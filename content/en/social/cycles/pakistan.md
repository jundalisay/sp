The main problem of Pakistan is obviously its separation from India after the British left.

India philosopher PR Sarkar explains that at that time, India was pushing for independence alone, not really thinking of the socio-economics, culture, and politics that would happen afterwards.

The ideal model for South Asia is Mahabharata, an idea from Krishna that united South Asia from Afghanistan (Kandahar, Bamiyan) in the West to Bangladesh in the East.

We shall call it Hindustan.

Buddhism flourished in Afghanistan in the past until it was uprooted by Islam


## Hindustan is not Arab

Hindustan is a mix of Aryan and South Asian DNA. Yet Afghanistan and Pakistan follow the Arab religion of Islam. 

The big problem is that Islam and Judaism were created specifically for the Israeli and Arab people who are genetically closer to the Anunnaki whom they called gods.

This is why Judaism and Islam fit well with Israeli and Arab genetics, but have some friction and disconnect with other genetics such as Aryan, South Indian, African, and Malay.

This is why the non Arab muslims modified their Islam into Shia. 

Spreading Islam to non-Arabs will cause more loss than benefit, as not all cultures prefer submission and slavery. 

It is most at odds with the democratic cultures of the Greeks and French. This is why Charlie Hebdo happened.

The solution for peace in South Asia is to undo the British mistake and unite the South Asian countries into an Indian or  South Asian Union:
- India
- Afghaistan 
- Pakistan
- Sri Lanka
- Bangladesh
- Nepal
- Bhutan


## How This Could Be Done

The best opportunity is to use natural disasters from global warming as a tool to push for cooperation and then integration.

This is exposed by:
- the floods in Pakistan and Afghanistan
- glacial floods in Nepal and Bhutan
- the cyclones in Bangladesh

India could use those events as opportunities to initiate cooperation over an [80-year period](/social/cycles/afghanistan), after which it could formalize a South Asian Union by the 60th year.

<!-- In Socrtes' Social Cycles model, the tyrant beats the populist, the philosopher beats the tyrant, the merchant beats the philosopher. 

This is why the Pakistani military was able to kick out their populist Prime Minister Imran Khan in 2022. The protests of Khan's supporters have been ineffective in preventing his imprisonment. 

So the Pakistan situation is a fight between tyrant-merchant and populist-philosopher. 

In the US, the fight is between populist Trump and 

Despite this, his partymates win most of the seats in the 2024 elections, though without a majority. But this goes against the model -- Khan's partymates (populist) should have naturally lost to its rival PML (tyrant). Why did they win?

In reality, PML's candidate is Nawaz Sharif, a businessman. -->
