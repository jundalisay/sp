The Quran writes about the Aad people who went against Allah. 

Since Allah is the Enki faction of the Anunnaki, then the Aad people were the good guys. 

Their king Shahad refused to submit to the Anunnaki, as did Gilgamesh (Namrud), and Firon (Pharaoh).

- Gilgamesh sided with humans
- Pharaoh sided with Enlil

The Quran writes the location of the Aad people as near the lofty pillars which means Gibraltar. 

Gibraltar is the entrance to the Mediterranean and so the Aad people could have grown wealthy through maritime trade. This is because the ancients already knew how to build large ships, as arks, to transport freight across the Atlantic. 

The humans after the flood stil rebelled against the Anunnaki who tried to destroy them. And so it was a hard sell to convince them to come back to worshipping the Anunnaki.
