There are 3  mmain combinations: 

1. Worker + Warrior Versus Thinker + Trader

This is the most common and natural combination. This is seen in:
- The Roman Empire versus the Roman Republic
- In modern times, this it Communist versus Capitalist and 


2. Worker + Trader Versus Warrior + Thinker

Liberal versus Conservative

2. Worker + Thinker Versus  Warrior + Trader

This is not so common. 

Currently, this is seen in Pakistn. 


### Other Variations

It may be possible to have 3 versus 1. For examnple, Venezuela has Worker, Warrior, and Thinker going against Traders.  But these would be easy to spot and would not need a comple model.
