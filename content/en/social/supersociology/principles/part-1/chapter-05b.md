Social cyles divide the society into 4 belligerent factions:

1. Worker
2. Warrior
3. Thinker
4. Trader


These are effects of the 2 Forces of Nature which then consolidate back into 2 for most efficiency. 

When the negative force dominates, civil war occurs.

There are 3 main combinations: 

## 1. Worker + Warrior Versus Thinker + Trader

This is the most common and natural combination. This is seen in:
- The Roman Empire versus the Roman Republic
- In modern times, this it Communist versus Capitalist


## 2. Worker + Trader Versus Warrior + Thinker

This is seen as Liberal versus Conservative. 

In ancient times, this happened as Marius (Warriors) versus Sulla (Traders).


## 2. Worker + Thinker Versus  Warrior + Trader

This is not so common. 

Currently, this is seen in Pakistan where the worker class (as the masses) allies with the thinker class (as the Taliban). 


### Other Variations

It may be possible to have 3 versus 1. For example, Venezuela has Worker, Warrior, and Thinker going against Traders.  But these would be easy to spot and would not need a complete model.
