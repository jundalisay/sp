Moral Consequentialism in the Justice System

Humans also debate on land which is put under the dialectics of the judge, getting data as evidence and finding the patterns in jurisprudence as the rulings on similar cases that came before. The current law represents the current genearl feelings. The past rulings represent the flow of specific feelings that are within the general feeling. The feelings are easy, but the data on the actual perceptions or evidence is difficult. Many crimes go unsolved from the lack of evidence and some non-crimes are created from planted evidence. 
Actual actions that lead to evidence are just a manifestation of the feelings of the criminal when the crime was perpetrated. Reason is the ability of the mind to project the proposed criminal action onto the present mind as to get generate a future-feeling or virtual-feeling from it. The this feeling is then compared to the current feeling. The ego then decides which feeling is better, more pleasurable or less painful. 

For example, a hungry man experiences the pain of hunger and sees a bread displayed in a bakery in the open. If he did not have reasoning ability, then he will simply grab it like an animal and run away with it. But if he had a reasoning ability, then he would first project in his mind himself stealing it and running away (to a different location or space), getting caught and being put to jail (in a future time) with even less possibility of food and an added displeasure of being confined in a cramped jail cell. He then compares this awful feeling to his current feeling of hunger and even the pleasure of eating the stolen bread. He decides that the possibility of jail gives a worse feeling and is feels better.
