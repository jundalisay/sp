The previous section explained Supply and Demand Efficiency and Inefficiency. 
- Efficiencies are called surpluses in Economics
- Inefficiencies are called losses, like deadweight loss

We can create their Supereconomic equivalents, using our effort theory of value, so that they can be applied to families, organizations, etc (ours is a socio-economic system, with more features than an economic system such as Capitalism and Communism):

Name |

**Producer’s surplus** — a state where the producer gets more gain. Examples are families where parents neglect their children, or a company where the employer gets way more benefit than the employees | {{< img src="/photos/social/vice.jpg" alt="Parents being negligent" cap="" >}}
**Deadweight loss** — a state where the society labours harder than usual for less gain. For example, when a natural disaster cuts the family’s water supply so that they have to go the river to fetch it manually | {{< img src="/photos/social/african.jpg" alt="Mother getting water" cap="" >}}
**Consumer’s surplus** — a state where the consumer gets more bargain or advantage. Examples are families where parents are overworked or a company where the employees are lazy and feed off a hardworking boss | {{< img src="/photos/social/wife.jpg" alt="Children being unruly" cap="" >}}
**Manageable balance** — a state where both get equitable share | {{< img src="/photos/social/family.jpg" alt="Happy family" cap="" >}}
**Material progress** — a state where society labours less for more gain. An example is a family buying a computer to get more work done or get more entertainment | {{< img src="/photos/social/laptop.jpg" alt="Family with a computer" cap="" >}}


## A Family Scenario (May 2020)

A single father (supplier) with two children (demanders) normally supplies his family with 3 meals a day by using public transport.

- A Covid crisis hits and his country goes on lockdown (new regulation) and imposes limits on purchases (ceiling), reducing the meals to 2 per day, leading to hungry kids (deadweight loss)
- After a month, the lockdown is eased and the father is able to buy a vehicle (material progress) to be able to bring more food with less effort, which then leads to spoiled kids. 
- Poor families have limited space as tiny houses (environmental limits) preventing the accumulation of food, which reduces the probability of having spoiled kids.

Superphysics uses its own [Effort theory of value](/social/economics/principles/part-2/chapter-01b/) instead of Marginal pricing theory of Economics Through this tool, the policymakers of a society, whether a father of a house, or a prime minister of a country, can choose the right policy from their arsenal in order to create a desired outcome. Do they increase limits to prevent externalities? Or do they subsidize technology and reduce limits to create progress and growth?


## Singularized Demand and Supply, with Deadweight loss and Material gain

The previous curves showed demand and supply arriving at a balance or 'the tao' by trial and error. The Tao represents the highest quantity of goods at the lowest prices, while being within the environmental limits:

![Unified Supply and Demand Curve](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/demsup/uni1.png)


In the future, this tedious process can be solved by machine learning which will coordinate supply to meet demand in real time. This will "singularize" both curves into one:

![Unified Curve](https://sorasystem.sirv.com/charts/demsup/uni2.png)

Deadweight loss and material gain will still manifest in such a curve. This is because, even though there is no more conflict between producer and consumer in a unified human species, **there would still be a gap between the ideal (represented by absolute demand) and the actual reality**.

In this example, assume that all humans agreed to be put under a single Earth government. Prosperity was optimized and secured at 5 output at 3 effort, or a total of 15 effort*. 


{{< f f="*In our effort-theory of value, there would be no more need to objectify effort into currency nor precious metals." >}}


If the government decided to mobilize human labour to colonize Proxima Centauri B by a tax that would force humans to add 2 more output at 1 effort, then it would create a new gross effort at 28, with a new imposition of 13 effort.

<!-- ### The Same Curves Applied to the ‘Team-society’

In a future post, we shall apply objective data from two societies — the Golden State Warriors and the Houston Rockets — onto our model to determine which society has a better manageable balance, distribution, and division of labour to maximize their productivity and value, measured in points per game instead of currency.

In theory, the society that has a better balance will produce more consistent value, over one that has either too much producer’s surplus (Capitalistic, monopolistic, elitist or right wing, or reliant on a star player) or too much consumer’s surplus (Socialistic, welfare state, democratic or left wing, or reliant on lesser-skilled players). This then would help support the idea of the Progressive Social Republic, which I derived from Plato and Hume, so that in effect, we use Smith’s economic models to support Hume’s political model.

Most likely, the humans in this situation would instead develop new technology to save their toil, manifesting as the dotted line. So that for the same 7 output, the new gross effort would be 21.

After Proxima Centauri B is colonized, the new curve will slowly settle to its natural rate, possibly at 14 effort.
