### **History of Fascism**

Fascism is a far-right, authoritarian political ideology that emerged in the early 20th century, characterized by dictatorial power, extreme nationalism, suppression of dissent, and often militarism. Its origins can be traced to the post-World War I era, particularly in Italy.

1. **Origins (1919–1922):**  
   - **Italy:** Benito Mussolini founded the Fascist Party in 1919, capitalizing on economic instability, social unrest, and nationalist resentment after World War I. By 1922, Mussolini seized power in the **March on Rome**, establishing the first fascist regime.
   
2. **Expansion (1920s–1930s):**  
   - **Germany:** Adolf Hitler adapted fascist principles into **Nazism**, which emphasized racial purity alongside authoritarian control. After becoming Chancellor in 1933, Hitler transformed Germany into a totalitarian state.
   - **Other Countries:** Variations of fascism appeared in Spain under Franco, Portugal under Salazar, and several Eastern European nations.

3. **World War II and Decline (1939–1945):**  
   - Fascist powers, notably Germany, Italy, and Japan, formed the Axis alliance, leading to World War II. The defeat of the Axis powers marked the collapse of most fascist regimes.

4. **Post-War Influence:**  
   - Although discredited after WWII, neo-fascist movements and far-right extremism have persisted in various forms globally, often rebranded under different nationalist ideologies.

### **Key Characteristics of Fascism:**
- **Authoritarian Leadership:** A single leader with absolute power (e.g., Mussolini, Hitler).
- **Nationalism:** Glorification of the nation-state, often tied to ethnic or cultural superiority.
- **Militarism:** Emphasis on military strength and expansion.
- **Suppression of Dissent:** Control of media, censorship, and use of state terror.
- **Anti-Democratic:** Rejection of democratic processes, political pluralism, and liberal values.
- **State Control:** Economic control through corporatism (collaboration between state and major industries).
