In the Book, the Origin of Species, Darwin sees natural behavior and interprets it as the survival of the fittest.



A Westerner who looks at wild animals will see competition and struggle for existence.

An Asian will see symbiosis and harmony. 

Darwin saw phenomena from Nature and imposed Western mentality on it to create a policy of competition to the death, racism, and survival of the fittest.

This was then used by Hitler as the Iron Law of Nature to kill inferior races.
