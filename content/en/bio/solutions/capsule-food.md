The main mechanism for life is living energy called prana which is then ingested as food.

It is prana that makes food as food. 

The degree of prana manifests as the foods edible-ness:
- fresh food has a lot of prana
- rotten food has negative prana

It is this negative prana that gives disease and even kills. 

Nevertheless, even negative prana is still prana. This is why some animals such as vultures and hyenas have a high tolerance for negative prana in rotting meat.

Even some medicines such as venom and strong antibiotics have negative prana to kill the bad bacteria or cancel the negativity of toxins.


### Capsule Food as Pranic Storehouses

Since energy can be squeezed into batteries and even into chemical compounds as explosives, then it follows that prana can be squeezed in too.

In homeopathy, this is done by shaking an organic active element in water.
