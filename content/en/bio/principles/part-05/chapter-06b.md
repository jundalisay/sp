Among the ideas from astrology is that the path of starlight falling on Earth creates mental and social effects. 

We were able to test this idea during the Covid pandemic through the pattern of outbreaks in various countries.

This led to us to test another effect which is war or conflict. 

The start of the Ukraine war in Q1 2022 and Gaza and Sudan wars in 2023 pointed to a pattern between 25-38 degrees longitude.

- Donbass is at 48N 38E
- Gaza is at 31N 34E
- Khartoum is at 15N 32E

This forms a southwest to northeast line from Western Sudan to the area east of Moscow.

We call this line the "war line" from the "War Star". 

We then extended this backwards in time to the major wars of the past. We find that the war star makes a round trip every 900 years or so. 


Year | War | Location

2023 | Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan | 32-38 East
1992 | Bosnia | Serbia 
1940 | WW2 | Germany
1914 | WW1 | France
1898 | Spanish | Spain

The path of the War Star is most obviously seen in the [Coup Belt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_Belt) in Africa that includes:
- Burkina Faso @ 1 West 
- Mali @ 4 West
- Niger @ 8 East
- Chad @ 18 East
- Sudan @ 30 East


## Why the War Star Doesn't Make a Consistent Path of War

Starlight provides the spark for specific feelings as it constantly bombards the chakras of humans.

In order to light up a body of grass, that grass has to be soaked in gasoline or be dried to be easily combustible. 

This soakness or dampness is what Kepler calls wetness. 
- The spark is called aspects. 


{{< q a="Kepler" c="The Firmer Fundaments of Astrology" >}}
This entire year 1601 had a lot of humidity yet the lack of aspects.
- The slightest aspects happened which created a lot of rains and cold. 

On the contrary, 1599 was not humid.
- When aspects happened, only small clouds appeared instead of vapour.
- This led to a drought.

So for a country to have a war, the hearts and minds of its people (via animal spirits or chi) should have a lot of negativity. 

The shining of the War Star will then trigger a war more easily had there been no negativity. 

Likewise, a nation might have negativity from its natural social cycles, unaffected by starlight. 

It would then easily go to war during its warrior cycle especially if its neighbors also go into a negative warrior cycle at the same time. This happened during the 1967 and 1973 wars between Israel and the Arab countries even without the War Star.
