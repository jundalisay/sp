Everything in the physical domain is made up of some or all of the 5 Layers which we call aether, space, radiance, conversion, and matter.

In ancient Biology, this was called aether, air, fire, water, and earth.  

To differentiate it from non-living beings, and to stay consistent with ancient medicine, we will call those layers as **elements**.* 

{{< n n="If we had used 'elements' for Material Superphysics, people might confuse them with the elements in the periodic table, which is a key concept in Chemistry. The use of elements in Biology, Botany, Zoology is less common that in Chemistry. Usually, the words 'chemicals' or 'minerals' are used instead of 'elements'. And so we chose to use traditional name of Elements here." >}}


In Spiritual Superphysics, we call the layers or elements as strata:

Material | Bio | Spiritual
--- | --- | ---
Layer | Element | Strata
