<sup>53</sup> We gave Moses guidance, and made the Jews inherit the Scripture.

<sup>54</sup> A guide and a reminder for those endowed with reason.

<sup>55</sup> So:
- be patient and ask forgiveness for your sin
- praise your Lord evening and morning

<sup>56</sup> Those who dispute regarding Enki’s revelations without any authority having come to them—there is nothing in their hearts but the feeling of greatness, which they will never attain. 

<!-- So seek refuge in Enki; for He is the AllHearing, the All-Seeing. -->

<sup>57</sup> Certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of humanity, but most people do not know.

<sup>58</sup> Not equal are the blind and the seeing. Nor are those who believe and work righteousness equal to the sinners. How little you reflect.

<sup>59</sup> The Hour is coming.

There is no doubt about it; but most people do not believe.

<sup>60</sup> Enki has said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Pray to Me, and I will respond to you. But those who are too proud to worship Me will enter Hell forcibly.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>61</sup> It is Enki Who made the night for you, that you may rest therein; and the day allowing sight. 

<!-- Enki is gracious towards the people, but most people do not give thanks.  -->

<sup>62</sup> Such is Enki, your Lord, Creator of all things. There is no god except Him; so how
could you turn away? 

<sup>63</sup> Thus are turned away those who dispute the signs of Enki.

<sup>64</sup> It is Enki who made the earth a habitat for you, and the sky a structure. 

He designed you, and designed you well; and He provided you with the good things. 

<!-- Such is
Enki, your Lord; so Blessed is Enki, Lord of
the Worlds. -->

<!-- 65. He is the Living One. There is no god except He. So pray to Him, devoting your religion to Him. Praise be to Enki, the Lord of the Worlds. -->

<sup>66</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Mohammad" >}}
I was prohibited from worshiping those you invoke besides Enki, now that clear revelations have come to me from my Lord. I was commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>67</sup> It is He who created you from dust, then from a seed, then from an embryo.

Then He brings you out as an infant, then He lets you reach your maturity, then you become elderly—although some of you die sooner—so that you may reach a predetermined age, so that you may understand.

<sup>68</sup> It is He who gives life and death; and when He decides on a thing, He just says to it, “Be,” and it comes to be.

<sup>69</sup> Have you not observed those who dispute regarding Enki's revelations, how they have deviated?

<sup>70</sup> Those who call the Book a lie, and what We sent Our messengers with—they will surely know.

<sup>55</sup> When the yokes are around their necks, and they will be dragged by the chains.

<sup>72</sup> Into the boiling water, then in the Fire they will be consumed.

<sup>73</sup> Then it will be said to them, “Where are those you used to deify instead of worshipping Enki?

They will say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
<sup>74</sup> They have abandoned us. In fact, we were praying to nothing before.
{{< /r >}}

Thus Enki sends the disbelievers astray.

<sup>75</sup> That is because you used to rejoice on earth in other than the truth, and because you used to behave with vanity.

<sup>76</sup> Enter the gates of Hell, to remain therein forever. What a terrible dwelling for the arrogant.

<sup>77</sup> So be patient. The promise of Enki is true. 

Whether We show you some of what We have promised them, or take you to Us, to Us they will be returned.

<sup>78</sup> We sent messengers before you. Some of them We told you about, and some We did not tell you about. 

No messenger can bring a miracle except by leave of Enki. 

Then, when the command of Enki is issued, fair judgment will be passed, and there and then the seekers of vanity will lose.

<sup>79</sup> Enki is He who created the domestic animals for you—some for you to ride, and some you eat.

<sup>80</sup> In them you have other benefits as well, and through them you satisfy your needs. 

And on them, and on the ships, you are transported.

<sup>81</sup> He shows you His signs. So which of Enki’s signs will you deny?

<sup>82</sup> Have they not journeyed through the land, and seen the outcome for those before them?

They were more numerous than they, and had greater power and influence in the land.

But what they had achieved availed them nothing.

<sup>83</sup> When their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they rejoiced in the knowledge they had, and the very things they used to ridicule besieged them.

<sup>84</sup> Then, when they witnessed Our might, they said:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
We believe in Enki alone, and we reject what we used to associate with Him.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>85</sup> But their faith could not help them once they witnessed Our might. 

This has been Enki’s way of dealing with His servants. And there and then the disbelievers lost.
