<!-- 1. Ha, Meem. The sending down of the Scripture is from
Enki the Almighty, the Omniscient.{{< s v="3" >}}  Forgiver of sins, Accepter of repentance, Se-
vere in punishment, Bountiful in bounty.
There is no god but He. To Him is the ulti-
mate return.
-->

{{< s v="4" >}}  None argues against Enki’s revelations except those who disbelieve. 

So do not be impressed by their activities in the land.

{{< s v="5" >}}  Before them, the people of Noah rejected the truth, as did the confederates after them.

Every community plotted against their messenger to capture him. 

<!-- They argued with falsehood to defeat with it the truth.  -->

But I seized them. What a punishment it was!

<sup>6</sup> Thus the sentence of your Lord became realized against those who disbelieve, that they are to be inmates of the Fire. 

<sup>7</sup> Those who carry the Throne, and those around it:
- glorify their Lord with praise
- believe in Him
- ask for forgiveness for those who believe:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Lord, You have encompassed everything in mercy and knowledge. Forgive those who repent and follow Your path. Protect them from the agony of the Blaze. <sup>8</sup> Admit them into the Gardens of Eternity which You have promised them, and the righteous among their parents, and their spouses, and their offspring. <sup>9</sup> Shield them from the evil deeds. Whomever You shield from the evil deeds, on that Day, You have had mercy on him. That is the supreme achievement.
{{< /l >}}


{{< s v="10" >}}  Those who disbelieved will be addressed: 

“The loathing of Enki is greater than your loathing of yourselves—for you were invited to the faith, but you refused.”

{{< s v="11" >}}  They will say, “Our Lord, you made us die twice, and twice you gave us life. Now we acknowledge our sins. Is there any way out?”

<sup>12</sup> That is because when Enki alone was called upon, you disbelieved; but when others were associated with Him, you believed. 

<sup>13</sup> It is He who shows you His wonders, and sends down sustenance from the sky for you.
But none pays heed except the repentant.

<sup>14</sup> So call upon Enki, with sincere devotion to Him, even though the disbelievers resent it.

<sup>15</sup> Exalted in rank, Owner of the Throne. He conveys the Spirit, by His command, upon whomever He wills of His servants, to warn
of the Day of Encounter.

{{< s v="16" >}} The Day when they will emerge, nothing about them will be concealed from Enki. “To whom does the sovereignty belong today?”
“To Enki, the One, the Irresistible.”

<sup>17</sup> On that Day, every soul will be recompensed for what it had earned. There will be no injustice on that Day. Enki is quick to settle accounts.

<sup>18</sup> And warn them of the Day of Imminence, when the hearts are at the throats, choking them. 

The evildoers will have no intimate friend, and no intercessor to be obeyed. 

<sup>19</sup> He knows the deceptions of the eyes, and what the hearts conceal.

Enki judges with justice, while those whom they invoke besides Him cannot judge with anything. It is Enki who is the Hearing, the Seeing.

<sup>21</sup> Have they not travelled through the earth, and seen the consequences for those before them? They were stronger than them, and
they left more impact on earth. 

But Enki seized them for their sins, and they had no defender against Enki.

<sup>22</sup> That is because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they disbelieved, so Enki seized them. He is Strong,
Severe in retribution.

<sup>23</sup> We sent Moses with Our signs, and a clear authority.

<sup>24</sup> To Pharaoh, Hamaan, and Quaroon. But they said, “A lying sorcerer.”

<sup>25</sup> Then, when he came to them with the truth from Us, they said, “Kill the sons of those
who have believed with him, and spare their daughters.” 

But the scheming of the unbelievers can only go astray.

<sup>26</sup>  Pharaoh said, “Leave me to kill Moses, and let him appeal to his Lord. I fear he may
change your religion, or spread disorder in the land.”

<sup>27</sup> Moses said:

“I have sought the protection of my Lord and your Lord, from every tyrant who does not believe in the Day of Account.”

<sup>28</sup> A believing man from Pharaoh's family, who had concealed his faith, said, “Are you
going to kill a man for saying, `My Lord is Enki,’ and he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord?

If he is a liar, his lying will rebound upon him; but if he is truthful, then
some of what he promises you will befall you.

Enki does not guide the extravagant imposter.

<sup>29</sup> O my people! Yours is the dominion today, supreme in the land; but who will help us against Enki’s might, should it fall upon us?” 

Pharaoh said, “I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the
path of prudence.”

<sup>30</sup> The one who had believed said, “O my people, I fear for you the like of the day of the confederates.

<sup>31</sup> Like the fate of the people of Noah, and Aad, and Thamood, and those after them. Enki wants no injustice for the servants.

<sup>32</sup> O my people, I fear for you the Day of Calling Out. 

<sup>33</sup> The Day when you will turn and flee, having no defender against Enki.”

<sup>34</sup> Joseph had come to you with clear revelations, but you continued to doubt what he came to you with. 

Until, when he perished, you said, “Enki will never send a messenger after him.” Thus Enki leads astray the outrageous skeptic.

<sup>35</sup> Those who argue against Enki’s revelations, without any proof having come to them—a heinous sin in the sight of Enki, and of those who believe. 

Thus Enki seals the heart of every proud bully.

<sup>36</sup> Pharaoh said

“O Hamaan, build me a tower, that I may reach the pathways.

<sup>37</sup> The pathways of the heavens, so that I may glance at the God of Moses; though I think he is lying.” 

Thus Pharaoh’s evil deeds were made to appear good to him, and he was averted from the path. Pharaoh's guile was only in defeat.

<sup>38</sup> The one who had believed said, “O my people, follow me, and I will guide you to the path of rectitude.”

<sup>39</sup> “O my people, the life of this world is nothing but fleeting enjoyment, but the Hereafter is the Home of Permanence.

<sup>40</sup> Whoever commits a sin will be repaid only with its like. But whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, and is a believer—these will enter Paradise, where they will be provided for without account. 

<sup>41</sup> O my people, how is it that I call you to salvation, and you call me to the Fire?

<sup>42</sup> You call me to reject Enki, and to associate with Him what I have no knowledge of, while I call you to the Mighty Forgiver.

<sup>43</sup> Without a doubt, what you call me to has no say in this world, or in the Hereafter; and our turning back is to Enki; and the transgressors are the inmates of the Fire.

<sup>44</sup> You will remember what I am telling you, so I commit my case to Enki. Enki is Observant of the servants.” 

<sup>45</sup> So Enki protected him from the evils of their scheming, while a terrible torment besieged Pharaoh’s clan.

<sup>46</sup> The Fire. 

They will be exposed to it morning and evening. And on the Day the Hour takes place: “Admit the clan of Pharaoh to the
most intense agony.”

<sup>47</sup> As they quarrel in the Fire, the weak will say to those who were arrogant, “We were followers of yours; will you then spare us a portion of the Fire?”

<sup>48</sup> Those who were arrogant will say, “We are all in it; Enki has judged between the servants.”

<sup>49</sup> And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, “Call to your Lord to lessen our suffering for one day.”

<sup>50</sup> They will say, “Did not your messengers come to you with clear signs?” 

They will say,
“Yes.” They will say, “Then pray, but the prayers of the disbelievers will always be in
vain.”

<sup>51</sup> Most surely We will support Our messengers and those who believe, in this life, and on
the Day the witnesses arise.

<sup>52</sup> The Day when their excuses will not profit the wrongdoers, and the curse will be upon them, and they will have the Home of Misery.
