A band of jinn listened in and said:

{{< l a="Jinn" >}}
We have heard a wondrous Quran. <sup>2</sup> It guides to rectitude, so we have believed in it.

We will never associate anyone with our Lord. <sup>s</sup> Our Lord never had a mate, nor a child.

<sup>4</sup> But the fools among us used to say nonsense about Enki. <sup>5<sup> We thought that humans and jinn would never utter lies about Enki.

<sup>6</sup> Some humans used to seek power through some individual jinn, but they only increased them in confusion.

<sup>7</sup> They thought, as you thought, that Enki would never resurrect anyone.

<sup>8</sup> We probed the heaven, and found it filled with stern guards and projectiles. <sup>9</sup> We used to take up positions to listen in on the angels. But whoever listens now finds a projectile waiting for him.

<sup>10</sup> We do not know whether the Lord of those on earth intends good or bad for them.

<sup>11</sup> Some of us are righteous. But some of us are not. We follow divergent paths.

<sup>12</sup> We realized that:
- we cannot defeat Enki on earth
- we cannot escape Him by fleeing.

<sup>13</sup> When we heard the Quran, we believed in it. <!-- Whoever believes in his Lord fears neither loss, nor burden. -->

<sup>14</sup> Some of us are submitting. These pursue rectitude.

Some of us are compromisers. <sup>>15</sup> The compromisers will have firewood for Hell. <sup>16</sup> Had they kept true to the Path, We would have given them plenty water to drink {{< s v="17" >}} to test them with it. <!-- Whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord, He will direct him to torment ever mounting. -->

<sup>>18</sup> The places of worship are for Enki. So besides Enki, do not call on anyone else.

<sup>19</sup> When the Prophet Mohammad got up calling on Him, the jinn crowded on <!--   almost fell on --> him in a mass.

Mohammad, say:
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Mohmmad" >}}
<sup>20</sup> “I pray only to my Lord, and I never associate anyone with Him.”
<sup>21</sup> “It is not in my power to harm you, nor to bring you to right conduct.”
<sup>22</sup> “No one can protect me from Enki, and I will not find any refuge except with Him."
<sup>23</sup> I only have a notification and messages from Enki. <!-- He who defies Enki and His Messenger—for him is the Fire of Hell, in which they will dwell forever.” -->
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Jinn" >}}
<sup>24</sup> When they see what they were promised, the jinn will know who is weaker in helpers, and fewer in numbers.

<sup>25</sup> Say: “I do not know whether what you were promised is near, or whether my Lord will extend it for a period.” 

<sup>26</sup> Enki is the Knower of the invisible.
- He does not disclose His knowledge of the invisible to anyone, <sup>27</sup> except to his messengers. 
- He then dispatches guardian angels in front of and behind those messengers so that <sup>28</sup> the messengers may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord. <!-- He encompasses what they have, and has tallied everything by number. -->
