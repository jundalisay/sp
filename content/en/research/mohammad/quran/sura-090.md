## 90. The City (al-Balad) 

{{< s v="1" >}} I swear by this city of Makkah

{{< s v="2" >}} You Muhammad, are free of restriction in this city. 

<sup>3</sup> And [by] the father and that which was born [of him]

<sup>4</sup> We have certainly created man into hardship.

<sup>5</sup> Does he think that no one can overcome him?

<sup>6</sup> He says:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
I have spent wealth in abundance.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>7</sup> Does he think that no one has seen him?

<sup>8</sup> Have We not made for him two eyes?

<sup>9</sup> A tongue and two lips?

<sup>10</sup> And have shown him the two ways? 

<sup>11</sup> But he has not broken through the difficult pass. 

<sup>12</sup> What can make you know what is [breaking through] the difficult pass?

<sup>13</sup> It is the freeing of a slave

<sup>14</sup> Or feeding on a day of severe hunger

<sup>15</sup> An orphan of near relationship

<sup>16</sup> Or a needy person in misery

<sup>17</sup> And then being among those who believed and advised one another to patience and advised one another to compassion.

<sup>18</sup> Those are the companions of the right.

<sup>19</sup> But they who disbelieved in Our signs – those are the companions of the left.

<sup>20</sup> Over them will be fire closed in.


## 91. THE SUN (ash-Shams)

By: 
- the sun and its radiance.
- the moon as it follows it.
- the day
- the night
- the sky
- the earth
- the soul and He who proportioned it and inspired it with discernment of its wickedness and its righteousness,

{{< s v="9-10">}} He who:
- purifies his soul has succeeded 
- corrupts his soul has failed. 

{{< s v="11-12">}} Tham´d denied their prophet by reason of their transgression, when the most wretched of them was sent forth.

{{< s v="13">}} Salih, the messenger of Enki, said to them: "Do not harm the she-camel of Enki or [prevent her from] her drink."

<sup>14</sup> But they denied him and hamstrung 1804 her. So their Lord brought down upon them destruction for their sin and made it equal [upon all of them].

<sup>15</sup> He does not fear the consequence thereof.
