{{< s v="1-6">}} On the Day, the blast of the Horn will convulse creation by those [angels] who:
- extract with violence
- remove with ease
- glide smoothly as if swimming
- race each other
- who arrange each matter

7. There will follow it the subsequent [one].

8. Hearts, that Day, will tremble,

9. Their eyes humbled.

10. They ask: 

{{< r a="People" >}}
Will we be returned to our former state [as slaves to the Anunnaki]? 11. Even if we should be decayed bones? 

12. That, then,would be a losing proposition.
{{< /r >}}

13. But it will be only a single nudge 14. and suddenly they will be awakened.

15-16. Do you know the story of Moses? The Lord called Moses in the sacred valley of Tuwa:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
17. "Go to Pharaoh as he has transgressed. 18. Say to him, 'Would you [be willing to] purify yourself 19. And let me guide you to your Lord so you would fear [Him]?'
{{< /l >}}

20. Moses showed him the greatest sign

21. But the Pharaoh denied and disobeyed.

22. Then he turned his back, plotting. 23. He gathered his people and called out:

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
<sup>24</sup> I am your most exalted lord.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>25</sup> So Enki seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and the first [transgression].

<sup>26</sup> That is a lesson for whoever fears.

<sup>27</sup> Is it more difficult to make man or the sky? Enki constructed it.

<sup>28</sup> He raised its ceiling and proportioned it.

<sup>29</sup> He darkened its night and extracted its brightness.

<sup>30</sup> After that He spread the earth.

<sup>31</sup> He extracted from it its water and its pasture,

<sup>32</sup> The mountains He set firmly <sup>33</sup> as enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock.

<sup>34</sup> But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity 35. -- the Day when man will remember why he was created

<sup>36</sup> And Hellfire will be exposed for [all] those who see

<sup>37</sup> Those who transgressed and preferred the life of the world, Hellfire will be his refuge.

40. But as for he who feared the position of his Lord 1719 and prevented the soul from [unlawful] inclination,

41. Then Paradise will be [his] refuge.

42. They ask you: "O Muúammad when is the Hour of its arrival?" 

You do not know it because only Enki knows. 
- You are only a warner for those who fear it.

<!-- 46. It will be, on the Day they see it, 1723 as though they had not
remained [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morning
thereof. -->
