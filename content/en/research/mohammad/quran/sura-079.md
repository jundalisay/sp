{{< s v="1-6">}} On the Day, the blast of the Horn will convulse creation by those [angels] who:
- extract with violence
- remove with ease
- glide smoothly as if swimming
- race each other
- who arrange each matter

<sup>7</sup> There will follow it the subsequent [one].

<sup>8</sup> Hearts, that Day, will tremble,

<sup>9</sup> Their eyes humbled.

<sup>10</sup> They ask: 

{{< r a="People" >}}
Will we be returned to our former state [as slaves to the Anunnaki]? 11. Even if we should be decayed bones? 

<sup>12</sup> That, then,would be a losing proposition.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>13</sup> But it will be only a single nudge 14. and suddenly they will be awakened.

<sup>15-16</sup> Do you know the story of Moses? The Lord called Moses in the sacred valley of Tuwa:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>17</sup> Go to Pharaoh as he has transgressed. 18. Say to him, 'Would you [be willing to] purify yourself 19. And let me guide you to your Lord so you would fear [Him]?'
{{< /l >}}

<sup>20</sup> Moses showed him the greatest sign

<sup>21</sup> But the Pharaoh denied and disobeyed.

<sup>22</sup> Then he turned his back, plotting. 23. He gathered his people and called out:

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
<sup>24</sup> I am your most exalted lord.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>25</sup> So Enki seized him in exemplary punishment for the last and the first [transgression].

<sup>26</sup> That is a lesson for whoever fears.

<sup>27</sup> Is it more difficult to make man or the sky? Enki constructed it.

<sup>28</sup> He raised its ceiling and proportioned it.

<sup>29</sup> He darkened its night and extracted its brightness.

<sup>30</sup> After that He spread the earth.

<sup>31</sup> He extracted from it its water and its pasture,

<sup>32</sup> The mountains He set firmly <sup>33</sup> as enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock.

<sup>34</sup> But when there comes the greatest Overwhelming Calamity 35. -- the Day when man will remember why he was created

<sup>36</sup> And Hellfire will be exposed for [all] those who see

<sup>37</sup> Those who transgressed and preferred the life of the world, Hellfire will be his refuge.

<sup>40</sup> But as for he who feared the position of his Lord and prevented the soul from [unlawful] inclination,

<sup>41</sup> Then Paradise will be [his] refuge.

<sup>42</sup> They ask you: 

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
O Muhammad when is the Hour of its arrival?
{{< /r >}}


You do not know it because only Enki knows. 
- You are only a warner for those who fear it.

<!-- 46. It will be, on the Day they see it, 1723 as though they had not
remained [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morning
thereof. -->
