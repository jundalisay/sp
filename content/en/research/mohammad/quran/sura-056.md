{{< s v="1-3" >}}  When the inevitable occurs, the low will be raised high. 

4-5. The earth will be shaken with a shock. The mountains are crushed and crumbled.

6. They become scattered dust. 

{{< s v="7" >}} And you become 3 classes.

8. Those on the Right—what of those on the Right?

9-10. And those on the Left—what of those on the Left? {{< s v="11" >}}  The forerunners are the nearest.

12. The Gardens of Bliss with luxurious furnishings throng with the ancients and a small band of the latecomers.

15. They recline on those furnishings, facing each other. 

The immortalized youth will serve them with:
- cups, pitchers, and sparkling drinks causing them neither headache nor intoxication
- 20. fruits of their choice
- 21. meat of birds that they may desire.
- 22. lovely companions 23 like treasured pearls.

24. These are reward for what they used to do.

25. Therein they will hear no nonsense, and no accusations 26. only the greeting: “Peace, peace.”

27. Those on the Right—what of those on the Right?

28. In lush orchards sweet-smelling plants 30 and extended shade.

31. And outpouring water.

32. And abundant fruit, uplifted mattresses.

35. We have created them of special creation and made them virgins that are tender and unaging for those on the Right, a throng from the ancients and a throng from the latecomers.

What of those on the Left?

45. They had lived before that in luxury in immense wrongdoing.

47. They used to say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
When we are dead, are we to be resurrected? And our ancient ancestors too?
{{< /r >}}

Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
The first and the last will be gathered for the appointment of a familiar Day
{{< /l >}}

Then the misguided will 52. be eating from the Tree of Bitterness.

56. That is their hospitality on the Day of Retribution.

57. We created you—if only you would believe!

58. Have you seen what you ejaculate?

59. Is it you who created it, or are We the Creator?

60. We have decreed death among you, and We will not be outstripped 61. in replacing you with your likes, and transforming you into what you do not know. 

62. You have known the first formation; if only you would remember.

63. Have you seen what you cultivate?

64. Is it you who make it grow, or are We the Grower?

65. If We will, We can turn it into rubble; then you will lament.

66. “We are penalized. No, we are being deprived.”

68. Have you seen the water you drink? 69. Is it you who sent it down from the clouds, or are We the Sender?

70. If we want we can make is salty. Will you not be thankful?

77. It is a noble Quran 78. In a well-protected Book.

79. Only the purified can grasp it, a revelation from the Lord of the Worlds.

81. Do you take this discourse so lightly and make it your livelihood to deny it?

83. So when it has reached the throat.

84. As you are looking on.

We are nearer to it than you are, but you do not see.

86. If you are not held to account.
