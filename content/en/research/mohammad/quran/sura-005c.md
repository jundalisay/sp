{{< s v="27-2" >}} Tell them the true story of Adam's two sons Cain and Abel.

Both made an offering. But only Abel's was accepted. Abel said:

{{< r a="Abel" >}}
I will kill you Cain, because Enki accepts only from the righteous.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Cain" >}} 
If you try to kill me, I will not try to kill you, for I fear Enki. I would rather you bear my sin and your sin, and you become among the inmates of the Fire.
{{< /l >}} 

{{< s v="30" >}} Then Cain's soul prompted him to kill his brother.

<!-- , so he killed him and became one of the losers. -->

Then Enki sent a raven digging the ground, to show him how to cover his brother's corpse. He said:

{{< l a="Cain" >}} 
Woe to me! I was unable to be like this raven and bury my brother's corpse.
{{< /l >}} 

So he became full of regrets.

{{< s v="32" >}} Because of that, We ordained for Jews that whoever kills a person unless it is for murder or corruption, it is as if he killed all of mankind. Whoever saves it, saves all of mankind. 

Our messengers came to them with clarifications. But even after that, many of them continue to commit excesses in the land.

{{< s v="33" >}}  The punishment for those who fight Enki and His Messenger, and strive to spread corruption on earth, is that they will be:
- killed
- crucified
- have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides, or
- be banished from the land.

That is to disgrace them in this life. In the Hereafter, they will have a terrible punishment {{< s v="34" >}} except for those who repent before you apprehend them.

<!-- {{< s v="35" >}} Be conscious of Enki, and seek the means of approach to Him, and strive in His cause, so that you may succeed. -->

{{< s v="36" >}} As for those who disbelieve, even if they owned everything on earth, and the like of it with it, and they offered it to ransom themselves from the torment of the Day of Resurrection, it will not be accepted from them. For them is a painful punishment.

{{< s v="37" >}} They will want to leave the Fire, but they will not leave it. For them is a lasting punishment.

{{< s v="38" >}} Cut the hands of the thief, whether male or female, as a penalty--a deterrent from Enki. 
- {{< s v="39" >}} But whoever repents and reforms after his crime, Enki will forgive. 

<!-- {{< s v="40" >}} Do you not know that to Enki belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He  -->

{{< s v="41" >}} O Messenger! Do not let those who are quick to disbelief grieve you, 
- They say they believe but their hearts do not believe

The Jews are listeners to lies<!-- , listeners to other people who did not come to you.  -->
- They distort words from their places.
- They say: “If you are given this, accept it. But if you are not given it, beware.” 

<!-- Whomever Enki has willed to divert, you have nothing for him from Enki.  -->

Enki does not intend to purify their hearts.
- They are a disgrace in this world.
- There is a great punishment for them in the Hereafter.


{{< s v="42" >}} Listeners to falsehoods, eaters of illicit earnings. 
- If they come to you, judge between them, or turn away from them. 

If you turn away from them, they will not harm you in the least. But if you judge, judge between
them equitably. Enki loves the equitable. 

{{< s v="43" >}} But why do they come to you for judgment, when they have the Torah, in which is Enki’s Law? 

Yet they turn away after that. These are not believers.


{{< s v="44" >}} We have revealed the Torah, wherein is guidance and light. The submissive prophets ruled the Jews according to it, so did the rabbis and the scholars, as they were required to protect Enki’s Book, and were witnesses to it.

So do not fear people, but fear Me. And do not sell My revelations for a cheap price.
Those who do not rule according to what Enki revealed are the unbelievers.

{{< s v="45" >}} We wrote for them in it: a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and an equal wound for a wound; but whoever forgoes it in charity, it will serve as atonement for him.

Those who do not rule according to what Enki revealed are the evildoers.

{{< s v="46" >}} In their footsteps, We sent Jesus son of Mary, fulfilling the Torah.
- We gave him the Gospel, with its guidance and light, confirming the Torah that preceded him. 


{{< s v="47" >}} So let the people of the Gospel rule according to what Enki revealed in it. Those who do not rule according to what Enki revealedare the sinners.

{{< s v="48" >}}  We revealed to you the Book, with truth, confirming the Scripture that preceded it, and superseding it. 

So judge between them according to what Enki revealed. 
- Do not follow their desires if they differ from that truth. 

For each of you We have assigned a law and a method. 
- Had Enki willed, He could have made you a single nation.
- But He tests you through what He has given you. 
- So compete in righteousness. 

To Enki is your return, all of you. 
- Then He will inform you of what you had disputed.


{{< s v="49" >}} Judge between them according to what Enki revealed, and do not follow their desires. 

Beware of them, lest they lure you away from some of what Enki has revealed to you. 

But if they turn away, know that Enki intends to strike them with some of their sins. In fact, a great many people are corrupt. 

{{< s v="50" >}} Is it the laws of the time of ignorance that they desire? 

Who is better than Enki in judgment for people who are certain?


{{< s v="51" >}} Do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies.
- Some of them are allies of one another. 
- Whoever of you allies himself with them is one of them. 
- Enki does not guide the wrongdoing people.


{{< s v="52" >}} You will see those in whose hearts is sickness racing towards them. 

They say:

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
We fear the wheel of fate may turn against us.
{{< /r >}}


But perhaps Enki will bring about victory, or some event of His making; thereupon they will regret what they concealed within themselves.

{{< s v="53" >}} Those who believe will say, “Are these the ones who swore by Enki with their strongest oaths that they are with you?” 

Their works have failed, so they became losers. 

<!-- punishes whom He wills, and He forgives whom He wills. And Enki is Capable of everything. -->

Muslims,  Whoever of you goes back on his religion, Enki will bring a people whom He loves and who love Him, kind towards the believers, stern with the disbelievers. 

They strive in the way of Enki, and do not fear the blame of the critic. 
<!-- That is the grace of Enki; He bestows it upon whomever He wills.  -->
