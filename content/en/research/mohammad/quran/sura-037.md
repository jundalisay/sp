{{< s v="1" >}}  By the aligners aligning {{< s v="2" >}} and the drivers driving {{< s v="3" >}} and the reciters of the Reminder.

{{< s v="4" >}}  Your God is indeed One.

<!-- s v="5" Lord of the heavens and the earth, and everything between them; and Lord of the Easts. -->

{{< s v="6" >}} We have adorned the lower heaven with the beauty of the planets.

{{< s v="7" >}} And guarded it against every defiant devil.

They cannot eavesdrop on the Supernal Elite, for they get bombarded from every side.

{{< s v="9" >}}  Repelled—they will have a lingering torment.

{{< s v="10" >}}  Except for him who snatches a fragment—he gets pursued by a piercing projectile.

{{< s v="11" >}} Ask them:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Are they more difficult to create, or the others We created?
{{< /l >}}


 We created them from sticky clay.

{{< s v="12-13" >}} But you wonder, and they ridicule. When reminded, they pay no attention.

<sup>14</sup> When they see a sign, they ridicule.

They say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
This is nothing but plain magic.

<sup>16-17</sup> When we have died and become dust and bones, shall we be resurrected? And our ancestors as well?
{{< /r >}}


<sup>18</sup> Say:

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Yes. You will be totally subdued.
{{< /l >}}

<sup>19</sup> It will be a single nudge. They will be staring.

<sup>20</sup> They will say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Woe to us. This is the Day of Judgment.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>21-22</sup> This is the Day of Separation which you used to deny. Angels [agents], gather those who did wrong, and their mates, and what they used to worship other than Enki.

<sup>23</sup> Lead them to Hell.

<sup>24</sup> Stop and question them: <sup>25</sup> What is the matter with you? Why do you not help one another?
{{< /l >}}


On that Day, they will be submissive.

<sup>27</sup> They will come to one another, questioning one another.

They will say: 

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
<sup>28</sup> “You used to come at us from the right. <sup>29</sup> You yourselves were not believers.

<sup>30</sup> We had no authority over you. You yourselves were rebellious people. 

<sup>31</sup> The Word of our Lord has been realized against us. We are tasting it.

We seduced you. We were seducers.
{{< /r >}}

On that Day, they will share in the punishment. 

We deal with the sinners.

When it was said to them, “There is no god except Enki,” they grew arrogant.

They said:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
<sup>36</sup> Are we to abandon our gods for a mad poet?
{{< /r >}}

<sup>37</sup> In fact, he came with the truth, and he confirmed the messengers.

<sup>38</sup> Most assuredly, you will taste the painful punishment.

<sup>39</sup> You will be repaid only for what you used to do. <sup>40</sup> except for Enki’s sincere servants.

<sup>41</sup> For them is a known provision <sup>42</sup> of fruits and honor <sup>43</sup> in the Gardens of Bliss <sup>44</sup> on furnishings, facing one another.

<sup>45</sup> They will be offered a cup <sup>46</sup> of pure white drink, a delight to those who drink.

<sup>47</sup> Never polluted, and never intoxicating.

<sup>48</sup> With them will be bashful women with lovely eyes <sup>49</sup> as if they were closely guarded pearls.

<sup>50</sup> Then they will approach one another, questioning.

{{< l a="Disbeliever" >}}
<sup>51-52</sup> I used to have a friend who used to ask me: Are you of those who believe <sup>53</sup> that after we die and become dust and bones, we will be called to account?

<sup>54</sup> Can you have a look?
{{< /l >}}

He will look, and will see him in the pit of Hell.

{{< r a="Friend of Disbeliever" >}}
<sup>56</sup> By Enki, you almost ruined me. <sup>57</sup>Were it not for the grace of my Lord, I would have been among the arraigned.

<sup>58</sup> We will not die. Except for our first death, and we will not be punished.
{{< /r >}}


This is the supreme triumph.

<sup>61</sup> For the like of this let the workers work.

<sup>62</sup> Which is a better hospitality, this or the Tree of Bitterness?

<sup>63</sup> We made it an ordeal for the unjust.

<sup>64</sup> It is a tree that grows from the bottom of Hell.

<sup>65</sup> Its fruits are like the devils’ heads.

<sup>66</sup> They will eat from it, and fill their bellies with it.

<sup>67</sup> Then, on top of it, they will have a brew of boiling liquid.

<sup>68</sup> Then their return will be to the Blaze.

<sup>69</sup> They had found their parents astray <sup>70</sup>and rushed along in their footsteps.

<sup>71-72</sup> Most of the ancients before them went astray even though We sent messengers to warn them.

<sup>73-74</sup> So observe the end of those who were warned.

<!-- <sup>74</sup> Except for the sincere servants of Enki  -->

<sup>75</sup> Noah called out to Us, and We are the Best of responders.

<sup>76</sup> We:
- saved him and his family from the great calamity
- <sup>77</sup> made his descendants the survivors
- <sup>78</sup> left mention of him among those who succeeded

<!-- 79. Peace
80. We
81. He
be upon Noah among all people. -->

<sup>79-82</sup> We thus reward the righteous and drowned the others.

<!-- He was one of Our believing servants. -->
