[The Prophet Mohammad was trying to spread Islam to an influential member of the Quraysh]

Abdullah, the son of Umm Makt´m asked him: "How do you know that he would be purified? He thinks he does not need Islam. Do not blame yourself if he will not be purified."

The Prophet Mohammad frowned and turned away.

But to those who came to you striving for knowledge, you were inattentive. 

These verses are a reminder. 

12. So whoever wills may remember it. 1729

13. [It is recorded] in honored sheets,

14. Exalted and purified,

15. [Carried] by the hands of messenger-angels,

16. Noble and dutiful. 


17. Destroyed [i.e., cursed] is man how disbelieving is he.

<!-- 1725ÔAbdullŒh, the son of Umm Makt´m. -->

18. From what thing [i.e., substance] did Enki create him?

19. From a sperm-drop. 20. Then He eased the way for him 21. Then He causes his death and provides a grave for him.

22. Then when He wills, He will resurrect him.

23. But No! Man has not yet accomplished what Enki commanded him.

24. Then let mankind look at his food

25. How We poured down water in torrents,

26. Then We broke open the earth

27. And caused grain to grow

28. And grapes and herbage

29. And olive and palm trees

30. And gardens of dense shrubbery

31. And fruit and grass

32. As enjoyment for you and your grazing livestock.

33-36. But when there comes the Deafening Blast, 34. man will flee from his brother, mother and father, his consort and his children

37. For every man, on that Day, will be a matter adequate for him.

38. [Some] faces, that Day, will be bright

39. Laughing, rejoicing at good news.

40. And [other] faces, that Day, will have upon them dust.

41. Blackness will cover them.

42. Those are the disbelievers, the wicked ones.
