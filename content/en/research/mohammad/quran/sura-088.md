{{< s v="2-5" >}} On that Day,
- faces will be shamed, laboring and exhausted, roasting in a scorching Fire, given  to drink from a flaming spring.

<sup>6-7</sup> They will have no food except thorns that neither nourishes, nor satisfies hunger.

<sup>8</sup> Faces on that Day will be joyful, satisfied with their endeavor.

{{< s v="9" >}}  In a lofty Garden, you will hear no nonsense.

<sup>12</sup> In it is a flowing spring, <sup>13</sup> there are raised beds, <sup>14</sup> cups set in place, <sup>15</sup> cushions are set in rows, <sup>16</sup> carpets spread around.

<sup>17</sup> Do they not look at:
- the camels—how they are created?
- <sup>18</sup> how the sky is raised? 
- <sup>19</sup> how the mountains are installed?
- <sup>20</sup> how the earth is spread out?

<sup>22</sup> You have no control over them.
