{{< s v="14" >}} We received the pledge of the Christians. 
- But they neglected some of what they were reminded of.
- So We provoked enmity and hatred among them until the Day of Resurrection; 

Enki will then inform them of what they used to craft.

{{< s v="15" >}} Christians, our Messenger has come to you:
- clarifying much of what you kept hidden of the Book, and
- overlooking much. 

A light from Enki has come to you, and a clear Book.

<!-- {{< s v="16" >}} Enki guides with it whoever follows His approval to the ways of peace.
- He brings them out of darkness into light, by His permission
- He guides them in a straight path. -->

{{< s v="16-17" >}} Muslims do not believe that Enki is the Christ, the son of Mary.

Enki can annihilate the Christ son of Mary, his mother, and everyone on earth.

<!-- To Enki belongs the sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. He creates whatever He wills, and Enki has power over everything. -->

{{< s v="18" >}} The Jews and the Christians say:

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
We are the children of Enki, and His beloved.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Why then does He punish you for your sins?
{{< /l >}}

In fact, you are humans from among those He created. 

<!-- He forgives whom He wills, and He punishes whom He wills. To Enki
belongs the dominion of the heavens and the
earth and what lies between them, and to
Him is the return. -->


{{< s v="19" >}} Christians, our Messenger has come to you, making things clear to you after a cessation of messengers. You cannot say, “No preacher, no warner, has come to us.” 

<!-- In fact, a preacher has come to you, and a warner --> <!-- and Enki is Capable of
everything. -->

{{< s v="20-21" >}} Moses said to his people:

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
Remember Enki’s blessings upon you when He:
- placed prophets among you,
- made you kings, and 
- gave you what He never gave any other people.

Enter the Holy Land which Enki has assigned for you. Do not turn back, lest you return as losers.

{{< r a="Jews" >}}
Moses, there are tyrannical people in it. We will not enter it until they leave.
{{< /r >}}


{{< s v="23" >}}  Two men of those who feared, but whom Enki had blessed, said, “Go at them by the gate; and when you have entered it, you will prevail. And put your trust in Enki, if you are believers.”

{{< s v="24-26" >}}  They said, “O Moses, we will not enter it, ever, as long as they are in it. So go ahead, you and your Lord, and fight. We are staying right here.”

{{< l a="Moses" >}}
My Lord! I have control only over myself and my brother. So please separate between us and between the wicked people.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Enki" >}}
It is forbidden for them for 40 years. They will wander aimlessly in the land. So do not grieve over the defiant people.”
{{< /r >}}
