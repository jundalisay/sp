{{< s v="1-2" >}} Ta, Seen. Those who observe the prayers, give charity regularly, and are certain of the Hereafter.

{{< s v="4" >}}  As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter: We made their deeds appear good to them, so they wander aimlessly.

{{< s v="5" >}}  They will receive the grievous punishment. In the Hereafter they will be the greatest losers.


6-7. Moses said to his family:

{{< r a="Moses" >}}
I saw a fire. I will bring you some news from it or bring you a firebrand, that you may warm yourselves.
{{< /r >}}

When he reached it, he was called:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Blessed is He who is within the fire, and He who is around it. Glorified be Enki, Lord of the Worlds.

9-10. O Moses Throw down your staff.” 
{{< /l >}}


But when he saw it quivering, as though it were a demon, he turned around not looking back.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
O Moses, do not fear. The messengers do not fear in My presence. 11. Only those who have done wrong fear Me.

12. Put your hand inside your pocket, and it will come out white, without blemish—among nine miracles to Pharaoh and his people, for they are immoral people.
{{< /l >}}


13. When Our enlightening signs came to them, they said:

{{< r a="Pharaoh" >}}
This is obvious witchcraft.
{{< /r >}}

14. They rejected them, although their souls were certain of them, out of wickedness and pride. So see how the outcome was for the mischief-makers.

15. We gave David and Solomon knowledge. They said:

{{< r a="David" >}}
Praise Enki, who has favored us over many of His believing servants.
{{< /r >}}

{{< s v="16" >}} Solomon succeeded David and said:

{{< l a="Solomon" >}}
O people, we were taught the language of birds, and we were given from everything. This is a real blessing.
{{< /l >}}


17. To the service of Solomon were mobilized his troops of sprites, and men, and birds—all held in strict order.

18. Until, when they came upon the Valley of Ants, an ant said:

{{< r a="Ant" >}}
O ants! Go into your nests, lest Solomon and his troops crush you without noticing.
{{< /r >}}

19. Solomon laughed and said:

{{< l a="Solomon" >}}
My Lord, make thankful for the blessings you have bestowed on me and on my parents. Make me do good works that please You. Admit me, by Your grace, into the company of Your virtuous servants.
{{< /l >}}


20. Then he inspected the birds, and said:

{{< l a="Solomon" >}}
Why do I not see the hoopoe? Or is he among the absentees? 21. I will punish him most severely, or slay him, unless he gives me a valid excuse.
{{< /l >}}

22. But he did not stay for long.

{{< r a="Bird" >}}
I have learnt something you did not know. I have come to you from Sheba, with reliable information.

23. I found a woman ruling over them, and she was given of everything, and she has a magnificent throne. 24. I found her and her people worshiping the sun, instead of Enki. 

Enlil made their conduct appear good to them, and diverted them from the path. 25-26. If only they would worship Enki.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Solomon" >}}
27. We will see, whether you have spoken the truth, or whether you are a liar. 28. Go with this letter of mine, and deliver it to them; then withdraw from them. See how they respond.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Bird" >}}
29. O Counselors, a gracious letter was delivered to me 30. from Solomon: ‘In the Name of Enki, the Gracious, the Merciful. 

31. Do not defy me, and come to me submissively. 32. O counselors, advise me in this matter. I never make a decision unless you are present.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
33. We are a people of might and great courage, but the decision is yours, so consider what you wish to command.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Bird" >}}
34. When kings enter a city, they devastate it, and subjugate its dignified people. Thus they always do. 35. I am sending them a gift, and will see what the envoys bring back.
{{< /r >}}

36. When the envoy came to Solomon, he said:

{{< r a="Envoy" >}}
Are you supplying me with money? What Enki has given me is better than what He has given you. It is you who delight in your gift. 37. Go back to them. We will come upon them with troops they cannot resist; and we will expel them from there, disgraced and humiliated.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Solomon" >}}
38. O notables, which one of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?
{{< /l >}}

39. An imp of the sprites said

{{< r a="Imp" >}}
I will bring it to you before you rise from your seat. I am strong and reliable enough to do it.
{{< /r >}}

40. He who had knowledge from the Book said:

{{< r a="Prophet" >}}
I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you.
{{< /r >}}

And when he saw it settled before him, he said:

{{< r a="Solomon" >}}
This is from the grace of my Lord, to test me, whether I am grateful or ungrateful. He who is grateful, his gratitude is to his own credit; but he who is ungrateful—my Lord is Independent and Generous.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Solomon" >}}
41. He said, “Disguise her throne for her, and we shall see whether she will be guided, or remains one of the misguided.”
{{< /r >}}

42. When she arrived, it was said:

{{< r a="Solomon" >}}
 “Is your throne like this?” 
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Solomon" >}}
As if this is it. We were given knowledge before her, and we were submissive.
{{< /r >}}


43. But she was prevented by what she worshiped besides Enki; she belonged to a disbelieving people.

44. It was said to her, 

{{< r a="Solomon" >}}
Go inside the palace. It is a palace paved with glass.
{{< /r >}}

When she saw it, she thought it was a deep pond, and she bared her legs. 

{{< r a="Solomon" >}}
My Lord, I have done wrong to myself, and I have submitted with Solomon, to Enki.
{{< /r >}}
