{{< s v="1" >}}  By the star as it goes down.

{{< s v="2" >}}  The Prophet Mohammad:
- has not strayed nor erred. 
- {{< s v="3" >}} nor does he speak out of his own inclination.

{{< s v="4" >}} He speaks from a revelation revealed, {{< s v="5" >}} taught to him by the extremely powerful Gabriel. 

Gabriel appeared in his true form to Mohammad while Mohammad's mind was in the higher part of the sky.
- Then Gabriel approached and descended and was at a distance of two bow-lengths or nearer, then revealed to Mohammad

Mohammad's heart did not lie about what it saw.
- He saw Gabriel at another instance at the Lotus Tree of the Utmost Boundary
  - Near it is the Garden of Refuge covered by the Lotus Tree 
- Mohammad's sight did not waver, nor did it exceed the limit of the Garden.
  - He certanly saw some of the Great Signs of his Lord.

Do you believe:
- in al-Lat, al-Uzza, Manat, the third one the other [Shiva, Shakti, Brahma?]
- that Enki is female [Shakti] and you are males [Shiva]?*

{{< n n="Here, the Anunnaki faction represented by Allah counter the natural system of spirituality to impose their own" >}}


{{< s v="22" >}} How absurd. 

These are nothing but names, which your ancestors devised. They:
- have no authority from Enki
- follow only assumptions, and what the ego desires
- have forgotten the guidance from their Lord.


{{< s v="24" >}} Do humans believe whatever he wants?

- {{< s v="27" >}} Those who do not believe in the Hereafter assign female names to the angels. But they are ignorant. 
- {{< s v="28" >}} Avoid those who have:
  - turned away from Our remembrance, and
  - desire only the present life. They only know the present life. 


{{< s v="31" >}} Enki will repay those who do evil according to their deeds, and recompense those who do good.


{{< s v="42-62" >}}
Enki:
- is the finality
- created the 2 kindsâ€”the male and the female from a sperm drop, when emitted.
- is the Lord of Sirius*
- destroyed:
  - the first people of Aad and Thamood, sparing no one.
  - the people of Noah before that for they were most unjust and most oppressive.

{{< n n="This shows that the Anunnaki faction who represent Allah are anti-Sirius and anti-Nature (probably siding with the domineering Regulus vibration)" >}}
