<sup>1-2</sup> The Compassionate Enki:
-  has taught the Quran.
- <sup>3</sup> created man <sup>4</sup> and taught him clear expression.

<sup>5</sup> The sun and the moon move according to plan.

<sup>6</sup> The stars and the trees prostrate themselves.

<sup>7</sup> Enki:
- raised the sky
- set up the balance.

<sup>8</sup> So do not transgress in the balance.

<sup>9</sup> But maintain the weights with justice, and do not violate the balance.

<sup>10</sup> Enki set up the earth for the creatures.

<sup>11</sup> In it are:
- fruits, and palms in clusters.
- <sup>12-13</sup> grains in the blades, and fragrant plants

<!-- <sup>13</sup> So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>14</sup> Enki created:
- man from hard clay, like bricks
- <sup>15-16</sup> the jinn from a fusion of fire

<!-- <sup>16</sup> So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>17-18</sup> Lord of the two Easts and Lord of the two Wests.

<!-- <sup>18</sup> So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>19</sup> He merged the 2 seas, converging together.

<sup>20-21</sup> Between them is a barrier, which they do not overrun.

<!-- <sup>21</sup> So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>22-23</sup> From them emerge pearls and coral.

<!-- <sup>23</sup> So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>24-25</sup> His are the ships, raised above the sea like landmarks.

<!-- <sup>25</sup> So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>26</sup> Everyone upon it is perishing.

<sup>27</sup> But will remain the Presence of your Lord, Full of Majesty and Splendor.

<!-- 28. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>29-30</sup> Everyone in the heavens and the earth asks Him. Every day He is managing.

<!-- 30. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>31-32</sup> We will attend to you, O prominent two.

<!-- 32. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>33</sup> O society of jinn and humans! 

If you can pass through the bounds of the heavens and the earth, go ahead and pass.

But you will not pass except with authorization.

<!-- 34. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>35-36</sup> You will be bombarded with flares of fire and brass, and you will not succeed.

<!-- 36. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>37-38</sup> When the sky splits apart, and becomes rose, like paint.

<!-- 38. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>39-40</sup> On that Day, no human and no jinn will be asked about his sins.

<!-- 40. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>41</sup> The guilty will be recognized by their marks. They will be taken by the forelocks and the feet.

<!-- 42. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>43</sup> This is Hell that the guilty denied.

<sup>44</sup> They circulate between it and between a seething bath.

<!-- 45. So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny? -->

<sup>46</sup> But for him who feared the standing of his Lord are 2 gardens <sup>48-49</sup> full of varieties <sup>50-51</sup> with:
- 2 flowing springs <sup>52-53</sup> with fruits of every kind, in pairs.
- <sup>54-55</sup> furnishings lined with brocade near the fruits of the 2 gardens
- <sup>56-58</sup> virgins looking only at their male partners, untouched before by any man or jinn, as though they were rubies and corals.

<sup>60-61</sup> The reward of goodness is goodness.

<sup>62-64</sup> Beneath them are 2 other gardens, deep green, with 2 gushing springs <sup>65-68</sup> with fruits, date-palms, and pomegranates.

<sup>70-76</sup> In them are good and beautiful virgins, fair ones secluded in the tents, untouched by human nor jinn. 
- They are reclined on green cushions and beautiful carpets.
