{{< s v="1-5" >}} The sun and the moon move according to plan, precise calculation.
- The stars and the trees submit to the laws of Enki.
- He raised the sky and set up the balance so that you will not transgress the balance and keep the weights with justice.
- He created
  - man from hard clay, like bricks.
  - the jinn from a fusion of fire.

<sup>1-2</sup> The Compassionate Enki:
-  has taught the Quran.
- <sup>3</sup> created man <sup>4</sup> and taught him clear expression.

<sup>5</sup> The sun and the moon move according to plan.

<sup>6</sup> The stars and the trees prostrate themselves.

<sup>7</sup> Enki:
- raised the sky
- set up the balance.

<sup>8</sup> So do not transgress in the balance.

<sup>9</sup> But maintain the weights with justice, and do not violate the balance.

<sup>10</sup> Enki set up the earth for the creatures.

<sup>11</sup> In it are:
- fruits, and palms in clusters.
- <sup>12</sup> grains in the blades, and fragrant plants

<sup>13</sup> So which of your Lord’s marvels will you deny?

- fruits of every kind, in pairs.
- furnishings lined with brocade near the fruits of the two gardens
- virgins looking only at their male partners, untouched before by any man or jinn, as though they were rubies and corals.

Beneath them are 2 other gardens, deep green, with 2 springs

pomegranates.
