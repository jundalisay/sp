<!-- 1. Glorifying Enki is everything in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty, the
Wise. -->{{< s v="2" >}}  To Enki belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. 

He:
- gives life and causes death
- has power over all things. 
- {{< s v="3" >}} is the First and the Last, and the Outer and the Inner
- has knowledge of all things.
- {{< s v="4" >}} created the heavens and the earth in 6 days, then settled over the Throne
- knows:
  - what penetrates into the earth
  - what comes out of it
  - what descends from the sky
  - what ascends to it

<!-- He is with you wherever you may be. Enki is Seeing of everything you do. -->

{{< s v="5" >}}  To Him belongs the kingship of the heavens and the earth, and to Enki all matters are referred.

<sup>6</sup> He merges the night into the day, and the day into the night. He knows what the hearts contains.

<!-- 7. Believe in Enki and His Messenger, and spend from what He made you inherit. Those
among you who believe and give will have a great reward. -->

<sup>8</sup> What is the matter with you that you do not believe in Enki, when the Messenger calls you to believe in your Lord, and He has received a pledge from you, if you are believers?

{{< s v="9" >}}  Enki sends down to His servant clear revelations, to bring you out of darkness into the light.

{{< s v="10" >}} Why don't you spend in the cause of Enki, when to Enki belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth? 

Not equal among you are those who contributed before the conquest, and fought.

Those are higher in rank than those who contributed afterwards, and fought. But Enki promises both a good reward. 

<!-- Enki is Well Experi-enced in what you do. -->

{{< s v="11" >}}  Who is he who will lend Enki a loan of goodness, that He may double it for him, and will have a generous reward? 

<sup>12</sup> On the Day when you see the believers—their light radiating ahead of them, and to their right: 

{{< l a="Enki Agents">}}
Good news for you today: gardens beneath which rivers flow, dwelling therein forever. That is the great triumph.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>13</sup> On the Day when the hypocritical men and hypocritical women will say to those who believed, 

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Wait for us; let us absorb some of your light.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki Agents">}}
Go back behind you, and seek light.
{{< /l >}}

A wall will be raised between them, in which is a door; within it is mercy, and outside it is agony.


<sup>14</sup> They will call to them:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
Were we not with you?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Muslims" >}}
Yes, but you cheated your souls, waited, doubted, and became deluded by wishful thinking until the command of Enki arrived. Arrogance deceived you regarding Enki.

<sup>15</sup> Therefore, today no ransom will be accepted from you, nor from those who disbelieved. The Fire is your refuge. It is your companion—what an evil fate!
{{< /l >}}



<sup>16</sup> It is time for those who believe to:
- surrender their hearts to:
  - the remembrance of Enki, and
  - the truth that has come down
- not be like those who were given the Book previously

But time became prolonged for them, so their hearts hardened, and many of them are sinners.

<sup>17</sup> Enki revives the earth after its death. We thus explain the revelations for you, so that you may understand.

<sup>18</sup> The charitable men and women, who have loaned Enki a loan of righteousness—it will be multiplied for them, and for them is a generous reward.

<sup>19</sup> Those who believe in Enki and His messengers—these are the sincere and the witnesses with their Lord.

They will have their reward and their light. But as for those who disbelieve and deny Our revelations—these are the inmates of the Blaze.

<sup>20</sup> Know that the worldly life is only play, and distraction, and glitter, and boasting among you, and rivalry in wealth and children. 

It is like a rainfall that produces plants, and delights the disbelievers. 

But then it withers, and you see it yellowing, and then it becomes debris. 

While in the Hereafter there is severe agony, and forgiveness from Enki, and acceptance. The life of this world is nothing but enjoyment of vanity.

<sup>21</sup> Race towards forgiveness from your Lord; and a Garden as vast as the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who believe in Enki and His messengers. 

<!-- That is the grace of Enki; He bestows it on whomever He wills. Enki is the Possessor of Immense Grace. -->

<sup>22</sup> No calamity occurs on earth, or in your souls, but it is in a Book, even before We make it happen. That is easy for Enki.

<sup>23</sup> That you may not sorrow over what eludes you, nor exult over what He has given you. Enki does not love the proud snob.

<sup>24</sup> Those who are stingy, and induce people to be stingy. Whoever turns away—Enki is the Independent, the Praiseworthy.

<sup>25</sup> We sent Our messengers with the clear proofs.

We sent down with them the Book and the Balance, that humanity may uphold justice. And We sent down iron, in which is violent force, and benefits for humanity. That Enki may know who supports Him and His messengers invisibly. 

<!-- Enki is Strong and Powerful. -->

<sup>26</sup> We sent Noah and Abraham, and established in their line Prophethood and the Scripture. Some of them are guided, but many of them are sinners. 

<sup>27</sup> Then We sent in their wake Our messengers, and followed up with Jesus son of Mary. We gave him the Gospel, and instilled in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and mercy.

But as for the monasticism which they invented—We did not ordain it for them—only to seek Enki’s approval.*

{{< n n="The Gnostic system establshed by Jesus was lost with the failure of Mary Magedelane in France" >}}

But they did not observe it with its due observance. So We gave those of them who believed their reward, but many of them are sinful.

<!-- 28. Muslims, Fear Enki, and believe in His Messenger: He will give you a double
portion of His mercy, and will give you a light
by which you walk, and will forgive you. Al-
lah is Forgiving and Merciful.
29. That the People of the Book may know that
they have no power whatsoever over Enki’s
grace, and that all grace is in Enki’s hand; He
gives it to whomever He wills. Enki is Possessor of Great Grace.
