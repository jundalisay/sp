## Abraham

<sup>83</sup> Abraham was of Noah's kind.

<sup>84-85</sup> He came to his Lord with a sound heart, and said to his father and his people:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
What are you worshiping? <sup>86</sup> Is it falsified gods, instead of Enki, that you want? <sup>87</sup> So what is your opinion about the Lord of the Worlds?”
{{< /l >}}


<sup>88-89</sup> Then he took a glance at the stars and said:

{{< r a="Abraham" >}}
I am sick.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>90</sup> But they turned their backs on him, and went away.

<sup>91</sup> Then he turned to their gods, and said:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
Will you not eat? <sup>92</sup> What is it with you, that you do not speak?
{{< /l >}}


<sup>93</sup> Then he turned on them, striking with his right hand.

<sup>94</sup> They came running towards him.

<sup>95</sup> He said:

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
Do you worship what you carve even if Enki created you and what you manufacture?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="People" >}}
<sup>97</sup> Build a pyre for him, and throw him into the furnace.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>98</sup> They wished him ill, but We made them the losers.

{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
<sup>99</sup> I am going towards my Lord, and He will guide me. <sup>100</sup> My Lord, give me one of the righteous.
{{< /l >}}


So We gave him good news of a clement boy.

<sup>102</sup> Then, when he was old enough to accompany him, he said:


{{< l a="Abraham" >}}
My son, I see in a dream that I am sacrificing you; see what you think.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Isaac" >}}
Father, do as you are commanded. I am one of the steadfast.
{{< /r >}}


<sup>103</sup> Then, when they had submitted, and he put his forehead down.

<sup>104</sup> We called out to him:

{{< l a="Anunnaki" >}}
<sup>105</sup> Abraham! You have fulfilled the vision.
{{< /l >}}

Thus We reward the doers of good.

<sup>106</sup> This was a test.

<sup>107</sup> We redeemed him with a great sacrifice.

<sup>108-111</sup> We left with him for later generations.

<!-- 109. Peace
110. Thus
be upon Abraham.
We reward the doers of good. -->


<!-- 111. He was one of Our believing servants. -->

<sup>112</sup> We gave him good news of Isaac, a prophet, one of the righteous.

<sup>113</sup> We blessed him, and Isaac. But among their descendants are some who are righteous, and some who are clearly unjust to themselves.

<sup>114-115</sup> We blessed Moses and Aaron, delivering them and their people from the terrible disaster.

{{< s v="116-122" >}} We:
- supported them, and so they were the victors
<!-- - <sup>117</sup>  -->
- gave them the Clarifying Scripture
<!-- - <sup>118</sup>  -->
- guided them upon the straight path
<!-- - <sup>119</sup> -->
- left with them for later generations

<!-- 115.
120. Peace
be upon Moses and Aaron.
121. Thus We reward the righteous. -->

<!-- 122. They were of Our believing servants. -->

## Elijah

<sup>123</sup> Elijah was also one of the messengers.

<sup>124</sup> He said to his people:

{{< l a="Elijah" >}}
<sup>125</sup> Do you not fear? Do you call on Baal, and forsake the Best of creators? <sup>126</sup> Enki is your Lord, and the Lord of your ancestors.
{{< /l >}}


<sup>127</sup> But they called him a liar, and thus they will be brought forward.

<!-- 128. Except
for Enki’s sincere servants. -->

We left with him for later generations.

<!-- 129.
130. Peace
131. Thus
132. He
be upon the House of Elijah. -->

<sup>131-132</sup> Thus, We reward the virtuous.

<!-- He was one of Our believing servants. -->

<sup>133</sup> Lot was one of the messengers.

<sup>134-135</sup> We saved him and his family, all of them except for an old woman who lagged behind.

<sup>136</sup> Then We annihilated the others.

<sup>137-138</sup> You pass by them in the morning and at night. Do you not understand?



## Jonah

<sup>139</sup> Jonah was one of the messengers.

<sup>140-141</sup> When he fled to the laden boat, he gambled and lost.

<sup>142</sup> Then the fish swallowed him, and he was to blame.

<sup>143-144</sup> Had he not been one of those who praised, he would have stayed in its belly until the Day they are raised.

<sup>145</sup> Then We threw him into the wilderness, and he got sick.

<sup>146</sup> We made a gourd tree grow over him.

<sup>147</sup> Then We sent him to a hundred thousand, or more.

<sup>148</sup> They believed, so We gave them enjoyment for a while.

<sup>149</sup> We ask them:

{{< r a="Anunnaki" >}}
Are the daughters for your Lord, while sons are for them [Nineveh]? <sup>150</sup> Or did We create the angels females, as they witnessed?
{{< /r >}}

<sup>151</sup> No! It is one of their lies. 

<sup>152</sup> When they say “Enki has begotten.” They are lying.

<sup>153</sup> So He preferred girls over boys?

What is the matter with you? How do you judge?

<sup>155</sup> Will you not reflect?

<sup>156</sup> Or do you have some clear proof?

<sup>157</sup> Then bring your book, if you are telling the truth.

<sup>158</sup> They invented a relationship between Him and the jinn. But the jinn know that they will be arraigned.

<!--  160. Except for Enki’s sincere servants 

159. Enki be glorified, far above what they allege. -->

<sup>161</sup> You and what you serve cannot seduce Enki's servants away from Him.

Except for he who will be roasting in Hell.

They used to say:

{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
None of us has an assigned position for we are the arrangers and the glorifiers.
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Disbelievers" >}}
<sup>167</sup> Had we received advice from the ancients <sup>169</sup> we would have been Enki's faithful servants.
{{< /r >}}

<sup>170</sup> But they rejected it, so they will find out.

Our Word has already gone out to our servant messengers.

<sup>172</sup> It is they who will be supported. <sup>173</sup> Our troops will be the victors.

So disregard them for a while <sup>175</sup> and watch them—they will soon see.

Are they seeking to hasten Our punishment?

<sup>177</sup> When it descends into their yard, miserable will be the morning of those forewarned.

<!-- 178. So avoid them for a while.

179. And watch—they will soon see. 
 -->
<!-- Exalted be your Lord, the Lord of Glory,
beyond their allegations. -->
<!-- 180.
181. And
peace be upon the messengers.
And praise be to Enki, the Lord of the
Worlds. -->
