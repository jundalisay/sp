{{< r a="Woman" >}}
Why did Putin invade Ukraine?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Interstellar Alliance" >}}
Putin is the most afraid and [emotionally] weakest person on Earth. 

He uses lies and force to hide the fact that his mind cannot get what it wants, as it is not empowered. 

Your military and police will be changed into rescue force.

They will be trained to learn how life works so they can save lives by themselves instead of slavishly following orders. 

Each military and police individual will have their own ethical center.

As an honorary member of the Interstellar Alliance, you should start programs to help people find their center and positive side.

Will aliens stop a global nuclear war?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Bashar" >}}
The Alliance will prevent a global nuclear war, but not small scale nuclear explosions.

This is because a global nuclear war will rip the interdimensional fabric.
