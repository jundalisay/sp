The Essassani are an alien species that come from a planet in a star near the Orion's belt. 

They are similar to humans in the sense that they have eyes, ears, arms, and legs just like us. 

However, they are much more advanced in intelligence and spirituality, to the point that they are psychic and can perform telepathy. 

They are able to talk to humans through the phenomenon called "channeling" (Giao tiếp với sinh vật ngoài hành tinh qua người truyền tin). 

This is how we are able to learn about their civilization and technologies. 

Since 1983, they have been communicating with an American named Darryl Anka from 1983. The internet and Youtube have allowed their communications to be known by more people.

Their goal is to help humans advance mentally and spiritually by explaining how the universe works. 

This is embodied in their philosophy of acting on your highest passion, which is very similar to The Law of Attraction. 

Their difference with the Law of Attraction is that their philosophy is done through a specific formula:


### Step 1. Act on your HIGHEST Excitement or Passion

In every moment, out of a series of choices, find out the one that you are most passionate or excited about.

In Hinduism, acting on your true passion means being in line with your dharma.


### Step 2. Do that act to the best of your ability. 

Once you find something to do, do it to the best that you can. 


### Step 3. While doing that action or activity, absolutely do not expect what the outcome should be

Whenever we do something, we often expect it to succeed. We get disappointed and sad when it fails to match our expectation. 

The Essassani instruct to NOT have expectation of the outcome. 

In Hinduism, this is called Karma Yoga, where we act but do not expect specific results.


### Step 4. Be Positive regardless of what happens

Whatever the results of your actions may be, stay in a positive state.


### Step 5. Observe your mind and its beliefs

After doing the action, you will get results. Observe how your mind reacts to those results. Then find out why it acted in a certain way. 

For example, let's say you did your best to apply for your dream job. You took the company's test and went for the interview. But you still did not get the job. 

If you become negative, then you might blame yourself and become discouraged, or you might sourgrape against the company that you applied to. 

But if you stay positive, then you might get an idea of which company to apply to, or you might get offered a different position in that company.

Being positive and unattached in Hinduism is known as "renouncing the fruits of one's actions or karma".
