Mathematics is expressed as geometry, not equations that use numbers. 

For example, humans have an equation that says you cannot observe a particle's position or momentum at the same time. 
- If you measure the position, then you don´t know how fast it´s moving because it´s frozen
- If you measure the momentum, then you can´t measure the position because it´s moving

We express that as a geometric tetrahedal form, four-sided pyramid of equilateral triangles. 

The base triangle represents the `x,y,z` of position
- Because it´s one triangle then you can measure the position.

The apex of the tetrahedron represents the time factor, the momentum factor.

Since it´s not connected to the base you can´t have the momentum at the same time that you measure the position. 

If you measure the momentum, your momentum is then measured by the apex and 2/3, two points of the side equilateral triangle, so you don´t have the entire position, but you do have the entire momentum. 

So it´s expressed as a tetrahedral structure, geometrically. 

<!-- The idea of whole number theories, again, is that  -->

We work with different levels of infinities in certain ways that humans express at this time. 

<!-- So we are not sure how to translate that idea into what you are asking, because  -->

A lot of your mathematics shy away from the idea of infinities. 

But for us, there are whole number infinities that are different from other whole number infinities.
