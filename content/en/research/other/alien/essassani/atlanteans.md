Atlantis was at 10,800 BC but spanned 50,000 years by then. 20,000-30,000 years agao was its prime. 

Atlantis was created by a migration from Lemuria.

Lemuria had remnants when Atlantis was at its height.  

Minoans are an Atlantean colony. 

Noah was Atlantean.

Aztec and Basque have Atlantean DNA.

Lemurians in South Pacific had blue skin as direct descendants of Anunnaki. 

They were more telepathic and natural.

It was a lush environment and so had few structures. Hawaii was the last remnant of the Mu civilization.

Mu was destroyed naturally by volcanic activity.
