{{< l a="Bashar" >}}
Chubacapras are a rare offshoot of canines that were hybridized by aliens long ago. These have gone extinct. 

Mothmen are interdinsional beings drawn to light that is experienced at the point of death. 

It is attracted to imminent death. So it is the harbringer or warner of death.
