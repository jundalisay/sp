Do Elementals have genetics?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Bashar" >}}
No. They are mostly made out of the collective consciousness. They can project themselves through electromagnethereic energy. 

While crystallized, they can take a non-physical DNA form. But it is not recommended to take their DNA.

Children are into faeries and elves. But as they get older they stop this belief. Why?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Bashar" >}}
They are taught to stop believing in elementals. Also, those elementals might not be important in their adult lives. 

But now elementals are more important because of the opening the senses and remembering who you are. 

You can connect to them without losing focus of your physical reality.
