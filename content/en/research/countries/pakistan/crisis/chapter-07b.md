### Bhutto's Islamic Socialism

The task of defining this new narrative fell to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto—the first civilian politician to rule Pakistan after nearly fifteen years of army rule. 

Having formed the Pakistan People's Party (PPP) only four years earlier,
Bhutto ascended to power on a populist platform embodied in the slogan
'roti [bread], kapra [cloth], makan [house]'. Like his predecessors Bhutto had
to wrestle with questions of Islam and ideology. Some contemporary
commentators pointed out that the separation of East Pakistan had resulted
in a more compact entity where Islam was presumably no longer needed to
bind the state. Unity could have derived from a robust democratic process
accommodating political and ethnic differences and looking toward
'geological, geographic, ethnic, and historic grounds for regarding the Indus
Valley and its western and northern mountain marches as a distinct national
unit separate from the rest of South Asia.' The Islamic parties, however,
vociferously attacked Bhutto and his socialist ideology as a threat to Islam.
Bhutto settled on the concept of 'Islamic socialism' as his defining manifesto
to stave off his critics on the religious right and to create a new national
narrative that promisingly leveraged core Islamic principles of justice, equity,
and poverty alleviation to tackle a developing nation's fundamental socio-
economic challenges.

Yet with the passage of time Bhutto's regime adopted a more
conservative bent—a posture fuelled by his insecurity vis-a-vis the
military and his authoritarian tendencies. Bhutto introduced a ban on
alcohol and gambling and made Friday a non-work day. In 1974, unwilling
to stand up to street protests by the Islamic parties against Ahmadis he
supported a constitutional amendment that declared Ahmadis non­
132Muslims. For the first time in the country's history, a minister for religious
affairs was appointed to the central cabinet. Eager to burnish his Islamic
credentials, in 1976, Bhutto invited the Imams of the Prophet's mosque in
Medina and the mosque at the Ka'ba—two of Islam's holiest sites—to
visit Pakistan.

Bhutto's Islamic orientation was also reflected in his foreign policy. In
1974, Bhutto hosted a major Organisation of Islamic Conference meeting in
Lahore, reorienting Pakistan away from South Asia and toward the Middle
East. Following India's allegedly 'peaceful nuclear explosion' in 1974, Bhutto
launched Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, rhetorically declaring, 'There's
a Hindu bomb, a Jewish bomb and a Christian bomb. There must be an
Islamic bomb.' In light of Pakistan's unsettled border with Afghanistan that
divided a restive ethnic Pashtun population between both countries, the
Bhutto government also began to support two Afghan Islamist militias to gain
leverage over Kabul on the border issue: Burhanuddin Rabbani's Jamiat-e-
Islami and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami. The decision was to have
far-reaching consequences. Both militias played a key role in the uprising
against the Soviets.

Ultimately, Bhutto's promise of Islamic socialism was compromised by
narrower political and foreign policy objectives as he failed to fully realise a
new and progressive national ideology. In the wake of rampant street
agitation led by the Islamic parties in conjunction with elements in the
military, General Zia-ul-Haq deposed him. It was Zia who would initiate
the wholesale process of converting Pakistan to an Islamic state.

### Islamisation of Pakistan

General Zia's decade in power was a setback for a faltering
democratic process and ushered in an era of religious obscurantism that
affected every facet of domestic life and foreign policy. In his very first
speech as Chief Martial Law Administrator after removing Bhutto from
power, Zia, who was sincerely devout, described himself as a 'soldier of
Islam' and spelled out his vision: 'Pakistan, which was created in the name
of Islam, will continue to survive only if it sticks to Islam. That is why I
consider the introduction of Islamic system as an essential prerequisite for
the country.' As such, in contrast to Ayub Khan and Yahya Khan, who saw
Islam as part of an ongoing and overarching nationalist project, Zia saw
133Islam as part of a revolutionary process to overhaul Pakistan.

The domestic impact was manifold. Beginning with the Army, Zia,
upon being appointed Army Chief by Bhutto, changed the slogan of the
Pakistan Army to 'Iman [faith], Taqwa [piety], and Jihad fi Sabil Allah
[jihad for the sake of God]'. Officer evaluation forms included a box of
comments on an officer's religious sincerity. Proselytising groups such as the
Tablighi Jamat linked to the Deobandi tradition enjoyed greater access to
military officers and civil servants. Like his military predecessors, Zia
cynically used the Islamic parties as a counter to his civilian political foes but
also extended them unprecedented political patronage, initially appointing a
number of Jamaat-e-Islami members to head key ministries. In the process,
Zia also politicised other Islamic parties that had largely remained apolitical
and empowered them. Along with separate electorates being introduced for
non-Muslims, registration criteria that excluded most secular parties were
introduced during elections.

Zia's Islamisation also encompassed Pakistan's judicial system. The
government constituted provincial Shariat benches at the High Court level
and an appellate Shariat Bench at the Supreme Court level tasked with
deciding if any parliamentary law was Islamic or not and whether the
government should change them. Particularly troubling was the introduction
of the Hudood Ordinance based on a distorted understanding of Quranic
injunctions and introducing punishments such as flogging, stoning and
amputation (albeit punishments that the state never applied). The ordinance's
most controversial application was and remains the imprisonment of female
rape victims on the grounds of adultery. 

An effort was also launched to
Islamise the education sector. In 1981, the University Grants Commission issued the following directive to prospective textbook authors:
.... to demonstrate that the basis of Pakistan is not to be founded in
racial, linguistic, or geographical factors, but rather in the shared
experience of a common religion. To get students to know and appreciate
the Ideology of Pakistan, and to popularize it with slogans. To guide
students towards the ultimate goal of Pakistan—the creation of a
completely Islamicized State.

The underlying motive behind these various genuine and cosmetic
'reforms' was a moral zeal that animated Zia. Islam was no longer just an
overarching ideology to harness to unify and to defend the state; it was the
134road to salvation. Decrying endemic corruption and economic ills in
Pakistan in a 1979 interview, Zia stated: 'In the last thirty years in general
but more so in the last seven years there has been a complete erosion of the
moral values of our society.... Islam from that point of view is the
fundamental factor.'

Under Zia a similar moral zeal characterised Pakistan's central
foreign policy preoccupation in the 1980s: the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. During Zia's rule, Pakistan became a staging ground for the
war against the Soviet Union, which was characterised as jihad. In this
effort, the Pakistani military leveraged the proxy Islamic groups it had
backed since the 1970s, providing them with arms and financing in
coordination with the US and Saudi Arabia, among other states.
Hekmatyar's Hizb-i-Islami, in particular, was a favourite of the Inter­
Services Intelligence (ISI), which spearheaded the covert operation in
Afghanistan.

Ultimately, Zia's goal in transforming a limited Islamist rebellion
into a full-scale jihad was to extend Pakistani influence into Afghanistan
in light of its historic territorial concerns, secure significant assistance by
helping the US bleed its Cold War adversary, and allegedly 'to make
Pakistan the source of a natural Islamic revolutionary movement, replacing
artificial alliances such as the Baghdad Pact.' 'This would be the means,'
continued one of Zia's confidants in describing his vision, 'of starting a
new era of greatness for the Muslim nations of Asia and Africa.'

In pursuing these strategic goals, the Zia regime with international
aid systematically cultivated a virulent strain of Islamist ideology in
Pakistan. The ISI made right-wing Islamic parties such as the Jamaat­e-
Islami and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam key partners in recruiting among the
millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan and students at religious schools
or madrasahs—lionising those who volunteered as mujahideen fighting in
the name of God. In the process, these parties developed extensive
networks throughout Pakistan and deepened their influence. 

Students
from impoverished backgrounds at the madrasahs were taught an
obscurantist understanding of Islam with no modern subjects, making
them easy prey for their handlers. Meanwhile, Saudi and United States
funding directly facilitated this indoctrination. From 1984 to 1994, for
example, the United States Agency for International Development gave a
135$51 million grant to the University of Nebraska Omaha to develop
textbooks filled with violent images and militant Islamic teachings as part
of a covert effort to inspire anti-Soviet resistance. Zia further opened
Pakistan's doors to volunteers from all over the world who participated in
the jihad in Afghanistan and who established offices, raised funds, and
issued statements on Pakistani soil. Pakistan became the epicentre of a
global jihad movement.

Alongside this jihadi culture, Pakistan under Zia witnessed an
unprecedented rise in sectarianism—once again triggered by both external
and internal factors—which has claimed tens of thousands of lives in
Pakistan. Externally, in the wake of the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran;
the Khomeini regime began exporting its revolutionary message across
the Muslim world. Neighbouring Pakistan became a battleground in a
'transplanted war' between Iran and Saudi Arabia that sought to limit Shi'a
influence—a struggle that violently played out among a hydra of sectarian
groups. On one side was the Iranian—backed Tehrik-i-Nifaz-i-Fiqh-i-
Jafria (Movement for the Implementation of Shiite Religious Law); on the
other were Sunni extremist groups such as the Sipah-e-Sahaba,
ideologically equipped with fatwas issued by Deobandi seminaries in
Pakistan and India declaring the Shi'a as apostates. Sipah-e-Sahaba's
political demand was that the state should declare the Shi'a—15-20 per
cent of Pakistan's population—non-Muslims through a constitutional
amendment, as done with the Ahmadis.

The cumulative effect of the Zia years in Pakistan was not just a
wholesale Islamisation of the Pakistani state to varying degrees but also the
explosion of a jihadi and sectarian culture in response to external forces
that were nurtured for political and ideological reasons. It was in the
throes of this period that Pakistan's drift into extremism began.
