There is growing consensus among central bankers that medium- to long-term price stability is the overriding goal of monetary policy. 

Research has shown that maintaining low and stable inflation has helped economies to grow, as businesses, households and individual consumers are able to make better investment, savings and wage contract decisions. If inflation gets out of control either due to an over heating of the economy or supply side factors, central banks have generally resorted to monetary tightening as a means to control inflation.

This has the knock on effect of reducing aggregate demand and feeding into slower growth.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)—an independent institution with full autonomy on monetary policy—has delicately balanced two opposing
objectives, an anti-inflation policy and a pro-growth policy. There has been
an impressive array of reforms in this regard, including the Fiscal
Responsibility Act and Debt Limitation Act of June 2003, yet the reform
agenda needs to be boosted further in the current macro­ economic
environment.

While inflation was not an issue in 2002-2008, the current challenges
are more testing. In order to achieve the 7% growth trajectory the SBP
needs to keep inflation low. 

The recent monetary tightening in response to
rising inflation has not been preferred strategy, not only because it is
politically unpopular but also because it results in increasing debt servicing
and could result in further weakness in the currency and another bout of
inflation. 

With Pakistan's high debt to GDP ratio as well as a growing fiscal
deficit, control of inflation becomes a pressing priority to induce confidence
in the business community and public at large about future price stability. The
SBP alone cannot control inflation without the presence of a coordinated
fiscal policy which requires support from the Ministry of Finance. The budget
announced in June 2010 was a step in the right direction as it signalled a more
responsible fiscal stance by the government. This would entail the
government sticking to an agenda where unnecessary current expenditures
are severely curtailed along with a clear policy for revenue enhancement.
Recent indicators suggest that inflation is on the rise. This has been
precipitated by the government's decision to increase electricity tariffs,
fuel prices, elimination of food subsidies and the imposition of a new
'Reformed General Sales Tax'. 

Further tariff increases and rises in taxation have been announced by the government, partly driven by the additional
239resources required for rehabilitation and relief for flood affectees. The SBP
is also pointing to aggregate demand picking up, led mainly by public
sector consumption, while prospects for aggregate supply remain weak
due to energy shortages and the poor law and order situation. These
developments together with the rising total debt reinforce the need to have
renewed efforts to keep inflation and the fiscal deficit under control.

What can be done? 

1. The government should announce a 'Medium Term Financial Strategy' (MTFS) for the next 5 years.

This will have a coordinated fiscal and monetary policy having a target band for inflation should form a cornerstone of the government's approach. 

Setting an inflation target or a band for inflation would certainly help to engender positive expectations across the economy and help to reinforce a 'mindset' that the government is serious about controlling inflation. Given that the vast majority of people are sensitive to rising prices, the very poor and low income groups, as well as business and industry, lose from higher input and capital costs in a rising inflation scenario.

Inflation-targeting is also an appealing choice as it has worked in both developing and advanced countries. It is not an end in itself, but a means to an end, which is achieving price stability that can be defined as low and stable inflation. The real point is to get inflation down to, in line with, or maybe even below its major trading partners and competitors.

If Pakistan can achieve this, then policy-makers will not need to depreciate its nominal
exchange rate and play catch-up with the adverse relative inflation
differential. Getting that adverse inflation differential down is therefore key.
The target range within such a context should be between 5 to 8 per cent over
the next five years.

2. This strategy should be supplemented by having a closely aligned industry and trade policy, and a clear policy on raising the level of productivity for capital and labour in key export sectors as well as those sectors where capacity constraints result in price increases of goods and services.

Examples of these sectors would include food, housing and energy which collectively account for over 60 per cent of the consumer price index. In particular, at a time when most nations globally are scrambling for food security, Pakistan's government would reap significant future dividends if it were to have a strong agricultural policy to encourage investments that enhance agricultural output and productivity. Increased attention to Research and Development would need to be an integral part of a productivity enhancement drive, particularly in agriculture and the SME sectors, which are export oriented. 

This is another way of improving competitiveness, which aims at cutting unit costs by raising productivity of capital and labour. To have a stable exchange rate raising productivity in the export sector is the only way to cut costs and increase export profitability. This would not only help to curb inflation but also allow an export surplus which would help in improving long term macroeconomic indicators.

3. The official consumer price index could be reconstituted to reduce the weight of food and energy which are dependent on exogenous
factors and a global pricing mechanism which is beyond the control of governments.

This would leave other items in the CPI basket such as wages,
rent, medical care, transportation, textile and apparel goods prices intact and
would be a more significant monitor of how successful the government is in
terms of achieving its inflation target.

4. To reinforce the stable price 'mindset', the government could enact an Act of Parliament which compels subsequent governments to adhere
to a consistent policy of bringing inflation within the target band. 

In the context of an Act of Parliament, caveats can be structured for unexpected
natural disasters such as the 2010 floods that produced a sharp increase in the
price of food and other necessities, which offset the benefits of an inflation
targeting policy.


### Conclusion

Despite turbulent economic and political headwinds over the last three
decades Pakistan's economy has not only avoided collapse but has recorded
an average growth rate of over 5 per cent per annum. Pakistan's medium and
longer-term future will be driven by key demographic and economic trends.
As the focus of much international attention, Pakistan has the opportunity to
push ahead on key structural reforms. Couple with a steady flow of loans,
assistance and investments, this has the potential to hedge any economic
downturn in the short to medium term. The list of things Pakistan needs to do
is not new. Yet they are difficult things to achieve and require a clearly
defined implementation framework and the full support of government
bureaucracy, industry, businesses and the public at large with priority given
to those measures that can create jobs to accommodate new people entering
the work force each year.

The full extent of damage emanating from the floods in Pakistan is not known at the time of writing this chapter, billions of dollars will be
required for rebuilding and reconstruction. Whilst the floods have caused
much misery and devastation the disaster can act as a catalyst to formulate a
clear economic vision. The need for better governance, for creating social
safety nets for the poor and for accelerating growth can become pressing
national issues. This, in turn, can force the government in power to become
more transparent and accountable to the public.

There are two scenarios that can emerge. The best-case scenario is one
where economics prevails over geo-political risks, and a collective will under
the leadership of a credible government is created to transform the economic
landscape of Pakistan. This can result in a change in perception about
Pakistan, trigger an investment cycle targeting growth in infrastructure
and propel Pakistan into the 7-8 per cent growth trajectory.

The second scenario is one where future growth is unstable and low.
Political and geo-political instability continues to weaken an already fragile
economy and investment rates remain low due to the poor internal security
situation. In this scenario, Pakistan's population, instead of being a natural
advantage, could turn into a crisis if young people are unable to find economic
opportunities and where unmatched expectations result in discontentment,
unemployment and growing disparities between the top and bottom end of the
social pyramid.

Pakistan's record in reform and policy implementation to achieve long-
term economic development has at best been marked by missed opportunities
and failures. The risks of failure are much greater today than at any time in
the past, but so too are the rewards of meaningful reform.
