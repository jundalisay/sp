Education lies at the heart of Pakistan's multiple challenges. 

If Pakistan is to emerge as a stable, moderate polity able to reap dividends from its burgeoning population it must be able to provide the young and future generations both personal safety and a decent livelihood. This requires relative peace, an environment conducive for economic growth, and a workforce that can power progress. Vital to such a turnaround is a well- educated population. 

Only through massive quantitative and qualitative gains in education can Pakistan produce the skill set required to drive the economy efficiently and produce a critical mass of well-informed and visionary leadership it so badly needs. Equally important, it is only through high quality, value-neutral education that Pakistan can challenge the salience of the Islamist discourse that threatens to radicalise society and drive youth energies towards destructive—often violent-channels.

This means that education should not only be a development priority
but also a strategic one. Pakistan's education performance is a tale of
unfulfilled expectations which has caused disaffection and alienation among vast
segments of society. The immediate future needs to be seen as a corrective phase
that requires holistic interventions in the education sector. The chapter begins
by outlining the conceptual underpinnings of the empirical analysis to follow.

This is followed by consideration of the Pakistani education sector's
performance and implications for society. In the final section concrete steps
are identified that can help bring about the required transformation.


### Education as an 'Expectation Builder'

Modern societies grasped the importance of a well-educated polity very early on. In recent decades however, investment in human capacity has become a top priority for international, multinational, and national efforts. Conventional wisdom suggested that education was critical for a society to produce a skilled labour force that could operate as productive members of the economy. Over time, education has increasingly been seen as a force multiplier capable of having a much broader impact—both positive and negative—on societies than merely producing a skilled work force.

High quality education can provide the means of social mobility and act as a source of contentment to people. It can contribute to peace, drive societal narratives and thus mould the very outlook of communities positively, as well as inculcate a civic sense among citizens. On the other hand, poor educational standards or agenda-driven education can contribute to a sense of alienation and deprivation, lead to internal discord and violence, and channelise societal energies in unproductive directions.

The discussion here draws on the 'expectations' literature. Education is
seen as an 'expectation builder'; it raises anticipations at three distinct stages. To
begin with, demand for education creates expectations among parents and
children that the state would be able to provide opportunities for acquiring
education. Once access to education is provided, consumers begin to expect
qualitative improvements. The third stage of expectations stems from the fact
that the schooling process itself has attached to it hopes of finding
commensurate employment.

The literature talks of 'unfulfilled expectations' as a major worry. A failure to fulfill expectations in terms of access to or quality of education could be a function of state incapacity, deliberate policies that exclude certain segments of society, or education content that is ill-suited to the requirements of modern economies and societies. Regardless, it implies that those who miss out are not fit to contribute to the economy optimally. Moreover they tend to feel aggrieved and may become alienated and marginalised from their communities. Alienation, deprivation, and marginalisation of youth are in turn linked to radicalisation and discord.

However, the failure of education does not have to be absolute to cause alienation. Particular segments of societies can be at a loss even if the rest of the society is progressing. In fact, the literature argues that feelings of alienation and marginalisation are often harboured when access to opportunities is unequal rather than absent. Discussing young males in particular, Collier (2000, p. 94) supports the relative deprivation hypothesis. Kaplan (1996) concurs with this view, arguing that discrimination against specific segments of society can cause the disadvantaged to resort to violence. Indeed, global studies on the linkage between education and violence point to a correlation between conflict outbreak and persistence and low educational attainment. Countries with the lowest rates of primary school enrolment show greater incidence of conflict. Secondary education is also believed to be inversely related to prevalence of internal conflict.

Educational content can also be used deliberately to pursue a particular agenda or create a sense of deprivation among students. Learning materials can emphasise a particular version of history or a worldview that may create an exclusionary and discriminatory mindset. Curricula, learning materials, and teaching methods that promote narrow- minded outlooks and intolerance are least suited to peaceful co-existence. Much too often, communities that have experienced extreme forms of conflicts have had divisive education systems. Rwanda, Nazi Germany, and South Asian countries like Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan are all cases in point.

The problem of perceived alienation or deprivation is compounded
in contexts already ridden by violence and extremism. Here, the
frustration caused by low educational attainment, agenda-driven content,
or a mismatch between education and economic opportunities provide a
perfect opportunity for militants to recruit cadres.

Grounding the argument in the 'education as an expectation builder' premise, the following discussion examines the Pakistani case in some detail. It argues that the Pakistani education sector has led to unfulfilled expectations at each of the three mentioned stages: there has been a failure to provide enough education, to provide good quality education, and to provide amicable livelihoods to the educated. Consequently, a vast proportion of the Pakistani population is ill prepared for a modern economy and is vulnerable to internal discord and violence.


### Recounting 'Expectation Failures' in Pakistani Education

Stage 1: Failure to Provide. 

Pakistan has made progress with regard to most education indicators over time. The total net primary enrolment rate has increased from 33 per cent in 1991 to 66 per cent in 2008. The ratio of female to male primary enrolment has increased from 52 per cent to 83 percent. Meanwhile, the total primary completion rate as a percentage of the relevant age group has risen from 50 percent to 60 per cent in the corresponding period. The total adult literacy rate has also increased from 26 per cent in 1981 to 54 per cent in 2008. Recent developments have yielded somewhat greater progress exemplified by the 266fact that youth literacy at 68.9 per cent is 15 per cent higher than adult literacy.

But progress remains poor both in absolute terms as and relative to
the rest of the South Asian region and other lower middle-income
developing countries. With the exception of Afghanistan, Pakistan has the
lowest education outcomes in the region. Half of Pakistan's population is
illiterate, the country has the second highest number of out of school
children in the world (9.5 million in 2005), it suffers from high drop-out
rates even at the primary level, and there is substantial gender disparity at
every education level. In fact, despite overall quantitative gains the gender
gap has widened between 1981 and 2008 from 20.6 to 26.8 per cent. Rural-
urban and interprovincial disparity also continues to persist.
Interprovincial disparity in youth literacy is just as high as in adult
literacy.

The Pakistani education system has failed to reach a large proportion of its eligible population. The problem is principally a supply side one. For one, the difficulty of accessing educational facilities keeps children away. A number of surveys register complaints
about having to travel long distances to reach schools, especially for girls in rural areas. Lack of basic facilities in schools such as electricity, drinking water and toilets are additional deterrents to school attendance. Out of 163,914 public schools (including 10,651 mosque schools), 10.5% operate without a building; 6.1 per cent are kacha schools; 61 per cent
lack electricity; 36.5% lack drinking water; 42.4 per cent lack latrines; 44.3 per cent lack boundary walls; 3.8 per cent are declared
dangerous while another 16.5 per cent are in need of major repair. Almost
10,000 schools are officially designated as non-functional. Vacant teacher
posts and absenteeism are also high across all provinces. Unaffordable costs,
lack of interest in education, and for females, cultural sensitivities are other
commonly cited reasons for children being out of school.

The present situation represents a failure on the part of the state to deliver on its fundamental duty to provide basic educational opportunities to its citizens. Those left out are people who will at best be suboptimal participants in the economy during their productive work life. 

Their sheer numbers represent a massive lost opportunity for Pakistan. Also, the current situation is bound to engender frustration and disaffection across the board. This is especially the case for a society like Pakistan's where demand for education is very high. In a Population Council (2002) survey whose findings have persistently been confirmed by subsequent research, 80 per cent of the young males and over 70 per cent of their female counterparts included in the survey expressed a desire to be educated at secondary and tertiary levels. The supply­ demand gap then is an obvious alienating factor. Internal tensions become even more likely when one considers that gender and geographical location within Pakistan are significant determinants of access to education.

A number of reasons can be adduced for this dismal state of affairs. The 2009 National Education Policy correctly identifies the two primary reasons as the 'commitment gap' and the 'implementation gap'. The commitment gap is reflected in the low resource allocation to the sector. In 2009-10, public expenditure on education was 2 per cent of GDP, the lowest in South Asia. This is representative of Pakistan's average educational spending; in the last fifteen years, average education expenditures have been a mere 2.1 per cent of GDP. Even within education, the bulk of the investment has been channelled to a few well-maintained higher education institutions implying that the benefits of the public subsidy of education are primarily availed by the higher income groups. The primary and secondary education tiers which are believed to be crucial to developing human capacity en mass have been neglected.

The implementation gap directly affects governance of the sector as well as the allocation and utilisation of resources. The lack of a planning culture and capacity and weaknesses in administrative capacity and accountability mechanisms result in only 20 to 30 per cent of the allocated funds being utilised effectively. Corruption, manifested in funds siphoned away for personal gain, influence in the allocation of resources, in the recruitment, training and posting of teachers, in selection of textbooks, and in 269the conduct of examinations and assessments are significant implementation challenges that decision-makers have struggled to address. 


### Stage II: Failure to deliver quality.

Pakistan's education sector is anomalous in that it has three parallel and largely unconnected systems of education operating simultaneously. These are the public and non elite private schools, the elite private schools, and the religious seminaries—the madrasahs. Approximately 67 per cent of the school going children are enrolled in public schools, close to 29 per cent are in private schools—the majority of these are in the non-elite variant—and 4% attend madrasahs (see table 2). The three systems follow their own curricula, teaching methods, and examination processes. Consequently, quality of education and the type of student body in each vary greatly. Only the public education system is fully regulated by the government.

The three education systems are broadly stratified along three dimensions: socio-economic, qualitative, and ideological. The madrasahs system largely caters to children from the poorest segment of society. The majority of public school and non-elite private school students belong to the lower-middle to middle socio-economic groups. Elite private schools apply stringent socio-economic screening and are reserved exclusively for the rich. So isolated are these systems that students go through their school life (and even adult life) without having the opportunity to engage intellectually across systems. The education sector therefore ends up producing three distinct cohorts from within the Pakistani youth, each quite cut-off from the other.

In terms of quality, madrasahs have the greatest mismatch with the requirements of modern economies. They are essentially geared towards producing cadres suitable only for the clerical sphere; this makes them misfits for mainstream employment opportunities. The public education and a large proportion of the non-elite private schools—together account for the overwhelming majority of Pakistani students—also suffer from extreme qualitative shortcomings. This is manifested in the learning outcomes, curricula, textbooks and other learning materials, assessments, teacher quality, and the learning environment. Although they teach all subjects expected of modern school systems, they follow fixed syllabi, which encourage rote learning—memorisation. The medium of instruction in public schools is predominantly Urdu; they even lack the capacity to develop a minimum level of proficiency in the English language, which is necessary for most white-collar jobs. The relatively small number of elite private schools are the only ones that provide decent quality education. They use English as the medium of learning and are ahead of the others in terms of teaching standards and learning outcomes. Most of them encourage objectivity and creative thinking among students. It is hardly surprising then that parents who send their children to private schools are found to be far more satisfied than those whose kids attend public schools or formal madrasahs.

The third layer of stratification is ideological. Though there is considerably greater overlap across systems in this case, in general one can attribute distinct and often irreconcilable world visions across the three systems. Pakistani madrasahs may not be actively engaged in producing militants as the West has suspected for long but they do produce graduates with narrow-minded ideological biases. In her research on madrasahs, Christine Fair (2006; 2007) argues that these cadres are much more likely to sympathise with Islamists where they are welcomed and given a positive identity. The syllabi of the public schooling system are closely managed by the state and provide a highly skewed historical narrative that is nationalistic and creates a siege mentality by portraying Pakistan as being perpetually under threat from all corners. The content also meshes Islam with nationalism and presents the two as being intrinsically linked. The roots of this anomaly lie in the 1980s when agenda-driven education was deliberately used as a political tool and textbooks were rewritten to 271inject a definitive anti-India and pan-Islamic bias. The elite private schools, while being bound by the state to follow the prescribed narrative in subjects such as Pakistan Studies, have more leeway given their unregulated nature. In addition, the economic stratum their students belong to allows them more physical and informational exposure to the Western style of life and leaves them less susceptible to accepting the curriculum biases at face value.

The divergent outlooks of these three cohorts are evident from who
they look up to and which direction they want their country to take.
Madrasah students tend to be amenable to the extremist world-view.
Students from the public schools, who are perhaps most representative of
mainstream society, idealise legendary Muslim historical figures but do
retain some admiration for figures known for their anti-West outlook.
Products of the private schools talk fondly of Hollywood stars,
personalities in the arts and theatre, international sportsmen and the like.
Overwhelming majorities of private school-educated youth seem to view
Turkey as a model for Pakistan to replicate. This is fundamentally different
than the preference of their less privileged counterparts who are more
likely to mention Iran or Saudi Arabia.

Frustration, alienation, internal discord and polarisation are built
into the education system. The isolation and divergent outlooks of the
three variants make for a divided polity. Indeed, the perceptions of the
country's youth validate this. Children of the elite are highly dismissive of
their Urdu medium counterparts and intolerant of young rural men,
especially those from lower socio-economic backgrounds. A sizable
segment from within the elite schools considers itself superior and more
progressive than the rest. Madrasah students on the other hand blame the
elite for having robbed them of necessary resources and causing hardship
for the rest of society. Their sense of alienation and deprivation is shared
by the public school, and to a lesser extent non­elite private school
students and provides an opening to Islamists to cash in on a 'haves versus
have nots' narrative. These disparate visions also make it virtually
impossible to forge a consensus on a national narrative in Pakistan.


### Stage 3: Failure to provide livelihoods. 

Educational attainment is a double-edged sword. While lack of education disqualifies youth from
attaining economic mobility and is thus undesirable, high level of
272education without the requisite outlet to apply skills raises expectations
which, if unfulfilled for long, can create an 'expectation-reality disconnect'.
Again, the latter makes the excluded disgruntled with the system, which not
only keeps potentially productive human capacity from engaging in
constructive endeavours but also acts as a violence inducing factor.

Surveys suggest that an overwhelming majority of young men and
women in Pakistan want to work provided suitable opportunities—
commensurate with their educational attainment—are made available.
Unfortunately, access to desirable employment in Pakistan is as unequal as
provision for high quality education. While Pakistan's labour market has
expanded, and the unemployment rate has declined to an impressive 5.32 per
cent, the improvement is unable to keep up with the large pool of employable
youth. In fact, youth employment has only dropped marginally since 1990
and even many who were employed at one time fell back into the unemployed
category. To be sure, the majority of non-elite young citizens can only find
relatively menial jobs and are thus underemployed. The public sector is
inherently corrupt and job openings are rarely awarded on merit. Children of
the poor, with generally little access to the corridors of power and already
disadvantaged by the poor skill set developed in public schools, are invariably
the first to be denied these prized positions.

The private sector has expanded tremendously in recent years and
presents many more lucrative opportunities. Ironically however, the
combination of the private sector's growth and a virtual breakdown of the
public sector act to increase the inequality in opportunities for graduates of
private versus public schools. Private sector firms solicit employees with
diverse exposures, a broad knowledge base, good English language skills, and
robust analytical ability. The only young adults that fit the bill are products
of elite private schools or foreign colleges (the latter are exclusively members
of elite households). In fact, so blatant is the bias against public, non-elite
private, and madrasah graduates that recruiters explicitly put a premium on
foreign and elite local degrees. A disproportionate amount of entry level
positions thus end up going to the already rich, leaving those from lower
socio-economic classes underemployed. For educated (even if poorly) young
men, underemployment ends up having just as much of an alienating effect
as unemployment.

There is evidence aplenty of the coming crisis. Increasingly, reasonably
eloquent, post-secondary degree holders are seeking financial help—that
is to say, begging—on the streets of urban towns in Pakistan. These are
273young men very different from the stereotypical beggars that dot the
streets of Pakistani cities and have been forced to the street by the labour
market crunch. Detailed discussions with such individuals reveal great
contempt for a state that cannot provide opportunities. There is also envy
and resentment against the elite who are believed to have deliberately
created entry barriers for the poor, and there is a sense of alienation
from the larger society.
