3. the practical requirements of "two maintenance"

Safeguarding the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Party Central Committee and
the core of the whole Party, safeguarding the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the
Party Central Committee, is not abstract but concrete, and must be implemented in reality and seen
in action.

To achieve the "two safeguards," we must persist in being loyal to the party. This is the basic
requirement of the Party Constitution for Party members. Loyalty to the party must be pure, and one
must not be "two-faced" or engage in "pseudo-loyalty"; it must be embodied in loyalty to the party's
beliefs, loyalty to the party organization, and loyalty to the party's theory, line, principles, and
policies. If "loyalty" doesn't pass, nothing else.
To achieve the "two safeguards," we must strictly abide by political discipline and political rules.
Political discipline is the most important discipline of the Party, political discipline is the most
fundamental rule of the Party, and abiding by political discipline and political rules is the basis for
observing all discipline of the Party. First, we must safeguard the authority of the Party Central
Committee, never allow deviations from the Party Central Committee's requirements to set up
another set of things, maintain a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee ideologically,
politically, and in action, and obey the command of the Party Central Committee.

Second, it is necessary to safeguard the unity of the party, persist in all parts of the world, unite all
comrades loyal to the party, unite the majority, draw lines with others, engage in any form of
factional activities, and still less allow the cultivation of private forces within the party; third, it is
necessary to follow organizational procedures, and it is absolutely not allowed to make unauthorized
claims and opinions on major issues and reports. Fourth, we must obey the organization's decisions,
never allow non-organizational activities, bargain with the organization, go against the
organization's decision, seek and rely on the organization when encountering problems, and must
not deceive the organization or confront the organization.
To achieve the "two safeguards," we must firmly establish a political awareness, an awareness of
the overall situation, a core awareness, and a sense of alignment. The most important thing is to
highly identify ideologically, resolutely safeguard politically, fully trust organizationally, and
closely follow the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in action. We must
achieve "two safeguards" and enhance the "four consciousnesses," and we must not shout empty
slogans, engage in formalism, and turn serious political discipline into "low-level red" and "high-
level black." The core consciousness is called "core", that is, the core of the Party Central Committee
and the whole party, and cannot be said to be "core" layer by layer; the "alignment" of aligning
consciousness means aligning with the Party Central Committee, General Secretary Xi Jinping, and
the party's basic theory, basic line, and basic strategy, and cannot shout "alignment" layer by layer.
