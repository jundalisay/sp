2. insist on doing everything for the people

The Communist Party of China is a Marxist party, the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the
vanguard of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, and has no special interests of its own other
than the interests of the people.

Adhering to doing everything for the people is the starting point and foothold of all the work of the
Communist Party of China, and it is also the intrinsic meaning and practical requirement of adhering
to the people-centered approach in the new era.
The Communist Party is a political party that emerged for the benefit of the people. The Communist
Manifesto clearly stipulates that Communists have no interests different from those of the proletariat
as a whole, and its ultimate goal is to realize that "the free development of everyone is the condition
for the free development of all"1 of communist society. The Communist Party of China is a faithful
practitioner of Marxism, and has consistently adhered to the needs of the people, the pursuit of the
people, and the happiness of the people in the period of revolution, construction, and reform, and
has always kept the people's warmth and warmth in mind and placed the people in the supreme
position.

Adhering to doing everything for the people is the consistent value pursuit of the Communist Party
of China. At the beginning of its founding, the Party defined its purpose as "serving the people"; at
the beginning of reform and opening up, the Party took resolving "the contradiction between the
people's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production" as the fundamental
task of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; in the process of reform and opening up, the
Party successively put forward that "comprehensive human development is the essential
requirement of socialism" and "Adhere to the people-oriented, comprehensive, coordinated and
sustainable development concept" in accordance with the changes in economic and social
development. New and significant progress has been made in safeguarding and developing the
interests of the people. The Party has always adhered to the people-centered approach in all periods,
and as a result, it has won the broad support of the masses of the people, and only then has a solid
mass and social foundation for the development of the cause of the Party and the country.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the face of the new
expectations and new requirements of the people yearning for a better life, the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has clearly put forward the people-centered
thinking, emphasizing that seeking happiness for the people is the original intention of the Chinese
Communists, and why the human problem is the touchstone for testing the nature of a political party
and a political power; and emphasizing the people-centered development concept to promote the
"five-in-one" in an integrated manner. The overall layout and coordinated promotion of the "four
comprehensive" strategic layout; emphasizing that all fields such as economic construction, political
construction, cultural construction, social construction, ecological civilization construction and
party building in the new era should reflect the requirements of people-centeredness. Since the 19th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China,

Proceeding from solving the main contradictions in our society, Comrade Xi Jinping proposed to
focus on solving the problem of unbalanced and insufficient development, vigorously improving the
quality of development, and better meeting the growing needs of the people in economic, political,
cultural, social and ecological aspects. This series of important expositions fully demonstrates our
party's fundamental political stand of being people-centered, and has become the fundamental
political guideline for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new
era.

3. Adhere to the party's mass line

The party's mass line means doing everything for the masses, relying on the masses in everything,
coming from the masses and going to the masses. The party's mass line is the systematic application
of the materialist view of history in all the party's activities of the principle that the masses of the
people are the creators of history, a scientific summary and induction of the party's historical
experience, an organic unity of Marxist values and methodology, and a full embodiment of the
fundamental political stand centered on the people.
From the perspective of values, all the work of the Communist Party of China is carried out with
the people at the center.

Everything for the masses" is the embodiment of the party's fundamental purpose. Upholding the
interests of the masses above all else is the highest political principle that every Communist Party
member must follow. The Marxist party firmly believes that the masses of the people can liberate
themselves, and the party must believe in the masses, mobilize the masses, and lead the masses to
struggle for the realization of lofty goals. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The people are the
source of our strength. We are deeply aware that everyone's strength is limited, but as long as we
are united in our will, there will be no difficulty that cannot be overcome."1 "Everything for the
masses" is the value goal of the party's work, and "relying on the masses in everything" is the means
to achieve the value goal.

From a methodological point of view, "coming from the masses and going to the masses" is the
party's fundamental leadership method and working method, emphasizing that the formulation of
the party's line, principles, and policies should fully understand the opinions of the masses and pool
the wisdom of the masses; in the process of implementing policy decisions, it is also necessary to
constantly listen to the opinions of the masses for revision and improvement, and the results of
policy decisions and implementation must stand the approval of the masses and the test of practice.

Historical experience proves that by adhering to the party's mass line, the party's cause and the
interests of the masses will prosper; if we deviate from the party's mass line, the party's cause and
the interests of the masses will be harmed. To realize the people's yearning for a better life in the
new era, the Party must adhere to the fundamental position of taking the people as the center and
prevent separation from the people at all times. To this end, it is necessary to administer the party
strictly in an all-round way, strengthen education in ideals and convictions, never forget the original
aspiration and keep in mind the mission, consciously accept the supervision of the people, educate
and guide the broad masses of party members and cadres to consciously practice the party's
fundamental purpose, deeply root the mass viewpoint and mass line in their thinking and concretely
implement them in action, focus on solving the problems of the masses' most realistic interests,
constantly enhance the people's trust and confidence in the party, and lay a solid class foundation
and mass foundation for the party's long-term ruling.
Section 2: The people's yearning for a better life is the
party's goal
The Communist Party of China comes from the people, and all its work must take the fundamental
interests of the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard, constantly meet the new
expectations of the people for a better life, and constantly solve the most direct and realistic interests
of the people. Striving to let the people live a better life is where the party's mission, value and life
lie.

1. The fundamental nature and purpose of the CCP according to Xi:

"Seeking happiness for the people is the original intention of the
Chinese communists. We must never forget this original intention, and always take the people's
yearning for a better life as the goal. "1 Adhering to everything for the people and leading the people
of the whole country to continuously create a better life vividly interprets the fundamental position
of the Chinese communists, the fundamental purpose of the party to serve the people wholeheartedly,
and the fundamental pursuit of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

Taking the people's yearning for a better life as the goal of struggle fundamentally answers the
question of "for whom?" The question of why people are a fundamental question and a question of
principle. If this problem is not solved well, one will not be qualified to be called a communist or a
Marxist. The Communist Party of China comes from the people, takes root in the people, and serves
the people; the Party has no special interests that are divorced from the masses, Party members do
not have a special position above the masses, and no Party member is allowed to break away from
the masses and be above the masses. The entire history of the Party's struggle is a history of serving
the people and relying on the people, a history of centering on the people, and a history of serving
the people wholeheartedly.

Taking the people's yearning for a better life as the goal of struggle, the core is to stand firmly on
the people's position. Representing the interests of the people, standing on the side of the people,
and serving the people wholeheartedly are the fundamental political positions of the Communist
Party of China. The question of position is not illusory, it is real. In capitalist society, capital is the
real master, capital logic is the leading logic of society, power is subject to capital, subject to capital,
and also serves capital, which determines that bourgeois political parties can only represent the
interests of capital. In socialist China, the people are the real masters, representing the interests of
the people is where the highest interests of the Communist Party of China lie, and always standing
on the side of the people is the lofty mission of the Communist Party of China. Chinese Communists
must consciously stand on the side of the overwhelming majority of the people, consciously stand
on the people's standpoint to think about problems, make decisions, do business, and be faithful
representatives of the people's interests. Without this, there is a fundamental departure from
Marxism; To betray this article is to fundamentally betray the cause of the communists.
The key to taking the people's yearning for a better life as the goal is to implement it in specific
actions to serve the people, which is reflected in promoting all aspects and links of economic and
social development. Comrade Xi Jinping adheres to the people-centered development thinking and
makes a series of important expositions on creating a better life for the people and ensuring and
improving people's livelihood. For example, on realizing the Chinese dream of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, it emphasizes that "the Chinese dream is, in the final analysis,
the dream of the people"; on building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way,
emphasizing that "a moderately prosperous society is not a well-off, the key is to look at the fellow
villagers"; "no one can be left behind on the road to a moderately prosperous life"; on
comprehensively deepening reform, emphasizing "closely relying on the people to promote reform"
and "the fruits of reform and development will benefit all the people more equitably"; on
comprehensively governing the country according to law, emphasizing "striving to let the people
feel fairness and justice in every judicial case"; Regarding the strict management of the party in an
all-round way, he stressed that "the key issue is to maintain the flesh-and-blood ties between the
party and the masses of the people";

Regarding targeted poverty alleviation and targeted poverty alleviation, he stressed that "we must
not leave behind a poor area or a poor mass.” All these are more realistic and targeted important
requirements for meeting the people's expectations for a better life, and have been translated into
effective practical steps and concrete actions of the Party and the people.
