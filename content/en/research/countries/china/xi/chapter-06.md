Chapter VI: Embark on a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way

Formulating strategic planning and determining strategic arrangements is the consistent leadership
method of the Communist Party of China, a basic experience of the Party in leading and promoting
socialist modernization, and a unique advantage of the party system with Chinese characteristics.
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "From building a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way to basically realizing modernization, and then to
building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way, it is a strategic arrangement
for the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era." 1 This "two-step"
strategic arrangement for the new era on the basis of building a moderately prosperous society in an
all-round way has completely outlined the timetable and road map for China's socialist
modernization construction between the "two hundred years."
Section 1: Attaching importance to strategic arrangements is
an important experience of the CPC in governing the country
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Strategic issues are fundamental issues for a political party and a
country. If we make accurate strategic judgments, plan scientifically strategically, and win the
initiative strategically, there will be great hope for the cause of the party and the people. "2 The
Communist Party of China has struggled for nearly a hundred years:

Persistently taking Marxism as the guide, deeply studying China's actual national conditions and the
development and changes of the times, planning China's revolution, construction and reform from
a strategic height, and planning for the cause of socialist modernization, and formulating a series of
lines, principles and policies that conform to China's reality and the characteristics of the times,
guiding China's revolution, construction and reform from victory to new victory, and leading the
Chinese nation to usher in a great leap from standing up, getting rich to becoming strong.

1. the strategic design for the realization of the "four modernizations" has opened up the great practice of independently exploring the road of socialist modernization

The strategic thinking of the Chinese Communist Party was born during the revolutionary war. As
the core of the party's first-generation leadership, Comrade Mao Zedong applied strategic thinking
to the practice of war, systematically expounded the strategic and tactical issues of the Chinese
revolution, the strategic and tactical problems of the people's war, the strategic foresight and
strategic guidance of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the strategic choices and strategic
decisive battles of the War of Liberation, the problems of strategically despising the enemy and
attaching importance to the enemy tactically, and the questions of principle firmness and tactical
flexibility; and systematically studied and answered "what is the Chinese revolution and how to
carry out the Chinese revolution." This major historical topic shows that it has focused on long-term
strategic foresight, made strategic arrangements with the overall situation in mind, and made
strategic adjustments that judge the hour and size up the situation, leading the party to victory in the
new democratic revolution. The founding of New China brought about national independence and
the people's liberation, marking the beginning of socialist modernization as the primary task of the
CPC's strategic planning.

In the early days after the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly summed up
the profound lessons of the international communist movement and China's initial experience in
building socialism, and put forward the strategic thinking of "taking the Soviet Union as a guide"
and independently exploring the road of socialist construction in China. He put forward the strategic
principle of correctly handling the "10 major relations" and mobilizing all positive factors to build
a socialist country; made a strategic judgment that correctly handling contradictions among the
people has become the main theme of the country's political life; put forward a series of major
principles for correctly handling contradictions among the people; clearly formulated the strategic
objectives and strategic steps for building a modern socialist country, and provided scientific
strategic guidance for correctly grasping the overall situation of China's socialist cause.
First, the strategic goal of the "four modernizations." As early as the late period of the New
Democratic Revolution, the Communist Party of China repeatedly proposed to transform China
from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country.

In 1945, Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out at the Seventh Party Congress: "The task of the
Chinese working class is not only to struggle for the establishment of a new democratic state, but
also to struggle for China's industrialization and agricultural modernization."1 At the Second Plenary
Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee, Comrade Mao Zedong further put forward the
strategic goal of turning an agricultural country into an industrial country. In June 1953, the Party
put forward the convex line of "one transformation and three transformations" in the transitional
period, and this "transformation" is socialist industrialization. Later, "The Struggle to Mobilize All
Forces to Build Our Country into a Great Socialist Country - Outline for the Study and Propaganda
of the Party's General Line in the Transitional Period" further pointed out: "By realizing the socialist
industrialization of the country, we can promote the modernization of agriculture and transportation,
and we can establish and consolidate a modern national defense."2 In September 1954, Comrade
Zhou Enlai pointed out in his "Report on the Work of the Government" delivered at the first session
of the First National People's Congress: "China's economy turned out to be very backward; if we do
not build a strong modern industry, modern agriculture, a modern transportation industry, and a
modern national defense, we will not be able to shake off backwardness and poverty, and our
revolution will not be able to achieve its goal."3 This is the first time that the party has put forward
the "four modernization" goals. From the end of 1959 to the beginning of 1960, Comrade Mao
Zedong made a complete expression of the "four modernizations" for the first time in his
"Conversation on Reading the Soviet Union's Political Economy Textbook.” He said: "To build
socialism, the original requirements were industrial modernization, agricultural modernization,
scientific and cultural modernization, and now we must add national defense modernization."4
Second, the strategic consideration of "two steps.” After the socialist system was basically
established, Comrade Mao Zedong began to plan and consider the issue of strategic steps to build
socialism. In September 1963, he revised the "On Industrial Development Issues (First Draft)" and
said that our industrial development can be considered in two steps: the first step is to establish an
independent and complete industrial system; the second step is to bring China's industry close to the
world's advanced level. At the First Session of the Third National People's Congress held in
December 1964, Comrade Zhou Enlai, in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions,
made a complete and accurate expression of the "two-step" strategy in the "Government Work
Report", that is: "Starting from the Third Five-Year Plan, China's national economic development
can be considered in two steps:

The first step is to establish an independent and relatively complete industrial system and national
economic system; The second step is to comprehensively realize the modernization of agriculture,
industry, national defense, and science and technology, so that China's economy will be in the
forefront of the world. "1 In terms of the time required, Comrade Mao Zedong initially envisaged
laying the foundation in 15 years and achieving modernization in 50 years. After the setbacks of the
"Great Leap Forward" and the three years of difficulty, his consideration of this issue became more
realistic, believing that if China is Chinese with many mouths, a weak foundation, and a backward
economy, it will take 100 years or more to turn China into a rich and powerful modern country. In
1975, at the First Session of the Fourth National People's Congress, Comrade Zhou Enlai reiterated
the strategic arrangement of "two steps" and the comprehensive realization of the "four
modernizations."
The "four modernizations" strategic objectives and the "two-step" strategic considerations were the
CPC's initial exploration of the road of socialist modernization after the founding of New China,
and also marked the transformation of the CPC's understanding of modernization from
"industrialization" to "modernization." Although such strategic objectives and strategic
considerations took detours and encountered twists and turns in later practice, they provided
important ideological preparation and practical foundation for the great practice of the party
gradually putting forward complete modernization goals and making systematic strategic
arrangements after reform and opening up.
2. Carry out strategic planning for the realization of socialist modernization
and successfully create, develop and improve socialism with Chinese
characteristics
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, faced with a situation in which
all wastes and all undertakings were waiting to be revived, the Chinese Communists, mainly
represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, clearly proposed to follow their own path and build
socialism with Chinese characteristics, formulated a development strategy for basically realizing
socialist modernization in three steps by the middle of the 21st century, and successfully created
socialism with Chinese characteristics.
First, it is necessary to adjust the "four modernizations" strategic objectives and the "two-step"
strategic concept in a timely manner. At the beginning of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng
Xiaoping pointed out that whether or not we can realize the "four modernizations" determines the
destiny of our country and the nation; he stressed that "our party's political line at the present stage,
in a nutshell, is to wholeheartedly pursue the four modernizations."

In December 1979, during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira, he quantified
the "four modernizations" as follows: By the end of the 20th century, strive to achieve a per capita
GDP of $1,000 and achieve a moderately prosperous level. Comrade Deng Xiaoping called this goal
"the four modernizations of the Chinese style," that is, the "home of moderate prosperity." He then
adapted the "two-step" strategic step, which was to "reach the level of the wealthier countries of the
Third World" by the end of the 20th century.”2 "To build a moderately prosperous society in China
by the end of the century." This moderately prosperous society is called Chinese-style
modernization."3 This is "we propose four minimum goals for modernization."4 The strategic goal
of the end of the 20th century was adjusted from "catching up with and surpassing the most advanced
capitalist countries in the world" to "reaching the level of the richer countries in the third world",
taking into account the actual situation of weak national foundation and weak foundation, and
further understanding the arduousness and long-term nature of realizing socialist modernization and
catching up with the developed countries in the world.

Second, clearly put forward the "three-step" strategic steps. The strategic concept of "three steps"
has been gradually formed. In March 1987, when meeting foreign guests, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
said: "We have set two stages of the goal, that is, to reach the level of moderate prosperity by the
end of this century, and then to reach the level of a moderately developed country in the next century
in 30 to 50 years." 5 "That's our strategic goal, that's our ambition. " 6 The 13th CPC National
Congress not only clearly summarized Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "three-step" strategic thinking,
but also called the third-step goal of reaching the level of a moderately developed country "basically
realizing modernization." The strategic steps of the "three-step" are: First, from 1981 to 1990, the
gross national product will double from 1980 and basically solve the problem of food and clothing;
the second step, from 1991 to the end of the 20th century, the gross national product will be doubled
again, the phenomenon of poverty will be basically eliminated, and the people's living standards
will reach the level of moderate prosperity; and the third step, by the middle of the 21st century, the
per capita gross national product will reach the level of a moderately developed country, the people's
living standards will be relatively prosperous, and modernization will be basically achieved.

Third, on the basis of adhering to the "three-step" strategy, put forward a new "three-step" strategic
goal. In September 1997, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out at the 15th CPC National Congress:
"Looking forward to the next century, our goal is to double the gross national product in the first 10
years compared with the year 2000, make the people's moderately prosperous life more prosperous,
and form a relatively perfect socialist market economic system; after another 10 years of efforts, by
the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, the national economy will be further developed
and various systems will be more perfect; and by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China by the middle of the century, we will basically realize modernization
and build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, and civilized socialist country."1 This is a
refinement and concretization of the "third step" of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "three-step" strategy,
and it is also a new "three-step" strategic arrangement for China's development in the first half of
the 21st century. In November 2002, the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
reaffirmed the new "three-step approach" and clearly defined the first centenary goal as: "To build
a better-off society of a higher standard that benefits more than one billion people in an all-round
way, so that the economy will be more developed, democracy will be more sound, science and
education will be more progressive, culture will be more prosperous, society will be more
harmonious and the people's life will be more solid." 2 In October 2007, at the 17th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Hu Jintao put forward new and higher
requirements for China's development, and adjusted the first centenary goal to build a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way.

3. Make strategic arrangements for building a moderately prosperous society and a modern socialist power in an all-round way, and start a new journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has scientifically planned the overall situation, firmly grasped
the strategic initiative, unswervingly achieved strategic goals, led China's reform, opening up and
socialist modernization to achieve historic achievements, opened up a new situation in the cause of
the Party and the country, entered a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and ushered
in a golden development opportunity in the journey of the modernization of the Chinese nation. The
19th CPC National Congress emphasized that from building a moderately prosperous society in an
all-round way to basically realizing modernization;

Then to build a modern socialist power in an all-round way is a strategic arrangement for the
development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Specifically, the five years from the 19th to the 20th CPC National Congress are the historical
convergence period of the "two centenary goals", and we must not only build a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way and achieve the first centenary goal, but also take advantage
of the situation to start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way and
march towards the second centenary goal. The first and second steps of the "three-step" strategic
goal have been achieved ahead of schedule, a moderately prosperous society will be built as
scheduled, China has become the world's second largest economy, and the economy and society
have maintained a good trend of sustained and healthy development. Against this background, it is
absolutely necessary for the 19th CPC National Congress to comprehensively analyze the
international and domestic situations and China's development conditions, and to make a new top-
level design and strategic plan for the 30 years after the "three-step" strategy, that is, the 30 years
between the "two centenary goals."
The strategic arrangement of "two stages" made by the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China is: the first stage, from 2020 to 2035, on the basis of building a moderately prosperous
society in an all-round way, will strive for another 15 years to basically realize socialist
modernization. In the second stage, from 2035 to the middle of this century, on the basis of basically
realizing modernization, we will strive for another 15 years to build China into a prosperous, strong,
democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist power. Such an arrangement can
be said to be an "upgraded version" of the third-step goal of the "three-step" strategy. This is the
solemn promise of the Communist Party of China on the journey of realizing the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation, but it is by no means something that can be achieved easily and by banging
gongs and drums, but a grand vision that requires the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups
throughout the country to endure, persevere and make long-term and arduous efforts with an
unremitting mental state and an indomitable attitude of struggle.

Section 2: Comprehensively grasp the strategic connotation and characteristics of a modern and powerful socialist country

The 19th CPC National Congress gave a macroscopic outlook and overall description of "basically
realizing socialist modernization" and "comprehensively building a modern and powerful socialist
country", which has profound connotations and rich meanings, and has distinct characteristics of
comprehensiveness, people's nature, practicality, and epochality.

1. China's modernization is a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful all-round modernization

China's modernization is a modernization jointly promoted by economic construction, political
construction, cultural construction, social construction and ecological civilization construction, and
its comprehensive characteristics are a clear symbol of China's socialist modernization strategy.
"Prosperity and strength" is the common pursuit of human society, the eternal theme of the times,
and the nuclear value of socialist China. "Prosperity and strength" means the unity of prosperity and
strength, and the unity of people's prosperity and national strength. It is not easy to be rich, and it is
even more difficult to be strong; being rich but not strong is not being rich and strong. China is a
big country, and only when it is rich and strong can it stand on its own among the nations of the
world; China is a socialist country, and "prosperity of the people" and "strength of the country"
should all the more be coordinated development, and "strong country and poor people" are untenable.
"Rich and strong" is first of all an economic category, but also a concept of comprehensive national
strength, a unity of hard power and soft power, and a strong country, a strong army, and a strong
people" is a process, China is a large country with a population of 1.4 billion, and regional
development is very unbalanced, which determines that it is impossible for all regions to achieve
prosperity and strength at the same time, nor can it achieve equal prosperity and strength in the
absolute sense; "rich and strong" is relative, there is only a starting point, there is no end. Looking
forward to the middle of this century, China will have a high degree of material civilization, its
economic strength, scientific and technological strength and social productivity will leap sharply,
its core competitiveness will rank among the best in the world, and it will become a country with
leading comprehensive national strength and international influence.

"Democracy", in essence, means that the people are masters of their own country, which is the
essence and core of socialist democratic politics. Without democracy, there can be no socialism, and
there will be no socialist modernization. The most important thing for "democracy" in the context
of modernization is the institutionalization and rule of law of democracy, including the maturity and
perfection of the political system, institutional mechanism, procedural norms and their operation,
including ensuring that the people enjoy extensive and fulfilling rights and self-esteem, ensuring
that the people widely participate in national and social governance, and ensuring vigorous and
healthy and orderly relations between political parties, ethnic groups, religions, classes, and
compatriots at home and abroad. Looking forward to the middle of this century, China will have a
high degree of political civilization, a country ruled by law, a government ruled by law, and a society
ruled by law, and realize the modernization of the national governance system and governance
capacity.

There is also the mature and finalized socialist democratic political system with Chinese
characteristics, and will give full play to its advantages and characteristics.
"Civilization" generally refers to the comprehensive cultural image displayed by a society, including
ideological consciousness, values, moral literacy, social order, production and lifestyle, scientific
and cultural level, etc., which is a concentrated embodiment of a country's development level and a
prominent symbol of a social progress. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Civilization, especially
ideology and culture, is the soul of a country and a nation.” 1 Without the inheritance and
development of civilization and the promotion and prosperity of culture, there will be no realization
of the Chinese dream. Looking forward to the middle of this century, China will have a high degree
of spiritual civilization, the quality of the people will be significantly improved, the practice of
socialist core values will become the conscious action of the whole society, and the Chinese spirit,
Chinese values and Chinese strength will become an important influence and driving force for
China's development.
"Harmony" means achieving social harmony and building a better society. This is the social ideal
that mankind has diligently pursued, and it is also the goal that the Communist Party of China has
unremittingly pursued. The most fundamental characteristics of a harmonious socialist society are
democracy and rule of law, fairness and justice, honesty and fraternity, vitality, stability and order,
and harmonious coexistence between man and nature. Looking forward to the middle of this century,
China will have a high degree of social civilization, urban and rural residents will generally have
higher incomes, a prosperous life, sound basic public services, enjoy a happier and healthier life,
the common prosperity of all the people will be basically realized, fairness and justice will be
universally displayed, and the society will be full of vitality and standardized and orderly.
"Beauty" means realizing ecological civilization and building a beautiful China. Ecological
civilization is a major achievement of human social progress and an inevitable requirement for
realizing harmonious coexistence between man and nature. Socialist modernization is a
modernization in which man and nature live in harmony. The construction of modern ecological
civilization is based on the carrying capacity of resources and environment, takes the laws of nature
as the criterion, takes sustainable development and harmony between man and nature as the goal,
firmly follows the civilized development path of production development, rich life and good ecology,
and strives to build a beautiful Zhongzhong. country where you can see the mountains, see the water,
and remember homesickness. Looking forward to the middle of this century, China will have a high
degree of ecological civilization, and the beautiful ecological environment of blue sky, green earth
and clear water will become the universal norm, creating a new realm of harmonious coexistence
between man and nature.

2. China's modernization is a modernization that adheres to the people-centered approach and takes the road of common prosperity

Socialist modernization, which takes the people as the center and takes the road of common
prosperity, is in line with the highest ideals and value pursuit of Marxism, and its goal is to benefit
the people and ultimately realize the free and comprehensive development of everyone.
In terms of the driving force of development, people-centered modernization emphasizes the great
cause of all the people to jointly build socialist modernization; in the pursuit of goals, it emphasizes
that all the people share the great achievements of socialist modernization; and in the evaluation
criteria, it emphasizes whether or not it brings a better life to the masses of the people as the
fundamental criterion for testing the results of modernization. People-centered modernization is not
a negation of the modernization of things, but a higher-level modernization based on the
modernization of things. This kind of modernization emphasizes the central position and subjective
status of "man", emphasizes that it cannot be at the cost of material abundance and spiritual poverty,
and emphasizes the need to avoid repeating the mistakes of some countries and regions that take
capital as the center and thus lead to the expansion of materialism and the decline of the spiritual
world.
Common prosperity is the essential requirement of socialist modernization, and it is the embodiment

of the people-centered position in the results of development and the distribution of wealth. As early
as 1955, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, "Now that we implement such a system and such a plan,
we can move towards richer and stronger year by year, and we can see richer and stronger year by
year."1 And this wealth is common wealth, this strong, is common strength.” After the reform and
opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Socialism is not about a few people getting rich
and the majority getting poor. The greatest advantage of socialism is common prosperity, which is
a thing that embodies the essence of socialism.”2 Entering the new era of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "The development we pursue is development that
benefits the people, and the prosperity we pursue is the common prosperity of all the people."

The socialist concept of common prosperity takes into account the unity of the standards of
productive forces and the people's interests, and the unity of material and human scales.

At this stage, China still has problems of regional disparity, urban-rural disparity, and large income
gap, which is a problem that is difficult to completely avoid at a specific historical stage but can
eventually be solved. Eliminating polarization and ultimately achieving common prosperity is the
firm commitment of the Communist Party of China to the Chinese people, and it is also the proper
meaning of China's realization of socialist modernization.

3. China's modernization is a modernization based on China's national conditions and independent development

The direction of development of modernization cannot be bypassed, but the path to modernization
can be chosen. Every country has the right to choose its own path of modernization, write its own
modern civilization, and reap its own modernization results.

With more than 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, a vast territory of more than 9.6 million square
kilometers, a population of 1.4 billion, and its own unique cultural traditions, historical destiny and
actual national conditions, China's modernization cannot imitate and depend on others, let alone
trade its own core interests, and must take the road of independent development and self-reliance.
The CPC has its own independent judgment on how and what kind of modernization should be
achieved. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The modernization we are engaged in is Chinese-
style modernization. The socialism we are building is socialism with Chinese characteristics. We
are mainly self-reliant according to our own actual situation and our own conditions. "2 Since the
18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly
stressed that "there is no one-size-fits-all development model in the world.”3

"We are willing to learn from all the achievements of human civilization, but we will not copy the
development model of any country."1 "The successful practice of the Chinese people shows the
world that there is more than one road to modernization, as long as you find the right direction and
keep going, all roads lead to Rome. "2
The practice of history fully proves that it is precisely by adhering to the road of independent
development based on its own national conditions that has enabled China to achieve tremendous
achievements in modernization that have attracted worldwide attention; for the first time, China has
relied on its own strength to achieve a moderate prosperity of the entire people, and for the first time
has achieved leapfrogging and catching up by following its own road. China's road to modernization
was born in the historical practice of contemporary China and is a great innovation in human history.
With its actual actions in modernization, China has told the world that China has neither "decoupled"
from human civilization nor imitated and attached to others; it has chosen to integrate with the
international community without sliding into the "Western track"; it has absorbed and learned from
all the outstanding achievements of human civilization without losing its autonomy. Independence
and self-reliance have been, are and will be the foothold of building a modern and powerful socialist
country.

4. China's modernization is a modernization that adheres to win-win cooperation and follows the path of peaceful development

China's modernization adheres to the concept of peaceful development and win-win cooperation,
does not follow the Western path of aggression, colonization and expansion, and does not agree with
the logic of "a strong country must be hegemonic", and has successfully opened up a road to the
rejuvenation of a great power that is "strong but not hegemonic.”

As China's policy proposition, "not seeking hegemony" stems from the profound immersion of
Chinese culture, from the deep memory of the history of national suffering, from the profound
understanding of the Western laws of "good war must die" and "hegemony must decline", and from
a profound grasp of the Communist Party's ruling philosophy and historical mission. The Chinese
nation is a peace-loving nation, and is well versed in the historical dialectics that a strong country
must hegemony, hegemony is bound to decline, and that warring is bound to die, and forgetting war
is dangerous.

In ancient times, the Silk Road was created for exchanges and mutual learning and shared
development between the East and the West, and the "Belt and Road" initiative proposed today is
also for exchanges and cooperation to promote prosperity.
However, we should also realize that along with the rapid improvement of China's economic
strength and comprehensive national strength, the theory of "China's threat" and "the theory that a
strong country must be hegemonic" are very popular. Some people believe that the 500 years of
world history since the discovery of geography is a history of national hegemony, the 16th century
is Portugal and Spain, the 17th century is the "sea coachman" Netherlands, the 18th and 19th
centuries is the Anglo-French hegemony, the achievement of the "sun never sets empire", the end of
the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Germany and Japan rose one after another,
two world wars followed, and the 20th century was the hegemony of the United States and the Soviet
Union. After these countries became strong, they all embarked on the road of no return of
hegemonism. China has not repeated the old path of the rise of great powers, but has risen peacefully
and still followed the path of peaceful development after its rise. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed:
"China will always be a builder of world peace, firmly follow the path of peaceful development, no
matter how the international situation changes, no matter how it develops, China will never seek
hegemony, never expand, and never seek spheres of influence."1 "This is how we set out in policy,
this is how we design our system, and we have always done this in practice.” 2 China is not a
challenger or destroyer of the international order, nor a bystander or outsider of the global
governance system; China was, is and will be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global
development and a defender of international order.
China has made a solemn commitment to the world never to seek hegemony or expansion, and at
the same time interprets the concept of adhering to win-win cooperation and taking the path of
peaceful development with its own concrete actions. The concept of "a community with a shared
future for mankind" advocated by Comrade Xi Jinping is a clear declaration of China's adherence
to the path of peaceful development, a top-level design proposed by China to plan the blueprint for
world development, and a Chinese idea and plan for improving the global governance system as a
responsible major country.

A strong China is not a threat to world peace, but the backbone of maintaining world peace. China's
peaceful rise has not only rewritten the development logic of the hegemonic expansion of great
powers in the past, but also rewritten the historical destiny of claiming hegemony after the rise of
great powers.

China's path of peaceful development shows the world that the rise of a great power is not only
based on the path of starting with war, plundering to get rich, and expanding hegemony, but that
peaceful development and civilization will be the priority option for the future world. China's
rejuvenation means the decline of the old logic of "a strong country must hegemony", and the
development logic of "strong but not hegemonic" will rise to the main axis of the new era.
All in all, a modern socialist power is not an empty slogan, nor is it an empty concept, but it expands
the new realm and new requirements of modern national construction. It is a collection of
manufacturing power, science and technology power, quality power, aerospace power, network
power, transportation power, maritime power, trade power, sports power, cultural power, education
power and talent power; it is also a collection of beautiful China, rule of law China, safe China,
healthy China and digital China; it is also a collection of innovative countries, rule of law countries,
learning countries, responsible countries, and peaceful countries; or a smart society, a harmonious
society, a rule of law society, and a society ruled by law. The collection of learning society has very
rich and specific connotations.
Section 3 Firmly implement the strategic arrangement for
building a modern socialist country in an all-round way
The strategic arrangements made by the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
for the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era are not only based on
the current development reality of China, but also adapt to the future development trend of China,
completely outline the timetable and road map for the construction of China's modern socialist
power, and provide important guidelines for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era.
1. decisively build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way
Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way is a solemn commitment made by the
Communist Party of China to the people and to history, and is the common aspiration of all Chinese
people. This grand goal is the first centenary goal of the "two centenary goals" and an important
milestone in the journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

Over the past 40 years and more since reform and opening up, our party has firmly grasped this goal
of struggle, worked one stubble after another, and run one stick after another, and the grand blueprint
for building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way is about to become a reality.
The building of a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by 2020 is of great significance
in the history of the development of the Chinese nation, the history of world development, and the
history of socialist development. Achieving this grand goal means high-quality economic
development, general improvement of people's living standards and quality, marked improvement
of national quality and social civilization, overall improvement of the quality of the ecological
environment, and more mature and stereotyped systems in all aspects.
Achieving such a goal requires us not only to achieve the goal in terms of volume and speed, but
more importantly, to solve the problems of balance, coordination and sustainability of development.
To be moderately prosperous in an all-round way, the areas covered should be comprehensive, and
the "five-in-one" should be comprehensively progressive; the population covered should be
comprehensive, which should benefit the entire people; and the areas covered should be
comprehensive, so as to be well-off in urban and rural areas. "Building a moderately prosperous
society in an all-round way is not a numbers game or a speed game, but a real goal. While
maintaining economic growth, it is more important to implement the people-centered development
thinking, think about what the masses think, be anxious about what the masses are anxious about,
and solve the difficulties of the masses."1
The comprehensive construction of a moderately prosperous society has reached the historical point
of vigor and decisive victory, and the sprint stage is particularly difficult, and it is even more
necessary to resist all kinds of interference. Today's world is facing major changes unprecedented
in a century, global sources of turmoil and risk points have increased, and the external environment
has become more complex and changeable. China's economy is shifting from a stage of high-speed
growth to a stage of high-quality development, with old and new contradictions intertwined, cyclical
and structural problems superimposed, and stable economic operation changing and worrying in
change. The downward pressure on the economy has increased, the growth rate of consumption has
slowed down, and the growth of effective investment has been weak; there are many difficulties in
the real economy, and the problem of "difficult financing and expensive financing" of private and
small and micro enterprises has not been effectively alleviated; the ability of independent innovation
is not strong, and the shortcomings of key core technologies are prominent; the three major battles
are still arduous, and there are still many places where the masses are dissatisfied in the field of
social undertakings.
Only by having a clear understanding of the situation can we face problems and challenges head-on
and win the decisive battle to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way.

In accordance with the strategic deployment determined by the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, we must make overall plans to promote the overall layout of the "five-
in-one", coordinate and promote the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, firmly implement the
seven major strategies of rejuvenating the country through science and education, strengthening the
country with talents, innovation-driven development, rural revitalization, coordinated regional
development, sustainable development, and military-civilian integration development, and build an
integrated national strategic system and capabilities. It is necessary to closely grasp the changes in
the main contradictions in our society, seek truth from facts, adapt measures to local conditions,
comprehensively implement policies, exert precise efforts, highlight key points, make up for
shortcomings, and strengthen weaknesses; in particular, we must resolutely fight the three major
battles, promote sustained and healthy economic and social development, and enable the building
of a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way to be recognized by the people and withstand
the test of history.
Resolutely fight the battle of preventing and defusing major risks. Putting the prevention and
resolution of major risks at the top of the three major battles reflects the strong sense of distress and
bottom-line thinking of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core. The
current and future period is a period in which the risks facing China's development in all aspects
continue to accumulate and even become concentrated and exposed. The major risks facing our
country include domestic economic, political, ideological and social risks and risks from the natural
world, as well as risks from international economic, political, strategic, sovereign and military risks.
Moreover, these risks often do not arise in isolation, but are likely to be intertwined and form a
complex of risks. If major risks occur and cannot be shouldered, the process of building a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way and even national rejuvenation may be interrupted. To
resolutely fight this tough battle, it is necessary to strengthen the investigation of hidden risks, find
out the bottom number of risks, persist in treating both the symptoms and the root causes, and pay
attention to improving the institutional mechanism to prevent and resolve risks. It is necessary to
strengthen the investigation and judgment of various risk sources, improve dynamic monitoring,
real-time early warning, and emergency response capabilities, pay special attention to potential
problems of emerging sexual tendencies, effectively prevent the impact of "black swan" events and
"gray rhino" events, prevent small risks from evolving into large risks, prevent external risks from
evolving into internal risks, prevent economic and financial risks from evolving into social and
political risks, prevent individual risks from evolving into systemic risks, and create a safe and stable
good environment for the comprehensive construction of a moderately prosperous society.
Resolutely win the battle against poverty. Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that no ethnic
minority or region should be left behind, and all Chinese people should share the fruits of all-round
moderate prosperity. At present, deep poverty is a "hard bone" on the road to overall moderate
prosperity, and it is necessary to mobilize the strength of the whole party and the whole society,
adhere to the basic strategy of targeted poverty alleviation and targeted poverty alleviation, and
adhere to the "three-in-one" poverty alleviation pattern of special poverty alleviation, industry
poverty alleviation and social poverty alleviation. It is necessary to give play to the advantages of
the socialist system in concentrating forces to do major things, strengthen cooperation and
counterpart support in poverty alleviation in the east and west, and do a good job in providing
designated assistance to central units. We should properly implement the "five batches" project, that
is, one batch of poverty alleviation through development, one batch of poverty alleviation through
relocation, one batch of poverty alleviation through ecological compensation, one batch of poverty
alleviation through education, and one batch of social security.

Attention should be paid to combining poverty alleviation with support for aspirations and wisdom,
and to improve the self-development ability of poor areas and the poor people and the internal
motivation to get rid of poverty and become rich. Adhering to the "two worries and three guarantees"
poverty alleviation standard can neither be divorced from reality, raise standards, and raise appetites,
nor can we falsely get rid of poverty, lower standards, and affect quality. Implement the strictest
assessment and evaluation to ensure that the rural poor under China's current standards will be lifted
out of poverty by 2020, and all poverty-stricken counties will be removed, regional overall poverty
will be solved, so as to get rid of real poverty and poverty alleviation, and make up for the biggest
shortcoming of building a moderately prosperous society.
Resolutely fight the battle against pollution. Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-
round way inevitably requires obvious progress in improving the quality of the ecological
environment. Resolutely fighting the battle of pollution prevention and control and accelerating the
solution of ecological and environmental problems at the intersection of history is a major task
entrusted by the times. It is necessary to adhere to the principle that green water and green mountains
are golden mountains and silver mountains, promote green development, strengthen energy
conservation and emission reduction, and at the same time take the solution of outstanding
ecological and environmental problems as a priority area for people's livelihood, resolutely win the
battle for blue skies, implement the water pollution prevention and control action plan, fully
implement the soil pollution prevention and control action plan, continue to carry out rural living
environment improvement actions, strengthen the protection and restoration of important
ecosystems, and form a pattern and atmosphere of ecological environmental protection in which the
whole society grasps and manages together, so that the improvement of the ecological environment
is compatible with the comprehensive construction of a moderately prosperous society.
2. the "two-step" strategic arrangement for the new era on the basis of
building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way
In accordance with the "two-step" strategic arrangement for the new era on the basis of building a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, to promote China's socialist modernization drive,
it is necessary to accelerate the development process and raise the level of development, which is
both an inspiring grand blueprint and a historical process of unremitting struggle. This requires the
whole party and the people of the whole country to grasp the international and domestic situation
and China's development conditions, seize the opportunity, seize the momentum, earnestly
accelerate the process of socialist modernization, strive to expand the broad space of socialist
modernization, and effectively promote the comprehensive improvement of China's material,
political, spiritual, social and ecological civilizations.
First, focus on economic modernization and continuously improve the level of material civilization.

Building a modern socialist country is inseparable from a strong material foundation. The main
contradiction in our society in the new era is the contradiction between the people's growing need
for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development, and China's economy has shifted from
a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage, and is in a critical period of
transforming the development mode, optimizing the economic structure, and transforming the
growth momentum. It is necessary to implement the new development concept, unswervingly regard
development as the top priority for the party to govern and rejuvenate the country, persist in
liberating and developing the social productive forces, adhere to the direction of socialist market
economic reform, and accelerate the realization of economic modernization. It is necessary to adhere
to quality first, benefit first, take supply-side structural reform as the main line, promote the quality
change, efficiency change and power change of economic development, and improve total factor
productivity. Efforts should be made to accelerate the construction of an industrial system with
coordinated development of the real economy, scientific and technological innovation, modern
finance, and human resources; strive to build an economic system with effective market mechanisms,
vigorous micro-subjects, and moderate macro-control, build a modern economic system,
continuously enhance China's economic innovation and competitiveness, and continuously improve
the level of material civilization.

Second, focus on modernizing the national governance system and governance capacity, and
continuously improve the level of political civilization. The national governance system and
governance capacity are the concentrated embodiment of a country's political civilization.
Upholding the party's leadership, the people being masters of the country, and the organic unity of
governing the country according to law are the inevitable requirements of socialist political
civilization. The leadership of the Communist Party of China is the most essential feature of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, the people's mastery of the country is the essence and core
of socialist democratic politics, and governing the country according to law is the basic way for the
party to lead the people to govern the country. We must adhere to the path of socialist political
development with Chinese characteristics, adhere to and improve the system of people's congresses,
the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the system of grassroots
mass autonomy. Consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic united front, develop socialist
consultative democracy, improve the democratic system, enrich democratic forms, broaden
democratic channels, ensure that the people's mastery of the country is implemented in the country's
political and social life, ensure that the people manage state affairs, economic and cultural
undertakings and social affairs through various channels and forms in accordance with the law,
continuously promote the building of socialist democratic politics and develop socialist political
civilization. Actively and steadily advance the reform of the political system, and promote the
institutionalization, standardization, rule of law, and procedural nature of socialist democratic
politics. By the 100th anniversary of the founding of our party, obvious results will be achieved in
making all aspects of the system more mature and more stereotyped; by 2035, the system in all
aspects will be more perfect, and the national governance system and governance capacity will be
basically modernized; by the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the national
governance system and governance capacity will be fully modernized, so that the socialist system
with Chinese characteristics will be more consolidated and its superiority will be fully displayed.

Third, efforts should be made to promote the construction of a culturally powerful country and
continuously improve the level of spiritual civilization. If culture is prosperous, the country is
prosperous, and a strong culture is a strong nation. To build a modern socialist country, we must
give full play to the guiding and supporting role of ideology and culture, and highlight the role of
spiritual civilization in social development as a spiritual driving force, ideological guarantee and
intellectual support. It is necessary to adhere to the path of socialist cultural development with
Chinese characteristics, stimulate the vitality of national cultural innovation and creativity, and build
a socialist cultural power. Firmly grasp the leadership of ideological work, cultivate and practice the
core socialist values, strengthen ideological and moral construction, prosper and develop socialist
literature and art, promote the coordinated development of cultural undertakings and cultural
industries, continuously enhance the soft power of national culture, continuously enhance the
influence of Chinese culture in the world, and continuously improve the ideological and moral level
and scientific and cultural level of the people.
Fourth, strive to achieve common prosperity and social fairness and justice, and continuously
improve the level of social civilization. Achieving common prosperity and social fairness and justice
is an important symbol of social civilization and an inevitable requirement for building a modern
and powerful socialist country. We must give priority to the development of education, improve the
quality of employment and the level of people's income, strengthen the construction of the social
security system, resolutely win the battle against poverty, implement the Healthy China strategy,
create a social governance pattern of joint construction, co-governance and sharing, and effectively
safeguard national security. Adhere to the bottom line, highlight key points, improve systems, guide
expectations, continuously narrow the gap between income, urban and rural areas, and regions,
basically realize the equalization of public services, ensure the basic life of the people, continuously
meet the people's growing needs for a better life, continuously promote social fairness and justice,
form effective social governance and good social order, and make the people's sense of gain,
happiness and security more fulfilling, more secure and more sustainable.
Fifth, focus on building a beautiful China and continuously improve the level of ecological
civilization. Socialist modernization is a modernization in which man and nature live in harmony.
We must firmly establish the concept of socialist ecological civilization, adhere to the principle of
giving priority to conservation, protection and natural restoration, and form a spatial pattern,
industrial structure, production mode and lifestyle for resource conservation and environmental
protection. Further advocate and promote the revolution of energy production and energy
consumption, accelerate the establishment of a legal system and policy guidance for green
production and consumption, establish and improve the economic system, green technology
innovation system and financial support system for green cycle and low-carbon development, truly
make green life a basic way of life, make the energy conservation and environmental protection
industry a leading industry for the development of the national economy, fundamentally improve
the ecological environment, and greatly improve the quality of ecological civilization in the whole
society.

To sum up, under the guidance of the strategic goal of building a modern and powerful socialist
country in an all-round way, China will become a country with leading comprehensive national
strength and international influence by building a high degree of material, political, spiritual, social
and ecological civilization, so that the Chinese nation will stand tall among the nations of the world
with a more lofty attitude.
