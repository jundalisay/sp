4. Resolutely advance the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland
The motherland must and will be reunified. This is the historical conclusion of the development of
cross-strait relations, and it is also an inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation in the new era. Cross-strait Chinese and the sons and daughters of China at home and abroad
should shoulder the great national righteousness, conform to the general trend of history, and jointly
promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations and the process of peaceful reunification
of the motherland.

First, explore the "one country, two systems" Taiwan plan to enrich the practice of peaceful
reunification. "One country, two systems" was originally proposed to take care of Taiwan's actual
situation and safeguard the interests and well-being of Taiwan compatriots. The specific form of
realizing "one country, two systems" in Taiwan will give full consideration to Taiwan's actual
situation, fully absorb the opinions and suggestions of all circles on both sides of the strait, and fully
take into account the interests and feelings of Taiwan compatriots. Under the premise of ensuring
national sovereignty, security and development interests, after peaceful reunification, the social
system and way of life of Taiwan compatriots will be fully respected, and their private property,
religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests will be fully guaranteed.
Cross-strait political consultations will be held on the basis of the one-China principle. Compatriots
on both sides of the strait are one family, and cross-strait affairs are family affair of compatriots on
both sides of the strait, and of course they should also be discussed and handled by family members.
Peaceful reunification means consultation on an equal footing and joint discussion of reunification.
The long-standing political differences between the two sides of the strait are the general root cause
affecting the stability and long-term development of cross-strait relations, and they cannot be passed
on from generation to generation.

The two sides of the strait should adopt an attitude of responsibility to the nation and future
generations, pool wisdom, give play to creativity, converge and assimilate differences, strive to
resolve political confrontation at an early date, realize lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait, and achieve
the vision of national reunification. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that on the basis of the one-
China principle, there are no obstacles to any political party or group in Taiwan interacting with us.
Only by replacing confrontation with dialogue, replacing strife with cooperation, and replacing zero-
sum with win-win can cross-strait relations be stable and far-reaching. We are willing to conduct
dialogue and communication with all political parties, organizations and personages in Taiwan on
cross-strait political issues and issues related to promoting the process of peaceful reunification of
the motherland, extensively exchange views, seek social consensus and advance political
negotiations. Comrade Xi Jinping also proposed that "on the common political basis of adhering to
the '92 consensus' and opposing 'Taiwan independence', all political parties and sectors on both sides
of the strait should nominate representative personages to carry out extensive and in-depth
democratic consultations on cross-strait relations and the future of the nation, and reach institutional
arrangements for promoting the peaceful development of cross-strait relations."1
Second, adhere to the one-China principle and safeguard the prospects for peaceful reunification.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "Reunification is the general trend of history and the right path.
'Taiwan independence' is a historical countercurrent and a dead end. " 2 Although the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait have not yet been completely reunified, China's sovereignty and territory have
never been divided, and the fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to the same China has never
changed. The reunification of the two sides of the strait is an end to political confrontation, not a
rebuilding of territory and sovereignty. The one-China principle is the political foundation of cross-
strait relations. By adhering to the one-China principle, cross-strait relations can be improved and
developed, and Taiwan compatriots will benefit. Deviating from the one-China principle will lead
to tension and turbulence in cross-strait relations and harm the vital interests of Taiwan compatriots.
We adhere to the policy of pinning our hopes on the Taiwan people, respect Taiwan compatriots,
care for them, unite with Taiwan compatriots, rely on Taiwan compatriots, and wholeheartedly do
practical things, do good deeds, and solve difficulties for Taiwan compatriots. We are willing to
create broad space for peaceful reunification, but we will never leave any space for various forms
of "Taiwan independence" separatist activities. Chinese don't hit Chinese. We do not undertake to
renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary measures, which are aimed
at the interference of external forces and the very small number of "Taiwan independence"
separatists and their separatist activities, and absolutely not at Taiwan compatriots. Compatriots on
both sides of the strait should work together for peace, safeguard peace, and share peace.
Third, deepen cross-strait integration and development and lay a solid foundation for peaceful
reunification. Compatriots on both sides of the strait are linked by blood.

Dear friends, Chinese to help Chinese. We treat Taiwan compatriots equally, take the lead in sharing
mainland development opportunities with Taiwan compatriots, and provide equal treatment for
Taiwan compatriots and Taiwan enterprises, so that everyone can have more sense of gain. Since
the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the degree of cross-strait economic
and cultural exchanges and cooperation has been continuously deepened, and the integration and
development of the two sides of the strait has reached a new level. In 2018, the mainland's trade
volume with Taiwan reached US$226.24 billion, and Taiwan is the mainland's fifth largest trading
partner and third largest source of imports, and the mainland is Taiwan's largest trading partner and
source of trade surplus. Among them, the mainland's exports to Taiwan were $48.647 billion, up
10.6 percent, imports from Taiwan were $177.598 billion, up 13.9 percent, and the mainland's trade
deficit with Taiwan was $128.951 billion. By the end of 2018, a total of 107,190 Taiwan-funded
projects had been approved, accounting for 11.2% of the total number of foreign-funded projects
actually used. By the end of 2018, more than 100 million Taiwan residents had come to the mainland.
The two associations have continuously strengthened consultations in the economic fields such as
finance, agriculture, shipping, taxation and nuclear power, as well as in the fields of people's
livelihood such as medicine and health, disaster monitoring and food safety, and established
institutionalized contact mechanisms for information exchange, personnel exchange visits and crisis
management, greatly expanding the fields of cross-strait exchanges and cooperation and enhancing
the well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait.

It is necessary to actively promote the institutionalization of cross-strait economic cooperation, build
a cross-strait common market, add impetus to development, add vitality to cooperation, and
strengthen the economy of the Chinese nation. The two sides of the strait should make every effort
to improve smooth economic and trade cooperation, infrastructure connectivity, energy and resource
connectivity, and common industry standards, and take the lead in realizing water, electricity, gas,
and bridges between Kinmen and Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian. It is necessary to promote
cross-strait cooperation in culture and education, medical and health care, social security and sharing
of public resources, and support the equalization, universalization and convenience of basic public
services in areas adjacent to the two sides of the strait or with similar conditions. The 2017 Central
Work Conference on Taiwan proposed to provide "national treatment" for the Taiwanese people.
On February 28, 2018, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, the Organization Department
of the Central Committee of the National Development and Reform Commission and other
departments issued Several Measures on Promoting Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges
and Cooperation ("31 Measures to Benefit Taiwan from the Mainland"). It clearly points out that
we should actively promote the acceleration of equal treatment for Taiwan-funded enterprises and
mainland enterprises in the field of investment and economic cooperation, and gradually provide
Taiwan compatriots with the same treatment as mainland compatriots in studying, starting
businesses, employment, and living on the mainland. On November 4, 2019, 20 relevant
departments, including the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and the Organization
Department of the Central Committee of Economic and Commercial Affairs of the National
Development and Reform Commission, issued Several Measures on Further Promoting Cross-Strait
Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation ("26 Measures");

It involves 13 measures to provide equal treatment for Taiwan enterprises to participate in
investment and construction of major technical equipment, 5G, circular economy, civil aviation,
theme parks, new financial organizations, etc., and 13 measures to provide more convenience and
support for Taiwan compatriots in consular protection, agricultural cooperation, transportation,
communication fees, housing purchase qualifications, culture and sports, title evaluation, classified
recruitment, etc. These measures have brought great opportunities and a real sense of gain to
Taiwan-funded enterprises and Taiwan compatriots.

Fourth, realize the spiritual unity of compatriots on both sides of the strait and enhance the identity
of peaceful reunification. The soul of the country is forged by culture. Compatriots on both sides of
the strait share the same roots, the same language, and the same species, and Chinese culture is the
root vein and belonging of the hearts of compatriots on both sides of the strait. The national
reunification we are pursuing is not only formal reunification, but more importantly, the spiritual
unity of compatriots on both sides of the strait. We understand the mentality formed by Taiwan
compatriots due to special historical encounters and different social environments, respect the social
system and way of life chosen by Taiwan compatriots themselves, and are willing to use sincerity,
goodwill and family affection to narrow the psychological distance between compatriots on both
sides of the strait. At the same time, Taiwan compatriots also need to know and understand more
about the feelings and mentality of mainland compatriots, and respect the choices and pursuits of
mainland compatriots. The fellowship of people is in the heart. No matter how many disturbances
and obstacles we encounter, exchanges and cooperation between compatriots on both sides of the
strait cannot be stopped, interrupted, or reduced. Compatriots on both sides of the strait should
jointly inherit the excellent traditional Chinese culture and promote its creative transformation and
innovative development. Compatriots on both sides of the strait should exchange and learn from
each other, engage in dialogue and tolerance, promote themselves and others, compare hearts to
hearts, deepen mutual understanding, and enhance mutual trust and recognition. It is necessary to
uphold the feelings of compatriots and empathy, educate future generations with a correct view of
history, nationality, and country, and carry forward the great national spirit. Between relatives, there
is no knot that cannot be untied. After a long period of meritorious service, we will certainly be able
to achieve the spiritual harmony of compatriots on both sides of the strait.

In short, "one country, two systems" has strong vitality, and realizing the complete reunification of
the motherland in accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems" is the common
aspiration of all Chinese people and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. As long as all
the sons and daughters of China, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, conform
to the general trend of history, shoulder the great national righteousness, and firmly hold the destiny
of the nation in their own hands, they will certainly be able to realize the peaceful reunification of
the motherland and jointly create a bright future for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
