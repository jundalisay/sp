2. Carry out strategic planning for the realization of socialist modernization and successfully create, develop and improve socialism with Chinese characteristics

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, faced with a situation in which
all wastes and all undertakings were waiting to be revived, the Chinese Communists, mainly
represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, clearly proposed to follow their own path and build
socialism with Chinese characteristics, formulated a development strategy for basically realizing
socialist modernization in three steps by the middle of the 21st century, and successfully created
socialism with Chinese characteristics.

First, it is necessary to adjust the "four modernizations" strategic objectives and the "two-step"
strategic concept in a timely manner. At the beginning of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng
Xiaoping pointed out that whether or not we can realize the "four modernizations" determines the
destiny of our country and the nation; he stressed that "our party's political line at the present stage,
in a nutshell, is to wholeheartedly pursue the four modernizations."

In December 1979, during a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira, he quantified
the "four modernizations" as follows: By the end of the 20th century, strive to achieve a per capita
GDP of $1,000 and achieve a moderately prosperous level. Comrade Deng Xiaoping called this goal
"the four modernizations of the Chinese style," that is, the "home of moderate prosperity." He then
adapted the "two-step" strategic step, which was to "reach the level of the wealthier countries of the
Third World" by the end of the 20th century.‚Äù2 "To build a moderately prosperous society in China
by the end of the century." This moderately prosperous society is called Chinese-style
modernization."3 

This is "we propose four minimum goals for modernization."4 The strategic goal
of the end of the 20th century was adjusted from "catching up with and surpassing the most advanced
capitalist countries in the world" to "reaching the level of the richer countries in the third world",
taking into account the actual situation of weak national foundation and weak foundation, and
further understanding the arduousness and long-term nature of realizing socialist modernization and
catching up with the developed countries in the world.

Second, clearly put forward the "three-step" strategic steps. The strategic concept of "three steps"
has been gradually formed. In March 1987, when meeting foreign guests, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
said: "We have set two stages of the goal, that is, to reach the level of moderate prosperity by the
end of this century, and then to reach the level of a moderately developed country in the next century
in 30 to 50 years." 5 "That's our strategic goal, that's our ambition. " 6 The 13th CPC National
Congress not only clearly summarized Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "three-step" strategic thinking,
but also called the third-step goal of reaching the level of a moderately developed country "basically
realizing modernization." The strategic steps of the "three-step" are: First, from 1981 to 1990, the
gross national product will double from 1980 and basically solve the problem of food and clothing;
the second step, from 1991 to the end of the 20th century, the gross national product will be doubled
again, the phenomenon of poverty will be basically eliminated, and the people's living standards
will reach the level of moderate prosperity; and the third step, by the middle of the 21st century, the
per capita gross national product will reach the level of a moderately developed country, the people's
living standards will be relatively prosperous, and modernization will be basically achieved.

Third, on the basis of adhering to the "three-step" strategy, put forward a new "three-step" strategic
goal. In September 1997, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out at the 15th CPC National Congress:
"Looking forward to the next century, our goal is to double the gross national product in the first 10
years compared with the year 2000, make the people's moderately prosperous life more prosperous,
and form a relatively perfect socialist market economic system; after another 10 years of efforts, by
the 100th anniversary of the founding of the CPC, the national economy will be further developed
and various systems will be more perfect; and by the 100th anniversary of the founding of the
People's Republic of China by the middle of the century, we will basically realize modernization
and build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, and civilized socialist country."1 This is a
refinement and concretization of the "third step" of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "three-step" strategy,
and it is also a new "three-step" strategic arrangement for China's development in the first half of
the 21st century. In November 2002, the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
reaffirmed the new "three-step approach" and clearly defined the first centenary goal as: "To build
a better-off society of a higher standard that benefits more than one billion people in an all-round
way, so that the economy will be more developed, democracy will be more sound, science and
education will be more progressive, culture will be more prosperous, society will be more
harmonious and the people's life will be more solid." 2 In October 2007, at the 17th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Hu Jintao put forward new and higher
requirements for China's development, and adjusted the first centenary goal to build a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way.

3. Make strategic arrangements for building a moderately prosperous society and a modern socialist power in an all-round way, and start a new journey of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has scientifically planned the overall situation, firmly grasped
the strategic initiative, unswervingly achieved strategic goals, led China's reform, opening up and
socialist modernization to achieve historic achievements, opened up a new situation in the cause of
the Party and the country, entered a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and ushered
in a golden development opportunity in the journey of the modernization of the Chinese nation. The
19th CPC National Congress emphasized that from building a moderately prosperous society in an
all-round way to basically realizing modernization;

Then to build a modern socialist power in an all-round way is a strategic arrangement for the
development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Specifically, the five years from the 19th to the 20th CPC National Congress are the historical
convergence period of the "two centenary goals", and we must not only build a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way and achieve the first centenary goal, but also take advantage
of the situation to start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round way and
march towards the second centenary goal. The first and second steps of the "three-step" strategic
goal have been achieved ahead of schedule, a moderately prosperous society will be built as
scheduled, China has become the world's second largest economy, and the economy and society
have maintained a good trend of sustained and healthy development. Against this background, it is
absolutely necessary for the 19th CPC National Congress to comprehensively analyze the
international and domestic situations and China's development conditions, and to make a new top-
level design and strategic plan for the 30 years after the "three-step" strategy, that is, the 30 years
between the "two centenary goals."

The strategic arrangement of "two stages" made by the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China is: the first stage, from 2020 to 2035, on the basis of building a moderately prosperous
society in an all-round way, will strive for another 15 years to basically realize socialist
modernization. In the second stage, from 2035 to the middle of this century, on the basis of basically
realizing modernization, we will strive for another 15 years to build China into a prosperous, strong,
democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist power. Such an arrangement can
be said to be an "upgraded version" of the third-step goal of the "three-step" strategy. This is the
solemn promise of the Communist Party of China on the journey of realizing the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation, but it is by no means something that can be achieved easily and by banging
gongs and drums, but a grand vision that requires the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups
throughout the country to endure, persevere and make long-term and arduous efforts with an
unremitting mental state and an indomitable attitude of struggle.
