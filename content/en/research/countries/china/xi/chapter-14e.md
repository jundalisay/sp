3. Actively lead and promote the reform of the global governance system

In today's world, with the ebb and flow of international forces and the increasing number of global
challenges, it is the general trend to strengthen global governance and promote the reform of the
global governance system. Comrade Xi Jinping attaches great importance to the issue of global
governance, and presided over the collective study of the Politburo on this topic twice in October
2015 and September 2016. With a broad global vision and a world mind, he asked "what is wrong
with the world and what should we do? “It also accurately grasps the development trend of
increasingly interdependent countries in the world, puts forward the global governance concept of
consultation, co-construction and sharing, and leads the innovative development of global
governance concepts and practices with Chinese wisdom, Chinese propositions and Chinese
solutions.

As a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international
order, China insists on proceeding from its national conditions and actively playing its role as a
responsible major country in accordance with the principle of consistency of responsibilities, rights
and capabilities. Comrade Xi Jinping called on all countries to have the spirit of taking the world as
their own responsibility, actively acting as action-oriented and not spectators, and working together
to take the future and destiny of mankind into their own hands. He clearly proposed to "adhere to
fairness and reasonableness and solve the governance deficit", "Adhere to mutual consultation and
mutual understanding and solve the trust deficit", "Stick to working together to solve the peace
deficit", "Adhere to mutual benefit and win-win results, and solve the development deficit.”1 In
terms of global economic governance, it emphasizes equality as the basis, better reflects the new
reality of the world economic pattern, increases the representation and voice of emerging economies
and developing countries, and ensures equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules for all
countries in international economic cooperation.

Guided by openness, adhere to the openness of concepts, policies and mechanisms, adapt to changes
in the situation, collect good opinions, fully listen to the suggestions and demands of all sectors of
society, and encourage all parties to actively participate and integrate; take cooperation as the
driving force, strengthen communication and coordination, take each other's interests and concerns,
discuss rules together, jointly build mechanisms, and meet challenges together; take sharing as the
goal, advocate the participation of all people, benefit everyone, and do not engage in one company
or winner-take-all. In terms of the reform and construction of the global governance system, it
emphasizes firmly upholding the international order with the purposes and principles of the UN
Charter as the core, promoting the democratization and rule of law of global governance rules,
promoting a more balanced global governance system that reflects the wishes and interests of the
majority of countries, and actively participating in the formulation of governance rules in the fields
of oceans, polar regions, cyber, outer space, nuclear security, anti-corruption and climate change. In
dealing with major international and regional hotspot issues and global challenges, we emphasize
constructive participation in political settlements, expand participation in peacekeeping operations
under the framework of the United Nations, and strive to make greater contributions to the
maintenance of world peace, security and stability. In terms of global human rights governance, it
emphasizes adhering to the new human rights concept of promoting development through
cooperation and promoting human rights through development. In terms of strengthening global
public health governance, it emphasizes the need to improve the public health safety governance
system, improve the emergency response speed of public health emergencies, and establish global
and regional epidemic prevention material reserve centers in view of the shortcomings and
shortcomings exposed by the new crown pneumonia epidemic. In terms of participation in global
governance, it emphasizes efforts to enhance the ability to formulate rules, set agendas, publicize
public opinion, and coordinate as well.

It is under the guidance of these new ideas and concepts that in recent years, China has taken the
initiative and courageously taken responsibility in the field of global governance, striving to promote
the reform of unfair and unreasonable arrangements in the global governance system, which has
won universal praise from the international community.
Section 3: The Belt and Road Initiative is an important
platform for building a community with a shared future for
mankind

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has
organically combined China's development with the common development of the world, drawn
nourishment from the ancient Silk Road, and creatively proposed the "Silk Road Economic Belt"
and "The "21st Century Maritime Silk Road" initiative has created a new pattern of China's all-
round opening up, created a new platform for China and the world to share development
opportunities, and opened up a new model for international cooperation.

In May 2017 and April 2019, China successfully hosted the first and second Belt and Road Forum
for International Cooperation. Over the past few years, from top-level design to project
implementation, from planning to specific practice, the joint construction of the "Belt and Road"
has changed from initiative to action, and has changed from drawing "big letters" Turned to carving
"Gongbi Painting.”

1. the top-level design of China's opening up and economic diplomacy in the new era

As socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, the situation of international economic
cooperation and competition is undergoing profound changes, the global economic governance
system and rules are facing major adjustments, China's introduction and going out are incomparable
in depth, breadth and rhythm in the past, and the pressure to deal with external economic risks and
maintain national economic security is also incomparable in the past. And "China's level of opening
up to the outside world is not high enough, the ability to make good use of the two markets and
resources at home and abroad is not strong enough, the ability to deal with international economic
and trade frictions and win the right to speak in the international economy is still relatively weak,
and the ability to use international economic and trade rules is not strong enough, and it needs to be
made up for it faster.”1 To this end, we must adhere to the basic national policy of opening up to the
outside world, pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy, persist in attaching equal
importance to bringing in and going out, deepen people-to-people exchanges, improve the layout of
opening up to the outside world, foreign trade layout and investment layout, form a new system of
opening up to the outside world, and develop a higher-level open economy, so as to expand opening
up to drive innovation, promote reform and promote development.
The construction of the "Belt and Road" not only makes overall planning for China's open space
layout in the new era, but also carries out the top-level design of the path for China and the world
to achieve openness and win-win results. For China, the construction of the "Belt and Road" is
"developed", China starts from a global perspective, consciously coordinates the overall situation at
home and abroad, and comprehensively plans the grand strategy of all-round opening up. It is a
major measure to go to the world with a more proactive attitude and maintain sustained and healthy
economic development.

It has and will continue to push China to further improve the level of opening up to the outside world
and enhance its ability to participate in international competitiveness, and at the same time, it will
also force the transformation of economic development mode and the optimization of economic
structure, and constantly expand new space for reform and development. For the world, the
construction of the "Belt and Road" requires China to actively guide the global economic agenda,
safeguard the multilateral trading system, accelerate the implementation of the free trade area
strategy, improve the level of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and strive to
shoulder international responsibilities and obligations commensurate with China's capabilities and
status. China has taken the "Belt and Road" construction as an opportunity to carry out cross-border
connectivity, improve the level of trade and investment cooperation, and promote international
production capacity and equipment manufacturing cooperation, essentially to generate new demand
and achieve world economic rebalancing by improving effective supply. Especially in the context
of the continuous downturn in the world economy and the rapid development of developing
countries to achieve economic independence and national rejuvenation, China conforms to the
aspirations of all countries, especially the vast number of developing countries, to promote peace
and seek development, and supports the vast number of developing countries along the Belt and
Road to promote industrialization, modernization and improve the level of infrastructure. This is a
milestone in the history of world development.

The construction of the "Belt and Road" is based on the basic principle of consultation, joint
construction and sharing. "Consultation" means communication and consultation, fully respecting
the differences in the development level, economic structure, legal system, business environment
and cultural traditions of various countries. "Co-construction" means joint participation, in-depth
docking with relevant national and regional development strategies, establishing cooperation
projects and jointly promoting them. "Sharing" means mutual benefit and win-win results, and all
parties maximize their interests through cooperation. These three complement each other and are
inseparable, forming an organic and unified whole. The construction of the "Belt and Road" firmly
grasps the greatest common denominator of development, aims to share China's development
opportunities with countries along the route and other countries, welcomes all parties to take the
"fast train" and "free ride" of China's development, and promotes all countries and international
organizations to work together to meet the challenges of human development and achieve
complementary advantages and mutual benefit and win-win results.
"One Belt, One Belt' construction focuses on the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa, while
naturally extending to Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean. The construction of the Silk Road
Economic Belt focuses on connecting the Eurasian continent, mainly including the construction of
six major economic corridors, namely the New Eurasian Land Bridge marked by the China-Europe
Express, the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor, the China-Mongolia-Russia
Economic Corridor, the China-Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor, the China-Pakistan
Economic Corridor, and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor.

The construction of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road focuses on connecting the Pacific Ocean
and the Indian Ocean, mainly through the construction of fulcrums along the coasts of the Indian
Ocean, Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea, such as Kyaukpyu Port and Sittwe Port in Myanmar,
Colombo Port and Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka, Gwadar Port in Pakistan, Djibouti Support Base,
and Piraeus Port in Greece. The connectivity of North Africa, Europe, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian
Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean promotes economic and trade ties and
common development among countries and regions along the route. As an open and inclusive
process, the construction of the "Belt and Road" is open to all like-minded friends across different
regions, different stages of development and different civilizations, and is neither excluded nor
targeted at any party. It is not about closing the door to engage in closed and exclusive circles or
"China clubs"; it is not about geopolitical alliances or military alliances; Moreover, it is not
demarcated by ideology, does not engage in zero-sum games, and does not buy and sell by force.
