2. the "Fourteen Persistences" are a program of action for adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics

Proceeding from the practical requirements of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era,
the "Fourteen Persistences" constitute the basic strategy for adhering to and developing socialism
with Chinese characteristics, profoundly answer the major practical topic of "how to uphold and
develop socialism with Chinese characteristics" in the new era, and are the concrete manifestation
of the "eight clear" ideological propositions in practice. It is organically unified with the "eight clear"
and together constitute an important part of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese
characteristics for a new era.
The "Fourteen Persistences" include: upholding the party's leadership over all work, adhering to the
people-centered, persisting in comprehensively deepening reform, adhering to the new development
concept, adhering to the people as masters of the country, adhering to the comprehensive rule of law,
adhering to the socialist core value system, adhering to ensuring and improving people's livelihood
in the process of development, adhering to the harmonious coexistence between man and nature,
adhering to the overall concept of national security, upholding the party's absolute leadership over
the people's army, adhering to the "two countries, two systems" and promoting the reunification of
the motherland, persisting in promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for
mankind, and adhering to comprehensively and strictly administering the party. As the basic strategy
for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, these "14
persistences" are a summary and enhancement of our party's basic program, basic experience and
basic requirements since the reform and opening up.

First, the "Fourteen Persistences" answer the question of "who will lead" in the practice of adhering
to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. A prominent feature of the
superiority of China's political system is that it has always adhered to the party's leadership position
of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all parties. During the period of socialist
construction, Comrade Mao Zedong stressed: "In the seven aspects of industry, agriculture,
commerce, study, soldiers, government, and the party, the party leads everything. "1 In the new era,
Comrade Xi Jinping further proposed on the basis of summing up the historical experience of
socialism: "Adhere to the party's leadership over all work. "2 It clearly answers the question of "who
will lead" in adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. The
leadership of the Communist Party of China is the choice of history and the choice of the people; it
is the fundamental and lifeline of the country and the nation, and the interests and happiness of the
people of the whole country are related. In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, in
the face of the new situation and new tasks, ensuring the party's role as the core of leadership has
put forward new requirements for the party's self-building, and "persisting in comprehensively and
strictly administering the party" has become the top priority. Such a basic strategy is based on the
party's scientific Lan of its own development experience, correct judgment of the international and
domestic situation, and always adhere to the original mission. The Communist Party of China is
China's supreme political leading force, and all fields and aspects must consciously uphold the
party's leadership, including "upholding the party's absolute leadership over the people's army."
Only by always adhering to the party's leadership over all work can we achieve ideological unity,
political unity and unity in action of the whole party and society at a higher level, further enhance
the party's creativity, cohesion and combat effectiveness, and ensure the success of socialist
construction.
Second, the "Fourteen Persistences" clarify the question of "for whom and on whom" in the practice
of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. The great cause
of socialism with Chinese characteristics has the most profound and extensive people's character.
First, it has always regarded the realization, safeguarding and development of the fundamental
interests of the broadest masses of the people as its value orientation; second, it has always taken
the broadest masses of the people as the main body of practice. Important strategies such as
"persisting in taking the people as the center", "upholding the people as masters of the country" and
"persisting in ensuring and improving people's livelihood in the course of development" show that
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is an unprecedented great cause, and it is necessary
to closely unite and highly unite the strength of the whole nation and fight unremittingly for it with
one heart and one mind.

Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "The concept of the people has different contents in different
countries and in different historical periods of each country. "1 In contemporary China, all classes,
strata and social forces that support, support and participate in the construction of socialism with
Chinese characteristics belong to the category of the people and are all relying forces for the cause
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our party must ensure that development is for
the people, development depends on the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the
people.

Third, the "Fourteen Persistences" respond to the question of "how to promote development" in the
practice of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. As
socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, major changes have taken place in the main
contradictions in our society, but the basic national conditions of our country in the initial stage of
socialism have not changed, and our international status as the world's largest developing country
has not changed. This determines that development remains the foundation and key to solving all
our problems. "How to promote development" has become a question that the ruling party must
answer. "Persisting in comprehensively deepening reform" shows that reform and opening up is a
key measure and powerful driving force for promoting the realization of the "two centenary goals"
and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. In contemporary China, only reform and
opening up can develop China, socialism and Marxism. "Reform and opening up is only carried out
when it is not completed. "2 Adhering to the new development concept of "innovation, coordination,
green, openness and sharing" reflects the party's new thinking and understanding of the law of
economic and social development, points out China's development ideas, development directions,
and development focuses, and is an important follow-up that must be adhered to for a long time in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. "Adhering to the harmonious coexistence of man
and nature" reflects a major change in China's development mode, further enriches the connotation
of development, expands the vision of development, clarifies new requirements for development,
and has both theoretical innovation and practical breakthroughs.
Fourth, the "Fourteen Persistences" respond to the question of "how to provide effective guarantees"
in the practice of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Under the new historical conditions, to smoothly advance the cause of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, it is necessary to provide effective guarantees and favorable conditions. "Adhering
to the socialist core value system" fully embodies the powerful goal and guiding role of the lofty
ideal of communism and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics in promoting
the development of the cause, and embodies the profound nourishing role of China's excellent
traditional culture and the spiritual guiding role of revolutionary culture and advanced socialist
culture.

"Adhering to the comprehensive rule of law" is the essential requirement for adhering to and
developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, an inevitable requirement for realizing the
modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, and is related to the
party's ruling and rejuvenating the country, the people's happiness and well-being, and the long-term
peace and stability of the party and the country. "Adhering to the overall concept of national
security" and taking national security as an important cornerstone of stability and stability are in the
fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and it will ensure the smooth
progress of the practical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. "Persistently
promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind" has drawn a blueprint
for human society to achieve common development, sustained prosperity and long-term stability,
pointed out the way forward, and also created a good external environment for China's development.
"Upholding one country, two systems' and promoting the reunification of the motherland" is an
inevitable requirement for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and is also where
the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation lie.
The "14 Adherence Principles" basic strategy makes top-level designs for economic, political,
cultural, social, ecological and rule of law, national security, national defense and the military, "one
country, two systems" and the motherland's reunification, united front, diplomacy, party building
and other aspects, clarifies the major policies for the development of various undertakings in the
new era, points out the goals, paths and methods for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era, and is the "road map" for realizing the "two centenary goals"
and realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
Section 3: Realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation on the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics
The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, as well as the vanguard
of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. The Party takes the realization of socialism and
communism as its goal and undertakes the historical mission of realizing the great rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation. Adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics epitomizes
the organic combination of realizing socialism and communism and realizing the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation. To realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on the road of socialism
with Chinese characteristics, generations of Chinese communists need to lead the people to continue
to struggle.
