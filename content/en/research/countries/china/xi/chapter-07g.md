Section 4: Persist in using scientific methods to promote reform and opening up

For a country and a nation, reform and opening up is a profound social change and a complex system
project, and we must adhere to scientific methods. Looking around the world, some countries have
fallen into civil war and turmoil due to poor decision-making and improper methods on the issue of
reform and opening up, and there are many examples of people living in poverty and national
division. A very important reason for the success of China's reform and opening up is that it has
adhered to the world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and historical materialism,
and accurately grasped the internal laws of reform and opening up. Both positive and negative
experiences show that reform and opening up do not necessarily bring success; Successful reform
and opening up must adhere to scientific methods. Whether it is summing up the historical
experience of reform and opening up for more than 40 years or deploying a new era to
comprehensively deepen reform, Comrade Xi Jinping attaches great importance to and repeatedly
emphasizes the importance of adhering to scientific methods.

1. Persist in combining strengthening the party's leadership with respecting the people's initiative

The party's leadership is the key and fundamental to the success of reform and opening up. It is
precisely by always adhering to the party's centralized and unified leadership that we can achieve a
great historical turning point and open a new period of reform and opening up. In the process of
reform and opening up for more than 40 years, the Party has adhered to the correct direction of
reform, maintained the determination of reform, and ensured that no subversive mistakes occurred
on fundamental issues; the Party proceeded from the overall situation, carefully deployed reform
tasks, and accurately promoted opening up. Let reform and opening up promote and complement
each other, and inject strong impetus into China's economic and social development; the Party
focuses on the prominent contradictions and problems facing development, conducts in-depth
investigation and research, and encourages bold exploration at the grassroots level. Adhere to the
connection between reform decision-making and legislative decision-making, and continuously
improve the scientific nature of reform decision-making, so as to promote the continuous success of
reform and opening up. Looking at the present, comprehensively deepening reform in the new era
is a complex system project, and the correlation and coupling requirements between various reform
measures are very high, and it is necessary to gather forces from all aspects and levels in order to
advance as a whole. Moreover, every step of reform and opening up is not easy, and the future will
inevitably face such risks and challenges, and even unimaginable stormy waves. To continue to
promote the comprehensive deepening of reform, we must give full play to the party's role as the
core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all parties, continuously
improve the party's ability and determination to set the direction, seek the overall situation,
formulate policies, and promote reform, and ensure that the ship of reform and opening up always
moves forward along the correct course and breaks the waves.

Reform and opening up is the cause of hundreds of millions of people, and there is endless wisdom
among the masses of the people. Every breakthrough and development in the understanding and
practice of reform and opening up, the emergence and development of every new thing in reform
and opening up, and the creation and accumulation of experience in every aspect of reform and
opening up all come from the practice and wisdom of hundreds of millions of people. To
comprehensively deepen reform and opening up in the new era, we must still closely rely on the
people, attach importance to giving play to the initiative of localities, grassroots units and the masses,
give full play to the subjective initiative of the masses, and gather majestic people's hearts and
people's strength for reform and opening up.

The party's leadership provides a strong political guarantee and a correct direction for reform and
opening up, and the people's initiative provides a steady stream of wisdom and strength for reform
and opening up. In the whole process of reform and opening up, we must always pay attention to
combining upholding the party's leadership with respecting the people's initiative. As Comrade Xi
Jinping pointed out:

"Sum up the fresh experience created by the masses in a timely manner, fully mobilize the
enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the masses to promote reform, pool the wisdom and strength
of the broadest masses of the people on reform, and work with the people to push reform forward."1

2. adhere to the combination of "crossing the river by feeling the stones" and the top-level design

"Crossing the river by feeling the stones" is a reform method rich in Chinese wisdom and in line
with China's national conditions, and it is also a scientific method that conforms to Marxist
epistemology and practical theory. "Crossing the river by feeling the stones" means feeling the law
and the law of reform and opening up. To carry out reform and opening up and develop the socialist
market economy, the ancestors did not talk about it, and other socialist countries did not do it, but
we can only gain true knowledge from practice through repeated exploration through practice,
understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding. China's reform and opening up has come about in
this way, which is a process of continuous accumulation of experiments, then summing up, and then
popularization, and a process of continuous deepening from rural to urban, from coastal to inland,
and from part to whole. This kind of gradual reform has avoided social unrest caused by unclear
circumstances and improper measures, and has provided a guarantee for steadily advancing reform
and smoothly achieving its goals. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Crossing the river by feeling
the stones is in line with the process of people's understanding of objective laws and the dialectic of
things changing from quantity to quality." It cannot be said that in the early days of reform and
opening up, we had to cross the river by feeling the stones, and now we cannot mention crossing the
river by feeling the stones. "2 To comprehensively deepen reform and open up, we also need to cross
the river by feeling the stones. "Of course, there are rules for crossing the river by feeling the stones,
and it is necessary to do it according to the laws that have been recognized, and then deepen the
understanding of the laws in practice, rather than stepping on the watermelon skin and sliding where
it counts."3

Reform and opening up has entered a period of tackling tough problems and deep waters, and has
reached the stage of gnawing hard bones, the relevance and interaction have been significantly
enhanced, and it is difficult to rely only on reforms in a single field and a single level to be effective,
we must strengthen top-level design and overall planning, make overall design for the economic
system, political system, cultural system, social system, ecological civilization system, etc.,
strengthen the study and judgment of the correlation of various reforms, and strive to achieve overall
and local coordination, the combination of root cause and symptom treatment, and gradual and
breakthrough promotion.

"Crossing the river by feeling the stones" and top-level design are both important methods to
promote reform and opening up, and the dialectical unity between the two. Promoting partial phased
reform and opening up should be carried out on the premise of strengthening the top-level design,
and strengthening the top-level design should be planned on the basis of partial phased reform and
opening up. It is necessary to strengthen macro-control and top-level design, pay more attention to
the systematic, holistic and coordinated nature of reform, and continue to encourage bold
experimentation and breakthroughs, and constantly deepen reform and opening up.

3. adhere to the unity of problem-oriented and goal-oriented

The CPC's efforts in revolution, construction, and reform have always been aimed at solving China's
practical problems. Reform and opening up is caused by the reversal of problems, and it has been
deepened in the continuous solution of problems. In the process of deploying and promoting reform
and opening up, the Party Central Committee has always upheld a strong sense of problems, whether
it is formulating plans, or deploying to promote and supervise implementation, and has taken
practical solutions to problems as the goal. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We must have a strong
sense of problems, be guided by major issues, grasp key issues for further research and thinking,
and focus on promoting the resolution of a series of prominent contradictions and problems facing
our country's development."1 Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, the Party has led the
people of the whole country to work as one, open roads in every mountain, build bridges when
encountering water, and constantly solve problems in the process of advancing. Old problems are
solved, and new problems arise. We must carry forward the spirit of struggle, dare to face problems
head-on, improve our ruling skills, be good at solving problems, and promote the continuous
advancement of reform and opening up.

Adhering to goal orientation is an important method to promote reform and opening up, and it is
also an important experience of the Communist Party of China in leading reform and opening up.
Scientific and reasonable goals guide the direction of efforts and provide spiritual inspiration. On
the basis of the "four modernizations" put forward by the party in the fifties and sixties of the 20th
century, in the 80s it proposed to achieve moderate prosperity and "build a prosperous, strong,
democratic, and civilized modern socialist country," and in the 90s it proposed "two hundred years."
In the new century, the goal of struggle is to "build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round
way," "build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way," and build a prosperous, strong,
democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful modern socialist country. Realize new goals such
as the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

These beautiful goals inspire the Chinese people to unite and firmly march towards a better life,
injecting strong spiritual power into reform and opening up.
Looking back at the process of reform and opening up, we can find that the goal is a concentrated
embodiment of the problem, and the problem should be solved in the process of accomplishing the
goal. The process of solving problems is the process of achieving goals, and the process of achieving
goals is also the process of solving problems, and the two are unified in the great practice of reform
and opening up. After arduous exploration in the early stage of reform and opening up, the party
overcame the old concept of opposing the market and planning in the reform and opening up, and
clarified the economic reform goal of establishing a socialist market economic system, which is a
model for adhering to the unity of goal orientation and problem orientation in reform and opening
up. In comprehensively deepening reform and opening up in the new era, it is all the more necessary
to unify goal-oriented and problem-oriented enemies, and achieve the set goals in the process of
solving problems.
