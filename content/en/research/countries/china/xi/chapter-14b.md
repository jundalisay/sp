2. Build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation

Building a community with a shared future for mankind and building a world of lasting peace,
universal security, common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty is a
historical process, which cannot be achieved overnight and smooth sailing, and it is necessary to
advance along the basic path of promoting the construction of a new type of international relations
featuring mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation. The essence of building a
new type of international relations is to embark on a new path of state-to-state exchanges based on
dialogue rather than confrontation and partnership rather than alliance, so as to open up the way and
accumulate conditions for building a community with a shared future for mankind.

As early as March 2013, in a speech at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, Comrade
Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that in the face of the objective requirement that all countries in the
world work together in the same boat, "to keep up with the pace of the times, we cannot enter the
21st century physically, and our heads are still stuck in the past, in the old era of colonial expansion,
in the Cold War mentality, and in the Cold War mentality." Inside the old box of zero-sum games.
"All countries should jointly promote the establishment of a new type of international relations with
win-win cooperation as the core, and the people of all countries should work together to safeguard
world peace and promote common development."1 To this end, it is necessary to go beyond those
ideas and principles in traditional international relations that do not adapt to the trend of the times
and should also be abandoned, such as the law of the jungle, the law of the jungle, you die and I live,
you lose and I win, zero-sum game, etc.; It is also necessary to inherit a series of universally
recognized principles and spirits accumulated in the evolution of international relations in modern
times, including the principles of equality and sovereignty established by the Peace of Westphalia
more than 370 years ago, the spirit of international humanism established by the Geneva
Conventions more than 150 years ago, the four major purposes and seven principles clearly defined
in the Charter of the United Nations more than 70 years ago, and the Bandung Conference more
than 60 years ago, "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence", etc.;

It is all the more necessary to actively advocate and firmly practice the principle of mutual respect
among all countries in the inheritance, jointly pursue fairness and justice in international relations
and international order, and work together for mutual benefit and win-win results.
Mutual respect is a prerequisite. All countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal
members of the international community and have the right to participate in international affairs on
an equal footing. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries brook no infringement,
interference in the internal affairs of all countries, respect for the social system and development
path independently chosen by the people of all countries, and respect for the core interests and major
concerns of all countries. It is necessary to oppose the use of illegal means to subvert the legitimate
regimes of other countries out of one's own interests or one's own opinions. These are the last truths
that must not be discarded at any time and should not be shaken at any time.

Fairness and justice are the norm. "The journey of the avenue is also the world's public. "Fairness
and justice are the lofty goals pursued by the peoples of the world in the field of international
relations. All countries should jointly promote the democratization of international relations, so that
the people of all countries can jointly control the destiny of the world and jointly discuss and handle
the affairs of the world. Jointly promote the rule of law in international relations, ensure that all
parties abide by international law and the universally recognized basic principles of international
relations, use uniformly applicable rules to clarify right and wrong, promote peace and seek
development, and refrain from double standards and distortions of international law and oppose the
use of "rule of law.‚Äù In the name of infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of other countries
and undermining peace and stability, we will promote the rationalization of international relations,
adapt the reform of the global governance system to the new changes in the international balance of
power, reflect the concerns and demands of all parties, and better safeguard the legitimate rights and
interests of the vast number of developing countries.
Win-win cooperation is the goal. "Harmony is strong, solitude is weak. "Win-win cooperation is a
universally applicable principle, not only applicable to the economic field, but also to politics,
security, culture and other fields, and should become the basic policy orientation of all countries in
handling international affairs." All countries should combine their national interests with common
interests, strive to expand the convergence of common interests of all parties, and should not build
a stage here and tear it down there, but should complement each other and play a good show. All
countries should actively establish a new concept of win-win, multi-win and win-win, and abandon
the old thinking that you lose and I win, and the winner takes all. "The beauty of each is the beauty
of the beauty, the beauty of the beauty, the beauty of the world." "All countries should adhere to the
principle of working together in the same boat, sharing rights and responsibilities, working together
to address the increasing number of global issues such as climate change, energy resource security,
cyber security, and major natural disasters, and jointly protect the earth home on which human
beings depend."
