3. The Party is the decider of major decisions

As the highest political leading force, it is very important for the Communist Party of China to make
decisions on major issues of the Party and the country. Without decision-making power, the so-
called leadership is an empty phrase. Along the way, the Communist Party of China has continuously
moved from victory to victory, and every step is inseparable from scientific and effective decision-
making, careful planning and effective implementation. Being good at grasping problems, thinking
of methods, and making decisions is a concentrated embodiment of the party's leadership level and
ruling ability.

The Chinese Communist Party uses scientific and democratic methods to make decisions. Formulate
lines, principles, policies, and make major policy decisions and arrangements, extensively solicit
the opinions and suggestions of the broad masses of the people, democratic parties and personages
without party affiliation, party-member cadres, experts, and scholars, and finally transform the
party's propositions into the will of the state through scientific demonstration and democratic
centralization. In decision-making,

The party has always adhered to the people-centered value concept and political stance, grasped the
most direct and practical interests of the masses, and formulated effective policies and measures.
The party formulates policies, adheres to the attitude of seeking truth from facts, scientifically
carries out investigation and research, persists in coming from the masses to the masses, and
analyzes specific problems in detail, so that policy decisions, programs and measures conform to
the spirit of the central authorities and local realities, meet the needs of the people and are feasible.
The Communist Party of China not only makes scientific decisions, but also pays attention to the
implementation of decisions. The Communist Party of China is a big party, China is a big country,
and to govern a big country, a big party first needs an authoritative party central committee that can
observe problems from the perspective of the overall situation and be able to make decisions "with
one hammer and the final word"; moreover, once the party Central Committee makes policy
decisions and arrangements, all party departments must resolutely implement them; the party
organizations of the people's congresses, governments, CPPCC, supervision commissions, courts,
and procuratorates must resolutely implement them; and party organizations such as public
institutions and people's organizations must also resolutely implement them.

4. the Party is the leader in social governance

Social governance is inseparable from a certain organizational form. The organizational form of the
Communist Party of China not only promotes the orderly governance of society, but also ensures
that society is full of vitality. First, the political function of the Chinese Communist Party provides
direction for social governance. The first attribute of the party is the political attribute, and the first
function is the political function. Political functions are embodied in political stance, political
direction, political road and other aspects, and the political function of the party can provide
direction, standards and values for social governance, and enhance the cohesion and sense of
direction of social governance. Second, the Communist Party of China promotes the effective
operation of society with the service function of the party. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed
out: "What is leadership? Leadership is serving the people.‚Äù 1 Adhering to the mass line is the
fundamental method by which the Party leads the masses of the people. By serving the masses of
the people, solving the problems of their interests, the Party promotes the effective operation of
society. Finally, the Communist Party of China ensures harmonious and orderly social governance
with a strong organizational system. The party adheres to the principle that "where there are masses,
there is party organization, and where there are party members, there is party work", and vigorously
promotes the coverage of party organizations and party work. Over the past 40 years of reform and
opening up, China has been one of the countries with the most profound social transformation in the
world, facing domestic and foreign contradictions and risks rarely seen in the world

However, Chinese society has always maintained overall stability, which is inseparable from the
strong organizational ability and excellent governance ability of the Communist Party of China.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has closely focused on the social governance theme of co-
construction, co-governance and sharing, continuously improved the social governance system and
mechanism, established a social governance system under the leadership of the Party committee,
the responsibility of the government, social coordination, public participation, and the guarantee of
the rule of law, and continuously improved the socialization, rule of law, intelligence and
professionalism of social governance. For example, strengthen the construction of mechanisms for
preventing and resolving social contradictions, correctly handle contradictions among the people;
comprehensively improve the level and coverage of public services, continuously meet the people's
growing needs for a better life, and let the people have more sense of happiness, attainment, and
security; strengthen the construction of community governance systems, promote the focus of social
governance to shift down to the grassroots level, give play to the role of social organizations, and
realize benign interaction between government governance and social regulation and residents'
autonomy. In the practice of party leadership in social governance, leading grassroots social
governance with party building has become the consensus of Chinese society and a successful
experience of Chinese social governance.
