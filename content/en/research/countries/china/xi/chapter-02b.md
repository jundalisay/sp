This theoretical system is rooted in reform opening up and socialist modernization, conforms to the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, conforms to the development trend of today's world and contemporary China, and has a distinct scientific, people's
nature, practical and open nature. 

In contemporary China, adhering to Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is truly adhering to Marxism.
Strengthening institutional self-confidence is because the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics is an advanced system with distinctive Chinese characteristics, obvious institutional
advantages and strong self-improvement ability. The socialist system with Chinese characteristics
includes a series of fundamental systems, including the fundamental system of upholding the party's
centralized and unified leadership and comprehensive leadership, the fundamental system of the
people's congress system, the fundamental system of upholding the guiding position of Marxism in
the ideological field, and the fundamental system of upholding the party's absolute leadership over
the people's army; the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, the system of
grassroots mass autonomy, the public ownership as the mainstay, the common development of
various ownership systems, and distribution according to work as the mainstay.

A variety of
distribution methods coexist, a series of basic systems such as the socialist market economic system,
and important systems such as legal rule of law, administrative management, cultural construction,
people's livelihood security, social governance, ecological civilization, "one country, two systems",
foreign affairs, party and state supervision, etc. This complete set of systems and governance
systems is guided by Marxism, rooted in the Chinese land, has a profound Chinese cultural
foundation, and is deeply supported by the people, a system and governance system with strong
vitality and great superiority, and a system and governance system that can promote the progress
and development of a country with a population of 1.4 billion and ensure that the Chinese nation,
which has a civilization history of more than 5,000 years, can achieve the "two centenary goals" and
then achieve great rejuvenation. Of course, with the continuous development of the cause of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must also continue to promote institutional innovation to
ensure that by the 100th anniversary of the founding of our party, obvious results will be achieved
in making all aspects of the system more mature and more stereotyped; by 2035, all aspects of the
system will be more perfect, and the national governance system and governance capacity will be
basically modernized; by the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the national
governance system and governance capacity will be fully modernized, so that the socialist system
with Chinese characteristics will be more consolidated and its superiority will be fully displayed.
Strengthening cultural self-confidence is because socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is
based on the excellent traditional Chinese culture, guided by Marxism, with socialist core values as
the soul, and advanced socialist culture as the main content and essential characteristics, which is
the fundamental spiritual driving force for enhancing China's self-confidence and realizing the "two
centenary goals.”

To strengthen cultural self-confidence is to have a high degree of cultural identification with
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Cultural self-confidence
is a more basic, broader and deeper self-confidence." 1 Only by strengthening cultural self-
confidence can we make the road, theory, and system more firm. We should run cultural self-
confidence through the whole process of road expansion, theoretical development and institutional
improvement, and give full play to the soulful guiding and promoting role of socialist culture with
Chinese characteristics in the practice of socialist construction with Chinese characteristics.

3. Constantly write a new chapter in socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era

Socialism with Chinese characteristics is a pioneering cause and a historical process that is
constantly advancing. The Chinese Communists, mainly represented by Comrade Xi Jinping, have
promoted historic achievements and changes in the cause of the Party and the country with great
political courage and strong responsibility, so that China's development will stand at a new historical
starting point. China's economy has sustained and stable growth, the economic structure has been
gradually optimized and upgraded; the coordination of development has been continuously
enhanced, the development gap between urban and rural areas and between regions has gradually
narrowed; the people's living standards and quality of life have been significantly improved, and the
people's sense of gain has been increasing; the comprehensive national strength has been
continuously enhanced, and the international influence has been significantly enhanced. Socialism
with Chinese characteristics has shown more and more beautiful development prospects, which has
not only won unprecedented international status and influence for China, but also won
unprecedented dignity and self-confidence for the Chinese people. This is an important embodiment
of writing a new chapter of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and it is also a
firm foundation for striving for good governance and forging ahead into the future.
Practice is unfolding at a new stage of development, and theoretical innovation must inevitably be
elevated to a new level. In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core focuses on the theme of adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics, has a profound insight into the trend of the times with the
strategic thinking of Marxist politicians, answers the new issues facing the development of the times
and practice with superb political wisdom and a high degree of theoretical consciousness, puts
forward a series of innovative new concepts, ideas and strategies, and creates Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, which provides us with guiding ideology
and a program of action for understanding and solving new contradictions and problems in practice.

Adhering to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a
New Era is an inevitable requirement for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and also an inevitable requirement for writing a new chapter of socialism with
Chinese characteristics.

Socialism with Chinese characteristics is still in practice. Whether it is now or in the future, there
are many new questions that need to be explored and answered, requiring us to make unremitting
efforts in "keeping the right and making new things.” Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Our
understanding of socialism and our grasp of the law of socialism with Chinese characteristics have
reached an unprecedented new height, which is beyond doubt. At the same time, we must also realize
that socialism in our country is still in its initial stage, we are still facing many problems that have
not yet been clarified and difficult problems to be solved, and there is no doubt that our
understanding and handling of many major issues are still in the process of deepening." 1 We must
think about and grasp a series of major issues facing the country's future development with a broader
vision and a longer-term perspective, improve our ability of strategic thinking, more accurately
grasp the changing characteristics of the initial stage of socialism in our country, continuously
enhance the principled, systematic, foreseeable and creative nature of our work, improve the
development strategy and various policies, do a good job in reform, development and stability, and
push forward socialism with Chinese characteristics with a new mental state and fighting attitude.

Characteristics in the New Era

kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics to adhere to and develop; the "Fourteen Persistences"
is the program of action for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in
the new era, focusing on answering how to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese
