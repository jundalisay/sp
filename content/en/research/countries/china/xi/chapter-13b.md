2. Deeply grasp the overall concept of national security

On April 15, 2014, at the first plenary meeting of the Central National Security Commission,
Comrade Xi Jinping put forward for the first time the major strategic thinking of the overall national
security concept, emphasizing that the overall national security concept should be adhered to and
the road of national security with Chinese characteristics should be followed. "Adhering to the
overall concept of national security" was also written into the report of the 19th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China as the basic strategy for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era, and was written into the revised Constitution of the
Communist Party of China. This is the first time in the history of the Communist Party of China that
the theory of national security has been included in the report of the party congress, and it is also
the first time that the theory of national security has been taken as an important part of the party's
guiding ideology. Adhering to the overall national security concept is not only an important part of
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, but also a practical
requirement for implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a
New Era.

The philosophical implications of the overall view of national security. The overall is a concept,
emphasizing the comprehensive and systematic nature of national security.

The overall emphasis is on "general security", which includes traditional security such as political,
territorial and military, as well as non-traditional security such as economy, culture, society, network
and ecology; includes both the current security field and new fields such as space, deep sea, polar
and biological fields; and includes both physical and human security. In addition, the overall
emphasis is on comprehensiveness rather than comprehensiveness, and security issues must not be
generalized, and security boundaries must be grasped well. It is not feasible to talk about security
without basic national conditions, security without the international environment, and security
without development.

The overall is a state that emphasizes the relativity and sustainability of national security. Safety is
relative, risk factors are always present, there is no absolute security. Overall security emphasizes
maintaining a state of relative freedom from danger and internal and external threats. It is necessary
to base ourselves on the present and the long term; we must base ourselves on the dynamic
perception and dynamic assessment of the situation, and on the foresight of the medium- and long-
term development trend; we must have a goal-oriented general idea, general framework, and general
layout, and be good at adjusting the strategy and tactics of national security in a timely manner
according to the new situation, new problems, and new tasks.
The overall is a methodology, emphasizing the scientific integration of national security. The overall
goal is to build a national security system that integrates security in various fields and properly
respond to various complex security challenges. In seeking overall national security, it is necessary
to advance as a whole while highlighting key points; stress both principles and strategies; stress both
needs and capabilities; and stress both safeguarding and reshaping. In particular, we must always
grasp national security in the overall situation of the party and the country, fully mobilize the
enthusiasm of all parties in all fields, perform their respective duties and work together, so as to
unite a strong joint force.

The connotation and extension of the overall national security concept. The summary of the
connotation and extension of national security in the overall national security concept can be
summarized into five major elements and five pairs of relationships.
The five major elements are to take people's security as the purpose, political security as the
foundation, economic security as the foundation, military, cultural and social security as the
guarantee, and international security as the basis. Taking people's security as the purpose is to always
put people's security in the highest position, adhere to the people-oriented and people-oriented,
adhere to national security for the people and rely on the people, and consolidate the mass foundation
of national security. Taking political security as the foundation means unswervingly adhering to the
party's leadership and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, putting institutional security
and regime security in the first place, and providing political guarantees for national security. Basing
on economic security is to ensure that the country's economic development is not encroached upon,
promote sustained, healthy and stable economic development, improve the country's economic
strength, and provide a material basis for national security.

Taking military, cultural and social security as the guarantee means paying attention to the new
situations and problems facing these fields, following the security laws in different fields,
establishing countermeasures to consolidate the foundation and turn dangers into disasters, and
providing hard and soft power guarantees for safeguarding national security. Relying on promoting
international security means unswervingly following the path of peaceful development, paying
attention to safeguarding national interests, while paying attention to safeguarding common security
and building a community with a shared future. These five aspects jointly support the overall
structure of the national security system and determine the basic orientation of the national security
path with Chinese characteristics.

The five-pair relationship is to attach importance to both external and internal security, emphasizing
the interconnection and mutual influence of external security and internal security; attaching
importance to both homeland security and national security, and emphasizing the organic unity of
homeland security and national security; attaching importance to both traditional and non-traditional
security, emphasizing that traditional security threats and non-traditional security threats affect each
other and may be transformed into each other under certain conditions; and attaching importance to
development issues. It also attaches importance to security issues, emphasizing that development
and security are two sides of the same coin, that development is the foundation of security, and that
security is the condition for development, so that a rich country can strengthen its troops and defend
its country; it attaches importance to both its own security and common security, and stresses that
the security of China and the world in the context of globalization are inseparable.
In short, national security is an inseparable security system, each element has its own focus, and
each element is interrelated and affects each other. The five major elements and the five pairs of
relationships accurately reflect the internal logic of China's national security, accurately reflect the
dialectical, comprehensive and systematic concept of national security, and profoundly reveal the
principle requirements and rich connotations of the overall national security concept. The overall
concept of national security is the concentrated application and latest embodiment of Marxist
positions and views and methods in the field of national security, which is both epistemological and
methodological, embodies a high degree of unity between people's security, political security, and
the supremacy of national interests, embodies a high degree of unity in historical thinking, world
vision and the spirit of the times, and embodies a high degree of unity in theory, practice, and system.

3. Safeguard and shape national security with Chinese characteristics
National security with Chinese characteristics should be both safeguarded and shaped, and shaping
is a higher-level and more forward-looking safeguard.

It is necessary to strengthen follow-up, study, and judgment of the national security situation, strive
to grasp the law in the changing situation, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages in chaos, and
strive for the initiative in struggle. It is necessary to strengthen strategic planning, persist in planning
the layout with global thinking, and shape an overall favorable national security strategic situation.
Uphold the party's absolute leadership over national security work. This is the fundamental principle
for doing a good job in national security work and the fundamental guarantee for safeguarding
national security and social stability. "Absolute" means unconditional and without dead ends, that
is, at any time and under any circumstances, take the party's banner as the banner, the party's
direction as the direction, and the party's will as the will, strengthen the "four consciousness",
strengthen the "four self-confidence", and achieve "two safeguards.‚Äù Adhere to the party's overall
control of the overall situation, coordinate all parties, resolutely safeguard the centralized, unified,

strategic deployment of national security. Give full play to the role of the Central National Security
Commission in coordinating national security affairs, do a good job in implementing national
security principles and policies, improve the national security work mechanism, and focus on
improving the party's strategic ability to grasp the star situation and plan for development.
Conscientiously implementing the national security responsibility system is an important
institutional guarantee for strengthening the party's leadership over national security work. Party
committees (leading party groups) at all levels are the main body responsible for safeguarding
national security, and should follow the decisions and arrangements of the Central National Security
Commission, properly manage national security affairs in their respective regions and departments,
lawfully exercise the functions and powers entrusted by national security laws and regulations, and
ensure that they have a responsibility to defend the land and fulfill their responsibilities.
Complete and improve the national security system. It is necessary to improve national security
strategies and policies, improve national security systems and mechanisms, strengthen the
organization and coordination of national security work, and establish and improve cross-
departmental and cross-regional joint work mechanisms. Improve the national security system, raise
the level of national security rule of law, and make full use of legal means to preserve national
security. On the basis of implementing the National Security Law and promulgating and
implementing national security laws and regulations such as the Counter-espionage Law, the
Counter-Terrorism Law, the Foreign NGO Domestic Activities Management Law, the
Cybersecurity Law, and the Nuclear Security Law, accelerate the formation of a set of national
security legal systems with Chinese characteristics that are based on the basic national conditions,
reflect the characteristics of the times, adapt to the strategic security environment, have coordinated
content, strict procedures, complete supporting facilities, and effective operation.
Safeguard national security in key areas. The key areas are the main position and the main battlefield
for safeguarding national security. It is necessary to give prominence to security work in various
aspects, such as political security, economic security, homeland security, social security, network
security, biological security, and the security of overseas interests.

Persist in ensuring political security as the first priority, firmly hold the soul of political security,
tighten the string of political security at all times, and promote national security work in key areas
with political security as the guide; persist in administering the party strictly in an all-round way,
firmly grasp the leadership, management and discourse power of ideological work, strictly guard
against and resist "color revolutions", and ensure the safety of the party's governance; adhere to the
basic economic system of socialism with Chinese characteristics without wavering, fight the battle

construction of border, coastal and air defense, crack down in depth on the "three forces", resolutely
guard against "Xinjiang independence" and "Tibet independence", resolutely thwart any form of
separatist attempts for "Taiwan independence", safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
and Macao, and build a solid wall of homeland security; improve the three-dimensional social
security prevention and control system, severely crack down on violent terrorist forces, properly
respond to major natural disasters and emergencies, and vigorously promote the construction of a
safe China; earnestly safeguard the sovereignty and security of cyberspace, and strengthen
cyberspace governance in accordance with the law. Continuously enhance cybersecurity defense
and deterrence capabilities; incorporate biosecurity into the national security system, systematically
plan the establishment of a national biosecurity risk prevention and control and governance system,
and comprehensively improve national biosecurity governance capabilities; adhere to peaceful
development, take the path of common security, form a strong security guarantee system for
overseas interests, and truly safeguard the security of overseas interests.
Strive to prevent and resolve major risks. Adhere to the basic judgment that China's development is
still in a period of important strategic opportunities and will be for a long time, enhance the
awareness of risk prevention and control, adhere to bottom-line thinking, keep pace with the times
to understand and grasp various actual and potential major risks, guard the bottom line of no
systemic and subversive risks, and look at the worst and strive for the best results. It is necessary to
be highly vigilant against both "black swan" events and "gray rhino" incidents; it is necessary to
have the first hand in preventing risks and also have high tactics to deal with and defuse risks and
challenges; and it is necessary to fight a prepared battle to prevent and resist risks, and also to fight
a strategic initiative battle to turn dangers into opportunities and turn crises into opportunities.
Improve risk prevention and control capabilities, improve risk prevention and control mechanisms,
grasp key points, make up for shortcomings, strengths and weaknesses, strictly prevent
superimposed and upgraded risk transmission, and be good at solving complex problems, handling
complex contradictions, and controlling complex situations. Comprehensively implement the party's

of a strong joint force in the whole society to safeguard national security.
