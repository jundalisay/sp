## Section 2: The scientific connotation of socialism with Chinese characteristics entering a new era

The major political judgment of socialism with Chinese characteristics entering a new era has rich
and profound ideological connotations. In the report of the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping revealed the scientific connotation of the new era
of socialism with Chinese characteristics from five dimensions, comprehensively described the
beautiful prospects of China in the new era from the perspective of the continuity of history and
reality, the combination of goals and approaches, and the connection between domestic and
international, and clarified the direction of efforts to win new victories of socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era.


1. The new era is an era of carrying forward the past and forging ahead into the future, and continuing to win the great victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics under new historical conditions

The connotation of the new era of this dimension focuses on the historical development of socialism
with Chinese characteristics, bases itself on today's reality, plans the positioning of future
development, clarifies the historical context of the new era, and highlights the temporal and spatial
nature of the new era.

Only by not forgetting the original and absorbing foreign countries can we face the future. Socialism
with Chinese characteristics, bearing the ideals and explorations of generations of Chinese
communists, the long-cherished wishes and expectations of countless people with lofty ideals, and
embodying the struggle and sacrifice of hundreds of millions of people, is the inevitable choice of
China's social development since modern times, and is the fundamental achievement of the party
and the people in the past hundred years of struggle, creation and accumulation. China's historical
development since 1840 has proved that only socialism and no other doctrine can save China; the
historical practice of China's socialist construction proves that China cannot develop China by
following the old road of closure and rigidity; the historical lessons of the drastic changes in Eastern
Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union prove that taking the evil road of changing the
banner will inevitably bury socialism; and the latest practice since the beginning of reform and
opening up has proved that only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China. Over the
past 40 years of reform and opening up, our party has led the people to adhere to their own path and
adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has greatly stimulated the
creativity of the Chinese people, greatly liberated and developed the social productive forces, greatly
enhanced social vitality, and enabled China to develop and grow at an unprecedented speed.

In the new era, adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental
guarantee for us to open up the future. To promote the development of the cause of the party and the
country, we must persistently hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "Our generation has inherited the cause of our predecessors, carried
out today's struggle, and opened up tomorrow's road." 1 To continue to win the great victory of
socialism with Chinese characteristics under the new historical conditions, we must, as always,
closely focus on the theme of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics,
which is the party's entire theory and practice, unite and lead the people to strive to achieve the "two
centenary goals", so that socialism can show strong vitality in China.


2. the new era is an era of decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and then building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way

The connotation of the new era of this dimension, focusing on the national development goals, based
on the existing foundation of struggle, makes strategic planning for the steps of socialist
modernization, clarifies the practical path of the new era, and highlights the practical nature of the
new era.

In the early days of reform and opening up, our party made strategic arrangements for China's
socialist modernization drive and put forward a "three-step" development strategy, in which the two
goals of solving the problem of food and clothing for the people and achieving a moderately
prosperous level of living standards on the whole have been achieved ahead of schedule. On this
basis, our party has put forward the "two centenary goals." Focusing on the realization of the "two
centenary goals", the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China made strategic
arrangements for economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social
construction, ecological civilization construction and party building, which are highly strategic,
forward-looking and targeted.

Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by 2020 is a solemn commitment
made by the Communist Party of China to the people and to history. According to the actual
completion of various indicators of economic and social development, we are fully confident that
we will build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by 2020 and achieve the first
centenary goal as scheduled. From the 19th CPC National Congress to the 20th CPC National
Congress, it is a period of historical convergence of the "two centenary goals." We must not only
build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and achieve the first centenary goal, but
also take advantage of the situation to start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in
an all-round way. Building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way is the goal
of the second centenary struggle. From the perspective of world development history, most of the
countries and regions that have achieved modernization have experienced nearly 300 years since
the industrial revolution to gradually complete, and China will take 100 years to complete the
modernization process that developed countries have gone through for hundreds of years, which is
not only extraordinary in speed and scale, but also extraordinary in the breadth, depth and difficulty
of change.

Comprehensively analyzing the international and domestic situations and China's development
conditions, the 19th CPC National Congress clearly made a new strategic arrangement of "two
steps," that is, basically realizing socialist modernization by 2035 and building China into a
prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful modern socialist power by the
middle of this century.

Compared with the requirements of the third step in the original "three-step" strategy, the "two-step"
strategic arrangement has a fuller connotation, more comprehensive content and more ambitious
goals. What we want to achieve is not modernization in the ordinary sense, but to build a prosperous,
strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist power. Comrade Deng
Xiaoping once said, "In the end, convincing those who do not believe in socialism depends on our
development." If we reach the level of moderate prosperity within this century, we will be able to
sober them up a little; by the middle of the next century when we build a moderately developed
socialist country, we will be able to convince them further."1 Comrade Xi Jinping further pointed
out: "Big does not equal strong, and weight does not equal strong.‚Äù2 If you are strong in all aspects,
you are a strong country. The new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics is essentially an era
that highlights the superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics and an era in which China
becomes stronger.
