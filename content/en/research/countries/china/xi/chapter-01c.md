## Section 2: The scientific connotation of socialism with Chinese characteristics entering a new era

The major political judgment of socialism with Chinese characteristics entering a new era has rich
and profound ideological connotations. In the report of the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping revealed the scientific connotation of the new era
of socialism with Chinese characteristics from five dimensions, comprehensively described the
beautiful prospects of China in the new era from the perspective of the continuity of history and
reality, the combination of goals and approaches, and the connection between domestic and
international, and clarified the direction of efforts to win new victories of socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era.


1. The new era is an era of carrying forward the past and forging ahead into the future, and continuing to win the great victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics under new historical conditions

The connotation of the new era of this dimension focuses on the historical development of socialism
with Chinese characteristics, bases itself on today's reality, plans the positioning of future
development, clarifies the historical context of the new era, and highlights the temporal and spatial
nature of the new era.

Only by not forgetting the original and absorbing foreign countries can we face the future. Socialism
with Chinese characteristics, bearing the ideals and explorations of generations of Chinese
communists, the long-cherished wishes and expectations of countless people with lofty ideals, and
embodying the struggle and sacrifice of hundreds of millions of people, is the inevitable choice of
China's social development since modern times, and is the fundamental achievement of the party
and the people in the past hundred years of struggle, creation and accumulation. China's historical
development since 1840 has proved that only socialism and no other doctrine can save China; the
historical practice of China's socialist construction proves that China cannot develop China by
following the old road of closure and rigidity; the historical lessons of the drastic changes in Eastern
Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union prove that taking the evil road of changing the
banner will inevitably bury socialism; and the latest practice since the beginning of reform and
opening up has proved that only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China. Over the
past 40 years of reform and opening up, our party has led the people to adhere to their own path and
adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has greatly stimulated the
creativity of the Chinese people, greatly liberated and developed the social productive forces, greatly
enhanced social vitality, and enabled China to develop and grow at an unprecedented speed.
In the new era, adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is the fundamental
guarantee for us to open up the future. To promote the development of the cause of the party and the
country, we must persistently hold high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "Our generation has inherited the cause of our predecessors, carried
out today's struggle, and opened up tomorrow's road." 1 To continue to win the great victory of
socialism with Chinese characteristics under the new historical conditions, we must, as always,
closely focus on the theme of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics,
which is the party's entire theory and practice, unite and lead the people to strive to achieve the "two
centenary goals", so that socialism can show strong vitality in China.


2. the new era is an era of decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and then building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way

The connotation of the new era of this dimension, focusing on the national development goals, based
on the existing foundation of struggle, makes strategic planning for the steps of socialist
modernization, clarifies the practical path of the new era, and highlights the practical nature of the
new era.

In the early days of reform and opening up, our party made strategic arrangements for China's
socialist modernization drive and put forward a "three-step" development strategy, in which the two
goals of solving the problem of food and clothing for the people and achieving a moderately
prosperous level of living standards on the whole have been achieved ahead of schedule. On this
basis, our party has put forward the "two centenary goals." Focusing on the realization of the "two
centenary goals", the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China made strategic
arrangements for economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social
construction, ecological civilization construction and party building, which are highly strategic,
forward-looking and targeted.
Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by 2020 is a solemn commitment
made by the Communist Party of China to the people and to history. According to the actual
completion of various indicators of economic and social development, we are fully confident that
we will build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way by 2020 and achieve the first
centenary goal as scheduled. From the 19th CPC National Congress to the 20th CPC National
Congress, it is a period of historical convergence of the "two centenary goals." We must not only
build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and achieve the first centenary goal, but
also take advantage of the situation to start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in
an all-round way. Building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way is the goal
of the second centenary struggle. From the perspective of world development history, most of the
countries and regions that have achieved modernization have experienced nearly 300 years since
the industrial revolution to gradually complete, and China will take 100 years to complete the
modernization process that developed countries have gone through for hundreds of years, which is
not only extraordinary in speed and scale, but also extraordinary in the breadth, depth and difficulty
of change.
Comprehensively analyzing the international and domestic situations and China's development
conditions, the 19th CPC National Congress clearly made a new strategic arrangement of "two
steps," that is, basically realizing socialist modernization by 2035 and building China into a
prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful modern socialist power by the
middle of this century.

Compared with the requirements of the third step in the original "three-step" strategy, the "two-step"
strategic arrangement has a fuller connotation, more comprehensive content and more ambitious
goals. What we want to achieve is not modernization in the ordinary sense, but to build a prosperous,
strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist power. Comrade Deng
Xiaoping once said, "In the end, convincing those who do not believe in socialism depends on our
development." If we reach the level of moderate prosperity within this century, we will be able to
sober them up a little; by the middle of the next century when we build a moderately developed
socialist country, we will be able to convince them further."1 Comrade Xi Jinping further pointed
out: "Big does not equal strong, and weight does not equal strong.‚Äù2 If you are strong in all aspects,
you are a strong country. The new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics is essentially an era
that highlights the superiority of socialism with Chinese characteristics and an era in which China
becomes stronger.

3. the new era is an era in which the people of all ethnic groups in the country unite and struggle, continuously create a better life, and gradually realize the common prosperity of all the people

The connotation of the new era of this dimension, focusing on the essential requirements of
socialism, based on the direction of struggle, makes plans for the future life of the people, clarifies
the value orientation of the new era, and highlights the people's nature in the new era.
Socialism is the cause of happiness for the vast majority of people. To build socialism, the
fundamental thing is to liberate the productive forces, develop the productive forces, eliminate
exploitation, eliminate polarization, and ultimately achieve common prosperity. Since the 18th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed
that we must always take the realization, safeguarding and development of the fundamental interests
of the broadest masses of the people as the starting point and foothold of all work, and have stressed
on many occasions: "The people's yearning for a better life is our goal."3 The CPC leads the people
in revolution, construction, and reform in order to enable the people to live a good life. In the new
era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, our party regards the continuous creation of a better
life and the gradual realization of common prosperity of all the people as the goal and destination
of development, embodies the people-centered development thinking, embodies the fundamental
purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly, and embodies the essential requirements of socialism
with Chinese characteristics.


After rapid development since the reform and opening up, the living standards of our people have
improved markedly and their prosperity has continued to increase. In the new era, on the one hand,
the needs of the people are characterized by diversification, multi-level and multi-faceted
characteristics, and the people's yearning for a better life is stronger, looking forward to better
education, more stable work, more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, higher level
of medical and health services, more comfortable living conditions, a more beautiful environment,
a richer spiritual and cultural life, and so on. On the other hand, with the continuous expansion of
the "cake" of China's economic development, the problem of unfair distribution has gradually
become prominent, the gap between income and the level of public services in urban and rural areas
is large, and achieving common prosperity and promoting social fairness and justice have become
urgent requirements.

Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "Sharing the fruits of reform and development by the broad masses
of the people is the essential requirement of socialism and an important embodiment of our party's
fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly." 1 The development we pursue is
development that benefits the people, and the prosperity we pursue is the common prosperity of all
the people. In the new era, the major task of the Communist Party of China is to focus on solving
the needs and expectations of the people, pay more attention to the people's new and diversified
needs for a better life, respect the people's status as the main body, respect the people's will, the
experience they have created, and the rights they have in their practical activities. The role played
by it fully stimulates the creative power hidden in the people, regards the realization of all-round
human development as the noble realm of a better life, and better meets the people's growing needs
for a better life; pays more attention to enabling all people to share the fruits of economic, political,
cultural, social, ecological and other aspects of development, so that the people's sense of gain,
happiness and security is more perfect, more sustainable, and more sustainable. More secure; pay
more attention to social fairness and justice, unite and lead all the people, and continuously
guarantee and improve the people's livelihood with their own hard work and unremitting efforts, so
that the results of reform and development can benefit all the people more equitably, so that all the
people can enjoy a happier and healthier life, and continue to make real new progress in realizing
common prosperity for all the people.

4. the new era is an era in which all the sons and daughters of China work together to realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation

The connotation of this dimension of the new era, focusing on the historical mission of the
communists, based on unity and struggle, expounds the development vision of the Chinese nation,
clarifies the national characteristics of the new era, and highlights the national nature of the new era.
Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation in
modern times, and it embodies the long-cherished wish of several generations of Chinese. Once
founded, the Communist Party of China has no hesitation in shouldering the historical mission of
realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The founding of New China laid a solid
foundation for national rejuvenation. The new great revolution of reform and opening up has
injected new strong vitality into national rejuvenation, enabled the Chinese nation to gradually
realize the great leap from standing up to becoming rich, and laid the basic conditions for becoming
strong. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, China, the world's largest developing
country, has created an earth-shaking development miracle in the history of human social
development, and the Chinese nation has radiated new vigor.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the strong leadership of
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, the Chinese nation has ushered
in a great process of becoming stronger, its comprehensive national strength has been greatly
enhanced, the people's living standards have been further improved, and the realization of the
Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has become the "greatest common
divisor" that inspires the sons and daughters of China at home and abroad. In the new era of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we are closer than ever before, more confident and capable
of realizing the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
He who travels a hundred miles is half ninety. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is by no
means easy and can be achieved by banging gongs and drums. To realize the great dream of the
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, the party must unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all
the enthusiasm that can be aroused, arouse all the spirit and spirit that can be aroused, concentrate
on construction, devote oneself to development, and be prepared to make even more arduous and
arduous efforts with high fighting spirit and fearless spirit. If the Chinese Communists in the new
era lead the Chinese people to continue to take the new Long March, they will certainly be able to
achieve the grand goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

5. the new era is an era in which China is moving closer to the center of the world stage and constantly making greater contributions to mankind

The connotation of the new era of this dimension, focusing on the responsibility of major countries,
based on its own development, makes a forward-looking description of China's role in the world,
clarifies China's positioning in the world in the new era, and highlights the cosmopolitan nature of
the new era.

China is the China of the world, China's development is inseparable from the world, and the
development of the world also affects China. In the profound adjustment of the international system
and international order, China plays an important role. For a long time in the past, China was not
the protagonist of the international community, and China's international influence and role were
relatively limited. After long-term efforts, especially the historic achievements made since the 18th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's role as a responsible major country
has been fully played and has become the main stabilizer and power source of world economic
growth; China actively participates in and leads global governance, and China's initiatives are
increasingly translated into international consensus and global actions, especially focusing on jointly
building the "Belt and Road", and working with all parties to build a new platform for international
cooperation, adding new impetus to the common development of the world. This series of major
achievements and measures shows that China is an important player that has attracted global
attention, greatly improved its international influence, appeal and shaping power, and has become a
leader in globalization, an important promoter of global governance system reform, and an active
advocate of a community with a shared future for mankind, and is increasingly approaching the
center of the world stage.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The Communist Party of China is a political party that seeks
happiness for the Chinese and the people, and it is also a political party that strives for the cause of
human progress. The Communist Party of China has always regarded making new and greater
contributions to mankind as its mission."1 In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics,
in the face of the deep adjustment of the international pattern and international relations, and in the
face of the external environment in which local conflicts and turbulence are frequent and mankind
needs to cope with many common challenges, we must, on the basis of practicing "internal strength",
give full play to the wisdom and talents of the Chinese people, and contribute Chinese wisdom and
provide Chinese solutions for the healthy and sustainable development of the international
community.

In the new era, China will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, pursue an open
strategy of mutual benefit and win-win results, and firmly safeguard multilateralism and the
international system with the United Nations at its core. Actively participate in the reform and
improvement of the global governance system, unswervingly safeguard an open world economy,
and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind. Strengthen
communication, dialogue, coordination and cooperation with major powers, deepen relations with
neighboring countries, and expand mutually beneficial cooperation with developing countries.
Actively provide more constructive solutions for properly responding to global challenges and
resolving regional hotspot issues. We will work hand in hand with other countries and work together
to always be a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of
international order. Historically, China has made outstanding contributions to human civilization. In
the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, China will certainly be able to make new and
greater contributions to promoting lasting peace and common development in the world and
promoting the prosperity and progress of mankind.

Section 3: The great significance of socialism with Chinese characteristics entering a new era

The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "The entry of socialism
with Chinese characteristics into a new era means that the Chinese nation, which has suffered for a
long time in modern times, has ushered in a great leap from standing up, getting rich to becoming
strong, and ushered in the bright prospect of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation;
it means that scientific socialism has radiated strong vitality in China in the 21st century and held
high the great banner of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the world; it means that the path,
theory, system, and system of socialism with Chinese characteristics have been brought high. The
continuous development of culture has expanded the way for developing countries to modernize,
provided new choices for countries and nations in the world that want to accelerate development
while maintaining their independence, and contributed Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to
solving human problems."1 These "three meanings" profoundly expound the historical, political and
world significance of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

1. The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation ushered in bright prospects

Peoples that have created glorious things better understand the meaning of rejuvenation; nations that
have experienced hardship are more eager to realize rejuvenation. With a long history of more than
5,000 years and splendid culture, the Chinese nation has been at the forefront of the world for a long
time and has made indelible contributions to the progress of human civilization. From the end of the
Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, due to the ideological imprisonment of the
ruling class and the obstacles of the feudal social system, the Chinese nation gradually entered the
modern history of humiliation after experiencing the prosperity of the Kang Qian era. After the
Opium War, China gradually degenerated into a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society. From the
cry of the enlightenment thinkers to "master and destroy with great skill", to the attempts of
bourgeois reformists to restore and change the law, to the Xinhai Revolution of the bourgeois
revolutionaries to overthrow the feudal monarchy, it has not changed the miserable situation of
modern China. It was not until Marxism spread to China and the Communist Party of China entered
the historical stage that the Chinese nation truly found the backbone of seeking national
independence, the people's liberation, the country's prosperity and strength, and the people's
happiness, and that the Chinese people changed from passive to active spiritually.
The birth of the Communist Party of China was a "groundbreaking event" and a major milestone in
realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in modern times, profoundly changing the
direction and course of the development of the Chinese nation after modern times, and profoundly
changing the future and destiny of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. Just as Comrade Xi
Jinping pointed out: After the birth of the Communist Party of China, it united and led the whole
party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to complete the new democratic
revolution and socialist revolution through protracted struggle, established the People's Republic of
China, established the basic socialist system, and realized the great leap of the Chinese nation from
being the sick man of East Asia to standing up; since the reform and opening up, the Chinese
Communists have united and led the people to carry out the new great practice of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, enabling China to catch up with the times in great strides and realize
the great leap of the Chinese nation from standing up to becoming rich; since the 18th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, Chinese Communists have united and led the people in
great struggles, building great projects, advancing great causes, realizing great dreams, promoting
all-round and groundbreaking historical achievements in the cause of the party and the country, and
taking place profound and fundamental historical changes, the Chinese nation has ushered in a great
leap from prosperity to strength.1

The successive three great leaps are the "trilogy" in which the Communist Party of China has led
the people to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in modern times.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, opening a new chapter in the third
part of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and ushering in a new journey for the Chinese
nation from prosperity to strength. The new era is a fundamental leap period to realize national
rejuvenation from quantitative change to qualitative change, and a period of historical
transformation of China from a big country to a strong country. This leap is not simply the
improvement of the total amount of material wealth, but also the process of overall leap in
comprehensive strength such as economic strength, national governance ability, cultural soft power,
social development level, ecological civilization level, military and national defense strength,
scientific and technological innovation ability, international discourse power and world influence,
political party leadership ability and governance level, and it is also the decisive process of the final
realization of the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Focusing on
achieving the goal of the new era, under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, the Chinese Communists have systematically planned, made
overall layouts and all-round efforts in various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society,
ecological civilization, military national defense, motherland reunification, diplomacy and party
building, and promoted the comprehensive national strength and international influence, and the
Chinese nation has taken more solid steps on the journey of becoming stronger. By the middle of
the 21st century, China will be built into a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious
and beautiful modern socialist country in an all-round way, material, political, spiritual, social and
ecological civilizations will leap forward in an all-round way, becoming a country with leading
comprehensive national strength and international influence, and the Chinese nation will stand tall
among the nations of the world with a more lofty attitude.

2. scientific socialism has radiated strong vitality in China in the 21st century

Faced with the low tide of world socialism in the late 80s and early 90s of the 20th century, Comrade
Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "I firmly believe that there will be more people in favor of Marxism in
the world, because Marxism is a science."1 "As long as socialism in China does not fall, socialism
will always stand in the world."2 Under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China,
China, which accounts for one-fifth of the world's population, has not only adhered to and defended
the largest position of socialism in the East and retained the inextinguishable fire of socialism, but
also successfully explored a path of socialist development with Chinese characteristics by
integrating the basic tenets of Marxism with China's specific conditions.

Instead of collapsing, China's comprehensive national strength is increasing day by day, and "the
scenery is unique here." The "Chinese miracle" created by more than 40 years of reform and opening
up has revitalized socialism, which was once at a low point, and revived people's confidence in
socialism around the world.

After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping made a
systematic review of the 500-year historical development of world socialism in the "Speech at the
Seminar for New Members and Alternate Members of the Central Committee to Study and
Implement the Spirit of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China", dividing the
historical process of socialist thought from its inception to the present into six time periods: the
emergence and development of utopian socialism; Engels founded the theoretical system of
scientific socialism; Lenin led the October Revolution to victory and practiced socialism; the Soviet
model gradually took shape; the Communist Party of China explored and practiced socialism after
the founding of New China; and our party made the historic decision to carry out reform and opening
up, and created and developed socialism with Chinese characteristics. The division of these six
stages clearly defines the position of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the history of socialist
development, and also clarifies the relationship between socialism with Chinese characteristics and
scientific socialism that is consistent, consistent and advancing with the times.
In the new era, the world is undergoing major changes unprecedented in a century, China is
experiencing extremely extensive and profound social changes in history, and is also carrying out
the most grand and unique practical innovation in human history. Comrade Xi Jinping demanded
that the Chinese Communists neither follow the old road of closure and rigidity, nor take the evil
path of changing the banner, but also adhere to the basic principles of scientific socialism and give
it distinctive Chinese characteristics according to the conditions of the times, enrich and develop the
connotation of the times of socialism with Chinese characteristics from both theoretical and practical
aspects, and open up a new journey of socialism with Chinese characteristics from a big country to
a strong country. The basic principles and value pursuit of scientific socialism have been fully
demonstrated in China in the new era, and the theoretical vitality and institutional superiority of
scientific socialism have been best proved in China in the new era. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed
out: "The success of scientific socialism in China is of great significance to Marxism and scientific
socialism and to world socialism."1

At the meeting to commemorate the 200th anniversary of Marx's birth, Comrade Xi Jinping further
emphasized: "In the new era, the communists who rush to the country should still study Marx, study
and practice Marxism, constantly draw scientific wisdom and theoretical strength from it, and adhere
to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era with more determination,
confidence and wisdom in the overall layout and coordinated advancement of the five-in-one and
the four comprehensive" strategic layout, so as to ensure that the giant ship of the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation always moves forward along the correct course and breaks the waves." 1

3. socialism with Chinese characteristics has broadened the way for developing countries to move toward modernization

Generally speaking, modernization is the process of transforming from traditional agricultural
society to modern industrial society, and it is a process of achieving a leap in the development of
human civilization. The historical process of modernization began in Europe and the United States.
Therefore, relying on their own hegemony in discourse, Western countries have tried their best to
advocate the "universality" of their modernization path, and "Western-centrist" people even describe
the modernization path that began in Europe as the only successful and correct development path,
believing that modernization is equal to Westernization. Affected by this, after World War II, many
developing countries either passively or actively chose the path of Western modernization. Decades
on, however, most countries that had pinned their hopes on the Western model of modernization
have not ushered in the bright prospects they wanted. On the contrary, many countries have
developed slowly, with many difficulties, and some even have constant wars and people's
livelihoods, and even if a few countries have achieved modernization with Western assistance, they
have to sacrifice political autonomy and bury hidden dangers for long-term development. In recent
years, due to the intensification of the inherent contradictions in capitalist society, some old capitalist
countries have also suffered from development crises repeatedly, and the authority and influence of
Western modernization theory have continued to decline.
In sharp contrast, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, New China has embarked
on a development path of independently exploring socialist modernization. In 459, Comrade Mao
Zedong for the first time put forward the development goals of building socialist industrial
modernization, agricultural modernization, scientific and cultural modernization, and national
defense modernization. In 1964, Comrade Zhou Enlai followed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions
and wrote it into the "Government Work Report" of the First Session of the Third National People's
Congress.

Under the guidance of this goal, China has gradually established an independent and relatively
complete industrial system and national economic system, laying an important material foundation
for modernization. After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Comrade
Deng Xiaoping clearly put forward the idea of "Chinese-style modernization" and opened the relay
exploration of building socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics. The 13th CPC National
Congress made a "three-step" strategic arrangement for socialist modernization. The 18th CPC
National Congress further put forward the "two centenary goals." While making decisions and
arrangements for the first centenary goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round
way, the 19th CPC National Congress made two-stage strategic arrangements for the second
centenary goal, thus opening a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-round
way.
In terms of guiding ideology, the path of socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics
adheres to the guiding position of Marxism and the practice of using the developing Marxism to
guide practice, which not only adheres to the ideological and theoretical advancement with the times,
but also ensures a high degree of ideological unity between the whole party and the people of all
ethnic groups throughout the country; in the political aspect, it adheres to the path of socialist
political development with Chinese characteristics, adheres to the party's leadership, the people are
masters of their own country, and The organic unity of governing the country according to law,
centering on adhering to and improving the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,
continuously promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance
capacity; in the economic aspect, unswervingly taking development as the primary task of the party's
governance and rejuvenating the country, implementing the basic economic system with public
ownership as the main body and the common development of various ownership economies,
insisting on making the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources and giving better
play to the role of the government, and constantly building a modern economic system, ‚Ä¢ Promote
the realization of high-quality development; in terms of culture, adhere to the direction of progress
of advanced socialist culture, adhere to the position of Chinese culture, and develop a national,
scientific, and popular socialist culture oriented to modernization, the world and the future; in the
social aspect, we always put the interests of the people in the supreme position, persist in ensuring
and improving the people's livelihood in the process of development, constantly meet the people's
growing needs for a better life, and constantly promote social fairness and justice, so that the people's
sense of gain, happiness and security will be more fulfilling and more secure. More sustainable; in
terms of ecological civilization, adhere to the principle of giving priority to conservation, protection
and natural restoration, form a spatial pattern, industrial structure, production mode and lifestyle
that conserve resources and protect the environment, and strive to achieve harmonious coexistence
between man and nature. This road of modernization "is not a simple continuation of the master
version of China's history and culture, it is not a simple application of the template conceived by the
classic writers of Marxism, it is not a reprint of the socialist practice of other countries, nor is it a
copy of the modernization development abroad."

Instead, proceeding from China's reality and striving to realize comprehensive modernization, it is
the road of seeking modernization independently and self-reliantly. In particular, the path of socialist
modernization with Chinese characteristics is a path of seeking modernization through peaceful
development, which is fundamentally different from the Western modernization path of
accumulating the foundation of modernization by colonial plunder and relying on power politics to
engage in development models and value export.

The entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era indicates the historical orientation
of China's comprehensive realization of modernization, the degree of modernization will leap from
a lower level to a higher level, the scope of modernization will be from some fields and some regions
to all fields and all-round coverage, and the connotation of modernization will extend from the
material level to the spiritual level and human literacy. Achieving this goal of the times means that
the largest developing country, which surpasses the total population of the existing developed
countries, will enter the ranks of modernization, and it also means that the world's largest socialist
countries will modernize people. The success of socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics
has broken the "path dependence" of developing countries on Western modernization, and "China's
development has provided successful experience and bright prospects for the vast number of
developing countries to modernize, is a powerful force for promoting world peace and development,
and is a major contribution of the Chinese nation to the progress of human civilization.‚Äù2
Section 4: The new era is the age of strivers
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is a struggle, and adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era also requires struggle. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed, "We must
persist in taking the people's yearning for a better life as our goal, always make unremitting efforts
for the people, work together with the people, and earnestly implement the spirit of struggle in the
whole process of carrying out great struggles, building great projects, advancing great causes, and
realizing great dreams, forming a vivid situation of competing and fighting in unity."3

require long-term struggle, relay struggle, and common struggle. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "The
original aspiration and mission of the Chinese communists is to seek happiness for the Chinese
people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. This original intention and mission is the
fundamental motive force that motivates the Chinese Communists to keep advancing." 1
The original aspiration and mission of the Chinese Communists are determined by the nature of the
Party and the Party's guiding ideology. The original intention is the purpose of the original departure,
that is, why the departure, the goal to be achieved or the task to be completed. Marx and Engels
pointed out in the Communist Manifesto: "The movement of the proletariat is an independent
movement of the overwhelming majority of the people, for the interests of the overwhelming
majority of the people."2 Communists "have no interests different from those of the proletariat as a
whole."3 That is to say, the original intention and mission of Marxism and the communists under its
guidance is to seek the interests of the overwhelming majority of the people. After its founding, the
Communist Party of China took Marxism as its guiding ideology, regarded the realization of
communism as the party's highest ideal and ultimate goal, shouldered the historical mission of
realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation without hesitation, united and led the people
in an arduous struggle, and composed a magnificent epic that swallowed mountains and rivers.
As a political organization, the original mission of the Communist Party of China was to follow the
path guided by Marxism and seek the independence and prosperity of the country and the freedom
and happiness of the people. We reaffirm the original intention of the Party and the historical mission
of the Chinese Communists in the new era, that is, to enable more than 90 million Party members
to continuously gain strong primary impetus from it. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "Our party
requires all comrades in the party not to forget their original intention and remember their mission,
that is, to remind all comrades in the party that the party's original intention and mission are the
concentrated embodiment of the party's nature, purpose, ideals and beliefs, and fighting goals, and
the longer they stay in power, the more they must not lose the true colors of a Marxist political party,
the more they must not forget the party's original intention and mission, and the more they must not
lose their self-revolutionary spirit."

No matter how far we go and how great our achievements are, we must not forget the road we
came from, the history written by the Party with blood, sweat, and tears, why we set out, the goal of
achieving the prosperity and strength of the country, the rejuvenation of the people, and the lofty
ideal of communism. Whether in the revolutionary years of the blazing flames, or in the years of
vigorous construction and the period of magnificent reform, the unchanged original intention is the
spiritual code of uniting and condensing the communists to continue their struggle, and is the key
to the success of the party from victory to new victory.

In July 2013, Comrade Xi Jinping went to Xibaipo, Hebei Province to conduct research, revisit the
"two musts" and issue a call to the whole party to "catch up for the exam"; only one week after the
conclusion of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping
led the new Politburo Standing Committee members to Shanghai and Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province to
visit the site of the First Congress and the Red Boat on Nanhu, review the history of the founding
of the Party, relive the oath of the People's Party, and declare the firm political conviction of the new
leadership of the Party Central Committee. According to the arrangements of the 19th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, starting from June 2019, the theme education of "not
forgetting the original intention and remembering the mission" will be carried out in two batches
from top to bottom in the whole party, promoting the whole party to firmly grasp the general
requirements of "keeping the original intention, undertaking the mission, finding the gaps, and
grasping implementation", and strive to achieve the specific goals of gaining gains in theoretical
study, being baptized ideologically and politically, daring to take responsibility for entrepreneurship,
serving the people and solving problems, and setting an example of honesty and integrity. The
Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee proposed that we should establish a
system that does not forget our original aspiration and keep our mission firmly in mind, and regard
not forgetting our original aspiration and keeping our mission in mind as an eternal task for
strengthening party building and a lifelong task for all party members and cadres. All this is to tell
the world that the Communist Party of China will always maintain the spirit of struggle in the
revolution and always maintain its heart for the people. This fully demonstrates the firm
determination of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core to never forget
its original intention and strive forever.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Ideals and beliefs are the spiritual calcium of communists, and if
the ideals and beliefs are firm, the bones will be hard; without ideals and beliefs, or if the ideals and
beliefs are not firm, the spirit will be 'calcium deficient', and you will get: cartilage." 2 He also
emphasized:

"History and practice have repeatedly proved that if a political party has lofty ideals and lofty
pursuits, it will be strong, invincible, and invincible, and will be able to withstand setbacks again
and again and rise up again and again; if a cadre has firm ideals and convictions, he will be able to
stand tall and broad-minded, and he will be able to adhere to the correct political orientation and be
as calm as a mountain without moving through storms." 1 The ideals and beliefs of the Chinese
Communists have never been ethereal, but have always been embodied in their original aspiration
and mission of seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation.
We must adhere to the Marxist faith and the lofty ideals of communism, engrave in our hearts the
original intention of the Party and the mission of the Party, build a solid foundation of faith, replenish
the calcium of the spirit, stabilize the rudder of thinking, always breathe with the people, share a
common destiny, and link hearts with each other, always regard the people's yearning for a better
life as the goal of struggle, and continue to forge ahead courageously towards the grand goal of
realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation with an unremitting mental state and an
indomitable attitude of struggle.

2. Always maintain the spirit of having the courage to assume responsibilities and dare to struggle

The eyes are difficult and difficult, and the jade is successful. The more difficulties and
contradictions stand in the way, the more it is necessary to rely on responsibility and struggle to
overcome difficulties and keep innovation upright. Strong historical responsibility and fighting spirit
are the spiritual characteristics of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for
a New Era. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping
has taken the lead in setting an example, clearly pointing out the ruling philosophy of "serving the
people and shouldering the responsibilities that should be shouldered", clearly putting forward that
"I will live up to the people without myself", and repeatedly emphasizing that "the ministry must
have a responsibility, how much responsibility can do how much cause, how much responsibility
can make great achievements", and "push forward socialism with Chinese characteristics with a new
mental state and fighting attitude.‚Äù

Our party is a party that is born, grows and grows in the course of struggle. After nearly a century
of struggle, the spirit of struggle has long been in the bloodline of the Party and runs through all
periods of revolution, construction and reform. Today, the Chinese nation is in a crucial period of
great rejuvenation, reform and development are in an important stage of overcoming difficulties and
conquering difficulties, and the road ahead cannot be smooth. This is the time when the struggle is
most needed, and it is also the time when the responsibility is most tested. In the face of the new
mission, we must fully understand the protracted, complex, and arduous nature of the struggle, and
we must carry forward the spirit of having the courage to assume responsibilities and dare to struggle.

Only by taking the posture of opening up roads every mountain and building bridges when
encountering water, and with abundant and tenacious fighting spirit, can we cross the "snowy
mountains" and "meadows" on the new Long March, conquer the "Loushan Pass" and "Laozikou"
on the new journey, and constantly win new victories in the great struggle of the new era.
Big things are difficult to bear, and major risks especially need to be fought for. At present, the
international situation is turbulent, the surrounding environment is complex and sensitive, the tasks
of reform, development and stability are heavy, various problems are superimposed, various
contradictions are prominent, various ideologies and interests are stirring each other, and various
risks and challenges are coming one after another. In particular, it is necessary to dare to take
responsibility and fight well in preventing and resolving major risks. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed
out: "We must always maintain a high degree of vigilance, both the black swan 'incident' and the
gray rhino 'incident; we must have the first hand to prevent risks, and we must also have the high
tactics to deal with and resolve risk challenges; we must fight a prepared battle to prevent and resist
risks, and we must also fight a strategic initiative battle to turn dangers into opportunities and turn
crises into opportunities."1 We must fully understand the importance and urgency of preventing and
defusing major risks, maintain the spirit of struggle, strengthen the experience of struggle, constantly
undergo strict ideological tempering, political experience, and practical tempering, do not bow our
heads in the face of difficulties, do not shrink in the face of challenges, do not trade principles, and
constantly improve our fighting skills in the midst of strong winds and waves and in the tempering
of practice. At the same time, we should dare to show our sword in the face of major right and wrong,
dare to face difficulties in the face of contradictions, dare to stand up in the face of crises, dare to
stand up in the face of crises, and dare to resolutely struggle in the face of unhealthy tendencies and
evil tendencies, so as to "step on the bumpy road and fight against hardships and dangers again." 's
tenacious will, coping well with every major risk and challenge, and pushing forward the cause of
the party and the people without hesitation.

3. Always maintain the practical character of integrating knowledge with action and doing solid work

Struggle cannot be shouted in vain, it must be translated into action. The unity of knowledge and
action and real work are the distinctive qualities of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era. Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that "empty talk misleads
the country, practical work rejuvenates the country"; he stressed that the Communist Party of China
started and developed by seeking truth from facts, and that adhering to seeking truth from facts can
rejuvenate the party and the country, and violating the truth from facts will lead to misleading the
party and the country;

He stressed that it is necessary to persist in the persistence of the political elite, establish that success
does not have to be carried out in my thinking, and work through to the end with a blueprint, and do
not engage in things that are divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and labored and the
people and hurt money. At the opening ceremony of the 2019 spring semester training course for
young cadres at the Central Party School (National Academy of Administration), Comrade Xi
Jinping encouraged the vast number of cadres, especially young cadres, to adhere to the unity of
knowledge and action, really grasp practical work, be actors who start and do, talk about things
without sitting and talking, be strugglers who overcome difficulties, and bodhisattvas who should
not be afraid of wind and rain. These important expositions are earnest, demonstrating Comrade Xi
Jinping's political character of integrating knowledge with action and doing real work.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the reason why the party and
the country have been able to establish a new wind and open up a new situation is closely related to
Comrade Xi Jinping's efforts to integrate knowledge with action and really do solid work. As the
leader of the party and the state, Comrade Xi Jinping not only pays attention to systematic thinking
and scientific planning on internal and foreign affairs, national defense, party and military
management, world development and global governance, but also pays attention to promoting
practical innovation with theoretical innovation, testing and promoting theoretical innovation with
practical innovation, and comprehensively promoting the "four greats", so as to promote historic
achievements and changes in the development of the cause of the party and the country.

Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "Great dreams are not something that can be waited for and shouted
about, but spelled out and done." "We must show the tenacity to grasp the traces of iron and step on
stones, grasp the implementation with the spirit of nails, and ensure that all major reform measures
are implemented."1 Today, Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New
Era has become the guiding ideology of the Party and the country, and the goal and task of winning
the victory in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and then building a
modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way have been clear, and the most important
thing is "action, action, and action" and "implementation, implementation, and implementation.‚Äù It
is necessary to establish a correct outlook on undertakings and political achievements, do practical
things without seeking false prestige, seek practical results and do not do false merits, do more work
to lay a foundation and benefit the long term, let it become a common practice to bury one's head in
hard work and really grasp solid work, and strive to create achievements that can stand the test of
practice, the people, and history.
