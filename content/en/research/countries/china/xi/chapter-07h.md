4. adhere to the pilot project and promote the comprehensive promotion

Adhering to the principle of pilot projects and promoting them in an all-round way is an important
method and important experience of reform and opening up. The pilot project is to accumulate
experience and find out the rules for comprehensive promotion. Comprehensive promotion is based
on the pilot first, which is the goal pursuit and final embodiment of the pilot first. Reform and
opening up has been continuously developed in the course of promoting pilot projects to
comprehensive and local to the overall situation.
China's reform and opening up began with pilot projects. This is true of the pilot reform of state-
owned enterprises in the early stage of reform and opening up, the four special economic zones of
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen as "test fields" for opening up to the outside world, or the
establishment of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone after the 18th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China to explore new forms of trade facilitation. To promote reform and
opening up, it is not necessary to carry out pilot projects in all aspects and fields. In practice, for
reforms that must make breakthroughs but are not so sure for the time being, we adopt the method
of pilot exploration and throwing stones to ask for directions, carry out experiments first, respect
practice and creation, encourage bold exploration, dare to open up, gain experience, see it accurately,
and then push it away. For reforms that are not yet deep enough in understanding, but must be
promoted, we must boldly explore and pilot the reforms. Some reforms involve deep-seated
institutional factors and complex interest relationships, and it is difficult to push them out on the
surface for a while; it is necessary to give play to the role of scouts and advance teams in the pilot
reforms, find out the rules, build consensus, and accumulate experience and create conditions for
comprehensively pushing them out. Seeking comprehensive advancement on the basis of pilot
projects can effectively reduce the overall cost and risk of promotion, and is more conducive to
steadily advancing reform and opening up.

When advancing in an all-round way, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between the
whole and the key points, pay attention to grasping the main aspects of the main contradictions and
contradictions, and grasp the important areas and key links, and also focus on proceeding from the
system and the whole, carry out overall planning, and promote the development of work in all
aspects.

5. correctly handle the relationship between reform, development and stability

Reform involves in-depth interest adjustment and system adjustment, and we must properly handle
the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Reform, development and stability are
the three important fulcrums of China's socialist modernization construction and the three key chess
pieces in the overall situation. Reform is a powerful driving force for economic and social
development, development is the key to solving all economic and social problems, and stability is
the prerequisite for reform and development. At present, China is not only in a period of important
strategic opportunities for development, but also in a period of prominent social contradictions, and
it is particularly important to properly handle the relationship between reform, development and
stability, and promote reform and development in social stability. It is necessary to persistently unify
the intensity of reform, the speed of development and the degree of social tolerance, take the
improvement of people's living standards as the point of integration in correctly handling the
relationship between reform, development and stability, promote reform and development while
maintaining social stability, and promote social stability through reform and development. It is
necessary to enhance the coordination of reform measures, development measures, and stability
measures, properly grasp the relationship between current interests and long-term interests, partial
interests and overall interests, and individual interests and collective interests, and strive to solve
problems related to the vital interests of the masses, and also focus on guiding the masses to correctly
handle various interest relations, rationally and lawfully express their interest demands, and create
a stable and united social atmosphere.
The new era is an era of comprehensive rule of law. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out in particular:
"Throughout the reform process, we must attach great importance to the use of rule of law thinking
and methods, give play to the leading and promoting role of the rule of law, strengthen the
coordination of relevant legislative work, and ensure that reform is promoted on the track of rule of
law."1 The deeper the reform and opening up, the more emphasis should be placed on the rule of
law. We must not violate the law under the guise of reform, nor can we not use the excuse that the
law is not perfect and does not promote reform. In the practice of reform, the study of reform plans
and reform measures should simultaneously consider the legislative issues involved, and put
forward legislative needs and suggestions in a timely manner.

The results of reform that have proved effective in practice should be upgraded into law in a timely
manner. Where the conditions for practice are not yet ripe and it is necessary to carry out a trial first,
authorization should be made in accordance with legal procedures. Laws and regulations that do not
meet the requirements of reform should be promptly revised or abolished.
Comrade Xi Jinping has stressed many times that the advancement of reform and opening up to this
day is more important than understanding determination, and more important than method is
responsibility. In order to implement the plan for comprehensively deepening reform, the central
authorities have clarified the responsibilities and requirements of all departments and units for
implementing the reform plan, stressed that the central and local governments should work together
to form a joint force, and make it clear that the relevant central departments that undertake the
leading tasks are the main units responsible for implementation, and must earnestly shoulder the
responsibility for the implementation of reform, especially paying attention to opening up the "last
mile" of reform promotion. In the concrete practice of promoting reform and opening up, we must
focus on the concrete implementation of relevant important reform arrangements, and the vast
number of party-member leading cadres must earnestly "understand the reform in a practical way,
plan for the reform, implement the reform, and act as both a promoter of reform and a doer of
reform.‚Äù1

"To govern a big country, if you cook small food. "China is a big country, and it must not make
subversive mistakes on fundamental issues, and once they occur, they cannot be irreparable or
compensated. In the new era, comprehensively deepening reform and opening up, just like moving
forward in deep water, encountering more and more resistance, facing more and more reefs,
undercurrents, and whirlpools, we must understand the water nature, grasp the overall situation, seek
progress in stability, must adhere to scientific methodology, pay attention to systematic, holistic and
synergistic, not only adhere to emancipating the mind, dare to be the first in the world, dare to dare
to try, but also adhere to seeking truth from facts, actively and steadily, and step steadily to unify
reform and development, adhere to the direction of unchanged, the road is not biased, The intensity
will not be reduced, and the reform and opening up will go more steadily and further.
