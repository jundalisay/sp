Section 2: Persist in comprehensively deepening reform

China's reform and opening up began with the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, adhered to the principle of prioritizing the easy before the difficult, and gradually
progressively to the convening of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's reform entered the
period of tackling tough problems and deep waters, "It can be said that the easy and happy reforms
have been completed, the delicious meat has been eaten, and the rest are hard bones."1 It can be said
that the complexity, sensitivity and arduousness of further promoting reform are no less than more
than 30 years ago, when reform and opening up reached a new and important juncture. The Third
Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee deliberated and adopted the Decision of the
CPC Central Committee on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reform,
which put forward the guiding ideology, goals, tasks and major principles for comprehensively
deepening reform, rationally laid out the strategic priorities, priorities, main directions of attack,
working mechanisms, promotion methods, timetables, and road maps for comprehensively
deepening reform, and opened a new era of comprehensively deepening reform and promoting
reform through the overall design of the system.

1. Comprehensively deepen the basic observance of reform

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has
repeatedly pointed out that the success of China's reform is because we have adhered to the correct
direction and position and maintained political firmness. To promote comprehensive deepening of
reform in the new era, we must also adhere to the correct direction, adhere to the people-centered
reform position, and resolutely implement the general requirements for reform put forward by the
Party Central Committee. This is the experience of reform, and it is also the follow-up of reform.
Reform and opening up is a profound revolution, and we must adhere to the correct direction and
advance along the correct road. In the early days of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
stressed: "Adhering to the socialist orientation in reform is a very important issue. "1 If reform and
opening up are not carried out, "reform and opening up" that negates the socialist direction is also a
dead end. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "Of course, we must hold high the banner of
reform, but our reform is a reform that continues to advance on the road of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and we will neither follow the old road of closure and rigidity, nor take the evil road
of changing the banner.”2 "The purpose of promoting reform is to continuously promote the self-
improvement and development of China's socialist system and give socialism new vitality.”3 These
loud declarations show that the direction of China's reform is to continuously promote the self-
improvement and development of the socialist system, rather than to change the course of the
socialist system. Over the past 40 years, China's reform process has also experienced twists and
turns, but because of the correct direction and proper control, problems can be corrected in time, so
it can always move forward along the right path. At present, reform is facing a very complex
domestic and international environment, and various ideologies and interests are stirring each other.
In order to grasp the pulse of reform from the appearance of complicated things and prescribe reform
remedies amid the divergence of opinions, we must keep a sober mind and have sufficient strategic
concentration. We are highly vigilant against the danger of the country being invaded, subverted and
split, the danger of undermining the overall situation of reform, development and stability, and the
danger of interrupting the development process of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

As Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "We will resolutely change what should be changed and can
be changed, and resolutely do not change what should not and cannot be changed." 1 To ensure that
the correct direction of reform is always adhered to, we must always adhere to the party's basic line
as the lifeline of the party and the country, and always adhere to the four basic principles of economic
construction as the center. The two basic points of reform and opening up are unified in the great
practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics; we must continue to adhere to the four basic
principles, which are the foundation of the country, not only ensure the correct direction of reform
and opening up with the four basic principles, but also give the four basic principles a new
connotation of the times through reform and opening up, eliminate all kinds of interference, and
unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
China's reform has a standpoint, and this is the people's stand that the Chinese Communists have
always adhered to. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "The fundamental purpose of our reform
is to make the country richer and stronger, make the society more fair and just, and make the people's
life better." 2 Comprehensively deepen reform, no matter what is changed or what step it takes,
adhere to the people-centered reform value orientation cannot change. To implement this reform
value orientation, we must embody the people-centered development thinking in the whole process
of reform, so that what the people care about and expect, what the reform should grasp and promote,
and bring more sense of gain to the people through reform. It is necessary to take the promotion of
social fairness and justice and the improvement of people's well-being as the starting point and
foothold of comprehensively deepening reform, focus on creating a fairer and more just social
environment, constantly overcome various phenomena that violate fairness and justice, and make
the results of reform and development more and more equitable to benefit all the people. We must
adhere to the original intention of reform and opening up, regard seeking happiness for the people
as the criterion for testing the results of reform, and ensure that everything that is beneficial to the
cause of the party and the people will be resolutely done, refueled, and worked without stopping;
and everything that is detrimental to the cause of the party and the people should be resolutely
reformed, thoroughly reformed, and changed without delay. It is necessary to introduce a number of
hard tricks and practical measures that can be loud, stand up, and be recognized by the masses,
properly handle the relationship between the "first kilometer" and the "last kilometer" of reform,
break through the "middle obstruction," and prevent inaction. The heavier the tasks of reform,
development and stability, the more it is necessary to maintain the flesh-and-blood ties between the
party and the masses, be good at improving policies and propositions from the people's practice,
creation, and development requirements, and constantly consolidate the mass foundation for
comprehensively deepening reform.
Further emancipating the mind, further emancipating and developing the social productive forces,
and further emancipating and enhancing social vitality are both the purpose and the conditions for
reform.

Among them, emancipating the mind is the premise, the general switch for liberating and developing
social productive forces, and emancipating and enhancing social vitality. Without the liberation of
Tian Xiang, it would be impossible to make the historic policy decision of reform and opening up,
and it would be impossible to promote theoretical innovation on the basis of practice. Without the
great emancipation of the mind, there will be no great breakthrough in reform. Emancipating and
developing the social productive forces and emancipating and enhancing social vitality is the
inevitable result of emancipating the mind and is also an important foundation for emancipating the
mind. Development is the last word, and only by further liberating and developing the social
productive forces can the grand goal of national rejuvenation be achieved. Emancipating the mind
and emancipating and enhancing social vitality is for the purpose of better emancipating and
developing the social productive forces. Through deepening reform, we should let the vitality of all
labor, knowledge, technology, management, capital and other elements burst out in a competitive
manner, and let all the sources of creating social wealth fully flow.
