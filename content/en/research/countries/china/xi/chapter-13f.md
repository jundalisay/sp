Section 3: Promoting the complete reunification of the motherland

Accomplishing the reunification of the motherland is one of the three major historical tasks of the
CPC and is where the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation lie.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping, based on
the long-term development of the cause of the party and the country, has systematically summed up
the successful experience of the practice of "one country, two systems", profoundly expounded the
basic position and major principles of adhering to the principle of "one country, two systems" and
promoting the great cause of the reunification of the motherland, and clearly established adherence
to "one country, two systems" and the promotion of the reunification of the motherland as the basic
strategy for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, fully
reflecting that the party's understanding of the law of the practice of "one country, two systems" has
reached a new height.

1. National reunification is a historical necessity for the Chinese nation to move toward great rejuvenation

National rejuvenation and national reunification are the trend of the times, the great righteousness,
and the aspiration of the people. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Maintaining the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao and realizing the complete reunification of the
motherland are inevitable requirements for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 1
"Unification is strong, division must be chaotic", this is a historical law. The American Civil War
stopped the division of the country, safeguarded the unity of the United States, and laid an objective
foundation for the United States to become a world power. As a country with an ancient civilization
of 5,000 years, China has encountered many times in history and has a profound understanding of
the harm of national division. After the modern era, due to the corruption and incompetence of the
feudal ruling clique, the gradual decline of national strength, and the deep suffering of the Chinese
nation, Macao and Hong Kong were forced to leave the embrace of the motherland, especially after
the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, the Qing Dynasty was forced to cede Taiwan to Japan, and Taiwan
was invaded and occupied by foreign peoples for half a century, "leaving heart-wrenching pain for
compatriots on both sides of the strait.”2 At that time, the history of China was full of national
humiliation and the sorrow and indignation of the people. In 1945, the victory of the War of
Resistance and the restoration of Taiwan washed away half a century of national humiliation. In
1949, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to win national independence and
people's liberation, established New China, and achieved the complete reunification of the mainland
of the motherland by 1951. 3 But Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao are still floating away. After
several generations of Chinese Communists' relay struggle, in the 90s of the 20th century, Hong
Kong and Macao successively returned to the embrace of the motherland, and the great cause of the
motherland's reunification took solid steps.

Resolving the Taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is the
common aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and the fundamental interests
of the Chinese nation.

The fact that the two sides of the strait have not yet been completely reunified is a wound left by
history to the Chinese nation. Cross-strait Chinese should make joint efforts to seek national
reunification and heal the wounds of history. The broad masses of Taiwan compatriots are all
members of the Chinese nation, and they should do their Chinese in an upright manner and regard
promoting the complete reunification of the country and jointly seeking the great rejuvenation of
the nation as the most glorious cause. At present, to grasp the overall situation of cross-strait
relations from the overall interests of the Chinese nation, the most fundamental and core thing is to
safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since 2016, Taiwan's political situation has
undergone major changes, and the Taiwan authorities do not recognize that both sides of the strait
belong to "one China", which has undermined the political foundation for the peaceful development
of cross-strait relations. Comrade Xi Jinping has made many important speeches on the situation in
the Taiwan Strait, expounding the principled position of adhering to the "consensus of '92" and
safeguarding the peaceful development of cross-strait relations, and declaring his firm will and
determination to oppose and curb any form of "Taiwan independence.” Comrade Xi Jinping stressed:
"We have firm will, full confidence and sufficient ability to thwart any form of 'Taiwan
independence' separatist attempt." We will never allow anyone, any organization, any political party,
at any time, in any form, to separate any piece of Chinese territory from China!" 1 These solemn
declarations of "any" embody the firm will of the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups
throughout the country to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
To realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Taiwan compatriots will certainly not be
absent. Taiwan's future lies in national reunification, and the well-being of Taiwan compatriots
depends on national rejuvenation. The peaceful development of cross-strait relations is the correct
path for safeguarding cross-strait peace, promoting common development between the two sides of
the strait and benefiting compatriots on both sides of the strait. The peaceful development of cross-
strait relations should be jointly promoted by compatriots on both sides of the strait, jointly
safeguarded by compatriots on both sides of the strait, and shared by compatriots on both sides of
the strait. The Chinese dream is the common dream of compatriots on both sides of the strait, and
only when the nation is rejuvenated and the country is strong and prosperous can the Chinese on
both sides of the strait live a prosperous and beautiful life. In the process of the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation, compatriots on both sides of the strait should join hands to realize the Chinese
dream, shoulder the responsibility of national rejuvenation, and share the glory of national
rejuvenation. The Taiwan issue arises from national weakness and chaos, and it is bound to end with
national rejuvenation! Supporting and pursuing national reunification is a national righteousness
and should be affirmed by the whole nation. After peaceful reunification,


With a strong motherland to rely on, Taiwan will always maintain peace, the people will live and
work in peace and contentment, the livelihood and well-being of Taiwan compatriots will be better,
the space for development will be greater, and the waist pole will be harder, the confidence will be
more sufficient, and it will be safer and more dignified in the international arena.
