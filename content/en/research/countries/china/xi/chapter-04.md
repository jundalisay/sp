Chapter IV: Adhere to the fundamental position of centering on the people

The masses of the people are not only the creators of material wealth, but also the creators of spiritual
wealth, and even more the decisive force for social change. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We
must always take the people's position as the fundamental position, take the happiness of the people
as the fundamental mission, adhere to the fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly,
implement the mass line, respect the people's dominant position and initiative, always maintain
flesh-and-blood ties with the people, unite the majestic force of all wills, and unite and lead the
people to jointly create a great historical cause."1 Adhering to the people-centered thinking, further
developing the Marxist outlook on the people, and fully demonstrating the distinct value orientation
of Chinese communists in the new era.
Section 1: Taking the people as the center is the essential
embodiment of the materialist view of history
To uphold the fundamental stand of centering on the people, we must always persist in relying on
the people to create great historical causes, persist in doing everything for the people, and persist
in implementing the party's mass line in all activities of governing the country.

1. Relying on the people to create great historical deeds

In the long history of the development of the Chinese nation, Chinese people have created splendid
achievements in material and spiritual civilization and forged the great spirit of the Chinese nation
through their own diligence and wisdom. Since modern times, under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, the Chinese people have won great victories in the new democratic
revolution, established the People's Republic of China, established the socialist system in which the
people are masters of their own affairs, won great victories in reform and opening up, formed the
path, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and ushered in the great
leap of the Chinese nation from standing up, getting rich to becoming strong. Historical materialism
emphasizes that the masses of the people are the creators and true heroes of history; the masses of
the people themselves create their own history and are the main body of historical activities.
Historical experience also fully shows that the fundamental strength for adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era lies with the people, and only by relying on
the people can we create a great historical cause and continue to write a new chapter of socialism
with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

To rely on the people to create great historical causes, we must firmly establish the idea of the
people's status as the main body. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "the people, and only the
people, are the driving force for creating world history," 1 and he proclaimed with emotion the
strongest voice in history, "Long live the people." Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that
the people are the creators of history and the people are the real heroes. Whether or not we respect
the people's status as the main body and whether we recognize the main role of the masses in creating
history is the fundamental mark that distinguishes the materialist view of history from the idealistic
view of history. The foundation of the Party lies in the people, its bloodline lies in the people, and
its strength lies in the people. Only by unifying respect for the law of social development with
respect for the people's status as the main body of history can we unite the strong force for realizing
the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
To rely on the people to create great historical deeds, we must go deep among the masses, conduct
investigations and studies, learn from the people, and seek education from the people. "Those who
know the house leak are in Uxia, and those who know the government are in the grass field. "The
people know the actual situation best, find problems the most, have the most experience in solving
problems, and are the most able to create solutions to problems." Comrade Deng Xiaoping said:
"Many things in the course of reform and opening up were put forward by the masses in practice...

It is the wisdom of the masses, the wisdom of the collective. "1 The great cause of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics is fundamentally the cause of the broad masses of the people themselves,
and the experience created by the masses in practice reflects the objective law of the development
of things and represents the direction of social progress. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "Every
breakthrough and development in the understanding and practice of reform and opening up, the
emergence and development of every new thing in reform and opening up, and the creation and
accumulation of experience in every aspect of reform and opening up all come from the practice
and wisdom of hundreds of millions of people." 2 To sum up the experience of the CPC's
development and growth, it is very important to always regard the people as the source of wisdom
and strength, and always deeply root the growth of political wisdom and the enhancement of ruling
skills in the creative practice of the people. Comrade Xi Jinping warned the whole party to soberly
realize: "In front of the people, we will always be primary school students, and we must consciously
worship the people as teachers, seek advice from the able, and ask the wise for advice."3 Only by
deeply understanding the masses, understanding reality, promptly discovering and summing up the
fresh experiences created by the masses of the people, elevating them to theories and policies, and
mobilizing and guiding the people to carry out new practices can the cause of the party and the state
always maintain its vitality.
To rely on the people to create great historical causes, we must take whether the masses of the people
are satisfied or not as the first criterion for testing our work. The masses of the people can encourage
what they support, do well what they expect, and correct what the masses oppose. The fundamental
criterion for judging whether the party's line, principles, and policies are correct can only be
"whether the people agree or not, whether they are happy or not, whether they support it or not, and
whether they approve or disapprove." Whether the Communist Party of China can hand over
qualified answers can only be judged by the people and tested by history.
2. insist on doing everything for the people
The Communist Party of China is a Marxist party, the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the
vanguard of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, and has no special interests of its own other
than the interests of the people.

Adhering to doing everything for the people is the starting point and foothold of all the work of the
Communist Party of China, and it is also the intrinsic meaning and practical requirement of adhering
to the people-centered approach in the new era.
The Communist Party is a political party that emerged for the benefit of the people. The Communist
Manifesto clearly stipulates that Communists have no interests different from those of the proletariat
as a whole, and its ultimate goal is to realize that "the free development of everyone is the condition
for the free development of all"1 of communist society. The Communist Party of China is a faithful
practitioner of Marxism, and has consistently adhered to the needs of the people, the pursuit of the
people, and the happiness of the people in the period of revolution, construction, and reform, and
has always kept the people's warmth and warmth in mind and placed the people in the supreme
position.
Adhering to doing everything for the people is the consistent value pursuit of the Communist Party
of China. At the beginning of its founding, the Party defined its purpose as "serving the people"; at
the beginning of reform and opening up, the Party took resolving "the contradiction between the
people's growing material and cultural needs and backward social production" as the fundamental
task of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; in the process of reform and opening up, the
Party successively put forward that "comprehensive human development is the essential
requirement of socialism" and "Adhere to the people-oriented, comprehensive, coordinated and
sustainable development concept" in accordance with the changes in economic and social
development. New and significant progress has been made in safeguarding and developing the
interests of the people. The Party has always adhered to the people-centered approach in all periods,
and as a result, it has won the broad support of the masses of the people, and only then has a solid
mass and social foundation for the development of the cause of the Party and the country.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the face of the new
expectations and new requirements of the people yearning for a better life, the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has clearly put forward the people-centered
thinking, emphasizing that seeking happiness for the people is the original intention of the Chinese
Communists, and why the human problem is the touchstone for testing the nature of a political party
and a political power; and emphasizing the people-centered development concept to promote the
"five-in-one" in an integrated manner. The overall layout and coordinated promotion of the "four
comprehensive" strategic layout; emphasizing that all fields such as economic construction, political
construction, cultural construction, social construction, ecological civilization construction and
party building in the new era should reflect the requirements of people-centeredness. Since the 19th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China,

Proceeding from solving the main contradictions in our society, Comrade Xi Jinping proposed to
focus on solving the problem of unbalanced and insufficient development, vigorously improving the
quality of development, and better meeting the growing needs of the people in economic, political,
cultural, social and ecological aspects. This series of important expositions fully demonstrates our
party's fundamental political stand of being people-centered, and has become the fundamental
political guideline for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new
era.
3. Adhere to the party's mass line
The party's mass line means doing everything for the masses, relying on the masses in everything,
coming from the masses and going to the masses. The party's mass line is the systematic application
of the materialist view of history in all the party's activities of the principle that the masses of the
people are the creators of history, a scientific summary and induction of the party's historical
experience, an organic unity of Marxist values and methodology, and a full embodiment of the
fundamental political stand centered on the people.
From the perspective of values, all the work of the Communist Party of China is carried out with
the people at the center.
Everything for the masses" is the embodiment of the party's fundamental purpose. Upholding the
interests of the masses above all else is the highest political principle that every Communist Party
member must follow. The Marxist party firmly believes that the masses of the people can liberate
themselves, and the party must believe in the masses, mobilize the masses, and lead the masses to
struggle for the realization of lofty goals. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The people are the
source of our strength. We are deeply aware that everyone's strength is limited, but as long as we
are united in our will, there will be no difficulty that cannot be overcome."1 "Everything for the
masses" is the value goal of the party's work, and "relying on the masses in everything" is the means
to achieve the value goal.
From a methodological point of view, "coming from the masses and going to the masses" is the
party's fundamental leadership method and working method, emphasizing that the formulation of
the party's line, principles, and policies should fully understand the opinions of the masses and pool
the wisdom of the masses; in the process of implementing policy decisions, it is also necessary to
constantly listen to the opinions of the masses for revision and improvement, and the results of
policy decisions and implementation must stand the approval of the masses and the test of practice.

Historical experience proves that by adhering to the party's mass line, the party's cause and the
interests of the masses will prosper; if we deviate from the party's mass line, the party's cause and
the interests of the masses will be harmed. To realize the people's yearning for a better life in the
new era, the Party must adhere to the fundamental position of taking the people as the center and
prevent separation from the people at all times. To this end, it is necessary to administer the party
strictly in an all-round way, strengthen education in ideals and convictions, never forget the original
aspiration and keep in mind the mission, consciously accept the supervision of the people, educate
and guide the broad masses of party members and cadres to consciously practice the party's
fundamental purpose, deeply root the mass viewpoint and mass line in their thinking and concretely
implement them in action, focus on solving the problems of the masses' most realistic interests,
constantly enhance the people's trust and confidence in the party, and lay a solid class foundation
and mass foundation for the party's long-term ruling.
Section 2: The people's yearning for a better life is the
party's goal
The Communist Party of China comes from the people, and all its work must take the fundamental
interests of the broadest masses of the people as the highest standard, constantly meet the new
expectations of the people for a better life, and constantly solve the most direct and realistic interests
of the people. Striving to let the people live a better life is where the party's mission, value and life
lie.
1. The fundamental embodiment of the nature and purpose of the Communist Party of
China
Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "Seeking happiness for the people is the original intention of the
Chinese communists. We must never forget this original intention, and always take the people's
yearning for a better life as the goal. "1 Adhering to everything for the people and leading the people
of the whole country to continuously create a better life vividly interprets the fundamental position
of the Chinese communists, the fundamental purpose of the party to serve the people wholeheartedly,
and the fundamental pursuit of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.

Taking the people's yearning for a better life as the goal of struggle fundamentally answers the
question of "for whom?" The question of why people are a fundamental question and a question of
principle. If this problem is not solved well, one will not be qualified to be called a communist or a
Marxist. The Communist Party of China comes from the people, takes root in the people, and serves
the people; the Party has no special interests that are divorced from the masses, Party members do
not have a special position above the masses, and no Party member is allowed to break away from
the masses and be above the masses. The entire history of the Party's struggle is a history of serving
the people and relying on the people, a history of centering on the people, and a history of serving
the people wholeheartedly.
Taking the people's yearning for a better life as the goal of struggle, the core is to stand firmly on
the people's position. Representing the interests of the people, standing on the side of the people,
and serving the people wholeheartedly are the fundamental political positions of the Communist
Party of China. The question of position is not illusory, it is real. In capitalist society, capital is the
real master, capital logic is the leading logic of society, power is subject to capital, subject to capital,
and also serves capital, which determines that bourgeois political parties can only represent the
interests of capital. In socialist China, the people are the real masters, representing the interests of
the people is where the highest interests of the Communist Party of China lie, and always standing
on the side of the people is the lofty mission of the Communist Party of China. Chinese Communists
must consciously stand on the side of the overwhelming majority of the people, consciously stand
on the people's standpoint to think about problems, make decisions, do business, and be faithful
representatives of the people's interests. Without this, there is a fundamental departure from
Marxism; To betray this article is to fundamentally betray the cause of the communists.
The key to taking the people's yearning for a better life as the goal is to implement it in specific
actions to serve the people, which is reflected in promoting all aspects and links of economic and
social development. Comrade Xi Jinping adheres to the people-centered development thinking and
makes a series of important expositions on creating a better life for the people and ensuring and
improving people's livelihood. For example, on realizing the Chinese dream of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, it emphasizes that "the Chinese dream is, in the final analysis,
the dream of the people"; on building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way,
emphasizing that "a moderately prosperous society is not a well-off, the key is to look at the fellow
villagers"; "no one can be left behind on the road to a moderately prosperous life"; on
comprehensively deepening reform, emphasizing "closely relying on the people to promote reform"
and "the fruits of reform and development will benefit all the people more equitably"; on
comprehensively governing the country according to law, emphasizing "striving to let the people
feel fairness and justice in every judicial case"; Regarding the strict management of the party in an
all-round way, he stressed that "the key issue is to maintain the flesh-and-blood ties between the
party and the masses of the people";

Regarding targeted poverty alleviation and targeted poverty alleviation, he stressed that "we must
not leave behind a poor area or a poor mass.” All these are more realistic and targeted important
requirements for meeting the people's expectations for a better life, and have been translated into
effective practical steps and concrete actions of the Party and the people.
2. Grasp the people's new expectations for a better life
A better life is the foundation of people's happiness and social harmony. Satisfying the people's
expectations for a better life is the essential requirement of the CPC's adherence to building the party
for the public and ruling for the people. The Party's efforts in revolution, construction, and reform
are all aimed at enabling the people to live a better life. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Serving
the people wholeheartedly is the fundamental starting point and foothold of all our party's actions."1
To test the effectiveness of all work, we must ultimately see whether the people have truly benefited
from the benefits, whether the people's living standards have been truly improved, and whether the
people's rights and interests have been truly guaranteed. To grasp the people's new expectations for
a better life in the new era, we need to pay attention to its salient characteristics.
First, the area of demand has expanded considerably, and needs that have already been met give rise
to new needs. Marx and Engels pointed out: "The first need that has been satisfied, the activities that
have been satisfied, and the tools that have been acquired to satisfy the need give rise to new needs."2
With the entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era, people's needs for a better
life have become more and more extensive, not only putting forward higher requirements for
material and cultural life, but also increasing requirements in democracy, rule of law, fairness, justice,
security, environment and other aspects. When meeting with Chinese and foreign journalists by
members of the Standing Committee of the 18th Political Bureau of the Central Committee,
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out with deep affection: "Our people love life and look forward to
better education, more stable jobs, more satisfactory income, more reliable social security, higher
levels of medical and health services, more comfortable living conditions, and a more beautiful
environment, and hope that children can grow up, work better, and live better."3 Compared with
"material cultural needs,"

The content needed for a better life of the people undoubtedly covers a wider range, more levels and
a wider range of fields, involving economic, political, cultural, social, ecological civilization and
other aspects. Human needs not only include the survival needs of maintaining life activities, but
also include the development needs of pursuing self-realization and free and all-round development,
and the enjoyment needs of pursuing a happy life have also been put forward as never before; people
not only pursue objective life needs, but also incorporate subjective needs such as a sense of gain,
happiness, security, and dignity into the scope of a better life.
Second, the specific difficulties of specific groups of people in cities and towns need to be focused
on and effectively resolved. Specific groups include urban subsistence allowances, the elderly,
migrant workers, university graduates and urban registered unemployed persons, etc., because of
their own characteristics, these groups face different difficulties, and the solutions must also be
focused. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We have about 18 million urban subsistence population,
for them, we must ensure basic living by improving various security systems; It is necessary to
increase the supply of old-age services and enhance the convenience of medical services for the
more than 300 million elderly people over the age of 65; gradually and fairly enjoy basic local public
services for the more than 200 million migrant workers in cities and towns; suitable living conditions
for the tens of millions of college graduates and other permanent residents employed in megacities;
and professional skills for the more than 9 million registered unemployed in cities and towns, so as
to achieve stable employment and stable income; and so on. "1 In short, we must adhere to the
people-centered development thinking, focus on the specific difficulties faced by specific groups of
people, do more things to help them solve practical problems, and promote sustained and healthy
economic development and social harmony and stability.
Third, "good life" is positioned as a new standard of life. In the new era of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, the people are no longer satisfied with their basic living needs such as food, clothing,
housing and transportation, but should pursue democracy and rule of law in political life, spiritual
civilization in cultural life, fairness and justice in social life, and beautiful China in ecological
civilization. The satisfaction of material needs has laid the foundation for people's happiness, but
the people not only hope to obtain higher quality social public goods, but also look forward to a safe,
stable, harmonious and green living environment, a social environment in which "people can make
the best use of their talents, the land can make the best of their benefits, the materials can make the
best use of their resources, and the goods can flow smoothly", a democratic and orderly political
environment with fair law enforcement and clean rivers.

In this way, people can really continue to get more "good" feelings.
3. adhere to the people-centered work orientation
To take the people's yearning for a better life as the goal of struggle, we must adhere to the people-
centered work orientation. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the
Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has always adhered to the people-
centered development thinking, always adhered to the people-centered work orientation, taken the
benefit of the people as the greatest achievement, shouldered the responsibility of reform and
development, implemented a large number of measures to benefit the people, promoted more and
fairer development results to benefit all the people, and continuously met the growing needs of the
people for a better life at a higher level. In this regard, there are the following characteristics.
First, highlight the focus of work. In any era, the interests of the people are often multifaceted, and
these problems range from light to heavy, slow and urgent; we must not grasp the eyebrows and
beards at once; we must hold the "bull's nose" and persist in combining overall advancement with
key breakthroughs. Without focus, there will be no clue and no rules; without focus, there will be
no policy and no proposition. To solve the problem of interests that the people are concerned about,
it is not possible to advance by leaps and go hand in hand; it is not possible to advance in unison
with excessive weight and weight; nor can it exert equal efforts and advance at the same time; it is
not possible to rush forward in a rush, nor can it talk about troops on paper. To solve the most direct
and realistic interests of the people, it is very necessary to grasp the following key points. First,
strive to do a good job in running education to the satisfaction of the people. Education is the
cornerstone of national rejuvenation and social progress, which is related to the future of the country.
It is necessary to implement the fundamental task of cultivating morality and cultivating people,
cultivate socialist builders and successors with all-round development of morality, intelligence,
physique, aesthetics, and labor, and provide strong talent guarantee and intellectual support for
economic and social development. The second is to make precise efforts to grasp employment work.
Servitude is the foundation of people's livelihood. It is necessary to adhere to the employment
priority strategy, implement a more active employment policy, create more jobs, focus on solving
structural employment contradictions, encourage entrepreneurship to bring employment, and
achieve relatively full and high-quality employment. The third is to promote a more reasonable and
orderly distribution of income. Income distribution is the source of people's livelihood, and it is the
most important and direct way to improve people's livelihood and realize that the fruits of
development are shared by the people. The fourth is to establish and improve a fairer and more
sustainable social security system. Social security acts as a social stabilizer. It is necessary to
implement the universal participation plan and strengthen policy convergence.

Improve the insurance system for basic old-age care for urban workers, basic old-age pension for
urban and rural residents, basic medical care in urban areas, unemployment, work-related injury,
and childbirth, improve the social assistance system, and raise the level of social welfare. Fifth,
improve the people's health. Without universal health, there can be no overall well-off. It is
necessary to put people's life safety and health first, adhere to the people's first and life first, and
promote the construction of a healthy China. Sixth, promote balanced population development.
Adhere to the basic national policy of family planning, further release fertility potential, alleviate
the pressure of population aging, and ensure population security.
Second, keep the bottom line of people's livelihood. The bottom line is an insurmountable warning
line, a critical point at which things change. "Bottom-line thinking" is to be in awe of the bottom
line and keep it. As far as people's livelihood work is concerned, the bottom line is the lifeline, safety
line, and hope line of the people, and it is the boundary line that can be retreated and must be
defended. Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that the work of people's livelihood must
guard the bottom line and firmly establish the bottom line, and the fundamental truth is here. Adhere
to the social policy to support the bottom, in accordance with the requirements of everyone's
participation, everyone's efforts, and everyone's enjoyment, and strive to ensure the basic people's
livelihood. On the premise of adhering to this principle, it is particularly necessary to do more work
to help people in distress, pay special attention to the masses in difficulty, always keep their safety
and well-being in mind, show concern for their welfare, and do everything possible to help them
solve their worries and difficulties.
Third, improve institutional design. System building is fundamental and a strong guarantee for
people's livelihood. The key to adhering to the people-centered work orientation is to make more
effective system design and institutional arrangements, gradually establish an institutional system
with equal rights, fair opportunities and fair rules as the main content, and strive to create an
institutional environment that guarantees fairness and safeguards the bottom line. In the final
analysis, people's livelihood issues such as education, medical care, narrowing the income gap,
environmental pollution control, judicial justice, and anti-corruption must be implemented through
systems; with a fair and just system, there is a solid foundation for solving the most direct and
realistic interests of the people.
Fourth, reasonably guide expectations. Expectations are expectations and prospects for the future.
Good expectations for people's livelihood can often be transformed into a calm social mentality and
healthy and orderly social actions, so that people have motivation, patience and confidence to
actively seek solutions to practical problems. People's livelihood expectations are unstable, which
is bound to be pessimistic and disappointed in society, and there will be panic and impatience and
negative emotions, resulting in risk accumulation and challenges to social harmony and political
stability. Especially in the context of a more complex domestic and international environment and
increasing downward pressure on the economy, it is even more important to reasonably guide
expectations.

Only by rationally viewing the hot and difficult issues in economic and social development and fully
understanding that it is impossible to make up for the shortcomings of people's livelihood can we
gather the confidence and strength to overcome difficulties and better safeguard the overall situation
of reform, development and stability.
Section 3: Steadily advancing in the direction of common
prosperity for all the people
Since ancient times, human society has pursued and explored common prosperity, but true common
prosperity can only be achieved when socialism develops to a certain extent. As a Marxist political
party, the Communist Party of China regards leading the people to create a better life and achieve
common prosperity as its unswerving goal. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The development
we pursue is development that benefits the people, and the prosperity we pursue is the common
prosperity of all the people." Whether reform and development succeed or not, the ultimate criterion
is whether the people have jointly enjoyed the fruits of reform and development. "1
1. Common prosperity is the fundamental principle of socialism with Chinese
characteristics
The concept of common prosperity can be understood from two dimensions: productivity and
production relations. "Common" reflects the way members of society occupy wealth, which is
relative to the polarization caused by private ownership, and is a concentrated embodiment of the
nature of social production relations; "affluent" reflects the degree of ownership of wealth by
members of society, which is relative to poverty and is a concentrated embodiment of the
development level of social productive forces. In this sense, common prosperity is a concept that
reflects specific productive forces and production relations.
The Communist Party of China has always regarded sharing the fruits of development and leading
the people to achieve common prosperity as its value goal.

After the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong raised the issue of common prosperity and
continued to explore it. "Now that we implement such a system, such a plan, we can become richer
and stronger year by year, and we can see richer and stronger year by year." And this wealth is
common wealth, this strength, is common strength, everyone has a share."1 Since the reform and
opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has summed up the lessons of the past, once again emphasized
the issue of common prosperity and its way of realization, regarded common prosperity as one of
the basic principles of socialism, and summarized common prosperity as the essential connotation
of socialism. Comrade Jiang Zemin stressed: "Achieving common prosperity is the fundamental
principle and essential characteristic of socialism, and it must not be shaken."2 Comrade Hu Jintao
also demanded: "Let all the people share the fruits of reform and development, and enable all the
people to advance steadily in the direction of common prosperity."3
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, socialism with Chinese
characteristics has entered a new era. A distinctive feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics
in the new era is that the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country unite and struggle,
constantly create a better life, and gradually realize common prosperity for all the people on the
basis of production and development. At the new historical starting point, Comrade Xi Jinping
attaches great importance to the issue of common prosperity and emphasizes that achieving common
prosperity is the essential requirement of socialism.
An important aspect that distinguishes socialism from capitalism lies in its profound criticism of
capitalist polarization and huge economic and social inequality, emphasizing adherence to the
people-centered approach and dedication to the pursuit of all-round human development and
common prosperity for all people. In his speech at the celebration of the 95th anniversary of the
founding of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "Leading the people
to create a happy life is the unswerving goal of our party. We must conform to the people's yearning
for a better life, adhere to the people-centered development thinking, focus on ensuring and
improving people's livelihood, develop various social undertakings, increase the intensity of income
distribution and regulation, win the battle against poverty, ensure the people's equal participation
and equal development rights, so that the results of reform and development will benefit all the
people more equitably, and steadily move towards the goal of achieving common prosperity for all
the people. "4

The main contradiction in our society has changed from the contradiction between the people's
growing material and cultural needs and backward social production to the contradiction between
the people's growing need for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development. To adapt to
the changes in the main contradictions in society, it is necessary not only to promote high-quality
economic development, solve the problem of insufficient development, and further expand the
"cake", but also to coordinate the distribution of income, solve the problem of unbalanced
development, and further divide the "cake.” In view of the imbalance in development, especially the
widening gap between income and personnel, Comrade Xi Jinping particularly stressed the need to
achieve shared development. "The 'cake' of China's economic development continues to expand, but
the problem of unfair distribution is more prominent, and the gap between income and the level of
public services in urban and rural areas is large. In sharing the achievements of reform and
development, there are still imperfections in both the actual situation and the system design. To this
end, we must adhere to the principle that development is for the people, development depends on
the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the people, and make more effective
institutional arrangements so that all the people can steadily advance in the direction of common
prosperity. "1 Practice shows that only by earnestly solving the problem of sharing the fruits of
reform and achieving common prosperity in shared development can we fully embody the
superiority of socialism, effectively enhance the momentum of development, and consolidate and
strengthen the mass foundation for the party's long-term ruling power.
2. Gradually realize common prosperity for all the people
The gradual realization of common prosperity is a systematic project. "Our country is in the primary
stage of socialism and will be for a long time, and we cannot do things beyond the stage, but this
does not mean that we will do nothing in gradually realizing common prosperity, but we must do as
much as possible according to the existing conditions, accumulate small victories into big victories,
and constantly advance towards the goal of common prosperity for all the people." 2 To gradually
achieve common prosperity, we must adhere to the principles of sharing by all, comprehensive
sharing, joint construction and sharing, and gradual sharing, adhere to doing our best and doing what
we can, comprehensively promote the construction of relevant fields, and form a long-term
mechanism for sustainable development. Doing our best emphasizes determination and will, that is,
how much ability to contribute, and actively create conditions for better results;

Doing what we can and insisting on seeking truth from facts means eating, dressing, and measuring
household belongings, without mentioning unrealistic goals, and not doing things that go beyond
stages and abilities.
Persist in taking economic construction as the center, further liberate and develop social productive
forces, and lay a solid material foundation for achieving common prosperity. Production is the
premise and foundation of distribution, and only on the basis of the continuous development of
productive forces can common prosperity be truly realized. China is still in the primary stage of
socialism and will remain for a long time, it is still the largest developing country in the world, and
development is still the top priority of contemporary China and the key to solving all China's
problems. We must firmly grasp the primary stage of socialism, which is the greatest national
condition, firmly base ourselves on the primary stage of socialism, which is the greatest reality,
unswervingly persist in taking economic construction as the center, fully mobilize the enthusiasm,
initiative, and creativity of the masses, constantly liberate and develop the productive forces, and
improve the quality and efficiency of development. Only in this way can we continuously meet the
people's growing needs for a better life in all aspects, continuously improve their living standards,
and gradually achieve common prosperity. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that the realization of
social fairness and justice is determined by many factors, the most important of which is the level
of economic and social development. We must firmly grasp the center of economic construction,
promote sustained and healthy economic development, further expand the 'cake', and lay a more
solid material foundation for ensuring social fairness and justice. "1
Adhere to the two "unwavering" and consolidate the foundation of the economic system for
achieving common prosperity. The basic economic system with public ownership as the main body
and the common development of various ownership economies is an important pillar of the socialist
system with Chinese characteristics. Both the public and non-public economies are components of
the socialist market economy, an important foundation for China's economic and
social
development, and an important condition for achieving common prosperity. In today's China, we
must unswervingly consolidate and develop the public ownership economy and adhere to the status
of the main body of public ownership, which plays a fundamental role in enhancing China's
economic strength, safeguarding social fairness and justice, preventing polarization, gradually
realizing common prosperity and promoting social harmony. At the same time, we must
unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public economy, which is
of great significance for promoting economic growth, expanding social employment, increasing
fiscal revenue, improving people's living standards and promoting common prosperity.

Coordinate urban and rural development and regional development, and promote common
prosperity between urban and rural areas and common prosperity in all regions. The dual structure
of urban and rural areas is an important cause of the gap between the rich and the poor. We must
strive to make major breakthroughs in coordinating urban-rural relations, especially in breaking the
dual structure of urban and rural areas, promoting the equal exchange of urban and rural factors and
the balanced allocation of public resources, implementing the strategy of rural revitalization,
injecting new impetus into rural development, and allowing the vast number of farmers to participate
in the process of reform and development on an equal footing and enjoy the fruits of reform and
development together. Regional development gaps are also an important reason for common
prosperity. It is necessary to properly implement the coordinated regional development strategy,
establish a more effective new mechanism for coordinated regional development, and promote the
gradual realization of common prosperity in the process of continuously improving the income level
and quality of life of the people in all regions.
Persist in ensuring and improving people's livelihood in the process of development. It is necessary
to seek more benefits for the people's livelihood and relieve more worries about the people's
livelihood, continuously make new progress in providing education for the young, learning and
teaching, earning income from hard work, treating the sick, providing care for the elderly, housing
and housing, and supporting the weak, so as to make up for the shortcomings of the people's
livelihood in the process of development, so that the people's sense of gain, happiness and security
will be more fulfilling, more secure and more sustainable. To achieve common prosperity, we must
focus on narrowing the income gap, which is a key task in the field of people's livelihood. It is
necessary to adhere to the principle of distribution according to work and improve the system and
mechanism for distribution according to key factors; expand the group of middle-income people,
increase the income of low-income earners, regulate those with excessive income, and ban illegal
income; persist in achieving simultaneous growth of residents' income while economic growth, and
achieve simultaneous increase in labor remuneration while increasing labor productivity; and
broaden the channels for residents' labor income and property income.
Section 4: Continuously
promote
development of the human person
the
all-round
The idea of comprehensive human development is the fundamental value and highest proposition
of Marxism, an important part of Marxist theory, and an important content of Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. Comprehensive human development is
not only the basic principle of communism, but also the value goal of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
From all-round human development to people-centered, this is a huge leap from general theory to
concrete reality, and implements the theoretical red line of Marxism.

In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to earnestly practice the
people-centered development thinking, better meet the growing diversified, multi-level and multi-
faceted needs of the broadest masses of the people in economic, political, cultural, social, ecological
and other aspects, and continuously promote all-round human development.
1. the basic connotation of all-round human development
Marxism holds that the all-round development of man is the development of the most fundamental
and essential thing of man, and that "man occupies his own comprehensive essence in a
comprehensive way, that is, as a complete person"1 That is, the comprehensive development of the
essential power of man as an end in itself. In connection with the essential provisions of human
beings, the all-round development of human beings has very rich connotations, which is specifically
manifested in the comprehensive development of human capabilities, the full development of human
social relations and the free development of human personality.
Comrade Xi Jinping once explained human development from the essential characteristics of human
beings, pointing out: "Man is essentially a cultural person, not a materialized person; an active and
comprehensive person, not a rigid, one-dimensional' person." Human beings not only pursue
material conditions and economic indicators, but also pursue happiness index; not only pursue the
harmony of natural ecology but also pursue the harmony of spiritual ecology; not only pursue
efficiency and fairness, but also pursue the harmony of interpersonal relationships and the
fulfillment of spiritual life, and pursue the meaning of life. "2 This idea explains the essence of man
from the relationship between the individual and society, and reveals the all-round development of
man from the relationship between man and the community of social life. Comrade Xi Jinping
clearly stated in the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "Ensure
that all the people have a greater sense of gain in joint construction and shared development, and
continuously promote the all-round development of people."3 These ideas have further inherited and
enriched the Marxist thinking on the all-round development of man.
First, comprehensive human development means the comprehensive development of human
capacities. The comprehensive development of human ability means that people are no longer
limited to the division of occupations, and can freely choose occupations according to their own
specialties, hobbies, etc.;

In this way, they can give full play to their talents and abilities in social practice, and can flexibly
change their roles and functions to meet different labor needs. When talking about the all-round
development of man, Marx often used such expressions as "the all-round development of all one's
own abilities" and "the all-round development of all human forces." When talking about well-
rounded people, Engels believed that this is a person who is capable in all aspects, "exerting all his
talents and strength.” According to Lenin, this is "a well-trained person, that is, a person who can
do everything."1 The comprehensive enrichment of human social relations and the free development
of human personality require that the development of human abilities must reach a certain level.
Marx believed that the all-round development of man is, in the final analysis, the development of
human capacity as an end in itself, and the development of human capacity "presupposes production
based on exchange value, which produces the universality of individual alienation from himself and
others, as well as the universality and comprehensiveness of personal relations and personal
ability.”2
Second, the comprehensive development of the human person means the full development of human
social relations. Social relations include the communication relationship between people, the
economic relations and production relations produced by people in social interactions, the
relationship between people and nature, and various relationships in ideology and culture, etc., and
the richness of social relations reflects the essence of human beings. In his Theses on Feuerbach,
Marx pointed out: "The essence of man is not an abstraction inherent in a single person, but in its
reality it is the sum of all social relations." "People are not only the product of social relations, but
also survive and develop in certain social relations all the time, in the sense that "social relations
actually determine how far a person can develop.”3 Of course, the development of human ability is
the most important content of human development, but Marx never simply reduced human
development to the development of ability, because the formation, development and expression of
human ability are inseparable from human social relations. The productive forces must be expressed
in certain relations of production, political forces must be expressed in certain political relations,
and spiritual forces must be expressed in certain spiritual relations. It is from the perspective of the
development of human social relations that Mark Tian explains the three stages of human
development from "human dependence" to "human independence based on material dependence"
and then to "free individuality.”

Therefore, if human development means the enrichment of human social relations, then the
realization of comprehensive human development means the full development of all human social
relations. Only by broadening the space and scope of people's activities and exchanges, broadening
people's vision and mind, and improving people's political, economic, legal and cultural relations
can we enhance people's autonomy in the process of enriching people's social relations.
Third, the all-round development of the human person means the free development of the human
personality. On the one hand, the full development of human personality mainly includes people's
interests, beliefs and the full development of human physical and intellectual strength, so that
people's character and temperament are more perfect and their psychology is healthier. On the other
hand, the full development of human personality is mainly manifested in the comprehensive
development of human subjectivity and the enrichment and increase of human uniqueness, that is,
the self-discipline of people who can restrain themselves, the free initiative to engage in social
practice activities according to their own will, the independence and autonomy of being able to
control their own behavior, and the originality of being able to create themselves. There is no doubt
that the all-round development of human abilities and the full development of human social relations
are inseparable from the free development of human personality. In a sense, the development of
abilities and relationships serves the formation and development of a person's "free personality."
The free development of human personality means that everyone in real social life can engage in
this or that labor at will, as he wants without exceeding the boundary. Marxism holds that the true
formation of man's free personality means the realization of man's all-round development, because
"this personality is comprehensive in both production and consumption, and therefore the labor of
individuality is no longer expressed as labor, but in the full development of activity itself."1
2. All-round human development is the value pursuit of socialism
In the era in which Marx lived, he based on the cruel reality of capitalist man-made servitude,
explored the enslavement and restraint of human beings by solidified social relations, and
emphasized that only by relying on the high development of productive forces can we fundamentally
overcome this limitation, and finally realize the active abandonment of human self-alienation, that
is, realize the free and comprehensive development of human beings.

The all-round development of man or the well-rounded development of man is not a product of
nature and pure nature, but a product of social history. Of course, the all-round development of man
is not a fixed, established and static ideal goal, but a generation process in the process of eternal
movement, change and development. To point out this qi is to prevent a mechanical, dogmatic, and
rigid understanding of the all-round development of man, which will lead to the degeneration of
originally alive, vibrant and dynamic theories into illusory and ethereal "utopian illusions" or lifeless
blunt dogmas. At every stage of the historical development of society, the all-round development of
man is being realized to varying degrees. Contradictions and problems belonging to this era will
emerge in every era, and at the same time, the resolution of these contradictions and problems will
lay the foundation for resolving the contradictions and problems of that era to a higher degree in the
future, thereby promoting the all-round development of society and people. In the course of the
historical development of this universal connection, humanity will continue to approach
comprehensive development.
To understand the Marxist theory of comprehensive human development from a historical
perspective, the key is to explore the specific characteristics of human nature and the realistic path
to promote comprehensive human development in the process of historical development. Similarly,
only by understanding the Marxist theory of comprehensive human development from the
perspective of history and development can we better grasp the inheritance and development of Xi
Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era.
After more than 40 years of reform and opening up, especially since the 18th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
has not only clearly declared that "the people's yearning for a better life is our goal", but also
emphasized adhering to the "people-centered" development thinking and the new development
concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing, unswervingly regarded
development as the first priority of the party's governance and rejuvenation of the country, persisted
in liberating and developing social productive forces, and promoted sustained and healthy economic
and social development. The people's living standards have achieved a historic leap; the people's
sense of gain, happiness and security in the reform and development has been significantly improved,
from the beginning of reform and opening up, more attention has been paid to material survival and
development, and gradually transitioned to all-round and diversified development in economy,
politics, culture, society and ecology, and the all-round development of people has been greatly
valued and realistically realized. This is an important symbol of socialism with Chinese
characteristics entering a new era. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
formally wrote the Constitution of the People's Republic of China on "promoting all-round human
development", and further emphasized that in the process of realizing the "two centenary goals" and
the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, it is necessary to promote the construction of a
"community with a shared future for mankind" and "make new and greater contributions to mankind.”

All this fully demonstrates that contemporary Chinese communists have always insisted on writing
the promotion of all-round human development on the great banner of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, insisted on embodying the promotion of all-round human development in the great
practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and insisted on implementing the promotion of
all-round human development in practical actions that benefit the Chinese people and even the
people of the world.
3. Promote all-round human development while promoting all-round social
progress
Comprehensive human development is inseparable from all-round social progress. In the new era,
to promote the all-round development of people, we must focus on the whole and make efforts in
various aspects.
First, adhere to the people-centered development thinking. Development is a prerequisite for solving
all our problems. Only by concentrating on development and focusing on the people's growing
yearning for a better life can we achieve, safeguard and develop the fundamental interests of the
broadest masses of the people. Compared with developed countries, the development of China's
productive forces is still at a medium level on the whole, and unbalanced and insufficient
development has become the main bottleneck to meet the people's growing needs for a better life.
In the new era, we must adhere to the people-centered value orientation, always regard development
as the first priority for the party to govern and rejuvenate the country, and strive to solve the problem
of unbalanced and insufficient development, and strive to solve problems such as the large gap
between residents' income and the relatively difficult life of some people. It is necessary to
comprehensively deepen reform, especially the reform of the income distribution system,
fundamentally eliminate the deep-seated institutional obstacles that affect social fairness and justice,
increase the income of low-income people, and strive to narrow the gap between urban and rural
areas, regions and industries.
Second, strive to achieve high-quality economic development. The quality and level of economic
development determine the degree of all-round human development. Failure to pay attention to
changes in the structure and level of social needs, especially the reality of increasing high-quality
consumption brought about by the improvement of consumption levels, will lead to the inability to
fully meet the needs of the people in the imbalance between supply and demand, and it will be
difficult to achieve comprehensive human development. In the new era, compared with the new
needs of the people, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of China's economic
development. To meet the people's growing needs for a better life, we must strive to realize the
transformation from a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage, promote
China's economy to maintain medium-high speed growth and move towards a medium-to-high-end
level, not only fully meet people's material needs, but also lay a solid foundation for meeting people's
high-level and diversified needs.

Third, constantly explore the path to realize the all-round development of people. Comrade Xi
Jinping pointed out: "We must stimulate the creativity and development vitality of the whole society,
and strive to achieve higher quality, more efficient, fairer and more sustainable development!"1 One
of the most important points is to give human development a more "comprehensive" and "concrete"
meaning. Whether it is to promote the modernization of the national governance system and
governance capacity, or to realize a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and
beautiful modern socialist country, the fundamental purpose is to realize human modernization and
comprehensive human development, so that people can obtain comprehensive and equal social
relations, fully enjoy the due rights such as the right to survival, security, development, participation,
etc., and constantly activate and release people's initiative. It is necessary to persist in promoting the
overall layout of the "five-in-one" and the "four comprehensive" strategic layout in a coordinated
manner, comprehensively improve the level of material, political, spiritual, social and ecological
civilization, and then promote the overall improvement of the level of comprehensive human
development. At the same time, we should actively promote the building of a community with a
shared future for mankind, promote the construction of a world of lasting peace, universal security,
common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty, jointly create a better future
for mankind, and make positive contributions to the all-round development of mankind.
