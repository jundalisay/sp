Chapter VIII: The New Normal of Economic Development and Achieving High-Quality Development

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has taken charge of the general trend of domestic and foreign
development, grasped the new characteristics and new requirements of China's economic
development, and clearly put forward a series of new concepts, ideas and strategies such as China's
economic development entering a new normal, adhering to the supply-side structural reform as the
main line, accelerating the construction of a modern economic system, and promoting high-quality
economic development, effectively leading the overall situation of China's economic development
in the new era and ensuring sustainable and healthy economic and social development. It has become
an important content of Xi Jinping's socialist economic thought with Chinese characteristics for a
new era.
Section 1: Economic development has entered a new normal
Clarifying that China's economic development has entered a new normal is a major judgment made
by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core by comprehensively analyzing
the long-term cycle of the world economy and the phased characteristics of China's development
and their interaction. To plan and promote China's economic and social development in the new era,
we must adapt to the new normal, grasp the new normal, and lead the new normal as the general
logic that runs through the overall development and the whole process.
1. deeply understand the scientific connotation of the new normal of
economic development
Scientific understanding of the current situation and accurate study and judgment of future trends
are the prerequisites for doing a good job in economic work.

In the face of the continuous downward trend of China's economic growth rate after the international
financial crisis in 2008, and the situation of "three-phase superposition" of the growth rate shift
period, the painful period of structural adjustment, and the digestion period of the previous stimulus
policy, Comrade Xi Jinping scientifically analyzed the new characteristics of economic
development in stages, clearly pointed out that China's economic development has entered a new
normal, showing new characteristics different from the past, and providing a fundamental basis for
formulating economic development strategies and policies in the new era.
Economic development has entered a new normal, which is an inevitable reflection of the phased
characteristics of China's economic development. Comrade Xi Jinping used the "nine looks" to
summarize the trend changes in China's economic development. (1) From the perspective of
consumer demand, consumption has changed from imitation wave consumption to personalized and
diversified consumption. (2) From the perspective of investment demand, investment in traditional
industries and real estate is relatively saturated, and investment opportunities in new technologies,
new products, new formats and new business models have emerged. (3) From the perspective of
exports and the balance of payments, the comparative advantage of low-cost exports has been
transformed, and it is urgent to cultivate new comparative advantages, and the situation of double
surplus in the balance of payments is developing in the direction of basic balance of balance of
payments. (4) From the perspective of production capacity and industrial organization mode, the
supply capacity of traditional industries greatly exceeds demand, the problem of overcapacity is
prominent, the industrial structure must be optimized and upgraded, and production miniaturization,
intelligence and specialization will become the new characteristics of industrial organization. (5)
From the perspective of the comparative advantages of production factors, the low-cost advantage
of labor is weakening, and economic growth will rely more on the quality of human capital and
technological progress. (6) From the perspective of market competition characteristics, it is
gradually shifting from quantitative expansion and price competition to quality-based and
differentiated-based competition. (7) From the perspective of resource and environmental
constraints, the environmental carrying capacity has reached or is close to the upper limit, and it is
necessary to promote the formation of a new way of green and low-carbon circular development.
(8) From the perspective of economic risk accumulation and resolution, all kinds of hidden risks are
gradually becoming apparent, and the bottom line of no systemic risk must be guarded. (9) From
the perspective of resource allocation mode and macro-control mode, the marginal effect of
comprehensive stimulus policy is significantly reduced, and it is necessary to give play to the
decisive role of the market in resource allocation and scientifically carry out macro-control.
The above nine trend changes are not only the external characteristics of the new normal, but also
the internal driving force of the new normal, which are reconstructing the growth model, power
structure, industrial structure and factor structure of China's economic development, and promote
China's economic development under the new normal to show growth rate changes, development
mode changes, economic structure optimization, New features of growth dynamics conversion.
First, the growth rate has changed, from high speed to medium and high speed.

The change in the speed of economic growth not only reflects the objective trend of economic
growth, but also reflects the new orientation of China's macro-control goals. Generally speaking,
catch-up economic development in post-developing countries goes through three stages. The first
phase usually has a faster growth rate. The reason is that the industrial space is large, it can be
imitated development, the pressure on resources and environment is not large, there is abundant and
low-cost labor, the base of 61* is small, and the growth space is large. In the second stage, the
conditions for rapid development no longer exist, the industrial space is relatively saturated, the
effect of imitation development decreases rapidly, the pressure on resources and environment
increases, labor costs increase, economic scale increases, and the economic growth rate is bound to
slow down. But this is not a step backwards, but a step forward, and the key task of this period is to
explore new sources of economic growth by encouraging innovation, with a focus on improving
quality and efficiency. In the third stage, it is close to or reaches the level of developed countries,
and the economic development rate slows down and is basically stable. The reason for this is that
the scale of the economy continues to grow, the industry is fine, and the new comparative advantage
depends mainly on human capital and science and technology, rather than on natural resources and
cheap labor. The new normal of China's economic development corresponds to the second stage,
and the change in growth rate is a natural reflection of the development stage.
The second is the transformation of development mode, from scale and speed to quality and
efficiency. Economic growth is no longer simply about heroes /^, and no longer simply about good
or bad in terms of speed. It is not that the economic development rate is higher and the situation is
"very good"; nor is the economic development speed lower that the situation is "very bad.”
Economic development should focus on improving quality and efficiency, and realize that
investment has returns, products have markets, enterprises have profits, employees have income,
the government has taxes, and the environment has improved. Economic development relies more
on efficiency improvement, including improving labor efficiency, capital efficiency, land efficiency,
resource efficiency, environmental efficiency, contribution rate of scientific and technological
progress, total factor productivity, etc., and gives play to the multiplier effect of data on the
efficiency of other factors.
The third is the optimization of the economic structure, from mainly incremental capacity expansion
to adjusting the stock and doing the same as the optimization of increment. In terms of demand
structure, the role of consumer demand in economic growth has become increasingly prominent,
and personalized, diversified, quality consumption, online shopping, customized consumption and
other ways have developed extensively, bringing new development opportunities; In terms of
industrial structure, the service industry has developed rapidly, and the contribution rate of China's
service industry to economic growth has approached 60% in 2018; in terms of urban and rural
structure, the urbanization process has continued to advance, and the urbanization rate reached 59..
in 201858%;

In terms of regional structure, the central and western regions have shown strong development
potential, and the implementation of regional development strategies such as the "Belt and Road"
construction, the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the construction of the
Yangtze River Economic Belt, the regional integration of the Yangtze River Delta and the
construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has continuously expanded
new space for regional development.
The fourth is the transformation of growth momentum, from mainly relying on factors such as
resources and low-cost labor to relying more on innovation-driven transformation. At present,
China's scientific and technological innovation ability is constantly improving, some important
fields are among the world's advanced ranks, and are changing from "followers" to "parallelists" or
even "leaders", and the innovation of industries, products, production methods, industrial
organizations, business models, management systems and other aspects continues to deepen. At the
same time, the world is facing a new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial
transformation, which not only brings great challenges to China's development, but also provides
China's development with a major historical opportunity to catch up with and surpass developed
countries. Under the new normal, it is necessary to create a new growth cycle by vigorously
implementing the innovation-driven development strategy, creating a new engine for development
and cultivating new impetus for development.
The new normal is a new theoretical summary made by the Party Central Committee on the current
phased characteristics of China's economic development, with definite theoretical connotation and
clear practical requirements, and this concept cannot be generalized and abused, let alone arbitrarily
labeled on other issues in other fields. It is necessary to scientifically understand its connotation and
accurately define its extension. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "In understanding the new
normal, we must accurately grasp the connotation and pay attention to overcoming several
tendencies. First, the new normal is not an event, and don't judge it by good or bad. "The new normal
is an objective state, a state that will inevitably appear at this stage of China's economic development,
an internal inevitability, there is no distinction between good and bad, we must plan according to
the situation, move according to the situation, and advance according to the situation." Second, the
new normal is not a basket, don't put everything in it. The new normal is mainly manifested in the
economic field, do not abuse the concept of the new normal, make a lot of 'new normal', what
cultural new normal, tourism new normal, urban management new normal, etc., and even classify
some bad phenomena into the new normal. Third, the new normal is not a safe haven, don't attribute
the work that is difficult or difficult to do well to the new normal, it seems that there is a reason not
to solve it if it is pushed to the new normal. The new normal is not to do nothing, not to do not
develop, not to do not want GDP growth, but to better use subjective initiative and more creative
spirit to promote development. ”1

2. the new normal is an accurate judgment of China's economic development
trend
Under the new normal, a series of new characteristics of economic development show that the
evolution of China's economy to a stage with high quality and more optimized structure is a natural
process, which is in line with the spiraling movement law of things. In other words, economic
development entering the new normal is a necessary stage of China's economic and social
development, and it is a general trend that is not transferred by human will.
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee opened a new period in the history
of reform and opening up. For more than 40 years, despite all the difficulties, we have created a
miracle in which a country's rapid economic growth lasted the longest since the end of the Second
World War. China's total economic volume ranked eleventh in the world at the beginning of reform
and opening up; In 2005, it surpassed France and ranked fifth; In 2006, it surpassed the United
Kingdom and ranked fourth; In 2007, it surpassed Germany and ranked third; In 2010, it surpassed
Japan and ranked second. In 2010, China's manufacturing scale surpassed that of the United States,
ranking first in the world. In a few decades, we have completed the development process that
developed countries have gone through for hundreds of years and created a miracle of world
development. However, with the continuous increase of economic aggregate, China has encountered
a series of new situations and problems in the process of development. The economy is large but
not strong, the quality of development is not high enough, and sustainable development is facing
severe challenges.
(1) Prominent contradictions in the economic structure. International experience shows that in the
initial stage of economic development, developing countries often pursue rapid economic growth,
and tend to neglect technological progress and structural optimization, resulting in structural
imbalances between the economy and society, urban and rural areas, regions and income distribution.
Since the reform and opening up, the main goal of China's economic development is to solve the
problem of food and clothing, pursuing speed, scale and quantity, and not paying enough attention
to structural problems. At present, China's economic development is facing three major structural
imbalances: First, the structural supply and demand imbalance of the real economy, although the
production capacity of the supply system is very strong, but most of them can only meet the needs
of low-end, low-quality and low-price, and it is difficult to meet the people's increasingly upgraded
multi-level, high-quality and diversified consumer demand. Second, the imbalance between finance
and the real economy, there is a phenomenon of funds turning from real to virtual, and a large
amount of funds circulate themselves in the financial system, which not only increases the risk of
the financial system, but also further aggravates the financing difficulties of the real economy. The
third is the imbalance between real estate and the real economy, and a large amount of money has
poured into the real estate market, resulting in excessive rise in house prices, further pushing up the
cost of the development of the real economy.

To solve the problem of economic structural imbalance, we must optimize the structure, use the
method of deepening reform to improve the quality of the supply system, and achieve a new dynamic
equilibrium between supply and demand.
(2) The endogenous driving force of growth needs to be reshaped urgently. In the past, economic
growth was mainly driven by investment and exports, but this pattern of growth is unsustainable.
From the perspective of investment, investment growth faces multiple constraints such as demand,
finance and environment. From 2013 to 2018, the growth rate of China's investment was 18.6%, 15,
7%, 10%, 8.1%, 7.2%, and 5.9%, respectively, and the decline trend was very obvious. From 2013
to 2018, China's export growth rate was 7.9%, 6.1%, -2.8%, -7.7% and 7.9% respectively , 7.1%,
fluctuating greatly, external demand growth is unstable. With the aging population and increasing
environmental requirements, the low-cost advantage of relying on the demographic dividend in the
past is disappearing, and the driving force of exports on economic growth is gradually weakening.
Therefore, based on domestic demand, cultivating endogenous power, especially relying on
consumption, has become an inevitable choice for China's future economic sustainable growth.
(3) Resource and environmental constraints are increasing. China's resource- and energy-intensive
industries account for a considerable proportion of the national economy, and the demand for
resources and energy is large and the consumption is high. According to World Bank statistics,
China's steel, copper, media and aluminum consumption rank first in the world, and oil consumption
ranks second in the world. Under the background of increasing constraints such as resources, energy
and environment and the increasingly prominent contradiction between supply and demand, it has
become an inevitable choice to promote the development of green and low-carbon cycles, force
industrial transformation and upgrading, and take a new path of resource-saving and environment-
friendly green development.
(4) International space is increasingly being squeezed. After the international financial crisis in 2008,
the world economy entered a period of economic growth based on long-term structural adjustment.
With the increase of unstable and uncertain factors in the world economic recovery, the world
economic pattern is undergoing major changes, and the global real economy competition has a new
trend. On the other hand, the advantages of factor costs in emerging economies and developing
countries are increasingly prominent. Coupled with the significant impact of the new crown
pneumonia epidemic on international trade and investment, the global industrial chain and supply
chain are facing deep adjustments, which correspondingly bring profound changes to the global
supply structure and demand structure, import and export patterns. China's manufacturing industry
is facing the dual squeeze and double challenge of developed countries gaining momentum and
emerging economies catching up and competing with each other. At the same time, after the rapid
rise of China's economy, it has become the main "variable" that the world economic power considers
to deal with, especially the United States and other countries do not want to see socialist China
develop and grow, and do everything possible to hinder China's economic development.

In the face of a more complex external environment, China urgently needs to cultivate new
advantages in international competition.
Therefore, to enter the new normal, we must accurately grasp the general trend of economic
development, not only see the appearance of economic growth rate shifting, but also grasp the trend
of development mode transformation, structural adjustment and power conversion in essence, and
promote the evolution of China's economy to a high-quality development stage.
3. the new normal has not changed the fundamentals of China's long-term
economic development
Under the new normal, although China's economy is facing downward pressure, the fundamentals
of long-term economic development have not changed, the good foundation and conditions
supporting sustained economic growth have not changed, China's development is still in a period of
important strategic opportunities, with sufficient resilience, huge potential and continuous bursting
of innovation vitality. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out at the Central Economic Work
Conference held on December 19-21, 2018: "The world is facing major changes unprecedented in
a century, and crises and opportunities coexist in the midst of changes, which brings great
opportunities for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. We must be good at turning crises
into opportunities, turning crises into security, and grasping the new connotations of important
strategic opportunities.” 1 This requires accurate identification, scientific response, and proactive
change, analysis of the economic situation with a comprehensive, dialectical and long-term
perspective, research and judgment of development opportunities from the dimension of time and
space, be good at nurturing new opportunities in crises, open up new situations in changes, and grasp
the new connotations of important strategic opportunities.
(1) Although the economic growth rate has slowed down, its comprehensive strength has been
significantly improved. In 2019, China's GDP increased by 6.1%, with a total volume of more than
99 trillion yuan, accounting for more than 16% of the world economy and contributing 30% to world
economic growth. Today, China is the world's second largest economy, the largest manufacturing
country, the largest foreign exchange reserves, and the largest country in goods trade. Made in China,
created in China, and built in China highlight China's new comparative advantages.
(2) Changes in the international environment have brought new opportunities for China to
participate in global governance. The anti-globalization of some countries has caused certain
negative impacts on international trade and investment, increased global economic risks, and
intensified global competition for capital and products, but it will not change the historical trend of
globalization.

Globalization has entered a new stage, and the future globalization is no longer determined only by
the West, and emerging economies have increasingly become an important force driving
globalization. The "new globalization", based on the principles of equal treatment, benefit sharing,
inclusiveness and reciprocity, represents the future development direction of mankind. This
provides a major historical opportunity for China, which advocates and actively practices the
construction of a community with a shared future for mankind, to become a "leader" of new
globalization, which will greatly enhance China's voice and influence in global governance.
(3) The scientific and technological revolution brings new opportunities for technological and
industrial upgrading. Science and technology have become the most important variable affecting
the world economic cycle and an important factor determining the quality of the economy. A new
round of scientific and technological revolution is shaping the global economic structure and
political landscape. In the face of new opportunities for the integrated development of digitalization,
networking and intelligence, China has a good foundation and growth potential in the fields of 5G
technology, industrial Internet, Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence and deep
integration of manufacturing, and the development prospects are very broad.
(4) China has a domestic market with huge potential, and the resilience and room for maneuver of
the economy are large. In 2019, China's per capita GDP exceeded $10,000, which is at the level of
upper-middle-income countries according to the World Bank's criteria. At present, there are more
than 400 million middle-income groups in China, which is the world's largest and most growing
middle-income group, with huge consumption potential.
At the same time, we must also see that the period of strategic opportunities is also an important
period of testing, and under the new normal, we must maintain determination, make good use of
opportunities, adhere to the general tone of seeking progress while maintaining stability, and
promote sustained and healthy economic development. The general tone of seeking progress while
maintaining stability is an important principle of governing the country and is also a methodology
for doing economic work well. Stability is the main tone and the overall situation. It is necessary to
use "stability" to cope with "change", adhere to stable employment, stable finance, stable foreign
trade, stable foreign investment, stable investment, and stable expectations, especially in the face of
the adverse impact of the new crown pneumonia epidemic. It is also necessary to fully implement
the tasks of ensuring the employment of residents, ensuring the basic people's livelihood, ensuring
market entities, ensuring food and energy security, ensuring the stability of the industrial chain and
supply chain, and ensuring the operation of the grassroots level, boosting market confidence,
enhancing the people's sense of gain, happiness and security, and maintaining sustained and healthy
economic development and overall social stability. Under the premise of stability, it is necessary to
make progress in key areas, use "progress" to achieve "stability", take the initiative, and
comprehensively deepen reform Accelerate the optimization and upgrading of the economic
structure, enhance the ability of scientific and technological innovation, accelerate green
development, actively participate in the reform of the global economic governance system, and
accelerate the promotion of high-quality economic development, so as to fundamentally achieve
stable economic and social operation.

Section 2: Deepen supply-side structural reform
Promoting supply-side structural reform is a major innovation to adapt to and lead the new normal
of economic development, an active choice to adapt to the new situation of comprehensive national
strength competition after the international financial crisis, and an inevitable requirement for
promoting the high-quality development of China's economy. Comrade Xi Jinping first proposed
"supply-side structural reform" at the 11th meeting of the Central Financial and Economic Leading
Group in early November 2015, pointing out that "while appropriately expanding aggregate demand,
efforts should be made to strengthen supply-side structural reform and focus on improving the
quality and efficiency of the supply system.", enhance the momentum of sustained economic growth,
and promote the overall leap in the level of social productivity in China.”1
1. adhere to the supply-side structural reform as the main line
Adhering to the supply-side structural reform as the main line is the general trend and the situation.
Economic development has entered a new normal, the main contradiction of China's economic
development has been transformed into structural problems, the main aspect of the contradiction is
on the supply side, mainly manifested in the supply structure can not adapt to the change of demand
structure. At this time, demand policies that focus on solving the problem of short-cycle economic
fluctuations will not only be difficult to deal with the structural problems that arise in the long-term
cycle, but may also further exacerbate structural imbalances, resulting in increased debt,
overcapacity, and even declining growth. Whether it is the United States after World War II or the
major economies after the 2008 international financial crisis, they basically adopt Keynesian
demand management policies to stimulate the economy, and their economic growth is prone to
decline again after a short-term recovery, or even stagflation. Therefore, we must adjust economic
development policies, exert efforts from the supply side, and promote supply-side structural reform.
The so-called supply-side structural reform

“That is, starting from improving the quality of supply, we should use reform methods to promote
structural adjustment, correct distortions in factor allocation, expand effective supply, improve the
adaptability and flexibility of the supply structure to changes in demand, improve total factor
productivity, better meet the needs of the broad masses of the people, and promote sustained and
healthy economic and social development." 1 To accurately grasp the profound connotation of
supply-side structural reform, it is necessary to grasp the three key points of "supply-side",
"structure" and "reform.”
"Supply side" means that the main contradiction of economic operation is on the supply side. Supply
and demand are two fundamental aspects of the intrinsic relationship of the market economy. Supply
management and demand management are two basic methods of macro-management of the
operation of the market economy, with the aim of maintaining the basic balance between total social
supply and total social demand in terms of total volume and structure, so as to promote sustained
and healthy economic development. In actual economic operation, if the main contradiction appears
on the supply side, the macroeconomic management method is mainly supply management; if the
main contradiction appears on the demand side, the macroeconomic management method is mainly
based on demand management. On January 18, 2016, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out in his speech
at the seminar for major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to study and
implement the spirit of the Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee: "Demand-
side management focuses on solving aggregate problems and pays attention to short-term regulation,
mainly by regulating taxation, fiscal expenditure, monetary credit, etc. to stimulate or suppress
demand. In turn, it drives economic growth. Supply-side management focuses on solving structural
problems, focusing on stimulating economic growth momentum, mainly improving the quality and
efficiency of the supply system by optimizing factor allocation and adjusting the production
structure, and then promoting economic growth. 2 In recent years, with the changes in the
contradiction between supply and demand in China's macroeconomic operation, the main
contradiction is on the supply side, and macroeconomic management needs to change from focusing
on demand management to focusing on supply management.
"Structural" means that the contradiction on the supply side is mainly "structure" rather than
"aggregate.” Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Although the prominent contradictions and problems
facing China's economic operation have cyclical and aggregate factors, the root cause is major
structural imbalances. ”3

To solve the structural imbalance, we must find ways and formulate policies from the supply side
and structural reform, use reform methods to promote structural adjustment, reduce ineffective and
low-end supply, expand effective and medium-to-high-end supply, and enhance the adaptability and
flexibility of the supply structure to changes in demand. To this end, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed
out: "The three words 'structural' are very important, and it is okay to refer to 'supply-side reform',
but we must not forget the three words 'structural'."1
"Reform" means that the way to solve the structural contradictions on the supply side is to deepen
reform. The fundamental reason for the supply-side and structural problems in economic operation
is that there are institutional obstacles, the decisive role of the market in the allocation of resources
is insufficient, and the government intervenes too much. To solve these problems, we must rely on
reform and innovation. On the one hand, it is necessary to give play to the decisive role of the market
in the allocation of resources, actively and steadily promote market-oriented reform in terms of
breadth and depth, greatly reduce the government's direct allocation of resources, let the market play
a full role in all areas that can play a role, and promote the allocation of resources to maximize
benefits and optimize efficiency; on the other hand, the market plays a decisive role in the allocation
of resources, not all of them. China practices a socialist market economic system, and we must still
persistently bring into play the superiority of our socialist system and give play to the positive role
of the party and government. It is necessary to effectively transform the functions of the government,
clearly define the boundary between the government and the market, and let the government play a
role in maintaining macroeconomic stability, strengthening and optimizing public services, ensuring
fair competition, strengthening market supervision, maintaining market order, promoting
sustainable development, promoting common prosperity, and making up for market failures. It is
necessary to deepen the reform of the administrative system, innovate administrative management
methods, optimize the way the government plays its role, reduce administrative orders, rely more
on market means and legal means, and on the basis of respecting market laws, use reform to
stimulate market vitality, use policies to guide market expectations, use planning to clarify the
direction of investment, and use the rule of law to regulate market behavior.
To promote supply-side structural reform, we must grasp three basic requirements: First, the
ultimate goal is to meet demand. It is necessary to deeply study market changes, understand actual
needs and potential needs, and better meet the needs of the people for a better life in the liberation
and development of social productive forces. Second, the main direction of attack is to improve the
quality of supply. It is necessary to reduce ineffective supply, expand effective supply, focus on
improving the quality of the entire supply system, and improve the adaptability of the supply
structure to the demand structure.

Third, the fundamental way is to deepen reform. It is necessary to improve the institutional
mechanism in which the market plays a decisive role in the allocation of resources, deepen the
reform of the administrative management system, break the monopoly, build a more perfect market-
oriented allocation system and mechanism for factors, and make the price mechanism truly guide
the allocation of resources. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen incentives and encourage
innovation, enhance the endogenous power of micro subjects, improve profitability, improve labor
productivity, improve total factor productivity, and increase potential growth rate.
To deepen supply-side structural reform, the general requirement is the eight-character policy of
"consolidation, strengthening, upgrading and smoothing.” It is necessary to consolidate the
achievements of "three to one reduction and one supplement", promote more industries with excess
capacity to speed up the liquidation, reduce all kinds of business costs in the whole society, and
increase the intensity of making up for shortcomings in infrastructure and other fields. It is necessary
to enhance the vitality of micro-subjects, give play to the subjective initiative of enterprises and
entrepreneurs, establish fair, open and transparent market rules and a business environment based
on the rule of law, promote positive incentives and survival of the fittest, and develop more high-
quality enterprises. It is necessary to improve the level of the industrial chain, pay attention to the
use of technological innovation and scale effects to form new competitive advantages, and cultivate
and develop new industrial clusters. It is necessary to smooth the national economic cycle, accelerate
the construction of a unified, open, competitive and orderly modern market system, improve the
ability of the financial system to serve the real economy, and form a virtuous circle of domestic
market and production subjects, economic growth and employment expansion, and finance and real
economy.
2. supply-side structural reform is different from the supply-side school
Soon after the supply-side structural reform was proposed, some people equated it with the Western
supply-side school. To this end, Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "First of all, I want to make
it clear that the supply-side structural reform we are talking about is not the same thing as the supply-
side school of Western economics, and we cannot regard the supply-side structural reform as a copy
of the Western supply-side school, and we must prevent some people from using their explanations
to promote 'neoliberalism' and take the opportunity to create negative public opinion."1
The Western supply-side school is an economic theory produced in response to the "stagflation"
problem in the United States and other Western countries in the 70s of the 20th century. The supply-
side school believes that stagflation is completely the cumulative effect of the long-term
implementation of Keynesian demand management policies, so in terms of policy propositions, one
is to reduce taxes, especially marginal tax rates, and the other is to reduce government intervention.

The theory and policy propositions of the supply-side school were valued by then US President
Reagan, and became the basis for the Reagan administration's policy formulation in the 80s of the
20th century, forming the so-called "Reagan economics.”
The supply-side structural reform is the product of combining the basic principles of Marxist
political economy with China's practice. In the Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy,
Marx analyzed the dialectical relationship between the four links of production, distribution,
exchange and consumption in the process of social reproduction, and discussed the appropriate
proportional relationship between the two categories in Capital, Volume 2, Part 3, "Reproduction
and Circulation of Total Social Capital.” The balance between supply and demand in quantity and
structure is deeply analyzed. These ideas have important guiding significance for China's supply-
side structural reform.
The main differences between supply-side structural reform and Western supply-side schools are:
First, the theoretical basis is different. The theoretical basis of supply-side structural reform is
Marxist political economy and Xi Jinping's socialist economic thought with Chinese characteristics
for a new era. The supply-side theory is based on neoliberalism based on "market omnipotence" and
"Say's law." Therefore, unlike the laissez-faire ideology of the supply-side school that opposes
government intervention, supply-side structural reform implements economic policies in accordance
with the idea of "combining the market and the government" to "make the market play a decisive
role in the allocation of resources and better play the role of the government", emphasizing the
dialectical unity of supply and demand.
Second, policy instruments are different. In addition to the supply-side school's tax cuts as an
important part of its policy platform, the Reagan administration also implemented measures such as
accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits to stimulate investment, while advocating
deregulation, balanced budgets, and lower inflation. The supply-side structural reform is to use
reform methods to promote structural adjustment, reduce ineffective and low-end supply, expand
effective and medium-to-high-end supply, enhance the adaptability and flexibility of the supply
structure to changes in demand, and improve total factor productivity. Tax reduction is only one of
the contents of supply-side structural reform, in addition to tax reduction, supply-side structural
reform emphasizes the adjustment of the supply structure through reform, the implementation of
"three to one reduction and one supplement", while more use of market-oriented, rule-of-law means,
in the "consolidation, Strengthen, upgrade and smooth "efforts to improve the quality of the supply
system.
Third, the reform goals are different. The goal of supply-side reforms was not only to get out of the
"stagflation" dilemma of the time, but also to return to the laissez-faire market economy tradition
advocated by classical economics, and to change the government intervention in the economy over
the past few decades to achieve long-term economic growth and prosperity.

Although the ultimate goal of supply-side structural reform is also to achieve long-term economic
growth and prosperity, the specific goals are very different from those of the supply-side school.
The goal of supply-side structural reform is by no means to implement a laissez-faire market
economy, not to get rid of the problem of "stagflation", but to focus on improving the quality and
efficiency of the supply system, enhancing the momentum of sustained economic growth, promoting
the overall leap in China's social productivity level, and making China's supply capacity better meet
the growing needs of the people for a better life.
3. the way of supply-side structural reform is to increase effective supply
The way of supply-side structural reform is mainly to increase the supply of effective systems,
increase the supply of effective technology, and increase the supply of high-quality products.
First, deepen the reform of the market economy system and increase the supply of effective systems.
Entering the new normal, whether China's economy has vitality and momentum, the key lies in the
market players. To stimulate the vitality of market entities, the key is to deepen reform, clearly
define the boundary between the government and the market, and change the adjustment of the
economic structure from government-led to market-led. It is necessary to give full play to the
decisive role of the market in the allocation of resources, give better play to the role of the
government, straighten out the relationship between the government and enterprises, the relationship
between the government and society, and release the vitality of economic subjects. To deepen
supply-side structural reform, we must focus on deepening economic structural reform by improving
the property rights system and market-oriented configuration of factors, and resolutely break down
the institutional obstacles that restrict the vitality and momentum of development. First, adhere to
and improve the basic economic system. We must unswervingly consolidate and develop the public-
owned economy, unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public-
owned economy, adhere to the principle of distribution according to work as the main body and the
coexistence of multiple distribution methods, accelerate the improvement of the socialist market
economic system, improve the scientific and technological innovation system and mechanism, and
build a new system of a higher-level open economy. In accordance with the spirit of the "Opinions
of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Accelerating the Improvement of the
Socialist Market Economy System in the New Era", comprehensively improve the basic systems of
market economy such as property rights, market access, and fair competition. The second is to
deepen the reform of "decentralization, management and service" and promote the reduction of
institutional transaction costs. Further reduce the negative list of market quasi-persons, and promote
the universal implementation of "non-prohibited access.” The government should minimize the
direct allocation of market resources and direct intervention in microeconomic activities, strengthen
supervision during and after the event, accelerate the reform of factor marketization and the
formation of a competitive market system.

Let the market regulate everything that the market can regulate independently, and let the enterprise
do what it can do. The third is to innovate and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, give
play to the strategic guiding role of the national development plan, improve the coordination
mechanism of fiscal, monetary, industrial, regional, consumption, investment and other economic
policies, accelerate the establishment of a modern fiscal system, deepen the reform of the financial
system, reform and improve the basic system of the capital market, and promote the healthy and
stable development of the multi-level capital market.
Second, improve total factor productivity through scientific and technological innovation and
increase effective technology supply. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
clearly pointed out that "we must adhere to quality first, benefit first, take supply-side structural
reform as the main line, promote the quality change, efficiency change, power change of economic
development, and improve total factor productivity.”1 The so-called "total factor productivity", often
referred to as the rate of technological progress, is a measure of the contribution of technological
progress to economic growth. From the perspective of the imbalance, uncoordination and
unsustainability faced by China's economic development, based on the realization of the
transformation of economic growth power, it is necessary to adhere to innovation to lead
development, cultivate and expand new momentum, and strive to improve total factor productivity.
The innovation practice of various countries shows that enterprises are the main body of innovation
and the most active innovation unit, and the government needs to provide a good institutional
environment for enterprises to engage in innovation activities. To deepen supply-side structural
reform, we must increase effective technology supply through scientific and technological
innovation. First, it is necessary to increase the support for basic research and applied basic research,
strengthen original innovation, and strengthen the research of key core technologies; second,
promote the reform of the scientific and technological system and accelerate the transformation of
scientific and technological achievements into real productive forces; third, improve the integrated
innovation mechanism of production, education and research with enterprises as the main body;
fourth, improve the venture capital system and give play to the supporting role of finance in high-
tech industries and technological innovation; fifth, strengthen the protection of intellectual property
rights and improve relevant laws and regulations. Promote industrial upgrading through the
improvement of independent innovation capabilities, and give play to the leading and supporting
role of innovation driving in improving the quality and efficiency of enterprise supply.
Third, while moderately expanding aggregate demand, increase the supply of high-quality products.
Comrade Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out: "Supply and demand are the two basic aspects of the
internal relationship of the market economy, and they are both antagonistic and unified dialectical
relations

Without demand, supply cannot be realized, new demand can give birth to new supply; without
supply, demand cannot be satisfied, and new supply can create new demand. 1 Therefore,
emphasizing the adjustment of the supply structure does not mean ignoring demand. On the contrary,
the next stage of supply structure adjustment must be carried out around the transformation and
upgrading of consumer demand. Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, China has bid
farewell to the shortage economy, a new round of upgrading and transformation of the consumption
structure of residents, more to "personalized and diversified" consumption, and China's economy
has entered a consumption-oriented era. How to meet the needs of the people for a better life has
become a new space for economic development. It is necessary to promote the formation of a strong
domestic market and continue to release the potential of domestic demand. Give full play to the
basic role of consumption and the key role of investment, stabilize effective domestic demand, and
provide strong support for the smooth operation of the economy. It is necessary to strive to meet the
final demand, improve product quality, accelerate the development of service industries such as
education, childcare, pension, medical care, culture, and tourism, improve the consumption
environment, and enhance consumption capacity. In China's economic structure, investment still
has a lot of room for development. From the perspective of supply-side structural reform, the focus
of expanding investment is to increase infrastructure construction in emerging fields such as
artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, and increase intercity transportation, logistics,
municipal infrastructure, and rural infrastructure construction.
Section 3: Promoting high-quality economic development
The fundamental purpose of adapting to and leading the new normal of economic development is
to strive to achieve high-quality economic development. This has become the fundamental
requirement for determining development ideas, formulating economic policies, and implementing
macroeconomic regulation and control at present and for some time to come.
1. China's economy has shifted from a stage of high-speed growth to a stage
of high-quality development
Practice is developing and awareness is increasing. On the basis of adhering to adapting to and
leading the new normal of economic development, the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China further clearly pointed out:

"China's economy has shifted from a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage",1
which is the basic feature of China's economic development at this stage. Shifting from a high-speed
growth stage to a high-quality development stage means that the growth rate will shift from the
original high-speed growth to medium-high-speed growth, which means that economic
development is in a critical period of transforming the development mode, optimizing the economic
structure, and transforming the growth momentum. This is highly consistent with the four basic
characteristics of the new normal of economic development, and is a deepening of the new normal
of economic development.
China's economy has shifted from a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage,
which is an important judgment made by the Party Central Committee in accordance with changes
in the international and domestic environment, especially changes in China's development
conditions and development stages. "From" means that the historical curtain has been opened from
the stage of high-speed growth to the stage of high-quality development, and it is inevitable;
"turning" means that China's economy is only marching towards high-quality development, and has
not "turned" to the stage of high-quality development. In a country with a huge economy and
population, it is not easy to shift from a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage,
and it may be a long historical stage. In this process, our economy faces two types of thresholds.
One is the unconventional threshold unique to China's economic development at this stage, for
which it is necessary to fight the three major battles of preventing and resolving major risks, precise
poverty alleviation, and pollution prevention and control; the other is a conventional long-term
threshold, that is, transforming the mode of economic development, optimizing the economic
structure, and transforming the growth momentum, so it is necessary to build a modern economic
system. Only by crossing these two types of thresholds can China's economy truly achieve high-
quality development.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that promoting high-quality development "is an inevitable
requirement for maintaining sustained and healthy economic development", "this is an inevitable
requirement for adapting to the changes in the main contradictions in our society and
comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society and building a modern socialist country
in an all-round way", and "this is an inevitable requirement for development in accordance with
economic laws."2 From the perspective of economic development needs, China is currently in a
period of transformation of economic development mode, the demographic dividend has plummeted,
the marginal return on investment has declined, the resource and environmental constraints have
increased, and the traditional extensive economic development mode of unilaterally pursuing scale
and speed is no longer sustainable. Only by promoting high-quality development and forming a
high-quality, efficient and diversified supply system can we achieve a balance between supply and
demand at a new level and achieve sustained and healthy economic development

From the perspective of the main contradiction in society, the contradiction between the people's
growing need for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development has become the main
contradiction in society, and the focus of the people's needs has shifted from "whether it is good or
not" to "whether it is good or not.” Whether it is to meet the needs of the people for a better life or
to solve the problem of unbalanced and insufficient development, it is necessary to pay more
attention to the quality of economic development. Judging from the requirements of building a
modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way, the 19th CPC National Congress planned
the strategic goal of "two steps." To realize socialist modernization, the economy is the foundation,
the country must be strong, the economy must be strong; the economy must be strong, scale is the
foundation, and quality is the key. Today's world is ushering in a new round of industrial revolution
and technological revolution, scientific and technological strength, innovation ability, human capital,
etc. have become the focus of international competition, scale alone can no longer win in
international competition, must turn to high-quality development. From the perspective of the law
of economic development, economic development is a non-linear spiral upward process, the
accumulation of quantity to a certain stage must be turned to quality improvement, China's economic
development should also follow this law. In 2019, China's total economic volume has reached 99
trillion yuan, ranking second in the world. We must attach importance to quantitative development,
and even more to solving qualitative problems, and put the main energy on promoting high-quality
development.
2. deeply understand the connotation of high-quality development
High-quality economic development can be understood from both narrow and broad perspectives.
In a narrow sense, high-quality economic development means that an economy (or enterprise) can
rationally allocate production factors through scientific and technological means in terms of input,
promote efficiency changes, realize the allocation of resource factors from extensive operation to
intensive and economical operation, and greatly improve the utilization efficiency of resource
factors; It can promote quality change and power change through technological innovation and
management innovation, so that the output quality and efficiency can be significantly improved. In
a broad sense, understanding high-quality economic development is not only limited to the scope of
economic growth, but also considers social, political, cultural and ecological influencing factors.
Specifically, high-quality economic development should contain the following connotations.
First, high-quality development is the development that embodies the new development concept.
The Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee proposed to establish and adhere to
the development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing.
China Aerospace Studies Institute
213
Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
Promoting China's economic and social development according to the new development concept is
a general trend, of which innovation is the first driving force to lead development, focusing on
solving the problem of development power; coordination is the inherent requirement of sustainable
and healthy development, focusing on solving the problem of unbalanced development; green is the
inevitable condition for sustainable development and an important embodiment of people's pursuit
of a better life, focusing on solving the problem of harmony between man and nature; opening up is
the only way for the country to prosper and develop, and focusing on solving the problem of internal
and external linkage of development; Sharing is the essence of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, focusing on solving the problem of social fairness and justice. The new development
concept is China's action guide to solve development problems, enhance development momentum,
and cultivate development advantages.
Second, high-quality development is the development of high-quality supply and high-quality
demand. From the perspective of supply, high-quality development should have a relatively
complete industrial system, networked and intelligent production organization, strong innovation,
brand influence, core competitiveness and the ability to discover and capture demand. From the
perspective of demand, high-quality development should continue to meet the personalized,
diversified and upgrading needs of the people, which in turn leads to changes in the supply system
and structure, and supply changes continue to generate new demand.
Third, high-quality development is the development that maximizes the benefits of input and output.
An important symbol of high-quality development is to continuously improve the input and output
efficiency of labor, capital, land, resources, environment and other factors, continuously improve
the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress, and continuously improve total factor
productivity. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "economic development is to improve the
efficiency of the allocation of resources, especially scarce resources, and to produce as many
products as possible with as few resources as possible and obtain the greatest possible benefits.”1
Fourth, the development of high seat capacity is the development of smooth economic circulation.
The economic cycle is the process of benign interaction between production and circulation,
distribution and consumption, virtual and physical, domestic and foreign, which is the basis for
sustainable economic development. At present, there are three major imbalances in China's economy:
the structural imbalance between supply and demand in the real economy, the imbalance between
finance and the real economy, and the imbalance between real estate and the real economy. This is
a concrete manifestation of the poor economic cycle. To promote high-quality development, we
must smooth the national economic cycle, accelerate the construction of a unified, open, competitive
and orderly modern market system, improve the ability of the financial system to serve the real
economy, and form a virtuous circle of domestic market and production subjects, economic growth
and employment expansion, and finance and real economy.

Fifth, high-quality development is development with scientific and rational distribution. Income
distribution is both the result of economic operation and the driving force of economic development.
The quality of income distribution directly reflects the advantages and disadvantages of the
economic structure. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out when talking about the new normal: "To
promote economic development, we must pay more attention to improving the quality and efficiency
of development. Measuring the quality and efficiency of development means that investment has a
return, products have a market, enterprises have profits, employees have income, the government
has taxes, and the environment has improvement, which is the development we want. 1 The
investment mentioned here has a return, the enterprise has profits, the employees have income, and
the government has taxes, which is how to distribute it reasonably.
3. Accelerate the construction of a modern economic system
To promote high-quality development, we must build a modern economic system. Building a
modern economic system is a major strategic deployment made by Comrade Xi Jinping for
economic construction at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. At present,
China's economic development is in the critical period of transforming the development mode,
optimizing the economic structure, and transforming the growth momentum, and building a modern
economic system is not only an urgent requirement for crossing the threshold, but also a strategic
goal of China's development.
To build a modern economic system, the basic principle is quality first, efficiency first; the main
line is to deepen supply-side structural reform; the basic path is to promote the quality change,
efficiency change, power change of economic development, and improve total factor productivity;
the focus is to accelerate the construction of the real economy, scientific and technological
innovation, modern finance, human resources coordinated development of the industrial system; the
institutional guarantee is to build an economic system with effective market mechanism, vitality of
micro subjects, and degree of macro-control; the fundamental goal is to continuously enhance the
innovation and competitiveness of China's economy. In short, the modern economic system is an
economic system led by the new development concept and high-quality development as the core,
with a reasonable economic structure, strong innovation momentum, intensive development
methods, real economic revitalization, and sound institutional mechanisms.
The modern economic system is an economic system in which the modernization of productive
forces and the modernization of production relations interact benignly. Comrade Xi Jinping was the
third in the 19th Politburo of the CPC Central Committee on January 30, 2018

The collective study pointed out: "The modern economic system is an organic whole composed of
the interrelationships and internal connections of all links, levels and fields of social and economic
activities.1 In this regard, he clearly put forward the organic composition and specific goals of the
"seven systems", that is, (1) build an industrial system led by innovation and coordinated
development, realize the coordinated development of the real economy, scientific and technological
innovation, modern finance, and human resources, and continuously increase the contribution share
of scientific and technological innovation in the development of the real economy. The ability of
modern financial services to the real economy has been continuously enhanced, and the role of
human resources in supporting the development of the real economy has been continuously
optimized(2) Build a unified, open and orderly market system, realize smooth market access, open
and orderly market, full market competition, and standardized market order, and accelerate the
formation of a modern market system in which enterprises operate independently and compete fairly,
consumers freely choose their own consumption, and commodities and factors flow freely and
exchange equally; (3) Build an income distribution system that embodies efficiency and promotes
fairness, and realizes reasonable income distribution, social fairness and justice, All the people will
prosper together, promote the equalization of basic public services, and gradually narrow the income
distribution gap ;(4) Build an urban and rural regional development system that highlights
advantages and coordinates linkages, realizes benign regional interaction, integrated urban and rural
development, and overall optimization of land and sea, and cultivates and gives play to regional
comparative advantages. Strengthen the complementarity of regional advantages and shape a new
pattern of coordinated regional development; (5) Build a resource-saving and environment-friendly
green development system, realize green cycle and low-carbon development, harmonious
coexistence between man and nature, firmly establish and practice the concept that green water and
green mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains, and form a new pattern of harmonious
development and modernization of man and nature;( 6) Build a diversified, balanced, safe and
efficient comprehensive opening system, develop a higher-level open economy, and promote the
transformation of opening up in the direction of optimizing structure, expanding depth and
improving efficiency; (7) Build an economic system that gives full play to the role of the market
and better plays the role of the government, so as to achieve effective market mechanisms, vitality
of micro-subjects, and degree of macro-control.
To build a modern economic system, it is necessary to fulfill the following tasks at present and for
some time to come.
First, vigorously develop the real economy and build a solid foundation for a modern economic
system. The real economy is the foundation of a country's economy, the fundamental source of
wealth creation, and an important pillar of national strength.

In order to create a down-to-earth, hard-working entrepreneurship, industrial prosperity
development environment and social atmosphere. The optimization and upgrading of industrial
structure is a key measure to improve the comprehensive competitiveness of the real economy. It is
necessary to accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, deeply promote
the deep integration of informatization and industrialization, focus on cultivating strategic emerging
industries, vigorously develop the service industry, especially the modern service industry, actively
cultivate new formats and new business models, and build a new system for modern industrial
development. It is necessary to promote the deep integration of the Internet, big data, artificial
intelligence and the real economy, accelerate the digitalization and intelligence of traditional
industries, promote industrial technological change and optimization and upgrading with intelligent
manufacturing as the main direction of attack, promote the fundamental transformation of
manufacturing industry models and enterprise forms, drive "revolution" with "Dingxin", drive stock
with increments, and promote China's industry to move towards the middle and high end of the
global value chain.
The second is to accelerate the implementation of the innovation-driven development strategy and
strengthen the strategic support of the modern economic system. Strengthen the construction of the
national innovation system, step up the layout of national laboratories, reorganize the state key
laboratory system, increase support for the innovation of small and medium-sized enterprises,
strengthen the protection and application of intellectual property rights, and form an effective
innovation incentive mechanism. Promote the deep integration of scientific and technological
innovation and economic and social development, and shape more innovation-driven and first-
mover leading development.
The third is to actively promote the coordinated development of urban and rural areas and optimize
the spatial layout of the modern economic system. It is necessary to cultivate and give play to
regional comparative advantages, implement the main functional area system, strengthen the
complementarity of regional advantages, broaden the development space in coordinated
development, and enhance development stamina in strengthening weak areas. Implement the
coordinated regional development strategy, promote the coordinated development of the Beijing-
Tianjin-Hebei region and the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, build the
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and promote the integrated development of the
Yangtze River Delta, ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.
Solidly promote the strategy of rural revitalization, adhere to the priority development of agriculture
and rural areas, establish and improve the institutional mechanisms and policy systems for integrated
development of urban and rural areas in accordance with the general requirements of prosperous
industry, ecological livability, civilized rural customs, effective governance and rich life, make
overall plans to promote rural economic construction, political construction, cultural construction,
social construction, ecological civilization construction and party building, accelerate the
modernization of rural governance systems and governance capabilities, and accelerate the
modernization of agriculture and rural areas. Take the road of socialist rural revitalization with
Chinese characteristics, let agriculture become a leading industry, make farmers an attractive
occupation, and let the countryside become a beautiful home to live and work in peace and
contentment.
The fourth is to promote all-round opening up and enhance the international competitiveness of the
modern economic system. Make better use of global resources and markets, and promote the
transformation from the opening of commodity and factor flows to the opening of institutions such
as rules.

Relax market access, fully implement the pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list
management system, protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in China,
especially intellectual property rights, and allow sole proprietorship in more fields. We will continue
to actively promote international exchanges and cooperation under the framework of the Belt and
Road.
Fifth, deepen the reform of the economic system and improve the institutional guarantee for the
modern economic system. The reform of the economic system must focus on improving the property
rights system and the market-oriented configuration of factors, so as to achieve effective incentives
for property rights, free flow of factors, flexible price response, fair and orderly competition, and
survival of the fittest. Accelerate the improvement of basic economic systems such as the socialist
market economic system with public ownership as the mainstay, the common development of
various ownership economies, distribution according to work as the mainstay, and the coexistence
of various distribution methods; accelerate the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned
enterprises, further support the development of private enterprises, and stimulate the vitality of
innovation and entrepreneurship in the whole society; accelerate the reform of the fiscal, taxation,
and financial systems, and resolutely eliminate the shortcomings of various systems and
mechanisms.
Comrade Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out: "Building a modern economic system is a big article,
not only a major theoretical proposition, but also a major practical topic." 1 In accordance with the
arrangements and requirements of the Party Central Committee, we must enhance the innovation
and competitiveness of our economy by building a modern economic system, promote China's
economic development to a new vitality, move to a new level, and achieve high-quality development.
4. Improve the party's ability and level of leadership over economic work
To do a good job in economic work, we must strengthen the centralized and unified leadership of
the party Central Committee and enhance the party's ability and level of leadership over economic
work. China's economy is a giant ship, and the larger the volume and the greater the wind and waves,
the more important it is to steer the way. The economy has entered a new normal, and the
development environment facing China has undergone profound changes, and uncertainties and
unstable factors have increased significantly. Economic globalization has encountered twists and
turns, multilateralism has been impacted, the international financial market has been shaken, and
economic and trade frictions have adversely affected enterprises' production and operation and
market expectations; China's economy is facing new and old contradictions intertwined, cyclical
and structural problems are superimposed, and economic operation is stable and changing, and
changes are worried. To achieve multiple goals such as stable growth and risk prevention, complete
various tasks of economic and social development, and properly handle the relationship between the
current and the long term, economic development and environmental protection, and the market and
the government, the difficulty of policy choices and work has increased significantly.

Therefore, we must continuously improve the party's ability and level of leading economic work,
keep the rudder steady and the rudder well, and ensure that the giant ship of China's economy moves
steadily and far-reaching.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "To lead a large socialist country with more than 1.3 billion people,
our party must not only be strong in politics, but also have strong skills.”1 "Leading cadres at all
levels should consciously strengthen study, enhance leadership ability, and improve management
level.”2 This requires leading cadres at all levels to unify their thinking and action with the Party
Central Committee's arrangements for economic work, strengthen study and practice, cultivate
professional ability, constantly enhance their ability to control the market economy, and improve
their ability to manage and deal with economic risks.
(1) Adhere to bottom-line thinking, enhance awareness of danger, and improve risk prevention and
control capabilities. In the face of profound and complex changes in the international environment
and domestic conditions, and in the face of the interweaving of various contradiction risks and
challenges, if the prevention and response are ineffective, it will be transmitted, superimposed,
evolved, and upgraded, so that small contradiction risk challenges develop into large contradiction
risk challenges, local contradiction risk challenges develop into systematic contradiction risk
challenges, international contradiction risk challenges evolve into domestic contradiction risk
challenges, and contradiction risk challenges in the economic field are transformed into
contradiction risk challenges in the political field, and eventually endanger the party's ruling position.
Endangering national security. Therefore, we must adhere to bottom-line thinking, enhance the
awareness of danger, take precautions, accurately study and judge, and properly respond to major
risks that may occur in the economic field.
From the perspective of China's current economic development, to prevent and resolve major risks,
attention should be paid to the following aspects: balance the relationship between stable growth
and risk prevention, grasp the rhythm and intensity; build a long-term mechanism for the stable and
healthy development of the real estate market to prevent real estate ups and downs; strengthen
market psychological analysis, do a good job in assessing the impact of policy introduction on the
financial market, and be good at guiding expectations; strengthen market monitoring, improve risk
early warning and regulatory coordination, and eliminate all kinds of hidden risks in a timely manner;
Effectively solve the problem of difficult and expensive financing for small and medium-sized
enterprises, increase the intensity of assistance to enterprises to stabilize jobs, and implement the
employment priority policy; increase efforts to properly deal with problems such as difficulty in
start-up, implementation, and personnel placement in the disposal of "zombie enterprises",
accelerate the promotion of market clearance, and release a large number of precipitated resources;
adopt effective measures to do a good job in stabilizing employment, finance, foreign trade, foreign
investment, investment, and expectations, and maintain economic operation in a reasonable range.

In the above seven aspects, the most important thing is to guard the bottom line of no systemic
financial risks, and balance the relationship between stable growth and risk prevention. The central
role of finance in the modern economy is reflected in the impact on economic development. Once a
major financial risk occurs, it will cause economic losses to the relevant entities, affect the
development of the real economy, and serious financial risks may even trigger economic crisis or
even social crisis. Therefore, it is necessary to put the prevention and resolution of systemic financial
risks in a more important position, effectively strengthen the party's centralized and unified
leadership over financial work, further deepen the reform of the financial system, improve financial
supervision, strengthen financial security capacity building, and resolutely guard the bottom line of
not occurring systemic financial risks.
(2) Take the initiative to pre-adjust and fine-tune, strengthen policy coordination, and improve
macro-control capabilities. Innovation and improvement of macro-control are objective
requirements for promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance
capacity. Since the reform and opening up, China has gradually explored macro-control methods
with Chinese characteristics, which has played an important role in promoting sustained and healthy
economic and social development. However, new changes in the domestic and international
environment, new requirements for promoting high-quality development, and new problems in
macro-control have put forward higher requirements for innovation and improvement of macro-
control.
First of all, it is necessary to improve the ability to do something and not to do something. Grasp
the boundaries of macro-control and avoid the problem of too much intervention in the operation of
the market and the operation of micro-subjects. The government should resolutely hand over the
matters that should not be managed to the market, minimize the direct allocation of resources, give
full play to the decisive role of the market in the allocation of resources, better play its own role,
and strengthen and improve the functions of macro-control, market supervision, public services,
social management, and environmental protection. Strengthen the overall planning and coordination
of policies, and reasonably grasp the timing, rhythm and intensity of the implementation of various
policies. For the new situations and new problems arising in economic operation, we should further
strengthen directional regulation and camera regulation on the basis of interval regulation, realize
the formulation of macro-control goals and the institutionalization of the use of policy means,
enhance the pertinence, forward-looking, flexibility and coordination of macro-control, and promote
the balanced coordination and linkage of multiple objectives, multiple policies and multiple reforms.
Second, it is necessary to enhance the comprehensive capability of macroeconomic regulation and
control. The first is to integrate domestic and international factors, take a broader global perspective,
learn from foreign useful experience, and actively adapt to and lead the adjustment and construction
of international economic rules. The second is to integrate the docking of the central and local
governments. Do a good job in top-level design at the central level to maximize local enthusiasm;

At the local level, it is necessary to strengthen the understanding, implementation and transmission
of macroeconomic policies, refine and decompose the overall goals according to local conditions,
and guide market entities to actively respond to and realize macro policy intentions. The third is to
integrate the coordination of various departments. Strengthen the coordination of policy timing,
boundary, direction, and goals, and realize the optimal combination of fiscal, monetary, industrial,
regional and other policies.
Third, it is necessary to improve the ability of macro policies to coordinate and coordinate.
Comprehensively use total regulation and structural regulation policies to promote effective
coordination of development planning, fiscal, monetary, industrial, regional, consumption,
investment and other policies. Focus on in-depth research on major issues restricting economic and
social development, strengthen policy research, and promote the transformation of research results
into strategic concepts, development plans, policy ideas, reform plans, major projects, etc. Make
overall plans to promote the implementation of major policies, grasp the direction, intensity, rhythm
and timing of policies, avoid excessive overlapping or mutual cancellation of policy effects, play a
combination of policies that take into account overall planning, each with its own emphasis, and
cooperate with each other, strengthen the comprehensive assessment of policies, especially major
policies, and promptly propose improvement measures.
(3) Grasp social psychological changes, respond to social concerns in a timely manner, and improve
the ability to actively guide market expectations. Good expectations often translate into orderly
economic behavior, giving people the motivation, patience, and confidence to actively seek
solutions to real-world problems and engage in long-term, creative activities. Unstable expectations
often lead to short-sightedness of market entities and risk agglomeration. Under the condition of
high informationization, the risk of agglomeration can easily spread, bringing challenges to national
economic security. Therefore, actively guiding market expectations is related to sustained and
healthy economic development and overall social stability. Only by forming good expectations can
we unite our efforts, strengthen confidence in development, overcome various risks and challenges,
and successfully complete various reform and development tasks.
To stabilize expectations, it is necessary not only to stabilize the present and eliminate the
interference of short-term factors, but also to strengthen confidence in development and plan for the
long term. First, we should adopt more reform methods, make more use of market-oriented and law-
based means, and effectively stimulate the creativity of micro-subjects. It is necessary to focus on
the pain points and difficulties of economic and social development, create a legal institutional
environment for development through reform, and provide stable expectations for society. The
second is to improve the ability of expected management, establish and improve the policy target
management and major decision-making disclosure mechanism for various regulatory policies that
can significantly affect economic operation, and clearly convey the intention, orientation and
operating rules of policies and regulations to the market. At the same time, it is necessary to maintain
the stability and consistency of economic policies, effectively guide market behavior, and form
reasonable social expectations. Third, it is necessary to transmit the original intention of the policy
and the intention of reform to all levels of economic and social development, strengthen the work
of guiding public opinion, effectively guide the cadres and masses to rationally understand the
current economic situation, and accurately grasp the orientation of macro policies

Prevent market entities from misjudging the effect of policies, prevent fragmented expectations of
"blind people touching elephants", and prevent non-professional and irrational value orientations
from misguiding expectations. It is necessary to respond to social concerns in a timely manner,
objectively report specific facts, and reflect the overall picture from a macro perspective; recognize
short-term local risks, strengthen analytical capabilities, and clarify policy orientation.
(4) Fully mobilize the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the whole society, and improve the
ability to gather talents and use talents. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "As long as there is the
support and participation of the people, there will be no difficulties that cannot be overcome, and
there will be no hurdles that cannot be overcome."1 To uphold the party's centralized and unified
leadership over economic work and improve the party's ability and level of leadership over
economic work is to unite people's hearts and minds, pool people's strength, and fully mobilize the
enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the whole society to overcome difficulties and promote
development. It is necessary to respect the initiative of the masses, extensively listen to their
opinions and suggestions, and pool the wisdom and strength of the broad masses of the people on
development. It is necessary to make good use of all kinds of talents, provide a stage and
environment for workers, intellectuals, entrepreneurs and innovative talents in all walks of life to
play a role, so that all labor, knowledge, technology, management and capital are full of vitality and
burst out in competition, and all sources of creating social wealth can fully flow. It is necessary to
enhance the vitality of micro-subjects, give play to the subjective initiative of enterprises and
entrepreneurs, establish fair, open and transparent market rules and a business environment based
on the rule of law, and further promote positive incentives and survival of the fittest.
Leading cadres at all levels are the backbone of governing the country and should strive to become
experts in promoting high-quality development. It is necessary to strengthen the study of modern
economic knowledge, enhance leadership ability, improve management level, and continuously
enhance the systematic, predictive, and creative nature of decision-making, work, and control efforts.
It is necessary to strengthen the investigation and study of economic operation, be good at finding
ideas and methods in study and practice, and ensure that all measures to promote high-quality
economic development are implemented and effective. It is necessary to speed up the creation and
improvement of the institutional environment, improve mechanisms such as performance evaluation,
performance appraisal, and interest incentives that match high-quality development, and further
strengthen the ideological consciousness and action consciousness of leading cadres at all levels to
promote high-quality development.
