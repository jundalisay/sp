Chapter IX: Upholding and Developing Socialist Democratic Politics

Developing people's democracy and promoting political civilization is the consistent stand and
unremitting pursuit of the Communist Party of China. After the founding of New China, especially
since the beginning of reform and opening up, the party has persistently integrated Marxist political
theory with China's specific realities and the characteristics of the times, and has embarked on a
path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics that suits the national conditions.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has consolidated its foundation and forged ahead into the future,
adhered to and strengthened the party's comprehensive leadership, explored and developed socialist
democratic politics with the people as the masters of the country, incorporated the comprehensive
rule of law into the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, and put forward a series of new concepts,
ideas and strategies, which greatly enriched the theory and practice of socialist democratic political
construction with Chinese characteristics, and became a scientific guide for adhering to the path of
socialist political development with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Section 1: Follow the path of socialist political development
with Chinese characteristics
The path of political development is of decisive significance in the political life of the country. There
are many examples of social turmoil, national division, and political death due to the wrong choice
of political development path. For China, a large developing country with a history of more than
5,000 years of civilization, 56 ethnic groups and a population of 1.4 billion, adhering to the correct
path of political development is a major issue that has a bearing on the fundamentals and the overall
situation.

The political development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the inevitable result of
the long-term struggle of the Chinese people in modern times, and an inevitable requirement for
adhering to the essential attributes of the party and practicing the fundamental purpose of the party.
The key to adhering to the path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics is to
adhere to the organic unity of the party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country, and the rule
of law, take ensuring that the people are masters of the country as the foundation, and aim at
enhancing the vitality of the party and the country and mobilizing the people's enthusiasm,
continuously expanding people's democracy and developing socialist political civilization.
1. Taking the path of socialist political development with Chinese
characteristics is a historical necessity
Each country's political path has its own unique aspects, which are the result of long-term
development and evolution on the basis of historical inheritance, cultural tradition, and economic
and social development. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The reason why the socialist political
system with Chinese characteristics is viable, vigorous and efficient is because it grows from China's
social soil. The socialist political system with Chinese characteristics has always grown and is
growing in China's social soil, and if it is to continue to grow in the future, it must also be deeply
rooted in China's social soil. " 1 The political development path of socialism with Chinese
characteristics is the practice and creation of the Communist Party of China in uniting and leading
the Chinese people and carrying out long-term and unremitting struggle based on China's reality.
After entering the modern era, various political forces in Chinese society have appeared, but they
have not found a plan suitable for the national conditions. Holding high the glorious banner of
democracy, the Communist Party of China has waged a heroic struggle for nearly a century. Since
its founding, the party has taken the realization of the people's mastery as its own responsibility, and
has always taken standing firm on the people's standpoint, upholding the people's dominant position,
and ensuring the realization of the people's fundamental interests as the starting point and end point
of all work. After the founding of New China, the Party united and led the people to carry out
socialist transformation, established the basic socialist system and promoted socialist construction,
completed the most extensive and profound social reform in the history of the Chinese nation, and
laid the fundamental political prerequisite and institutional foundation for all development and
progress in contemporary China.

In the new period of reform and opening up, the Party has continuously deepened the reform of the
political system, developed socialist democratic politics, improved the leadership system of the
Party and the state, comprehensively advanced the rule of law, improved the socialist legal system
with Chinese characteristics, made the institutional guarantee and rule of law guarantee for the
people being masters of the country more powerful, developed the cause of human rights in an all-
round way, consolidated the patriotic united front, and enriched the content, more convenient
channels and more diverse forms for the people to enjoy and exercise democratic rights in
accordance with the law. From the revision, improvement and in-depth implementation of the
Constitution, to the continuous improvement of the basic political system of the People's Congress
and the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, the system of regional ethnic autonomy and the system of grassroots
mass autonomy, to the promotion of the reform of the leadership system of the Party and the state,
the promotion of the rule of law, the rule of law in socialist democratic politics, and the strengthening
of supervision and restraint on the operation of power, all these have fully demonstrated the Party's
unremitting efforts and great achievements in promoting socialist democratic politics. As Comrade
Xi Jinping pointed out: "Since the reform and opening up, our party has united and led the people
to make great progress in developing socialist democratic politics, successfully opened up and
adhered to the path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics, and established
the correct direction for the realization of the broadest people's democracy."1
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has taken the development of socialist democratic politics as
an important part of promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance
capabilities, and promoted the improvement and development of socialist democratic politics in the
comprehensive deepening of reform, and the construction of socialist political civilization has
achieved fruitful results: actively develop socialist democratic politics, promote the comprehensive
rule of law, the leadership of the Party, the people are masters of the country, The construction of
an organic and unified system for governing the country according to law has been comprehensively
strengthened, the party's comprehensive leadership system and mechanism have been continuously
improved, inner-party democracy has become more extensive, socialist consultative democracy has
been comprehensively developed, and the patriotic united front has consolidated and developed.
Scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair justice, and law-abiding by the whole people have
been further advanced, the construction of a rule-of-law country, a rule-of-law government, and a
rule-of-law society have mutually reinforced, the socialist rule of law system with Chinese
characteristics has been increasingly improved, and the concept of rule of law in the whole society
has been significantly enhanced. The reform of the state supervision system has achieved practical
results, and the reform of the administrative system, the reform of the judicial system, the restraint
on the operation of power, and the establishment of a supervision system have been effectively
implemented. All these have provided a strong guarantee for forming a stable and united political
situation and a clean political environment, for mobilizing and stimulating the enthusiasm of the
people for reform, opening up, and modernization, and for creating a more vibrant, standardized and
orderly society.

Historical practice shows that the path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics
is a correct path that conforms to China's national conditions and ensures that the people are masters
of their own country, and has strong vitality and broad development prospects. It conforms to the
requirements of the development of the times, promotes the progress of national civilization and
guarantees the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation; it fully embodies the common will of the people,
safeguards the people's democratic rights and safeguards the fundamental interests of the people.
The path of political development of socialism with Chinese characteristics is deeply rooted in
contemporary Chinese history and practice, is the choice of history and the people, and is the
fundamental guarantee for the Party and the people to withstand the tests of various difficulties and
risks and smoothly advance socialist modernization.
2. the political development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics
has demonstrated its unique advantages
The path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics is conducive to giving play
to the characteristics and advantages of the socialist system, developing people's democracy,
promoting economic and social development, safeguarding national unity, ethnic unity, people's
well-being and social harmony, and providing a strong political guarantee for the Party to unite and
lead the people to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Demonstrate the superiority of socialism. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The socialist system
with Chinese characteristics insists on organically combining the fundamental political system and
basic political system with the basic economic system and various institutional mechanisms and
other specific systems, insists on organically combining the democratic system at the national level
with the grassroots democratic system, and insists on organically combining the party's leadership,
the people being masters of the country and governing the country according to law, which conforms
to China's national conditions, embodies the characteristics and advantages of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and is the fundamental institutional guarantee for China's development and
progress."1 The development and improvement of the political development path of socialism with
Chinese characteristics has effectively ensured that the people enjoy broader and fuller rights and
freedoms and ensured that the people have extensively participated in national and social
governance; effectively regulated state political relations, enhanced national cohesion, and formed
a stable and united political situation; effectively promoted the liberation and development of social
productive forces, promoted various undertakings of modernization, and promoted the continuous
improvement of the people's quality of life and standards;

It has effectively safeguarded national independence and self-determination, safeguarded national
sovereignty, security and development interests, safeguarded the well-being of the Chinese people
and the Chinese nation, and fully demonstrated the superiority of socialism.
Provide a fundamental guarantee for people's democracy. Democracy is fundamentally a political
institutional arrangement, involving major issues such as the state and the form of government. As
early as 1940, Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly pointed out in "On New Democracy" that "without
an appropriate form of political power organs, the state cannot be represented",1 which also clarified
the internal relationship between the state system determining the political system and the political
system reflecting the state system. China's Constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China
is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on
the alliance of workers and peasants", and "all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to
the people."2 As far as the state system is concerned, socialist democracy is fundamentally different
from any form of democracy in Chinese history. As far as the form of government is concerned, the
Constitution stipulates that China implements the system of people's congresses to ensure that the
people are masters of their own country. This shows that socialist democracy with Chinese
characteristics adheres to the people's dominant position and protects the people's rights in political,
economic, cultural and social aspects in an institutionalized form. The people are guaranteed to
exercise their rights to democratic election, democratic decision-making, democratic management
and democratic supervision, and to administer state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings and
social affairs in accordance with the law; It is guaranteed that state organs and their functionaries
accept the people's supervision and serve the people wholeheartedly; and that the state's major
policies and policies embody the will of the people, safeguard the people's interests, and promote
all-round human development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "In carrying out socialist
modernization, we aim to catch up with the developed capitalist countries economically, create a
higher and more effective democracy politically than the capitalist countries, and bring up more and
better qualified personnel than these countries."3
Comrade Xi Jinping put forward the criteria of "eight cans"4 with keen political vision and profound
theoretical thinking. Using such criteria to examine China's political practice can provide a clearer
understanding of the effectiveness of China's political system: First, whether the country's leadership
can be changed in an orderly manner in accordance with the law. After the reform and opening up,

Newspaper, 6 September 2014.

China has abolished the lifelong system of leading posts that actually exists, universally
implemented the tenure system for leading cadres, and achieved an orderly replacement of the
country's leadership and leading cadres at all levels. Second, whether the entire people can manage
state and social affairs and economic and cultural undertakings in accordance with the law. Our
Constitution has special provisions to stipulate this, and at the same time has a fundamental political
system, a basic political system and a variety of democratic mechanisms, effectively guaranteeing
that the people enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms and participate in national governance
and social management. Third, whether the masses of the people can freely express their interests
and demands. We have continuously expanded the orderly participation of citizens, and the content
and forms of people's mastery have become more and more extensive. Fourth, whether all sectors
of society can effectively participate in the country's political life. We have adhered to and
developed the broadest patriotic united front, developed unique socialist consultative democracy,
and effectively pooled forces from all sectors of society. Fifth, whether national decision-making
can be scientific and democratic. We continuously enhance the transparency and participation in
decision-making, strive to build a decision-making mechanism that understands public opinion,
reflects public sentiment, concentrates people's wisdom, and cherishes people's strength, so as to
ensure that decision-making conforms to the interests and aspirations of the people. Sixth, whether
talents from all walks of life can enter the national leadership and management system through fair
competition. We recruit a wide range of talented people and use systems and mechanisms to gather
outstanding talents in various undertakings of the party and the state. Seventh, whether the ruling
party can exercise leadership over state affairs in accordance with constitutional law. We adhere to
the joint advancement of governing the country according to law, ruling according to law and
administering according to law, and vigorously promoting the construction of a rule of law in China,
with remarkable results. Eighth, whether the use of power can be effectively checked and supervised.
We have established and improved a multi-level power supervision system, reformed the state
supervision system, and ensured that Party and state organs and personnel, as well as all kinds of
public power subjects, exercise their powers in accordance with legal authorities and procedures.
All this clearly shows that the socialist democratic political system with Chinese characteristics
plays a unique advantage and effectiveness in ensuring that the people are masters of their own
country. The realization of democratic political forms is rich and varied, and we cannot stick to rigid
models. Practice has fully proved that Chinese-style democracy works and works well in China.
Strong self-improvement ability. The historical process of the Communist Party of China in
promoting the construction of socialist democratic politics is a historical process of constantly
gaining insight into the development trend of the times and actively conforming to the expectations
of the people, a historical process of constantly deepening the reform of systems and mechanisms,
stimulating the creative vitality of the whole society, and constantly improving the socialist legal
system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the gradual deepening of the rule of law.
Persisting in advancing with the times and upholding the right and bringing forth the new is a
distinctive feature of China's socialist democratic political construction. "Socialist democracy with
Chinese characteristics is a new thing and a good thing.

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
Of course, this does not mean that China's political system is perfect and does not need to be
improved and developed.1 The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed
that by the middle of this century, China should be built into a prosperous, strong, democratic,
civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist country, which requires the comprehensive
improvement of material, political, spiritual, social and ecological civilizations, and the
comprehensive realization of the modernization of the national governance system and governance
capabilities. It is fully believed that the political development path of socialism with Chinese
characteristics will inevitably achieve a new and higher level of leap.

3. Practical requirements for the political development path of socialism with
Chinese characteristics

Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "The key to adhering to the path of socialist political
development with Chinese characteristics is to adhere to the organic unity of the party's leadership,
the people's mastery of the country, and the rule of law.” 2 The party's leadership, the people's
mastery of the country, and the rule of law are the basic elements of China's socialist democratic
politics, and the three are interrelated and interact to form an intrinsically unified and inseparable
whole, which is a major political judgment and inevitable requirement that must be deeply
understood and grasped to adhere to the path of socialist political development with Chinese
characteristics.

The most fundamental thing is to uphold the party's leadership. The leadership of the Communist
Party of China is the most essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the greatest
advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and the most important guarantee for
the development of socialist democratic politics in China. The leadership of the Communist Party
of China is the fundamental point of political stability, economic development, ethnic unity and
social order, and the fundamental guarantee for the people to be masters of their own country and
to govern the country according to law. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Only by adhering to the
party's leadership can the people's mastery of the country be fully realized, and the
institutionalization and rule of law of state and social life can be promoted in an orderly manner." 3
The Communist Party of China has always represented the fundamental interests of the people of
all ethnic groups throughout the country and shouldered the historical mission of realizing the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. The purpose of leading the people to establish a people's republic
is to support and organize the people to manage state and social affairs according to law.

The party's proposition is highly consistent with the people's will, and the realization of the people's
interests and will cannot be separated from the party's leadership. The Party leads the people in
formulating the Constitution and laws, the Party leads the people in implementing the Constitution
and laws, and the Party leads the people to defend the dignity of the Constitution and laws.
The people's ownership is the fundamental starting point and destination. Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out: "The people's mastery is the essence and core of socialist democratic politics. People's
democracy is the life of socialism. Without democracy, there would be no socialism, no socialist
modernization, and no great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.1 The original intention and mission
of the Communist Party of China is to seek happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for
the Chinese nation. Upholding the party's leadership is, in the final analysis, the purpose of realizing
the right and fundamental interests of the masses of the people to be masters of their own affairs.
The people's mastery of the country is the essential feature of socialist democratic politics, and to
lead the people to effectively govern the country, it is necessary to "expand the orderly political
participation of citizens at all levels and in all fields, and develop a broader, fuller and more sound
people's democracy.” 2 The essence of socialist democracy is people's democracy, and its core
content is that the people are masters of their own country. So far, the form of democracy before
socialism was essentially the rule of a minority, and only socialist democracy was the form of
democracy that achieved the rule of the greatest majority. In the final analysis, the development of
socialist democratic politics is aimed at satisfactorily realizing, safeguarding and developing the
democratic rights of the masses of the people and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the
broadest masses of the people. Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out: "We are not developing socialist
democracy for anyone in the West to see, but to truly safeguard and develop the fundamental
interests of the Chinese people and ensure and promote China's stability and development." We
cannot shake this, whether the West accepts it or not, no matter what they say.”3
Governing the country according to law is the basic way for the party to lead the people to govern
the country. Governing the country according to law not only guarantees that the people are masters
of their own country in terms of legal system and procedures, but also guarantees the ruling position
of the party in terms of legal system and procedures. The fundamental purpose of adhering to the
rule of law is to protect the rights and interests of the people, and the realization of the rule of law
must be for the people, rely on the people, benefit the people, and protect the people.

To solve a series of major problems facing the development of the cause of the party and the country,
liberate and enhance social vitality, promote social fairness and justice, maintain social harmony
and stability, ensure the long-term peace and stability of the party and the country, and ensure the
happiness and well-being of the people, we must comprehensively promote the rule of law. In order
to ensure the unity of the country, the legal system, the unity of government decrees, and the unity
of the market, and to achieve economic development, political clarity, cultural prosperity, social
justice, and good ecology, the party must uphold the criterion of law and make good use of the rule
of law.
The organic unity of the party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country, and the rule of law,
which contains the positioning of the relationship between the party and the people, the party and
the state, and the state and the people, is a scientific summary of the practice of socialist democratic
political construction with Chinese characteristics, and reflects the fundamental law of the political
development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. It is necessary to give better play to the
party's role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all parties,
strengthen the party's centralized and unified leadership, and support people's congresses,
governments, CPPCC, courts, and procuratorates in performing their functions, carrying out work,
and playing their roles in accordance with the charter. It is necessary to better realize that the people
are the masters of the country, effectively ensure that the people enjoy broader and more fulfilling
rights and freedoms, ensure that the people widely participate in national and social governance, let
the people be the masters of the country take root and gather the majestic power of development. It
is necessary to better safeguard the unity, dignity and authority of the national legal system,
comprehensively promote the rule of law, and accelerate the construction of a socialist country ruled
by law. Only by adhering to the organic unity of the three and developing socialist democratic
politics can we effectively regulate political relations, enhance national cohesion, and ensure the
long-term peace and stability of the country.
To adhere to the path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics, we must have
firm political self-confidence. The path of political development of socialism with Chinese
characteristics is essentially different from the "three powers" and "multi-party system" in foreign
countries, and can achieve "six practical preventions": effectively prevent the phenomenon of
leaderless and scattered sand, earnestly prevent the phenomenon of overflowing promises made
during elections and no one cares about them after elections, effectively prevent the phenomenon of
party disputes and mutual rivalries, earnestly prevent the phenomenon of ethnic estrangement and
ethnic conflicts, earnestly prevent the phenomenon of people having formal rights but actually have
no power, and earnestly prevent the occurrence of mutual restraints and restraints. Serious internal
friction. To strengthen self-confidence in the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, we must
first strengthen our confidence in the socialist political system with Chinese characteristics and
enhance our confidence in taking the path of socialist political development with Chinese
characteristics. It is necessary to unify firm institutional self-confidence with continuous reform and
innovation, and continuously promote the improvement and development of the institutional system
on the basis of adhering to the fundamental political system and basic political system.

We must persist in proceeding from our own national conditions and reality, grasp the historical
inheritance formed over a long period of time, grasp the development path we have traveled, the
political experience we have accumulated, and the political principles we have formed, and we must
also grasp the requirements of reality and focus on solving practical problems. As Comrade Xi
Jinping said: "The key to developing socialist democratic politics is to increase and expand our
advantages and characteristics, not to weaken and shrink our advantages and characteristics."1
Section 2: Improve the institutional system in which the
people are masters of their own affairs
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out in the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China: "Developing socialist democratic politics is to embody the will of the people, protect the
people's rights and interests, stimulate the people's creative vitality, and use the system to ensure
that the people are masters of their own country."2 In his important speech at the celebration of the
40th anniversary of reform and opening up, he further emphasized: "We must improve the
democratic system, broaden democratic channels, enrich democratic forms, improve the guarantee
of the rule of law, and ensure that the people enjoy extensive, full, true and concrete benefits in
accordance with the law. Functioning democratic rights3 The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th
CPC Central Committee clearly proposed to uphold and improve the system of the people being
masters of the country and develop socialist democratic politics. The specific requirements are: We
must uphold the people's status as the main body, unswervingly follow the path of socialist political
development with Chinese characteristics, and ensure that the people manage state affairs, economic
and cultural undertakings, and social affairs through various channels and forms in accordance with
the law. It is necessary to uphold and improve the fundamental political system of the people's
congress system, the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic united
front, uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, and improve the system of
vigorous grassroots mass autonomy.

It can be seen from this that the institutional system in which the people are masters of their own
country, including the country's fundamental political system, basic political system and a series of
specific institutional arrangements, is the result of long-term development, gradual improvement
and endogenous evolution on the basis of China's historical inheritance, cultural tradition and
economic and social development.

1. Uphold and improve the country's fundamental political system and basic
political system

To uphold and develop socialist democratic politics, we must insist that all state power belongs to
the people and demonstrate the people's status as the main body. We must persist in and continuously
improve the people's congress system for a long time, keep pace with the times, improve and
improve the basic political system, and constantly strengthen the institutional guarantee and the rule
of law guarantee for the people to be masters of their own country.
Continuously improve the people's congress system. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The people's
congress system is a fundamental political system arrangement that adheres to the party's leadership,
the people are masters of the country, and the rule of law is organically unified, and must be adhered
to and continuously improved for a long time.1 This is the fundamental basis for improving the
system of the people being masters of their own affairs. The Constitution stipulates that all power
in the People's Republic of China belongs to the people. The organs through which the people
exercise state power are the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels.
The people administer state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings and social affairs through
various channels and forms in accordance with the law. The Constitution also stipulates that the
State organs of the People's Republic of China practice the principle of democratic centralism, and
that the National People's Congress and local people's congresses at all levels are democratically
elected, responsible to and supervised by the people. State administrative organs, supervisory organs,
judicial organs and procuratorial organs are all elected by the people's congress and are responsible
to and supervised by it.
The people's congress system is the most reliable and effective democratic system that conforms to
China's national conditions and reality. Over the past 60 years, especially in the past 40 years of
reform and opening up, the people's congress system has been continuously consolidated and
developed in practice and has played an important political role: First, it can ensure the orderly
participation of the masses of the people in state management and realize that the people are masters
of their own country.

Second, it can guarantee democratic rights and realize the people's supervision over state organs at
all levels; third, it can mobilize all the people to actively participate in the cause of socialist
construction, reform and development; fourth, it can ensure the coordinated and efficient operation
of state organs in accordance with the principle of democratic centralism; fifth, it can effectively
safeguard national unity and ethnic unity; and sixth, it can ensure the party's effective leadership
over the state and society. By maintaining close ties with the masses, integrating the expression of
the interests of the masses, safeguarding the democratic rights of the masses, stimulating the creative
vitality of the people, and rallying the majestic force of national rejuvenation, the people's congress
system is an important institutional guarantee for building a prosperous, strong, democratic,
civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist country.
To uphold and improve the people's congress system in the new era, it is necessary to do a good job
in the building of two "organs." First, it is necessary to strengthen the building of people's congresses
and their standing committees at all levels as working organs exercising their functions and powers
in accordance with the law, improve the organizational and working systems of people's congresses,
optimize the composition of people's congress standing committees and special committees, let
people's congresses fully undertake all the duties entrusted by the Constitution and laws, give play
to the leading role of people's congresses and their standing committees in legislative work, and
ensure that people's congresses exercise their legislative powers, supervisory powers, decision-
making powers, appointment and removal powers in accordance with the law. Second, it is
necessary to strengthen the building of people's congresses as representative organs that maintain
ties with the masses of the people, solve the problem of further maintaining close ties with the
masses of the people in terms of system, give better play to the role of people's congress deputies,
and improve the ability of deputies to perform their duties.
Improve and perfect the basic political system. The system of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the system of regional ethnic
autonomy and the system of grassroots mass autonomy together constitute the basic political system
of our country. To improve the institutional system in which the people are masters of their own
affairs, it is necessary to improve and perfect the basic political system.
The CPPCC is a great achievement of the CPC in integrating Marxist-Leninist united front theory,
party theory, and democratic political theory with China's reality; it is a great creation in the political
system carried out by the CPC under the leadership of various democratic parties, personages
without party affiliation, people's organizations, and people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life;
it is a new type of political party system that has grown out of Chinese soil; and it is a major
contribution to human political civilization. First, it is the product of the integration of Marxist party
theory with China's specific reality, which can genuinely, extensively, and sustainably represent and
realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people, and effectively avoid the
drawbacks of the old-style party system of representing a small number of people and minority
interest groups; second, it can closely unite all political parties and personages without party
affiliation to strive for a common goal, and effectively avoid the drawbacks of lack of supervision
by one party or vicious competition between multiple parties taking turns to sit in power;

Third, it concentrates opinions and suggestions from all quarters through institutionalized,
procedural, and standardized arrangements, promotes scientific and democratic decision-making,
and effectively avoids the drawbacks of the old-style party system being limited to party interests,
class interests, regional and group interests, and decision-making and governance, resulting in
narrow-mindedness and short-sightedness. This new type of party system emphasizes both the
leadership of the Communist Party of China and the promotion of socialist democracy, and has
unique advantages and distinctive characteristics. The CPPCC is an organization of the united front,
an institution for multi-party cooperation and political consultation, an important form of realizing
people's democracy, an important channel and special consultative body for socialist consultative
democracy, an important part of the national governance system, and an institutional arrangement
with Chinese characteristics. The work of the CPPCC involves all fields of national governance and
plays a vital role in political consultation, democratic supervision, participation in and discussion of
state affairs, and so on. To strengthen and improve the work of the CPPCC in the new era, it is
necessary to take the adherence to and development of social Wang Yi with Chinese characteristics
as the main axis of consolidating the common ideological and political foundation, take serving the
realization of the "two centenary goals" as the main line of work, strengthen ideological and political
guidance and extensive consensus as the central link, adhere to the two major themes of unity and
democracy, improve the level of political consultation, democratic supervision, participation in and
discussion of state affairs, better condense consensus, and adhere to the CPPCC system well We
should develop the cause of the CPPCC well, shoulder the political responsibility of implementing
the decisions and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and the requirements for the work
of the CPPCC, pooling the wisdom and strength of the Chinese people at home and abroad, and
contribute to the decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way
and then building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way.
The system of regional ethnic autonomy is an important content and institutional guarantee for the
correct path of solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics, and has played an important role
in safeguarding national unity and territorial integrity, strengthening ethnic equality and unity,
promoting the development of ethnic regions, and enhancing the cohesion of the Chinese nation. To
uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, we must adhere to the leadership of
the Communist Party of China, adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics,
resolutely safeguard the unity of the motherland, adhere to the equality of all ethnic groups,
strengthen ethnic unity, and promote the common prosperity, development and progress of all ethnic
groups. To uphold and improve the system of regional ethnic autonomy, it is necessary to adhere to
the combination of unification and autonomy, and also adhere to the combination of ethnic factors
and regional factors, help ethnic autonomous areas develop their economies, improve people's
livelihood, forge a firm sense of the Chinese national community, and better realize exchanges,
exchanges and blending among all ethnic groups.

The system of grassroots mass autonomy is the most direct, extensive, and vivid practice of
democracy. To improve the system of grassroots people's self-government and develop grassroots
democracy, we must permeate the party's leadership throughout the entire process and all aspects of
grassroots people's autonomy, realize the combination of rule of law, rule by virtue, and autonomy,
and ensure that the building of grassroots democracy always advances in the right direction. It is
necessary to unblock democratic channels and improve mechanisms such as grassroots elections,
deliberation, openness, debriefing, and accountability

Promote the masses' self-management, self-service, self-education, and self-supervision in urban
and rural community governance, grassroots public affairs, and public welfare undertakings in
accordance with the law, and give play to the role of social organizations, so as to realize benign
interaction between government governance and social regulation and residents' autonomy. It is
necessary to improve the democratic management system of enterprises and institutions, take the
workers' congress as the basic form, respect the people's initiative, and effectively implement the
rights of the masses of workers to know, participate, express and supervise.
The functional system of the Party and state institutions is an important part of the socialist system
with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The purpose of deepening the reform
of the party and state institutions is to better promote the development of the cause of the party and
the country, better meet the growing needs of the people for a better life, and better promote the all-
round development of people, all-round social progress and common prosperity of the people."1 To
deepen the reform of party and state institutions, we must adhere to the party's overall leadership,
adhere to the people-centered, adhere to optimization and coordination, adhere to the comprehensive
rule of law, make overall plans to promote the reform of the party, government, military and masses,
build a systematic, scientific, standardized, and efficient functional system of party and state
institutions, including the party's leadership system, government governance system, armed forces
system and mass work system, and comprehensively improve the country's governance capacity and
governance level.

2. Promote the extensive and multi-level institutionalization of socialist consultative democracy

Socialist consultative democracy is an important form of democracy under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, in which all aspects of the people conduct extensive consultations before
and during the implementation of decisions on major issues of reform, development and stability
and practical issues involving the vital interests of the masses, and strive to form consensus. 2
"Socialist consultative democracy is a unique form and unique advantage of China's socialist
democratic politics, an important embodiment of the party's mass line in the political field, and an
important content of deepening the reform of the political system"3 Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out:
"China's socialist consultative democracy has enriched the form of democracy, expanded the
channels of democracy, and deepened the connotation of democracy. ”

It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the socialist consultative democratic system and
ensure the extensive, sustained and in-depth participation of the people in all aspects of state and
social affairs.

1
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that "consultative democracy is a unique, unique and unique form
of democracy in China's socialist democratic politics.”2 Deliberative democracy constitutes a unique
and beautiful landscape of socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics, with a profound cultural,
historical, theoretical and practical foundation. Consultative democracy stems from the excellent
political culture of the Chinese nation that has long been formed by the Chinese nation, such as
serving the public in the world, being inclusive, and seeking common ground while reserving
differences. The spirit of consultation embodied in traditional Chinese culture is a valuable cultural
resource of socialist consultative democracy. Consultative democracy is a great creation jointly
realized by all parties, organizations, nationalities, strata and people from all walks of life in the
political system since the founding of New China. Consultative democracy is an important
embodiment of the mass line of the Communist Party of China in the political field. The Communist
Party of China insists on building the party for the public and ruling for the people, adhering to the
mass line, and insisting that all power belongs to the people. Whether the Communist Party of China
is in power or the state organs are administering, upholding the people's dominant position and
closely relying on the people, they are inseparable from consultative democracy. Consultative
democracy is deeply embedded in the whole process of socialist democratic politics with Chinese
characteristics, and continues to develop with the in-depth advancement of socialist democratic
politics.

Socialist consultative democracy has unique advantages. Socialist consultative democracy not only
upholds the leadership of the Communist Party of China but also plays a positive role in all quarters;
upholds the people's dominant position and implements the leadership system and organizational
principle of democratic centralism; and upholds the principle of people's democracy and the
requirements of unity and harmony. The advantage of socialist consultative democracy is that it can
effectively regulate national political relations. Comrade Xi Jinping comprehensively summarized
this unique advantage: "The greatest consensus on decision-making and work can be widely reached,
and the drawbacks of parties and interest groups competing with each other or even fighting each
other for their own interests can be effectively overcome; channels for various interest demands and
demands to enter the decision-making process can be widely unblocked, and the drawbacks of
different political forces stubbornly holding their own opinions and excluding dissidents in order to
safeguard and fight for their own interests can be effectively overcome; mechanisms for discovering
and correcting mistakes and mistakes can be widely formed, and the drawbacks of unclear
circumstances and self-righteousness in decision-making can be effectively overcome;

It can widely form a mechanism for the people's participation in management and governance at all
levels, effectively overcome the drawbacks that the people cannot express and participate in in the
country's political life and social governance; it can extensively pool the wisdom and strength of the
whole society to promote reform and development, and effectively overcome the drawbacks of low
consensus on various policies and work and inability to implement. ”1
Improve the institutional system and working mechanism of socialist consultative democracy.
Under the new historical conditions, "we must insist on discussing more when there is something,
discussing more when things happen, discussing more when doing things, and discussing as much
as possible as deeply as possible.”2 To improve the socialist consultative democracy system, it is
necessary to promote the extensive and multi-level institutionalization of consultative democracy.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that "it is necessary to broaden the consultation channels of the
Communist Party of China, the People's Congress, the people's government, the People's Political
Consultative Conference, democratic parties, people's organizations, grassroots organizations,
enterprises and institutions, social organizations, various think tanks, etc., and carry out in-depth
consultations such as political, legislative, administrative, democratic, social, and grassroots
consultations" 3 .Extensive consultations were held on major issues of reform, development and
stability, especially those concerning the vital interests of the masses of the people. In the concrete
practice of improving the socialist consultative democratic system, attention should be paid to
respecting the wishes of the majority and taking into account the reasonable demands of the minority,
and combining the diversity of levels with the appropriateness of scale. Consultations should be
carried out extensively among the masses of the people in a locality concerning matters involving
the interests of a part of the masses and the interests of a specific mass; and matters involving the
interests of the masses at the grassroots level should be extensively discussed among the masses at
the grassroots level. Only by giving full play to the role of various consultation subjects as a platform
can we better uphold the status of the people as the main body, ensure the orderly participation of
citizens in the country's political life, effectively integrate social forces, coordinate social relations,
and effectively ensure that the people are masters of their own country.

To improve the working mechanism of socialist consultative democracy, it is necessary to carry out
extensive consultation in various forms before and during the implementation of decision-making.
Due to the different scope, channels and forms of consultations, the content and focus of
consultations are also different. In consultation with political parties, it is necessary to strengthen
thematic consultations between the CPC and democratic parties on important principles and policies
and major issues of the party and the state

Improve the system for the central committees of democratic parties to make proposals directly to
the CPC Central Committee, strengthen the establishment of mechanisms for consultation and
guarantee of political parties, and consolidate and develop harmonious relations between political
parties. People's congress consultations should carry out in-depth consultations in legislative work,
give play to the role of people's congress deputies in consultative democracy, encourage grassroots
people's congresses to carry out consultations in accordance with the law in the course of performing
their duties, and support and guarantee the people's exercise of state power through people's
congresses. In government consultations, it is necessary to enhance the transparency of decision-
making and public participation, explore the formulation and publication of a catalogue of
consultation matters, enhance the breadth and pertinence of consultations, improve the government
consultation mechanism, and improve the capacity and level of government governance. In CPPCC
consultations, it is necessary to clarify the main contents of CPPCC consultations, improve CPPCC
meetings and other forms of consultations, strengthen the effective connection between CPPCC
consultations and the work of party committees and governments, strengthen the construction of the
CPPCC system, and continuously improve the level of the democratic system of CPPCC
consultation, standardization and procedure. People's organization consultations should focus on
doing a good job of the party's mass work in the new situation, better organize and represent the
masses with whom they are connected to participate in public affairs, effectively reflect the wishes
and interests of the masses, and give play to the role of people's organizations as a bridge and link
between the party and the government and the masses. Grassroots consultations should, in
accordance with the requirements of consultation for the people and consultation for the people,
establish and improve mechanisms for coordination and linkage in the construction of grassroots
consultative democracy, better solve the actual difficulties and problems of the people, resolve
contradictions and disputes in a timely manner, and promote social harmony and stability. Generally
speaking, to improve the socialist consultative democratic mechanism, it is necessary to
continuously establish and improve various consultation methods to ensure that the people's
democratic rights are effectively realized in participating in the country's political and social life
management.

3. Consolidate and develop the patriotic united front

The broad patriotic united front is an important part of the socialist political system with Chinese
characteristics. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi
Jinping has made many important speeches on united front work, scientifically answering major
questions such as why to adhere to the united front, what kind of united front to adhere to, and how
to consolidate and develop the united front in the new era.
For a long time, we have adhered to the important magic weapon of the patriotic united front. The
united front is an important magic weapon for the CPC to win victories in the cause of revolution,
construction and reform, as well as for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Whether from the perspective of historical experience or from the perspective of promoting reform
and development, it is necessary to adhere to the patriotic united front for a long time.

The patriotic united front is the united front led by the Communist Party of China, and upholding
the party's leadership is the fundamental political guarantee for doing a good job in united front
work. The party's leadership over the united front is primarily political leadership, including
leadership over political principles, political orientation, and major principles and policies. The
essence of the patriotic united front is broad political unity, and its role lies in uniting all patriotic
forces that can be united. The more the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics advances,
the more it is necessary to gather the broadest forces. Adhering to the broadest patriotic united front
can effectively pool the wisdom and strength of all parties, groups, nationalities, social strata, and
people from all walks of life.

Firmly grasp the basic observance of the patriotic united front. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "To
do a good job in united front work in the new situation, we must master the law, adhere to the
principle and pay attention to the method.”1 First, to consolidate and develop the patriotic united
front, we must always hold high the two banners of patriotism and socialism. These two banners are
a conspicuous symbol of the consolidation and development of the united front since the reform and
opening up, and are the political foundation of the patriotic united front in the new era. Second, to
consolidate and develop the patriotic united front, we must firmly grasp the two major themes of
great unity and great alliance. To win the decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous
society in an all-round way and start a new journey of building a modern socialist country in an all-
round way, the sons and daughters of China need to unite and work together. The patriotic united
front is to find the greatest common divisor and draw the largest concentric circle. Third, to
consolidate and develop the patriotic united front, it is also necessary to grasp the basic laws.
Properly handle the relationship between consistency and diversity. Fourth, to consolidate and
develop the patriotic united front, it is also necessary to improve its working methods. Be good at
networking, this is the basic way. "In a certain sense, whether the united front work is done well or
not depends on whether the number of friends made, whether they are qualified or not, and whether
they are iron enough. More or less is a matter of quantity, and whether it is qualified or not is a
matter of quality. "2
Earnestly promote the key work of the patriotic united front in the new situation. On the basis of
summing up the existing successful experience and combining it with the new practical requirements,
the CPC has made a series of important arrangements for solidly advancing the united front work in
various fields and constantly opening up a new situation in the party's united front.
First, persist in doing a good job in the work of democratic parties.

Accurately grasping the nature and positioning of democratic parties as socialist participating parties
with Chinese characteristics, strengthening political consultations with democratic parties, and
adhering to the basic principle of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other
with all sincerity, and sharing honor and disgrace" are the basic guidelines established in the practice
of long-term revolution, construction, and reform, and have long-term guiding significance. It is
necessary to support democratic parties in strengthening their own construction, and help democratic
parties focus on improving their ability to grasp politics, participate in and discuss state affairs,
organize and lead, cooperate and work together, and solve their own problems.
Second, comprehensively implement the party's ethnic and religious policies. As a multi-ethnic
country and a country with a large number of religious believers, it is very important for China to
properly handle ethnic and religious issues for achieving long-term peace and stability in the country.
It is necessary to adhere to the correct path of solving ethnic issues with Chinese characteristics,
deepen education on national unity and progress, firmly establish the sense of the Chinese national
community, strengthen exchanges, exchanges and blending among all ethnic groups, and "promote
all ethnic groups to hug together like pomegranate seeds, work together in unity, and prosper and
develop together."1 Fully implement the party's basic policy on religious work, fully implement the
party's policy on freedom of religious belief, manage religious affairs in accordance with the law,
adhere to the principle of independence and self-management, actively guide religion to adapt to
socialist society, adhere to the direction of Sinicization, and guide religious efforts to serve the
promotion of economic development, social harmony, cultural prosperity, ethnic unity, and the
reunification of the motherland.

Third, comprehensively do a good job in the work of all social strata. Since the reform and opening
up, in addition to the traditional workers, peasants and intellectuals, a large number of new social
strata have emerged, all of whom are important forces for realizing the great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation. Doing a good job in the work of people from new social strata under the new
situation is a new major issue entrusted by the times. It is necessary to enhance political consensus,
make good use of network platforms, innovate work carriers, and better concentrate them on the
cause of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. The work of
intellectuals outside the party has always been an important part of the party's united front work,
and it is necessary to follow the work line of strengthening education, grasping the ranks, and
playing a role, strengthen ideological and political guidance, and give full play to the important role
of intellectuals outside the party in promoting reform and development and maintaining social
stability. It is necessary to build a new type of government-business relationship that is "pro" and
"Qing", and promote the healthy development of the non-public economy and the healthy growth
of people in the non-public economy.
Fourth, it is necessary to comprehensively do a good job in the work of overseas Chinese and the
families of returned overseas Chinese.

Overseas Chinese and their families of returned overseas Chinese are also an important force in
socialist modernization, and they also need extensive unity and joint efforts to work together for the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Section 3: Comprehensively advancing the rule of law
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has made a series of major decisions and put forward a series
of major measures on the comprehensive rule of law, systematically answered the major theoretical
and practical issues involved in the comprehensive rule of law, and comprehensively expounded the
basic issues such as the positioning, goals, path, layout and policy of the rule of law, which has
become a scientific guide for promoting the construction of socialist rule of law with Chinese
characteristics in the new era.

1. Governing the country according to law is the basic way for the party to lead the people in governing the country

Law is the most important instrument of governance, and the rule of law is the basic way to govern
a country. In the face of the new requirements for the development of the cause of the party and the
country in the new era, the Communist Party of China has incorporated the comprehensive rule of
law into the "four comprehensive" strategic layout. The 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China proposed that governing the country according to law is the basic way for the party
to lead the people to govern the country, and endowed the rule of law with a basic and strategic
position in governing the country.

Governing the country according to law is the essential requirement and important guarantee for
adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. Adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics is a process of joint advancement of material, political,
spiritual, social and ecological civilizations, and the improvement of the level of rule of law is not
only the proper meaning of the question, but also the basic support running through it. Since the
reform and opening up, the Communist Party of China has integrated the construction of the rule of
law into the theory and practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics, which has become an
important part of the modernization drive. In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics,
the rule of law has a more important position and role in the overall work of the party and the state.
Whether it is developing the socialist market economy, developing socialist democratic politics,
building advanced socialist culture, building a socialist harmonious society, building a socialist
ecological civilization, or properly responding to various complex contradictions and severe risks
and challenges, it is more necessary to give play to the guiding and normative role of the rule of law,
and it is more necessary to use the rule of law thinking and methods to carry out work.

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
It can be said that the results of governing the country according to law directly affect the process
of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and only by giving full play to the important
role of governing the country according to law can we ensure the smooth realization of the "two
centenary goals" and continuously open up the bright prospects of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
Governing the country according to law is an inevitable requirement for modernizing the national
governance system and governance capacity. The rule of law is the rule of rules and systems. In
modern society, rule of law is the main criterion for measuring the modernization level of national
governance system and governance capacity, and it is also an inevitable requirement for realizing
the modernization of national governance system and governance capacity. Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out, "The issue of rule of law and rule of man is a basic issue in the history of human political
civilization, and it is also a major issue that all countries must face and solve in the process of
realizing modernization." Looking at the modern history of the world, there is not a single country
that has successfully achieved modernization that has not solved the problem of rule of law and rule
of man well. "1 In the face of the complex governance tasks of modern countries, to ensure the
effective operation of all aspects of politics, economy and society, there must be rules and laws to
follow, and rule of law thinking and methods must be used. The Third Plenary Session of the 18th
CPC Central Committee focused on promoting the modernization of the national governance system
and governance capacity, clearly put forward important tasks such as safeguarding the authority of
the Constitution and law, deepening the reform of the administrative law enforcement system,
ensuring the independent exercise of judicial and procuratorial powers in accordance with the law,
improving the operation mechanism of judicial power, and improving the judicial guarantee system
for the people's seal, so as to accelerate the pace of promoting the construction of a rule of law in
China. Promoting the comprehensive rule of law is of vital significance to promoting the
modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, and then promoting the
entire socialist modernization.
Governing the country according to law is the fundamental guarantee for achieving long-term peace
and stability in the country and the happiness and well-being of the people. History and reality have
taught us that the rule of law must be relied upon to achieve long-term peace and stability in the
country and the happiness and well-being of the people. China is a large country with a large
population, vast territory, many ethnic groups and complex national conditions, and it is not easy
for the Communist Party of China to govern such a large country, and it is not easy to ensure the
long-term peace and stability of the country and the happy and healthy life of the people. Only by
bringing the work of the party and the state into the track of rule of law, persisting in coordinating
social forces, balancing social interests, regulating social relations, and regulating social behavior
on the track of rule of law, can we make our society both vigorous and orderly in the midst of
profound changes, achieve economic development, political clarity, cultural prosperity, social
justice, and good ecology, and realize the strategic goals of China's socialist modernization.

Similarly, only by adhering to the rule of law can we ensure that the people enjoy a wide range of
rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, guarantee the people's rights to equal participation
and equal development in accordance with the law, punish criminal acts that harm the interests of
the people in accordance with the law, safeguard social fairness and justice, and realize, safeguard
and develop the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people.
2. Take the path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics
The positioning of the rule of law establishes the status of comprehensive rule of law in the new era,
and the goal and path of rule of law construction establish the direction of efforts and the process of
realizing comprehensive rule of law. In the early days after the founding of New China, while
abolishing the old legal system, our party actively applied the successful experience of building the
legal system in the base areas during the period of the new democratic revolution, stepped up the
construction of socialist rule of law, and initially laid the foundation for socialist rule of law. Later,
the construction of socialist rule of law went through a detour and paid a heavy price. In the new
historical period of reform and opening up, our party has defined governing the country according
to law as the basic strategy for the party to lead the people to govern the country, and ruling
according to law as the basic way for the party to govern the country. The report of the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1997 and the 1999 Amendment to the Constitution of
the People's Republic of China clearly put forward the requirement of "governing the country
according to law and building a socialist country ruled by law.” In January 2013, Comrade Xi
Jinping put forward for the first time the goal of building a rule of law in China in his important
instructions on doing a good job in political and legal work under the new situation. In October 2014,
the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Several Major Issues
Concerning Comprehensively Promoting the Rule of Law adopted by the Fourth Plenary Session of
the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "The overall goal of
comprehensively promoting the rule of law is to build a socialist rule of law system with Chinese
characteristics and build a socialist country under the rule of law. The 19th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China organically combined this general goal with the new journey of
socialist construction, and proposed that by 2035, when socialist modernization is basically realized,
"the rule of law country, the rule of law government, and the rule of law society will be basically
completed.” The path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics is a concentrated
embodiment of the achievements and experience in the construction of socialist rule of law, and the
only correct path to building a socialist country under the rule of law.
To take the road of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, the most fundamental thing is
to adhere to the party's leadership. Adhering to the party's leadership is the fundamental requirement
of socialist rule of law, the fundamental guarantee for comprehensively promoting the overall goal
of governing the country according to law, and the soul of socialist rule of law with Chinese
characteristics.

Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "The relationship between the party and the law is a
fundamental issue, and if it is handled well, the rule of law, the party and the country will prosper;
if it is not handled well, the rule of law, the party and the country will decline." 1 The leadership of
the Party and the socialist rule of law are consistent, and the socialist rule of law must adhere to the
leadership of the Party, and the Party's leadership must rely on the socialist rule of law. "'Party
Congress or Law University' is a false proposition", "whether the major matter of comprehensively
promoting the rule of law can be done well, the most important thing is whether the direction is
correct and whether the political guarantee is strong and powerful.”2 Therefore, it is necessary to
carry out the party's leadership throughout the entire process and in all aspects of governing the
country according to law, persist in the party's leadership in legislation, ensure law enforcement,
support the judiciary, and take the lead in abiding by the law, and unify the basic strategy of
governing the country according to law with the basic method of governing the country according
to law; integrate the party's overall control of the overall situation and coordination between all
parties and the people's congresses, governments, CPPCC, judicial organs, and procuratorial organs
in performing their functions and carrying out work in accordance with the charter; and unify the
party's leadership of the people in formulating and implementing the constitution and laws with the
party's insistence on activities within the scope of the constitution and laws. He is good at making
the party's propositions become the will of the state through legal procedures, good at making
candidates recommended by party organizations become leading personnel of organs of state power
through legal procedures, good at implementing the party's leadership over the state and society
through organs of state power, and good at using the principle of democratic centralism to safeguard
the authority of the central authorities and the unity of the whole party and the whole country.
To take the road of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, we must adhere to the people's
dominant position. Upholding the people's dominant position is the basic attribute of socialist rule
of law. "China's socialist system ensures the dominant position of the people as masters of the
country, and also guarantees the main position of the people in comprehensively promoting the rule
of law. This is our institutional advantage, and it is also the fundamental difference between the
socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics and the capitalist rule of law. "3 The people are the
main body and source of strength for governing the country according to law, and we must adhere
to the rule of law for the people, rely on the people, benefit the people, and protect the people, and
ensure that the people, under the leadership of the Party and in accordance with the law, manage
state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings, and social affairs through various channels and
forms; we must persist in embodying the interests of the people, reflecting the people's aspirations,
safeguarding the people's rights and interests, and improving the people's well-being in the entire
process of governing the country according to law;

We must persist in expanding the people's orderly political participation and ensure that the people
practice democratic elections, democratic consultation, democratic decision-making, democratic
management and democratic supervision in accordance with the law. At the same time, it is also
necessary to educate and guide the people to realize that the law is not only a powerful weapon to
protect their own rights, but also a code of conduct that must be observed, so that the law can be
mastered, observed and applied by the people.
To take the road of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, we must adhere to the
combination of governing the country according to law and governing the country with ethics. Fa'an
world, morality and people's hearts. "Law is written morality, and morality is the law of the heart.
Law and morality have the role of regulating social behavior, regulating social relations, and
maintaining social order, and both have their status and functions in national governance. "1 The
effective implementation of the law cannot be separated from the strong support of morality. It is
necessary to strengthen the supporting role of morality in the rule of law, attach importance to giving
play to the role of morality in educating and nourishing the rule of law, improve the degree of
civilization of the whole society, reflect the requirements of the rule of law in the moral system,
highlight the connotation of the rule of law, pay attention to cultivating people's legal beliefs,
concepts of the rule of law, and awareness of rules, strive to connect, coordinate and promote the
moral system with socialist legal norms, guide people to consciously perform legal obligations,
social responsibilities, and family responsibilities, and create a humanistic environment in which
the whole society stresses and abides by the rule of law. It is necessary to implement moral
requirements in the construction of the rule of law, and use the rule of law to carry moral concepts,
so that morality can be supported by a reliable system. Laws and regulations should establish a clear
moral orientation, promote virtue and righteous deeds, and legislation, law enforcement, and justice
should run through the core socialist values, embody the requirements of socialist morality, and
make the socialist rule of law a good law and good governance. Persist in making the rule of law
and the rule of ethics complementary, mutually reinforcing and mutually reinforcing in national
governance.
To take the road of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, we must persist in proceeding
from China's reality. There is no universal and unique path to rule of law in the world, and the choice
of rule of law path chosen by a country must be based on its own history, reality and national
conditions. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "To comprehensively promote the rule of law, we must
go the right way. If the road is wrong and the opposite is lost, then there is no point in putting
forward any more requirements and measures. "

The path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics is a concentrated embodiment of the
achievements and experience in the construction of socialist rule of law, and is the only correct path
to build a socialist country under the rule of law. Persisting in proceeding from China's actual
conditions, it is necessary to adapt to the modernization of the national governance system and
governance capacity, and neither ignore the national conditions and transcend the stage, nor follow
the old ways and stick to established rules, but highlight the characteristics of China, practice and
the times; It is necessary not only to draw rich nourishment from the excellent traditional rule of law
culture, excavate and inherit the essence of Chinese legal culture, but also to sum up and apply the
successful experience of the party in leading the people to implement the rule of law, and
continuously enrich and develop the theory of socialist rule of law that conforms to China's reality
and embodies the law of social development around major theoretical and practical issues in the
construction of socialist rule of law, so as to provide theoretical guidance and academic support for
governing the country according to law. In the process of learning from other outstanding
achievements of rule of law civilization in the world, we must persist in taking ourselves as the
mainstay, using them for our own use, carefully identifying them, and rationally absorbing them,
and we must never engage in "complete westernization" and "comprehensive transplantation.”

3. Comprehensively deepen the practice of governing the country according
to law
Comrade Xi Jinping proposed that we should adhere to the joint advancement of governing the
country according to law, ruling according to law and administering according to law, and adhere
to the integrated construction of a country ruled by law, a government ruled by law, and a society
ruled by law. This important thesis points out the key elements and key links of comprehensively
governing the country according to law, and clarifies the overall layout and key tasks of the rule of
law construction in the new era. To deepen the practice of governing the country according to law
in the new era and accelerate the construction of a socialist country ruled by law, we must take the
comprehensive rule of law as a systematic project, take into account the overall consideration, grasp
the key points, and plan as a whole, fully mobilize the initiative and enthusiasm of all parties, and
form a good situation of coordinated development of the rule of law.
Persist in administering the country according to law, ruling according to law, and administering
according to law. Governing the country according to law, ruling according to law, and
administering according to law are organically linked wholes, and the three are essentially the same,
the goals are integrated, and the results are related, and they must cooperate with each other, promote
together, and form a joint force. Governing the country according to law is the basic strategy for
governing the country as determined by our Constitution. It is necessary to implement the concept
of rule of law in all links of governance, throughout the entire process of reform and development,
and through the construction of economic, political, cultural, social, ecological civilization and other
aspects, to ensure that all organizations and individuals operate within the scope of the law.

Ruling according to law is the basic way for the party to govern the country. It is necessary to
continuously improve the party's leadership and ruling methods, enhance the awareness of ruling
according to law, persist in carrying out work with the concept of rule of law, the system of rule of
law, and the procedures of rule of law, and promote the institutionalization, standardization and
procedure of ruling according to law. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "To govern the country
according to law, we must first adhere to governing the country according to the constitution, and
ruling according to law must first adhere to ruling according to the constitution.1 This important
exposition fully reflects that the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core pays
more attention to the important role of the Constitution as the fundamental law of the country. In
this sense, our party must first take the lead in respecting and implementing the constitution, and
unify leading the people to formulate and implement the constitution and laws with the party's
insistence on activities within the scope of the constitution and laws. Administration according to
law is the main way for administrative organs to perform government functions and manage
economic and social affairs. It is necessary to fully perform functions in accordance with the law,
insist that legally prescribed duties must be performed and cannot be done without the authorization
of the law, continuously improve the decision-making mechanism in accordance with the law,
improve law enforcement procedures, strictly enforce the responsibility for law enforcement, and
achieve strict standardization, fairness and civility in law enforcement. It is necessary to
comprehensively promote openness in government affairs, strengthen the restraint and supervision
of administrative powers, and establish a law-based administrative system with unified powers and
responsibilities, authority and high efficiency.
Adhere to the integrated construction of a country ruled by law, a government ruled by law, and a
society ruled by law. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The rule of law country, the rule of law
government, and the rule of law society all have their own focus and complement each other, the
rule of law country is the goal of rule of law construction, the rule of law government is the main
body of building a rule of law country, and the rule of law society is the foundation for building a
rule of law country."2 In the construction of a country ruled by law, we must take the construction
of a socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics as the general starting point, accelerate
the formation of a complete legal normative system, an efficient rule of law implementation system,
a strict rule of law supervision system, a strong rule of law guarantee system, and form a sound
system of internal party laws and regulations. In the construction of a government ruled by law,
governments at all levels must carry out work under the leadership of the Party and on the track of
rule of law, and accelerate the construction of a government ruled by law with scientific functions,
statutory powers and responsibilities, strict law enforcement, openness and justice, honesty and
efficiency, and law-abiding and honest. In the construction of a society ruled by law, it is necessary
to carry out in-depth publicity and education on the rule of law, carry forward the spirit of socialist
rule of law in the whole society, disseminate legal knowledge, build a socialist culture of rule of
law, establish the concept of rule of law in which the constitution and the law are supreme and
everyone is equal before the law, and form a good social atmosphere of respecting the law, believing
in the law, abiding by the law, using the law, and protecting the law. It is necessary to persist in
combining education on the rule of law with the practice of the rule of law, extensively carry out
activities to govern according to law, and raise the level of legalization of social management.

It should also be pointed out that supervision according to law is a major measure to implement the
practice of comprehensively governing the country according to law under the new situation, and
an important part of promoting the reform of the socialist political system with Chinese
characteristics. Promoting supervision according to law means to ensure the organic unity of
governing the party according to law and governing the country according to law, and intra-party
supervision and state supervision through legal means, to carry out anti-corruption work with rule
of law thinking and methods, to integrate intra-party supervision with supervision by state organs,
democratic supervision, judicial supervision, mass supervision, and public opinion supervision, and
to continuously improve the supervision efficiency of the party and the state. Deepening the reform
of the state supervision system in accordance with the Constitution and laws is a major political
system reform related to the overall situation made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade
Xi Jinping as the core, and a major decision and deployment to strengthen the self-supervision of
the Party and the state.
Promote scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, fair administration of justice, and law-abiding
by all people. This is the guiding principle for the construction of China's rule of law in the new era,
which clarifies the key requirements of each major link and constitutes the basic work pattern of
comprehensively governing the country according to law in the new era.
Scientific legislation is an important prerequisite for the construction of the rule of law. After the
basic formation of the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics, the people's expectations
for legislation are no longer whether they are there or not, but whether it is good or not, whether it
works, whether it can solve practical problems, and the requirements for improving the quality of
legislation are getting higher and higher. In accordance with the arrangements of the 19th CPC
National Congress, we should earnestly promote scientific, democratic, and law-based legislation,
and do a good job in the work of legislation, reform, abolition, and interpretation. It is necessary to
respect and embody the objective laws of legislation, implement the principles of fairness, openness
and justice, ensure that the laws enacted abide by the law, are reasonable, and reasonable, and
continuously improve the quality of legislation. It is necessary to persist in legislation for the people
and rely on the people, continuously broaden the channels for citizens to participate in legislation in
an orderly manner, so that legislation reflects the will of the people and is supported by the people.
It is necessary to legislate in accordance with the legal authority and procedures to safeguard the
unity and dignity of the socialist legal system.
Strict law enforcement is a key link in the implementation of the law. Law enforcers must be faithful
to the law. Administrative organs are important subjects in implementing laws and regulations, and
should take the lead in strictly enforcing the law and safeguarding the public interest, the people's
rights and interests, and social order. It is necessary to comprehensively implement the system of
power lists, responsibility lists, and negative lists to ensure that administrative organs operate within
the scope of the law. Continuously improve law enforcement methods, put an end to undesirable
phenomena such as rough law enforcement, selective law enforcement, and fishing law enforcement,
and effectively solve prominent problems such as inaction and indiscriminate action in law
enforcement. It is necessary to strictly enforce law enforcement qualifications, improve law
enforcement procedures, establish and improve the benchmark system for administrative discretion,
and ensure that the law is fair, effective, and impartial justice is the last line of defense to maintain
social fairness and justice.

Judicial justice plays an important leading role in social justice, and judicial injustice has a fatal
destructive effect on social justice. In order to promote judicial justice, it is necessary to deepen the
reform of the judicial system. It should be said that the reform of the judicial system plays an
important role in comprehensively deepening reform and comprehensively governing the country
according to law, and is of great significance to promoting the modernization of the national
governance system and governance capacity. It is necessary to fully implement the judicial
responsibility system and further advance the reform of the criminal procedure system centered on
trial. Carry out comprehensive supporting reform pilots to improve the overall effectiveness of
reform. It is necessary to deeply understand the key role of judicial accountability in the reform of
the judicial system. By promoting the reform of the judicial accountability system, we will promote
the resolution of difficult problems that restrict judicial fairness, and at the same time lead other
reform measures to form synergies. Therefore, it is necessary to deepen the comprehensive and
complementary reform of the judicial system, fully implement the judicial responsibility system,
improve the judicial management system and the operation mechanism of judicial power, strengthen
the supervision of judicial activities, accelerate the construction of a fair, efficient and authoritative
socialist judicial system, continuously improve the quality, efficiency and credibility of the judiciary,
and let the people feel fairness and justice in every judicial case.
Law-abiding by the whole people is the social basis for the law to function. It is necessary to
intensify the popularization of law among the whole people, establish the concept of rule of law in
which the Constitution and the law are supreme and everyone is equal before the law, guide the
masses to do things according to law, find the law when encountered, rely on the law to solve
problems, and consciously be faithful advocates, conscientious observers, and staunch defenders of
the rule of law. Party organizations at all levels and all party members should take the lead in
respecting the study of the law and abiding by the law; no organization or individual should have
privileges that go beyond the Constitution and the law, and it is absolutely not allowed to use words
to represent the law, use power to suppress the law, pursue profit to break the law, and bend the law
for personal gain.
