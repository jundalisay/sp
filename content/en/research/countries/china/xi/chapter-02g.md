3. Coordinate and promote the "4 comprehensive" strategic layout

In the new era, the Central Committee with Xi as the core has formed a "4 comprehensive" strategic layout.

It conforms to the new expectations and new requirements of the people.

It is also put forward to promote the resolution of the outstanding contradictions and problems we
are facing. "1 

In November 2012, the 18th Congress proposed an all-round prosperous society.

In November 2013, the Third Plenary Session proposed to deepen reform

In October 2014, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee proposed to comprehensively promote the rule of law.

In October 2014, Xi proposed at the summary meeting of the party's mass line education practice activities to comprehensively promote
strict party management.

In November 2014, Xi visited Fujian for inspection and investigation.

In December 2014, during his investigation in Jiangsu, Comrade Xi Jinping raised the "three comprehensives" to "four comprehensives", that is, "coordinating and promoting the comprehensive construction of a moderately prosperous society, comprehensively
deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country according to law, comprehensively administering the party strictly, and promoting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization to a
new level." 

Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way is a development goal and is in a
leading position. On the basis of summing up the achievements and experiences in building a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, the 18th CPC National Congress clearly put
forward the grand goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way. 

To build a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, including sustained and healthy economic
development, continuous expansion of people's democracy, significant enhancement of cultural soft
power, comprehensive improvement of people's living standards, and major progress in the
construction of a resource-saving and environment-friendly society. "Achieving this goal is a crucial
step in realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."

It represents the pursuit of the Party and the aspirations of the people, strengthens the ideological
foundation of the Party and the people in unity and struggle, and plays a strategic leading role in the
development of the cause of the Party and the country at the present stage. After the comprehensive
construction of a moderately prosperous society is realized as scheduled in 2020, it will be followed
by the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist power, which still plays a leading role in
the "four comprehensive" strategic layout.

Comprehensively deepening reform is the fundamental driving force. To build a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way and then build a modern and powerful socialist country in
an all-round way, we must comprehensively deepen reform, further eliminate all ideological
concepts and institutional mechanisms that hinder scientific development, build a systematic,
scientific, standardized, and effective institutional system, and make all aspects of the system more
mature and more formalized. To realize socialist modernization and realize the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation, the most fundamental and urgent task is still to further liberate and develop
the social productive forces. The purpose of comprehensively deepening reform is to let the vitality
of all labor, knowledge, technology, management, capital and other elements burst out and let all
the sources of creating social wealth fully flow. It is necessary to focus on the reform of the economic
system, give play to the leading role of the reform of the economic system, and at the same time
adhere to the direction of the reform of the socialist market economy and constantly improve the
socialist market economic system.

Comprehensively governing the country according to law is an important guarantee. To build a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and then build a modern and powerful socialist
country in an all-round way, the rule of law is needed as a reliable guarantee. At present, the
development of the cause of our party and country is facing many unprecedented contradictions,
risks and challenges, and the position and role of governing the country according to law in the
overall work of the party and the country are more prominent and more important. Comprehensively
promoting the rule of law is a major strategic issue related to our party's ruling and rejuvenating the
country, the happiness and well-being of the people, and the long-term peace and stability of the
party and the country, and is an important aspect of improving and developing the socialist system
with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national governance system
and governance capacity. Only by comprehensively promoting the rule of law can the state and
social life operate in an orderly manner, achieve social harmony and stability, and provide a reliable
guarantee for socialist modernization.

Strictly administering the party in an all-round way is the fundamental guarantee. Adhering to the
party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for building a moderately prosperous society in an
all-round way and then building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way. Under
the new historical conditions, the environment in which the Party finds itself and the tasks
shouldered by it have undergone great changes;

The party's ideological, political, organizational, and work style building is facing many new
situations and problems, and the task of strictly administering the party is heavier and more urgent
than ever. Only by strengthening the party's self-building, keeping the party's self-building up with
the requirements of the times, continuously improving the party's leadership and ruling level,
continuously improving its ability to resist corruption, guard against degeneration, and resist risks,
and continuously improve its ability to control the overall situation, resolve contradictions, and cope
with risks, can the party's ruling foundation and mass foundation be consolidated and the party's
role as the core of leadership in the process of realizing socialist modernization and the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation be brought into full play.
To coordinate and promote the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, we must firmly grasp the
theme of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out: "Coordinating and promoting the four comprehensive and strategic layouts is the
strategic choice of the Party Central Committee to promote reform, opening up and socialist
modernization, and adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics under the
conditions of the new era to promote reform, opening up and socialist modernization, and adhere to
and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics under the conditions of the new era."1 Every
aspect of the "four comprehensive" strategic layout embodies the inherent requirements for adhering
to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and at the same time injects new
connotations into adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
