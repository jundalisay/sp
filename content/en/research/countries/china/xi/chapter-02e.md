1. Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the historical mission of the Chinese Communists

Leading the Chinese nation toward rejuvenation is not only the historical mission entrusted to the
Chinese Communists by the development of China's modern history, but also the conscious choice
and initiative of the Chinese Communists. Since its birth, the Communist Party of China has
regarded seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation as its
original aspiration and mission. The nature, ideals and purposes of the Party doom it to take the
realization of national independence and the prosperity and strength of the country as her own
responsibility, to devote all her wisdom and painstaking efforts to the realization of national
rejuvenation, and to the fact that she must closely unite and rely on the broadest masses of the people
and gain from them the tremendous strength to promote historical progress.
In order to realize the historical mission of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, whether it
is weak or strong, whether in good times or bad, the Communist Party of China has never changed
its original intention and unswervingly determined, dared to overcome any difficulties, is willing to
make any sacrifice, has the courage to correct any mistakes, unites and leads the Chinese people to
carry out the new democratic revolution, socialist revolution, socialist construction, reform and
opening up, and the Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up, getting rich to
becoming strong. Facts have eloquently proved that it is precisely under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China that the Chinese nation has completely shaken off the miserable situation
of being slaughtered by others, and that the Chinese people have completely bid farewell to the weak
state of poverty and backwardness; in contemporary China, only the Communist Party of China and
no other political force can lead the Chinese people to realize the great historical cause of national
rejuvenation.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has taken over the baton of history, united and led the whole
party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to promote the overall layout of the
"five-in-one" and the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, promoted the historic achievements
and changes in the cause of the party and the country, entered a new era of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and entered the decisive stage of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-
round way, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation ushered in unprecedented bright
prospects. At the same time, China's reform into the "deep water area" is faced with "hard bones"
that are difficult to gnaw; development has entered a period of concave contradictions between
people, and various risks and tests are intertwined and superimposed. As Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out: "What we are now in is a time when the boat is wandering more urgently, and the road
to the middle of the mountain is steeper, and it is a time when it is more and more difficult to advance,
more and more dangerous, and if you do not advance, you must retreat, you must enter."

At this critical historical juncture, only the Communist Party of China can play its role as the
"backbone" ideologically and politically, maintain the political determination not to follow the old
road and not to take the evil road, unite the invincible and majestic strength of the whole party and
the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, and continue to forge ahead courageously
towards the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

2. the essence of the Chinese dream is national prosperity and strength, national rejuvenation and people's happiness

The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "Realizing the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation in modern times. "2
This great dream, with profound historical accumulation and rich ideological connotation, embodies
the long-cherished wishes of several generations of Chinese, embodies the overall interests of the
Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and is the common aspiration of every Chinese sons and
daughters. In November 2012, when Comrade Xi Jinping led all the comrades of the Standing
Committee of the 18th Politburo and the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee to visit the
exhibition "The Road to Rejuvenation", he first proposed the concept of the Chinese Dream. In
March 2013, in his speech at the first session of the 12th National People's Congress, Comrade Xi
Jinping pointed out: "To realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation
is to realize the prosperity and strength of the country, national rejuvenation and people's happiness,
which not only deeply embodies the ideals of today's Chinese, but also deeply reflects the glorious
tradition of our ancestors in their unremitting pursuit of progress", 3 further clarifying the basic
connotation of the Chinese dream.

The most distinctive feature of the Chinese dream is that it closely links the destinies of the country,
the nation and the people, and integrates the pursuit of the country, the yearning of the nation and
the expectations of the people. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "History tells us that everyone's
future and destiny are closely linked to the future and destiny of the country and the nation. If the
country is good and the nation is good, everyone will be good. "4

From the national level, the Chinese dream is the dream of a strong country, and it is necessary to
completely shake off the country's poverty and weakness and build a modern and powerful socialist
country in an all-round way; from the national level, the Chinese dream is the dream of rejuvenation,
to completely shake off backwardness, so that the Chinese nation can stand stronger and more on
its own feet among the nations of the world and make greater contributions to the noble cause of
pursuing peace and progress of mankind; from the people's level, the Chinese dream is the dream of
prosperity, and it is necessary to completely shake off poverty and strive to live a better life.

The Chinese dream is the dream of the country and the nation, but in the final analysis, it is the
dream of the people. The people are the main body of the Chinese Dream, the creators and enjoyers
of the Chinese Dream. The deepest foundation of the Chinese dream lies in the hearts of the Chinese
people, and we must rely closely on the people to realize it. The realization of the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation is not the dream of any one person or part of the people, but the common
pursuit of all Chinese people; the realization of the Chinese dream is not the achievement of any one
person or part of the people, but the benefit of all the people. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that all
people who are interested in this great cause can make great achievements, and should "consciously
integrate life ideals and family happiness into the great cause of national prosperity and national
rejuvenation, and closely link personal dreams with Chinese dreams.‚Äù1 Everyone is a participant and
writer of the Chinese Dream, and enjoys the opportunity to shine in life; everyone's continuous
efforts towards the dream are also a force for realizing the great Chinese Dream.

The dreams of the Chinese people are closely related to the dreams of the people of all countries.
The Chinese dream is a dream of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results. In the
process of realizing the Chinese dream, China will work with other countries to promote the people
of all countries to better realize their dreams. The realization of the Chinese Dream is inseparable
from a peaceful international environment and a stable international order, as well as the
understanding, support and assistance of the people of all countries. In the process of realizing the
Chinese Dream, "we will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, unswervingly
pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy, not only devote ourselves to China's
own development, but also emphasize our responsibility and contribution to the world; not only
benefit the Chinese people, but also benefit the people of the world."2 China's development is the
growth of the world peace force and the positive energy of friendship. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed
out:

"China's development will surely be embedded in the trend of world development, and will also
inject more vitality and bring more opportunities for the common development of all countries in
the world." 1 History will prove that the realization of the Chinese dream brings to the world
opportunities rather than threats, peace rather than turmoil, and progress rather than retrogression.

3. to realize the Chinese dream, we must adhere to the Chinese path, carry
forward the Chinese spirit, and unite China's strength
In his speech at the first session of the 12th National People's Congress, Comrade Xi Jinping clearly
pointed out that to realize the Chinese dream, we must take the road of China as a country, carry
forward the Chinese spirit, and unite China's strength.
The Chinese road is the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. History and reality tell us
that the road determines destiny, and it is extremely difficult to find a correct path. Since the reform
and opening up, the Communist Party of China has summed up historical experience, made
continuous arduous explorations, and finally found the correct path to realize the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation, which is the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The path of
socialism with Chinese characteristics is to base on the basic national conditions under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, take economic construction as the center, adhere to the
four basic principles, adhere to reform and opening up, liberate and develop social productive forces,
build a socialist market economy, socialist democratic politics, advanced socialist culture, socialist
harmonious society and socialist ecological civilization, promote all-round human development,
gradually realize common prosperity for all the people, and build a prosperous, strong, democratic,
civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist country. The connotation and orientation of
this road are completely consistent and highly unified with the grand goal of realizing national
rejuvenation. Practice has also fully proved that this is a bright road suited to China's national
conditions and guiding China's development and progress, and is of decisive significance to
realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This road has enabled
the Chinese nation to make great strides to catch up with the advancing trend of the times and
enabled the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to make more and more contributions to world
peace and development.

The Chinese spirit is the national spirit with patriotism as the core and the spirit of the times with
reform and innovation as the core. People cannot stand without spirit, and the spirit of the country
is not strong.

The Chinese spirit is the soul of rejuvenating the country and the soul of strengthening the country
that condenses the strength of the Chinese nation. The great national spirit is fostered, inherited and
developed by the Chinese people in their long-term struggle, and its core is patriotism, the main
content of which is unity and unity, peace-loving, industriousness and courage, and unremitting self-
improvement, which is embodied in the spirit of great creation, great struggle, great unity and great
dream. It is precisely with the great national spirit that the Chinese nation has created and developed
the splendid traditional Chinese culture and provided a strong spiritual impetus for China's
development and the progress of human civilization. The timeless great national spirit is the
foundation for strengthening the "four self-confidences" and the fundamental force for China's
march forward. Since the reform and opening up, the Party has injected a new connotation of the
times into the Chinese spirit in the innovative practice of leading the people, which is the spirit of
the times with reform and innovation as the core. The opening up of the road of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, the formation of the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, the continuous improvement of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and
the continuous development of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics shine everywhere with
the light of the spirit of the times. The spirit of reform and innovation of the times has become the
most important character of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the foundation of the
vigorous vitality of socialism with Chinese characteristics. On the new journey of realizing the
Chinese dream, only by vigorously carrying forward the great national spirit and the spirit of the
times, making the Chinese spirit an internal spiritual support for promoting social development and
progress, and becoming a spiritual bond to strengthen the unity and struggle of the people of the
whole country and a spiritual driving force for unceasing self-improvement, can we compose a
wonderful movement of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
China's strength is the strength of the great unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Among
them, the Communist Party of China is the core force. Without the leadership of the Communist
Party, an advanced Marxist political party, the Chinese people of all ethnic groups would have no
"backbone" and would find it difficult to form cohesion. To pool China's strength, we must, under
the leadership of the Communist Party of China, consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic
united front, unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized,
fully stimulate everyone's enterprising spirit and creativity, and fully mobilize the initiative and
creativity of all social strata and social groups. The masses of the people are the main force, and
China's strength is fundamentally the strength of the people of all ethnic groups in China to unite
and struggle, and the strength of the 1.4 billion Chinese to think and work hard in one place. The
people's yearning for a better life, their desire for brilliant opportunities in life, and their pursuit of
making their dreams come true contain endless potential for struggle and creative vitality. The
strength of the Chinese people to realize their dreams will be incomparably strong, and everyone's
efforts to realize their dreams will have broad space, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation will certainly be realized.
