3. there is no end to the self-revolution

A century of great deeds. The Party leads the people in carrying out the great social revolution and
constantly advances, and the Party's great self-revolution will never stop.
Maintain the strategic focus of self-revolution in firm faith and conviction. Engels once pointed out:
"The movement of the proletariat must go through various stages of development; at each stage
there are some people who stop and no longer advance."1 There may be many reasons why these
people are not moving forward, but the most important is the loss of faith or abandonment of faith;

They will even "use the party to do private dirty work",1 let alone self-revolution. Therefore, as far
as the Communist Party of China is concerned, in order to maintain the strategic strength of self-
revolution, it must attach importance to strengthening the soul with ideals and beliefs, and the firmer
the faith and conviction, the more it dares to "throw away all the old and dirty things in oneself.”2
In today's China, the trend of social thought is becoming increasingly diverse and diverse, the
principle of commodity exchange in the market economy penetrates widely into social and political
life, and there is still a market among some Communist Party members, such as the communist
"theory of obscurity" and the "theory of obsolescence" of Marxism. This will have a certain impact
on maintaining the determination to self-revolutionize. We must make good use of the magic
weapon of ideological party building, promote the "study of the heart" of communists, focus on
educating party members and cadres with Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era, the latest achievement of Marxism in Sinicization, and continue to
strengthen the cultivation of party spirit of the whole party. Only when theoretical attainment and
party spirit cultivation are strengthened, and there is no shortage of "calcium" in spirit, will we
always maintain the backbone and confidence of self-revolution.
Adhere to the correct direction of self-revolution in accordance with the will of the people. The
people's position is the fundamental political stand of the CPC, and taking the people as the center
is the starting point and foothold of the CPC's cause development. Without the people, all the Party's
struggles and ideals will not only be in vain, but will also become meaningless. The same is true of
self-revolution. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Only by not seeking selfish interests can we seek
fundamental and great benefits, and only then can we proceed from the nature and fundamental
purpose of the party and the fundamental interests of the people, and examine ourselves.” 3 To
comply with the will of the people, it is necessary to always grasp the ruling logic of building the
party for the public and ruling for the people, strictly prevent and investigate all phenomena of
abusing power for personal gain, and resolutely prevent the emergence of vested interest groups
within the party. To comply with the will of the people, we must dare to break down the barriers of
interests, so that the people can share the fruits of reform and development and have a greater sense
of gain. As long as we truly carry out self-revolution in accordance with the will of the people, we
can eliminate formalism, bureaucratism, hedonism and extravagance, avoid the danger of separation
from the masses, and constantly consolidate the solid mass foundation for the Party to create a new
history.
A powerful impetus to inspire self-revolution in solving outstanding problems. Comrade Xi Jinping
stressed,

Our party has always led the people to carry out revolution, construction, and reform for the purpose
of solving China's practical problems. Only by properly resolving various problems in reform,
development and stability, especially the problems of party building itself, can we stimulate the
powerful driving force of the CPC's self-revolution. Because every successful solution to a problem
is constantly gathering a powerful force to promote the orderly governance of the country, the
happiness and well-being of the people, and the prosperity and progress of society; every solution
to a problem will give the party an opportunity for self-reflection and a starting point for reform and
innovation. In order to properly manage and cure more than 90 million party members and more
than 4.6 million grassroots party organizations, the party must persist in facing and following
problems, focus on solving problems wherever they are prominent, inject impetus into rectification
and reform of problems, and win the hearts and minds of the people with rectification and reform
of problems. In the past hundred years, the Party has not relaxed in solving its own problems,
gradually forming a set of endogenous mechanisms for deepening self-revolution, which has
become the driving force support for the Party to continuously promote self-revolution.
Improve the level of self-revolution in innovative institutional mechanisms. Comrade Mao Zedong
pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee: "The productive
forces are the most revolutionary factor. When the productive forces develop, they always want
revolution. 1 It should be noted that with the institutional revolution brought about by the
development of productive forces, it will greatly promote the innovation of institutions and
mechanisms; and each innovation of institutional mechanisms will in turn promote further
revolutions and continue to liberate and develop productive forces. Similarly, through self-
revolution, the Party has continuously promoted the innovation of systems and mechanisms, and
constantly promoted the maturity and formalization of systems. In turn, the innovation of systems
and mechanisms has provided a guarantee for the party to gnaw hard bones, wade into deep waters,
and further self-revolution, thus improving the ability and level of self-revolution. Since the 18th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party has vigorously broken the shackles
of systems and mechanisms, continuously promoted institutional innovation, and focused on
establishing a relatively mature institutional system in all aspects, greatly improving its self-
revolutionary ability in promoting the modernization of the national governance system and
governance capacity, and improving its overall promotion." The overall layout of the five-in-one
and the ability to coordinate and promote the self-revolution in the "four comprehensive" strategic
layout are the most convincing proof.

Carry forward the spirit of self-revolution and constantly promote the party's self-revolution. Self-
revolution is endless, and whether or not there is a strong spirit of self-revolution is the key factor
determining the success or failure of the party. The spirit of self-revolution, as the soul of the party's
spirit of pursuing progress and self-improvement, and as the basic concept of overcoming
difficulties and risks, can be fully called the way to build the party, rejuvenate the party, and
strengthen the party.

After the reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping demanded that the vast number of party
members and cadres "carry forward the revolutionary and desperate spirit" and stressed that "the
revolutionary spirit is very valuable, and without the revolutionary spirit, there will be no
revolutionary action.” 1 Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,
Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasized: "We should more consciously strengthen the
principles of the Party spirit, carry forward the spirit of thorough self-revolution, and continuously
enhance the Party's ability to purify, improve, renew and improve itself." 2 Only by holding an
attitude of never being complacent and never slackening, and solving our own problems with the
vigor of always being on the road, can we continuously realize the party's self-building and new
development and new transcendence in various undertakings while enhancing the initiative, and
forge ahead courageously towards the goal of strengthening the party and the country.
