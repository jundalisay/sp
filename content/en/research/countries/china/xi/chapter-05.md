Chapter V: Adhere to the new development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing

Development is the eternal theme of human society and also the eternal theme of Marxism. The
concept of development is the forerunner of development actions and a concentrated embodiment
of development ideas, development directions and development focuses. In the face of new trends
and opportunities in economic and social development, as well as new contradictions and challenges,
Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that the new development concept of innovation,
coordination, green, openness and sharing has pointed out China's development ideas, development
directions and development focus. The new development concept profoundly answers the major
question of "what kind of development and how to achieve development" in China in the new era,
enriches and develops the Marxist outlook on development, marks that the CPC's understanding of
the trend and law of economic and social development has reached a new height, and is an important
guideline that China's economic and social development must adhere to for a long time.

Section 1: Scientific guidance that conforms to the trend of the times and reflects the law of development

The era is the mother of ideas, and practice is the source of theory. The new development concept
is a scientific summary of the law of human economic and social development, conforms to the
general trend of human development and the trend of the times, conforms to the new situation and
new problems of China's economic and social development, and is a scientific guide to lead the great
practice of the new era.

1. the profound insight of the general trend of human development

The new development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing does not
come out of thin air;

Rather, it is formed on the basis of profoundly summing up the development experience and lessons
of domestic and foreign development, and also on the basis of profoundly analyzing the general
development trend at home and abroad, which reflects the profound insight of the Communist Party
of China on the law of the development of human society.
The development of human society tells us that development must rely on innovation to lead, and
the old path will not work. Since the great geographical discoveries, especially since the industrial
revolution, the wave of world development has been surging, all of which are guided by conceptual
changes and scientific and technological progress. Marx and Engels said in the Communist
Manifesto: "The productive forces created by the bourgeoisie in less than a hundred years of its class
rule are greater and greater than all the productive forces created by all previous generations."1 Such
a huge historical development of productive forces is inseparable from the Renaissance and the
Scientific Revolution breaking the ideological shackles that have long bound people. The scientific
and technological revolution and industrial transformation have brought about the rebirth of
development and the rapid development of productive forces. Many Western countries seized the
opportunity of the scientific and technological revolution and the industrial revolution to achieve a
collective rise, which profoundly changed the balance of international forces. However, some
countries and regions that have been in the leading position for a long time have failed to seize the
opportunities of the scientific and technological revolution and the industrial revolution due to
ideological imprisonment and isolation from the country, and their development has turned from
prosperity to decline, gradually lagging behind the times, and even falling into a slump.
The course of the development of human society tells us that development must be coordinated
development, and the path of growth without development will not work. After the end of World
War II, the task of developing the economy was put back on the agenda, and the "theory of economic
growth" once again appeared, advocating that development is growth and growth is development.
Under the guidance of this concept, many countries, especially developing countries, regard
economic growth as the top priority, industrialization as the primary goal, and GDP growth as the
only criterion. The "theory of economic growth" promoted the economic take-off of some countries
after the war, but it also brought serious problems such as economic structural imbalance, unfair
distribution of income, agricultural and rural decay, and excessive consumption of resources. The
grim reality forces people to reflect on the one-sided pursuit of economic growth and re-understand
the relationship between "growth and development.” Today, some developed countries overly
advocate the financial industry and its derivatives, and the virtual economy is seriously disconnected
from the real economy, resulting in the outbreak of the financial crisis and bringing profound
disasters to the global economy.
The development of human society tells us that development must be sustainable, and the path of
"pollution first and treatment later" will not work.

Nature, the environment and ecosystems are prerequisites for sustainable human development.
Human beings and nature are closely related to prosperity and decline, and human beings should
respect nature, treat nature kindly, protect nature, and reasonably regulate the material exchange
between man and nature. In the "Dialectics of Nature", Engels warned us that man, as a subject, can
make nature serve his own purpose through human activities. "But let's not revel too much about
our human triumph over nature. For each such victory, nature takes revenge on us. "1 However,
Engels' warning did not change the desire of capital to deprive nature, nor did it stop human beings
from trampling on nature, and the concept of "pollution first and treatment later" in Western
countries is still popular. Environmental pollution, especially the "eight major pollution incidents"
that have occurred since the 30s of the 20th century, ozone layer damage, global warming, sharp
decline in biodiversity, and air, water quality and soil pollution problems after the 70s, make people
realize the importance of green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development of production
and lifestyle.

The development of human society tells us that development must be open to the world, and the
path of closed development will not work. With the historical torrent of globalization, mankind has
constantly made difficult choices in opening up and closed: from 1929 to 1939, in the face of the
world economic crisis, countries adopted beggar-thy-neighbor economic policies, currency
depreciation, tariff increases, and the formation of exclusive economic blocs, which was an
important reason for the slide of human society into the abyss of World War II. After the end of the
Second World War, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade determined the basic rules of
international trade, countries reduced tariffs to each other, promoted free trade, and the world
ushered in a new peak of globalization, and economic development showed a good trend. 

In the
second half of the 20th century, the world's successful transition from middle-income to high-income economies all pursued the concept of open development. In the 21st century, mankind once
again stands at the crossroads of globalization. Affected by the US financial crisis and the European
debt crisis, protectionism, populism and isolationism have risen in some countries, the United States
has held high the banner of "America First" and "America First", and globalization has encountered
twists and turns. Nevertheless, economic globalization is still the trend of the times, and openness
and cooperation are still a powerful driving force for the development of all countries.
The development of human society tells us that the fruits of development should be shared by society,
and the path of abnormal development and polarization will not work. The traditional Western
concept of development is essentially a development concept that "sees things but does not see
people.”

This view of development holds that development is an economic process and that capital
appreciation and expansion are the only purpose of economic growth. In a society where the laws
of the market dominate everything, the growth of material wealth comes at the expense of
polarization between the rich and the poor, and people often become a means of capital appreciation.
The development of "seeing things but not seeing people" is popular, and the direct consequence is
the abnormal development of society and the polarization of wealth. This is not only an important
source of "color revolutions" and political and social turmoil in some countries, but also an important
reason for the rise of populism and the rise of anti-globalization thinking in some countries. History
and reality have repeatedly proved that if development is not premised on sharing and is not aimed
at people, it not only lacks social fairness and justice, but also violates the law of social development
and is unsustainable.

In today's world, many countries are actively innovating development concepts, improving
development strategies, and striving to win the development initiative. The United States issued the
National Strategic Plan for Advanced Manufacturing and the Framework for Revitalizing American
Manufacturing, aiming to occupy the commanding heights of high-end manufacturing; the European
Union formulated the European 2020 Strategy, proposing to achieve intelligent growth based on the
development of the knowledge economy, sustainable growth based on the development of a green
economy, and comprehensive growth focusing on employment improvement and poverty
eradication; Japan formulated the "Japan Revitalization Strategy" and proposed the development of
"social 5 · 0", the goal is to create a "more people-oriented super-intelligent society"; Russia has
formulated the "National Goals and Strategic Tasks for the Development of the Russian Federation
before 2024", Germany has formulated the "National Industrial Strategy 2030", and the United
Kingdom launched the "Industry 2050 Strategy", aiming at the commanding heights of scientific
and technological innovation.

In the final analysis, the issue of development is a question of ideas, and the competition for
development strategies also reflects the battle of development concepts. The Communist Party of
China puts forward a new development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and
sharing, conforms to the development requirements of the times, and draws lessons from the
development of other countries. Establishing and implementing the new development concept is an
important magic weapon for China's development to occupy the commanding heights of the times,
maintain and make good use of the important strategic opportunity period, and win advantages and
take the initiative in international competition.
2. the inherent requirements of China's actual development
Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and the main contradictions in our
society have been transformed, but the basic national conditions of our country that are still in the
primary stage of socialism and will remain for a long time have not changed

China's international status as the world's largest developing country has not changed, and
development remains the foundation and key to solving all China's problems. To build a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way and realize the "two centenary goals", it is still necessary to
take development as the first priority, take economic construction as the center, and continue to
promote all-round economic and social development. However, development must be scientific and
adhere to the new development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing.
The new development concept is a fundamental policy for China's economic development into the
new normal. China's economy has entered a new normal and encountered a series of new situations
and contradictions. From a domestic point of view, China's economic development is in the node of
economic development speed shifting, economic development structural adjustment node and
economic development power conversion node. The downward pressure on the economy has
increased, the driving force formed by low-cost resources and factor investment has weakened
significantly, and economic growth needs a stronger driving force. Under the new normal, China's
economic development is facing a shift in growth rate from high-speed growth to medium-high-
speed growth, a shift in development mode from scale and speed to quality and efficiency, economic
restructuring from incremental capacity expansion to stock adjustment, optimization and increment,
and development momentum from mainly relying on resources and low-cost labor and other factors
to innovation-driven. These changes are the necessary process for China's economy to evolve to a
stage with a more advanced form, a more optimized division of labor, and a more reasonable
structure. From an international point of view, China's export advantages and participation in the
international industrial division of labor model are facing new challenges. In 2008, the international
financial crisis broke out, the world economy entered a period of deep adjustment, and the
development of global trade entered a period of downturn, resulting in a slowdown in the growth
rate of China's export demand. At the same time, from the historical experience of some world
trading countries, as China's exports of goods account for more than 10% of the world's total, the
turning point of China's export growth has arrived, and it is impossible to maintain high export
growth and a high proportion of exports to GDP in the future. This requires more economic growth
to be driven by innovation and expanding domestic demand, especially consumer demand. In the
face of new changes in the international and domestic situation, it is obviously not feasible to follow
the extensive development model and simply pursue the growth rate, and we must establish a new
development concept to lead and promote China's economy from a high-speed growth stage to a
high-quality development stage.

The new development concept is a strategic guide for the prominent problems and challenges facing
China's development. After unremitting efforts in the 70 years since the founding of New China,
especially in the more than 40 years of reform and opening up, China is generally in the period of
"after development", and the interrelatedness, superposition and complexity of various
contradictions and problems are becoming more and more prominent. For example, although China
has become the world's second largest economy, the problems of large but not strong economy, fast
but not excellent economic growth have not been solved

Economic development still relies heavily on resources and labor and other factors to invest in
people, the driving force of innovation is not enough, the innovation ability is not strong, and the
situation in which core technologies in key areas are subject to people has not fundamentally
changed; the problem of uncoordinated development in urban and rural areas is still relatively
prominent, the level and layout of productivity in different regions and different fields are very
uneven, there are still insufficient development problems in some regions, some fields, and some
aspects, and the development task is still very heavy; the carrying capacity of the environment has
reached or is close to the upper limit, and it is difficult to bear high consumption. With extensive
development, the pressure on the ecological environment has not been fundamentally alleviated; the
level of China's opening up to the outside world is not high on the whole, the ability to make good
use of the two markets and resources at home and abroad is not strong enough, the ability to deal
with international economic and trade frictions and win the right to speak in the international
economy is still relatively weak, and the ability to use international economic and trade rules is not
strong enough; there is still a problem of imbalance between economic growth and improvement of
people's livelihood in development, there are still many shortcomings in the field of people's
livelihood, the task of poverty alleviation is arduous, the gap in income distribution is still large, and
the masses are still in employment, education, medical care, housing, There are still many problems
in the elderly, and the people's sense of gain and happiness still needs to be improved. These
problems must be resolved in the process of building a modern and powerful socialist country. The
new development concept is put forward in response to these problems and is the right solution to
development problems and sustainable development.

In short, development is a process of constant change, the development environment will not remain
static, the development conditions will not remain static, and the development concept will naturally
not remain static. Innovating development concepts in a timely manner according to changes in the
development environment and development conditions is an inherent requirement for coping with
development problems and creating a new situation in development.

3. advanced concepts proven by development practice

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the face of the new normal
of China's economic development, the transition period of world economic development, and the
new development pattern of new breakthroughs in the development of world science and technology,
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has adhered to the new
development concept to lead the new normal of economic development, accelerated the formation
of a mechanism and environment that advocates innovation, pays attention to coordination,
advocates green, cultivates openness, and promotes sharing, and promotes economic and social
development to achieve historic achievements.
First, adhere to innovative development and promote the transformation of growth momentum.
Vigorously implement the innovation-driven development strategy, the reform of the scientific and
technological system has been greatly promoted, a large number of major scientific and
technological achievements have come out one after another, and new technologies, new production
ports, new industries and new formats have flourished;

The supporting role of new momentum on the economy has been significantly enhanced, and the
contribution rate of scientific and technological progress has increased from 52.2% in 2012 to 57.5%
in 2018, and the country's comprehensive innovation ability ranks 17th in the world. Second, adhere
to coordinated development and enhance the integrity of development. Major strategies such as the
"Belt and Road" construction, the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the
development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt have been implemented, the Guangdong-Hong
Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has been planned and promoted, and the regional integration
development of the Yangtze River Delta, ecological protection and high-quality development of the
Yellow River Basin have been promoted, and the gap between regions has been narrowing. With the
implementation of the rural revitalization strategy, the gap between urban and rural income has
narrowed from 3.13 times in 2011 to 2.2 in 201869 times. The third is to adhere to green
development and enhance the sustainability of development. The concept of "green water and green
mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains" is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people,
the intensity of energy and resource consumption has been greatly reduced, the prevention and
control of air, water and soil pollution has achieved obvious results, and the environmental situation
has been improved. Fourth, adhere to open development and create a new pattern of opening up.
Advocating and promoting the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", initiating the establishment
of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, setting up the Silk Road Fund, and advocating the
concept of win-win cooperation, the international space has broadened the international space for
China's development. Holding high the banner of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation,
and actively guiding economic globalization in the right direction, China's influence on global
economic development and its voice in global economic governance have been greatly enhanced.
Fifth, adhere to shared development and enhance people's sense of gain, happiness and security.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, more than 78 million new jobs
have been created in cities and towns, the income of residents has generally increased faster than
economic growth, decisive progress has been made in the battle against poverty, and the number of
poor people has decreased by more than 93 million. The social security system covering urban and
rural residents has been basically established, the level of security has steadily improved, the
people's health and medical care level has been rapidly improved, and the degree of equalization of
basic public services has been continuously improved, forming the world's largest middle-income
group.

Under the guidance of the new development concept, China has successfully coped with the dual
pressure of the continuous fermentation of the domestic "three-phase superposition" and the impact
of the international financial crisis, maintained stable economic and social development, and
reached a new level of economic strength and comprehensive national strength. Since the 18th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's economy has grown by an average of
about 7% per year, and the total economic volume has increased from 54 trillion yuan in 2012 to 99
trillion yuan in 2019. China's contribution rate to the world economy exceeds 30% annually,
becoming the main power source and stabilizer of world economic growth.
Fundamentally speaking, the historic achievements of China's economic and social development are
the result of unswervingly implementing the new development concept, resolutely correcting the
concept of development, transforming the mode of development, and improving the quality and
efficiency of development. Practice has fully proved that the new development concept is an
advanced concept guiding China's development practice in the new era, and an important guideline
that China's economic and social development must adhere to for a long time.

Section 2: It has enriched and developed the Marxist outlook on development

The new development concept is the Sinicization and epochalization of the Marxist outlook on
development by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in the new era,
and is the latest theoretical achievement of combining the basic principles of the Marxist outlook on
development with China's specific reality, enriching and developing the Marxist outlook on
development.

1. the scientific connotation and practical requirements of the new development concept

To implement the new development concept, we must grasp its scientific connotation and practical
requirements, clarify the "natural" and "reasonable" in it, and enhance ideological consciousness
and action consciousness.

Innovation is the number one driving force for development. The driving force of development is
the source of development, which determines the speed, efficiency and sustainability of
development. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi
Jinping has raised innovation to an unprecedented height and placed it in the primary position of the
new development concept, pointing out: "If we grasp innovation, we will grasp the 'bull's nose' that
affects the overall situation of economic and social development." 1 It has been repeatedly
emphasized that the basis of development is innovation, grasping innovation is to grasp development,
and seeking innovation is to seek the future. Innovation covers theoretical innovation, institutional
innovation, scientific and technological innovation, cultural innovation and other aspects, runs
through all national work, and is overall, systematic and integrated. To adhere to innovative
development, we must put innovation at the core of the overall development of the country, and run
innovative ideas through all fields of economic and social development. It is necessary to
continuously emancipate the mind and guide the practice of constantly developing and changing
economic and social development with theoretical innovation; it is necessary to continuously build
institutional mechanisms to promote development, improve all aspects of institutional systems, and
create a good institutional environment for ensuring development; it is necessary to maximize the
liberation and stimulation of the huge potential of science and technology as the primary productive
force, seize the commanding heights of global science and technology through scientific and
technological innovation, provide an inexhaustible driving force for supporting development, and
accelerate the formation of an economic system and development model mainly led and supported
by innovation;

It is necessary to cultivate the sense of innovation, carry forward the spirit of innovation, establish
the values of advocating innovation, and provide spiritual power for promoting development.
Coordination is an inherent requirement for sustained and healthy development. Development is a
whole and a system, which requires the cooperation and linkage of all aspects, links and factors. The
concept of coordinated development is put forward on the basis of summing up the lessons learned
from economic and social development at home and abroad and grasping the law of development,
and in view of the outstanding problems of imbalance and incoordination in China's development.
While paying attention to the speed of development, coordinated development pays more attention
to the wholeness, coordination and balance of development, pays more attention to the overall and
comprehensive balance, pays more attention to the relationship between the local and the overall
situation, the current and long-term, the key and non-key points, and pays more attention to making
up for shortcomings and narrowing the gap, which is development with more complete content and
higher quality. To adhere to coordinated development, in practice, it is required to firmly grasp the
overall layout of the "five-in-one" and the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, correctly grasp
the major relations in development, and constantly make up for the shortcomings of development
and enhance the stamina for development. The key points are to promote the coordinated
development of urban and rural areas, broaden the spatial layout of development, and optimize the
pattern of interests of development; promote coordinated economic and social development and
solve the problem of "one leg is long and one leg is short"; promote the synchronous development
of new-type industrialization, informationization, urbanization, and agricultural modernization, and
enhance the overall efficiency of development; promote the coordinated development of material
civilization and spiritual civilization, and promote the joint enhancement of the country's "hard
power" and "soft power"; promote the integrated development of economic construction and
national defense construction, and adhere to the balance between development and security, and the
unity of a rich country and a strong military. The ultimate goal of promoting coordinated
development is to promote the stability and long-term development of China's economy and society,
and promote the formation of a situation of all-round development in all regions and fields.
Green is a necessary condition for sustainable development. "Green development, in its essence, is
to solve the problem of harmonious coexistence between man and nature. "1The natural world is the
basis and premise of the birth, existence and development of human society, and human beings can
purposefully use nature and transform nature through social activities, but human beings are
ultimately part of nature, and must respect nature, conform to nature, protect nature, and cannot be
above nature, otherwise they will be retaliated by nature. This is a law of nature that no one can
change. Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, China's economy and society have
achieved rapid development.

However, there are many debts in terms of ecological environment, and the environmental problems
accumulated over the years have entered the stage of high intensity and frequent occurrence. At the
same time, the people's requirements for clean air, clean drinking water, safe food and a beautiful
environment are getting higher and higher. Adhering to green development requires putting
ecological environmental protection in a more prominent position, establishing the concept that
protecting the ecological environment is to protect productive forces and improving the ecological
environment is to develop productive forces; adhere to the principle that green water and green
mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains, protect the ecological environment like eyes,
and treat the ecological environment like life. It is necessary to adhere to the basic national policy
of saving resources and protecting the environment, adhere to sustainable development, adhere to
the civilized development path of production development, rich life and good ecology, accelerate
the construction of a resource-saving and environment-friendly society, form a new pattern of
harmonious development and modernization of man and nature, promote green development
methods and lifestyles, promote harmonious and symbiotic development between man and nature,
build a beautiful China, and make new contributions to global ecological security.
Opening up is the only way for a country to prosper and develop. Openness brings progress, while
closure inevitably leads to backwardness. "If a country and a nation want to rejuvenate, it must
advance in the logic of historical progress and develop in the trend of the development of the times.
"1 Looking back at history, open cooperation is an important driving force for enhancing the vitality
of international economy and trade; looking to the future, open cooperation is the requirement of
the times to promote the continuous progress of human society. Under the conditions of
globalization, if we want to develop and grow with the times and continuously improve our
international competitiveness, we must unswervingly open up and expand opening up. To adhere to
open development, it is necessary to conform to the trend of the times, make overall use of both
international and domestic markets and resources, focus on solving the problem of internal and
external linkage of development, take meeting domestic demand as the starting point and foothold
of development, and gradually form a new development pattern with the domestic cycle as the main
body and the domestic and international dual circulation promoting each other. To expand new space,
it is necessary to pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy, develop a higher-level
open economy, and build a broad community of interests; it is necessary to actively participate in
global economic governance and the supply of public goods, and improve China's institutional voice
in global economic governance; it is necessary to resolutely safeguard China's development interests,
actively prevent various risks, and ensure national economic security.

Sharing is the essential requirement of socialism with Chinese characteristics. "Governing the
country is constant, and benefiting the people is the foundation. Allowing the broad masses of the
people to share the fruits of reform and development is the essential requirement of socialism, a
concentrated embodiment of the superiority of the socialist system, and an important embodiment
of the CPC's fundamental purpose of serving the people wholeheartedly. Shared development
focuses on solving the problem of social fairness and justice, and the essence is to adhere to the
people-centered approach. It mainly includes four meanings: First, from the perspective of coverage,
it requires sharing by all people. Shared development is enjoyed by everyone and each has its own
place, not shared by a few and shared by some people. Second, from the perspective of content,
comprehensive sharing is required. Shared development means sharing the achievements of national
economic, political, cultural, social and ecological construction, and comprehensively protecting the
legitimate rights and interests of the people in all aspects.
From the perspective of the way of implementation, it requires joint construction and sharing. Co-
construction can be shared, and the process of co-construction is also a process of sharing. It is
necessary to give full play to democracy, extensively gather the wisdom of the people, stimulate the
people's strength to the greatest extent, and form a vivid situation in which everyone participates,
everyone does their best, and everyone has a sense of achievement. Fourth, from the perspective of
the promotion process, gradual sharing is required. Shared development is a process from low level
to high level, from unbalanced to balanced, and we must think about and design sharing policies
based on national conditions and economic and social development levels. These four aspects are
interconnected and mutually reinforcing, and should be understood and grasped as a whole. On the
one hand, it is necessary to fully mobilize the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the masses of
the people to continuously make the "cake" bigger; on the other hand, it is necessary to divide the
"cake" that is constantly expanding so that all the people can have a greater sense of gain in joint
construction and shared development, enhance the momentum of development, enhance the unity
of the people, and steadily advance in the direction of common prosperity.
2. The latest achievements of the Marxist outlook on development
The outlook on development is the world outlook and methodology of human development, and is
people's overall view on the connotation, essence, purpose and requirements of development. The
Marxist outlook on development is an open and constantly developing theoretical system, and its
actual form has always been revitalized and enriched in the process of integrating with specific
countries, specific times, and specific practices. In the more than 70 years since the founding of
New China, especially in the more than 40 years of reform and opening up, the Chinese Communists
have always put forward corresponding development concepts and strategies in a timely manner in
accordance with changes in the situation and tasks, leading and guiding China's development to
achieve new leaps.

The Chinese practice of the Marxist outlook on development has become an important part of the
Sinicization of Marxism.

At the beginning of the founding of New China, Comrade Mao Zedong made a pioneering
exploration on how to promote China's social development on the basis of "one poor and two white"
in light of China's actual conditions. In important literatures such as "On the Ten Major Relations"
and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," he comprehensively and
systematically expounded the overall major relations that must be handled well in socialist
construction, put forward the development policy of comprehensive balance and overall
consideration, and stressed the need to take agriculture as the foundation, industry as the lead, and
coordinated development of agriculture as the priority, thus laying an important foundation for the
formation of a Marxist development theory of Sinicization.
After the reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, basing himself on China's main
contradictions and basic national conditions, clearly put forward that "development is the last word"
and promoted the establishment of the party's basic line centered on economic construction; he
proposed that the fundamental task of socialism is to liberate and develop the productive forces, and
that the key to solving all problems in China is to rely on its own development; he clearly defined
the "three-step" modernization development strategy and formed a development theory for the initial
stage of socialism. At the turn of the century, Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward that development
is the most important task for the party to govern and rejuvenate the country, expounded that
development is the main theme running through the important thinking of the "three represents,"
stressed the need to coordinate the development of material, spiritual, and political civilizations,
implement the strategy of rejuvenating the country through science and education, the strategy of
sustainable development, and the strategy of large-scale development of the western region, and
persist in following the road of new-type industrialization. After the 16th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Comrade Hu Jintao proposed to take development as the key to solving
all problems in China, firmly establish and fully implement the scientific outlook on development,
emphasize that development is the first meaning, the core is people-oriented, the basic requirement
is comprehensive, coordinated and sustainable, and the fundamental method is to take into account
all aspects, and improve the "five-in-one" of economic construction, political construction, cultural
construction, social construction and ecological civilization construction The convex layout of the
cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics puts forward that to achieve the grand goal of
building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, we must promote the coordinated
development of socialist material, political and spiritual civilizations, persist in promoting all-round
social progress and all-round human development on the basis of economic development, and persist
in realizing harmonious coexistence between man and nature in the development and utilization of
nature, and achieve sustainable economic and social development. All these have made important
contributions to enriching the Marxist outlook on development.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has
scientifically grasped the profound changes in the foundation, environment, conditions, goals and
tasks of China's economic and social development, vigorously promoted the innovation of the party's
development theory, clearly put forward a new development concept, and raised the party's
development theory to a new historical height.

The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China took "adhering to the new
development concept" as one of the basic strategies for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era, emphasizing that "development is the foundation and key to
solving all problems in our country, development must be scientific development, and we must
unswervingly implement the development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and
sharing.”1

The new development concept adheres to the basic stance, viewpoint and method of the Marxist
outlook on development, inherits the party's development theory, and profoundly expounds major
theoretical and practical issues such as current and long-term, fairness and efficiency, government
and market, internal and external, and man and nature. The new development concept embodies the
organic unity of development thinking and practical measures, scientifically answers major
questions such as development direction, development mode, development momentum,
development principles, and development path, and puts forward powerful measures such as
conceptual change, improvement of system, and implementation well. The new development
concept adheres to the organic unity of problem awareness and goal orientation, not only focuses on
the contradictions, problems and shortcomings in China's development, but also carries out top-level
design and systematic planning for the goals to be achieved to solve these contradictions and
problems. The new development concept reflects the organic unity of development in time and space,
focusing not only on fairness, justice and sustainable development, but also on the balance of
development in urban, rural and regional spatial layout. The new development concept adheres to
the organic unity of development subjects and development objects, advocates promoting the
common development of all social fields based on economic development, but also pays attention
to the fundamental issue of development for people, emphasizing the promotion of all-round human
development. It can be said that the new development concept accurately grasps the pulse of
development in the new era, which is the summation of experience and theoretical improvement of
the new concept and new thinking and strategy of the party governing the country on the
development issue, and is the latest achievement of the Sinicization of the Marxist concept of
development.

3. it has enriched and developed the political economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics

The new development concept is an important content of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, which deepens and expands the CPC's understanding of the
law of the development of the socialist economy with Chinese characteristics, and enriches and
develops the political economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The new development concept has written a new chapter in the political economy of socialism with
Chinese characteristics. Marxist political economy has revealed the basic principle that productive
forces determine production relations and that production relations must meet the requirements of
the development of productive forces. The new development concept insists on closely integrating
the basic principles of Marxist political economy with the reality of contemporary China, more
clearly emphasizes that development is the foundation and key to solving all problems in our country,
emphasizes real and waterless development, emphasizes promoting changes in the quality, power,
and efficiency of economic development, and achieves high-quality development. Give better play
to the role of the government, emphasize the continuous deepening of reform and opening up,
establish the principle of market competition neutrality, and break down the institutional obstacles
that hinder the development of productive forces; more clearly emphasize that innovation is the
primary driving force for development, talent is the first resource to support development, and
emphasize the promotion of comprehensive innovation in theory, system, science and technology,
culture, etc.; more clearly emphasize the coordination and sustainability of the social reproduction
process, emphasize inter-industry, urban-rural, inter-region, man and nature, domestic and
international, The improvement of the relationship between people emphasizes the handling of the
relationship between the present and the long-term, the local and the overall situation, and the key
and the general; more clearly emphasizes the harmonious coexistence between man and nature, so
that a good ecological environment becomes the growth point of people's lives. It will become a
driving force to show China's good image and continue to move towards a new era of ecological
civilization; more clearly emphasize that opening up is a basic national policy, emphasize promoting
high-level two-way opening-up, implement a more proactive opening strategy, create a new pattern
of comprehensive opening up, emphasize active participation in global economic governance, and
promote the international economic order towards equality and justice. Develop in the direction of
win-win cooperation; more clearly emphasize adhering to the people-centered development thinking,
emphasizing that the people are the fundamental force for promoting development, adhering to the
people's dominant position, mobilizing the enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of all parties, and
integrating into a powerful driving force for development. These understandings and summaries of
laws conform to the general trend and trend of the development of human society, clarify the essence
of the contemporary Chinese version of political economy, and realize a new leap in the political
economy of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The new development concept has enhanced the leading force of the political economy of socialism
with Chinese characteristics. The new development concept has refined and summarized the theory
and practical theory of socialist development with Chinese characteristics, giving it new meaning to
the political economy of contemporary Chinese Marxism, and becoming a "classic discourse" and
"logo concept" for interpreting China's road, telling Chinese stories well, and spreading Chinese
voices. Since the 80s of the 20th century, many developing countries have been trapped in the
"middle-income trap", it is difficult to get rid of the "trap" of the traditional growth model, and
exploring new development concepts and development paths has become a more urgent issue.

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
The new development concept contains a summary and analysis of the successes and failures of
global economic growth and development, especially a profound exploration of various growth and
development dilemmas. A series of ideological viewpoints and practical directions put forward by
the new development concept have increasingly become new concepts, new categories and new
expressions understood and accepted by the international community, and have produced important
enlightenment for many countries, including developing countries, to overcome the "middle-income
trap.” At present, many developing countries no longer believe in the development path and
development theory of Western countries, but have turned to study and learn from China's
development concept and experience. All these fully demonstrate the vigorous vitality and world
influence of the "Chinese road", "Chinese plan" and "Chinese wisdom" in the new era, and further
enhance the international discourse power of the political economy of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
Section 3: Adhere to the new development concept to lead
the overall development situation
The implementation of the new development concept is a profound change that has a bearing on the
overall development of our country, and we must accelerate the transformation of ideology and
concepts, promote the reform of systems and mechanisms, and earnestly transform the new
development concept into a program of action for the overall situation, specific ideas for planning
development, work measures for implementing development tasks, and practical results in
promoting scientific development.

1. Comprehensively promote the reform of the development concept

Concept is the precursor of action, and certain development practices are led by certain development
concepts. Whether the development concept is correct or not fundamentally determines the
development effectiveness and even the success or failure. Practice tells us that development is a
process of constant change, the development environment will not remain static, the development
conditions will not remain static, and the concept of development will naturally not remain static.
Looking back at the course of development since China's reform and opening up, from the great
discussion on the criterion of truth to the establishment of economic construction as the center, from
the reform of the planned economic system to the establishment of the socialist market economic
system, from the addition of the WTO to the leadership of economic globalization, every great leap
in development is the result of ideological emancipation and conceptual change.

To establish a new development concept, we must comprehensively promote the reform of the
development concept.

To comprehensively promote the reform of the development concept, we must persist in
emancipating the mind and updating the concept. Establishing and practicing the new development
concept means a fundamental change in the traditional development thinking and development
mode, which will inevitably be accompanied by the emancipation of the mind and the renewal of
concepts. Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "The establishment of a new concept is always
accompanied by the destruction of the old concept. "1 In the face of new development practices,
some things that were effective in the past may not be effective now; some things that were out of
date in the past are imperative now; and some things that were insurmountable in the past and need
breakthroughs now. For example, China's economy has shifted from a high-speed growth stage to a
high-quality development stage, and we can no longer simply judge the heroes by GDP and measure
the quality of economic development, not because the speed is higher, the situation is "very good",
nor is the speed down, the situation is very bad, but depends on whether there is quality and
efficiency. For another example, in the face of the dash to build a moderately prosperous society in
an all-round way and the task of building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round
way, it is no longer possible to simply work fast and fast, and we can no longer rely on extensive
development methods and strong stimulation to raise the speed, we must take emancipation of the
mind as the "general switch", establish a way of thinking that is compatible with the development
of the times and practice, resolutely break the outdated concepts of one-sided pursuit of GDP,
fighting for resources and people, emphasizing cities over rural areas, pollution before treatment,
and efficiency over fairness, and lead new development practices with new development concepts.
To establish and practice the new development concept, we should not stop at words, but should be
used as a yardstick for behavior, consciously check the actual work in all aspects, encourage and
support those that meet the requirements, oppose and discard those that do not conform, and better
keep up with the times in the process of emancipating the mind and win new development in the
process of changing concepts.

To comprehensively promote the reform of development concepts, we must persist in seeking truth
from facts and acting according to laws. On the issue of development, we have both successful
experiences and profound lessons. Successful experience lies in persistently proceeding from reality
and acting in accordance with objective laws; lessons are mainly reflected in being divorced from
reality and violating laws. For example, some localities develop one-sidedly and deformed
development, some localities exhaust their resources to fish and eat too much food, and some
localities compete with the people for profits and neglect people's livelihood, etc., which have
brought many contradictions and problems to economic and social development. Comrade Xi
Jinping stressed: "Development must be scientific development that follows economic laws,
sustainable development that follows natural laws, and inclusive development that follows social
laws."

Fundamentally speaking, the new development concept is to build development on the basis of
better grasping the law and acting according to the law, so as to achieve more quality and higher
level of development. To implement the new development concept, it is necessary to enhance the
awareness of laws, promote the transformation of economic development mode in accordance with
the requirements of economic laws, adhere to the organic unity of development speed, quality and
efficiency, and promote scientific development and high-quality development; in accordance with
the requirements of natural laws, respect nature, conform to nature, protect nature, promote the
formation of green development methods and lifestyles, and achieve sustainable development; in
accordance with the requirements of social laws, strengthen social construction. Innovate social
governance, make the results of reform and development more equitable and benefit all the people,
and achieve inclusive development.

To comprehensively promote the reform of development concepts, we must adhere to systematic
thinking and grasp them as a whole. The new development concept contains all aspects with the
same theme and goal, each with its own focus and mutual support, forming an internal logical system
of a system. Among them, innovation is the core and soul of development, coordination is the basic
method of development, green is the inherent requirement of development, openness is the
characteristics of the era of development, and sharing is the starting point and fundamental
destination of development. All aspects are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, and run
through the entire development process. Therefore, we must understand the new development
concept as an inseparable whole, think systematically and grasp it comprehensively. In line with
this, in the specific work practice of implementing the new development concept, we must also
adhere to the systematic viewpoint, carry out systematic design in accordance with the integrity and
relevance of the new development concept, adhere to and implement as one, so as to promote and
complement each other. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The comrades of the whole party must
improve the ability and level of unified implementation of the five major development concepts and
constantly open up new realms of development."2 This requires us to enhance our ability to think
systematically, persist in observing things in a developmental rather than static manner,
comprehensively rather than partially, systematically rather than piecemeal, and universally linked
rather than singular and isolated, properly handle various major relations in development, seek
advantages and avoid disadvantages while weighing advantages and disadvantages, and make the
most favorable strategic choice.

2. Accelerate the construction of institutional mechanisms based on the new development
concept

To implement the new development concept, involving the change of way of thinking, behavior and
working mode, and involving the adjustment of social relations, interest relations and work relations,
we must comprehensively innovate the development system, reshape the development ecology,
solve problems and build mechanisms in solving the development momentum and enhancing the
integrity, coordination, balance and inclusiveness of development, so that various reform measures
can take root, ensure that the new ideas are transformed into new practices and new actions, and
form a conducive to innovative development, coordinated development, green development, open
development, Institutional mechanisms for shared development.
First, adhere to innovation to lead development, and accelerate the construction of innovative
development systems and mechanisms. Under the situation of increasingly fierce international
development competition and the transformation of China's development momentum, we must focus
on innovation and form an institutional framework to promote innovation. The first is to deepen the
reform of the scientific and technological system and give play to the leading role of scientific and
technological innovation in comprehensive innovation. Reform the investment system for scientific
and technological innovation, establish a categorized investment mechanism for scientific research
and technological innovation, and strengthen the main position of enterprises in innovation. The
government should vigorously support scientific and technological products and services with
"public goods" attributes and externalities, such as cutting-edge technologies, major common key
technologies, and public welfare technologies. Improve the organizational mechanism of scientific
and technological innovation, and give play to the guiding role of the market in the direction of
technology research and development, the choice of routes, and the allocation of various innovative
resources. At the same time, we should give full play to the institutional advantages of concentrating
forces to do major things, pay attention to major technologies that break through the overall situation
of related development, and concentrate on overcoming a number of "stuck neck" technologies.
Improve the incentive mechanism for scientific and technological innovation, improve the
distribution mechanism that fully reflects the value of intellectual labor, accelerate the
decentralization of the right to use, dispose of and benefit from scientific and technological
achievements, and allow scientific and technological personnel to receive reasonable returns in
innovation activities. The second is to deepen the reform of the talent system and innovate the
mechanism for training, using and attracting talent. Focusing on building a large-scale, innovative
spirit and risk-taking innovative talent team, build an innovative talent training model, establish and
improve the two-way flow mechanism for scientific research talents, implement a more competitive
talent attraction system, train and attract talents in accordance with the law of innovation, and realize
the full use of talents, talents and achievements. The third is to build an open innovation mechanism.
Adhere to the combination of bringing in and going out, integrate the global innovation network
with a more proactive attitude, absorb global innovation resources with a broader mind, and promote
the output of technology and standards with a more active strategy at a higher level. Next, build an
open innovation mechanism to promote the formation of a deeply integrated open innovation
situation.

Second, persist in enhancing the comprehensive effectiveness of overall development and accelerate
the construction of institutional mechanisms for coordinated development. Focusing on solving the
problem of unbalanced and insufficient development, reform and improve relevant mechanisms and
policies. First, it is necessary to improve the mechanism for the coordinated development of material
civilization and spiritual civilization. While building a highly developed material civilization, we
should vigorously promote the building of spiritual civilization, further strengthen overall planning
and coordination, improve the leadership system and working mechanism, form a work pattern of
joint grasp and joint management, and ensure that the achievements of the "two civilizations" are
shared by all the people. Second, we should build a new mechanism for coordinated regional
development. Strive to promote the large-scale development of the western region to form a new
pattern, promote the comprehensive revitalization of the northeast, give full play to its advantages
to promote the rise of the central region, take the lead in innovation and take the lead in realizing
the optimal development of the eastern region, focus on the implementation of the "Belt and Road"
construction, the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the development of the
Yangtze River Economic Belt and other strategies, and accelerate the construction of a new
mechanism for the coordinated development of regions with orderly and free flow of factors,
effective constraints on main functions, equal basic public services, and bearable resources and
environment. Third, we should establish and improve the institutional mechanism for integrated
urban and rural development. Adhere to the priority development of agriculture and rural areas,
consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land
system, improve the reform of the "separation of powers" of contracted land, and deepen the reform
of the rural collective property rights system. Deeply has implemented the strategy of rural
revitalization and accelerated the modernization of agriculture and rural areas in accordance with
the general requirements of prosperous industry, ecological livability, civilized rural customs,
effective governance, and rich life. Promote people-centered new-type urbanization, deepen the
reform of the household registration system, accelerate the urbanization of the rural migrant
population, and strive to achieve equality between urban and rural areas for basic public services.
Fourth, it is necessary to establish a mechanism for coordinated development of economic
construction and national defense construction. Adhere to the integration of military and civilian use,
integrate military with civilian use, accelerate the formation of an all-factor, multi-field, and high-
efficiency military-civilian integration development pattern, and enhance the coordination of
military-civilian sharing of advanced technologies, industrial products, and infrastructure.
Third, adhere to resource conservation and ecological protection, and accelerate the construction of
green development systems and mechanisms. Firmly adhere to the basic national policy of saving
resources and protecting the environment, and continuously promote institutional innovation and
policy system improvement. First, we must start from the source, reshape the endogenous power
mechanism, and form a green development mode and lifestyle. Accelerate the establishment of a
legal system and policy guidance for green production and consumption, establish and improve an
economic system for green and low-carbon circular development, build a market-oriented green
technology innovation system, accelerate the construction of ecological function zones, and
establish a market-oriented and diversified ecological compensation mechanism. Second, we must
comprehensively strengthen the construction of the ecological civilization system.

We will establish and improve an ecological and cultural system with ecological values as the
criterion, an ecological economic system with industrial ecology and ecological industrialization as
the main body, a target responsibility system with improving the quality of the ecological
environment as the core, an ecological civilization system guaranteed by the modernization of the
governance system and governance capacity, and an ecological security system focusing on the
virtuous cycle of the ecosystem and the effective prevention and control of environmental risks.
Third, we should focus on solving prominent environmental problems and build an environmental
governance system led by the government, with enterprises as the main body, social organizations
and the public participating. Through raising pollution discharge standards, strengthening the
responsibility of polluters, and improving systems such as environmental credit evaluation,
mandatory disclosure of information, and severe punishments, we will achieve fundamental
solutions to prominent environmental problems.
Fourth, adhere to the basic national policy of opening up to the outside world and accelerate the
construction of an open development system and mechanism. Take the initiative to participate in
and actively promote the process of economic globalization, develop a higher-level open economy,
and promote the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening up. First, we must promote
the joint construction of the "Belt and Road.” Following the principle of consultation, co-
construction and sharing, with policy communication, facility connectivity, unimpeded trade,
financial integration and people-to-people ties as the main contents, we will strive to build the "Belt
and Road" into a road of peace, prosperity, openness, innovation and civilization. Second, we should
promote the construction of a strong trade country. Accelerate the transformation of foreign trade
development mode, innovate cross-border e-commerce, market procurement trade development,
foreign trade comprehensive service enterprises and other foreign trade development models,
innovate foreign investment methods, implement active import policies, create a world-class
business environment, greatly relax market standards, and expand the opening up of the service
industry. Third, it is necessary to speed up the cultivation of new advantages in international
economic cooperation and competition. Promote international production capacity cooperation,
form a global-oriented trade, investment and financing, production and service network, support
enterprises to expand foreign investment, promote equipment, technology, standards and services to
go global, and build a number of world-class multinational enterprises with global competitiveness.
Fourth, efforts should be made to promote global economic governance. Strengthen international
economic policy coordination, actively participate in the formulation of international rules in new
fields such as the deep sea, polar regions, outer space and the Internet, promote the process of
multilateral trade negotiations, accelerate the implementation of the free trade area and free trade
island strategy, and promote the reform of the international monetary system and international
financial regulation.

Fifth, persist in promoting and safeguarding social fairness and justice, and accelerate the
construction of institutional mechanisms for shared development. First, it is necessary to ensure that
educational development is fairer and more quality. Deepen educational reform, improve the quality
of education, promote educational equity, promote the balanced development of compulsory
education, and enable all people to share the dividends of education reform. Second, it is necessary
to ensure higher-quality employment in terms of system. Adhere to the employment priority strategy
and place the employment priority policy at the macro policy level;

Completely break down barriers and identity discrimination in the employment and
entrepreneurship markets, improve entrepreneurship support policies, build a good entrepreneurial
platform, create a new engine for mass entrepreneurship and innovation, and create more
opportunities for participation in shared development. Third, we should continue to deepen the
reform of the medical and health system and implement the Healthy China Strategy. Establish a
basic medical and health system covering urban and rural areas and a modern hospital management
system, accelerate the pace of reform of public hospitals, optimize the layout of medical and health
institutions, promote the flow of medical resources to the grassroots and rural areas, and encourage
social forces to develop health services. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of the
social security system. Establish a fairer and more sustainable social security system, implement a
universal participation plan, basically achieve full coverage of statutory personnel, realize the
national overall planning of basic pensions for employees, establish a reasonable adjustment
mechanism for basic pensions, fully implement the serious illness insurance system for urban and
rural residents, coordinate the social assistance system, promote the integration of relevant systems,
and ensure the basic livelihood of the people in difficulty. From the strategic perspective of the
transformation of major social contradictions, examine the relationship between fairness and
efficiency, strengthen and innovate social governance, divide the "cake" well while making the
"cake" bigger, ensure that the fruits of development benefit all the people, let the people have more
sense of gain, gradually realize common prosperity, and promote social fairness and justice.
The new development concept points out the right direction and follows the development of
contemporary China. To successfully realize the party's historical mission and goal in the new era,
we must unify our thinking and action with the new development concept, strive to improve the
ability and level of overall implementation of the new development concept, resolutely change the
understanding that it is not suitable or even contrary to the new development concept, resolutely
correct behaviors that are not suitable for the new development concept, and constantly make new
breakthroughs in enhancing the ability to innovate, promote the balance of development, improve
the ecological environment, raise the level of openness, and promote shared development.
