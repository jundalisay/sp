2. The inherent requirements of China's actual development

Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and the main contradictions in our
society have been transformed, but the basic national conditions of our country that are still in the
primary stage of socialism and will remain for a long time have not changed

China's international status as the world's largest developing country has not changed, and
development remains the foundation and key to solving all China's problems. To build a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way and realize the "two centenary goals", it is still necessary to
take development as the first priority, take economic construction as the center, and continue to
promote all-round economic and social development. However, development must be scientific and
adhere to the new development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing.

The new development concept is a fundamental policy for China's economic development into the
new normal. China's economy has entered a new normal and encountered a series of new situations
and contradictions. 

From a domestic point of view, China's economic development is in the node of
economic development speed shifting, economic development structural adjustment node and
economic development power conversion node. The downward pressure on the economy has
increased, the driving force formed by low-cost resources and factor investment has weakened
significantly, and economic growth needs a stronger driving force. Under the new normal, China's
economic development is facing a shift in growth rate from high-speed growth to medium-high-
speed growth, a shift in development mode from scale and speed to quality and efficiency, economic
restructuring from incremental capacity expansion to stock adjustment, optimization and increment,
and development momentum from mainly relying on resources and low-cost labor and other factors
to innovation-driven. These changes are the necessary process for China's economy to evolve to a
stage with a more advanced form, a more optimized division of labor, and a more reasonable
structure. From an international point of view, China's export advantages and participation in the
international industrial division of labor model are facing new challenges. In 2008, the international
financial crisis broke out, the world economy entered a period of deep adjustment, and the
development of global trade entered a period of downturn, resulting in a slowdown in the growth
rate of China's export demand. At the same time, from the historical experience of some world
trading countries, as China's exports of goods account for more than 10% of the world's total, the
turning point of China's export growth has arrived, and it is impossible to maintain high export
growth and a high proportion of exports to GDP in the future. This requires more economic growth
to be driven by innovation and expanding domestic demand, especially consumer demand. In the
face of new changes in the international and domestic situation, it is obviously not feasible to follow
the extensive development model and simply pursue the growth rate, and we must establish a new
development concept to lead and promote China's economy from a high-speed growth stage to a
high-quality development stage.

The new development concept is a strategic guide for the prominent problems and challenges facing
China's development. After unremitting efforts in the 70 years since the founding of New China,
especially in the more than 40 years of reform and opening up, China is generally in the period of
"after development", and the interrelatedness, superposition and complexity of various
contradictions and problems are becoming more and more prominent. For example, although China
has become the world's second largest economy, the problems of large but not strong economy, fast
but not excellent economic growth have not been solved

Economic development still relies heavily on resources and labor and other factors to invest in
people, the driving force of innovation is not enough, the innovation ability is not strong, and the
situation in which core technologies in key areas are subject to people has not fundamentally
changed; the problem of uncoordinated development in urban and rural areas is still relatively
prominent, the level and layout of productivity in different regions and different fields are very
uneven, there are still insufficient development problems in some regions, some fields, and some
aspects, and the development task is still very heavy; the carrying capacity of the environment has
reached or is close to the upper limit, and it is difficult to bear high consumption. With extensive
development, the pressure on the ecological environment has not been fundamentally alleviated; the
level of China's opening up to the outside world is not high on the whole, the ability to make good
use of the two markets and resources at home and abroad is not strong enough, the ability to deal
with international economic and trade frictions and win the right to speak in the international
economy is still relatively weak, and the ability to use international economic and trade rules is not
strong enough; there is still a problem of imbalance between economic growth and improvement of
people's livelihood in development, there are still many shortcomings in the field of people's
livelihood, the task of poverty alleviation is arduous, the gap in income distribution is still large, and
the masses are still in employment, education, medical care, housing, There are still many problems
in the elderly, and the people's sense of gain and happiness still needs to be improved. These
problems must be resolved in the process of building a modern and powerful socialist country. The
new development concept is put forward in response to these problems and is the right solution to
development problems and sustainable development.

In short, development is a process of constant change, the development environment will not remain
static, the development conditions will not remain static, and the development concept will naturally
not remain static. Innovating development concepts in a timely manner according to changes in the
development environment and development conditions is an inherent requirement for coping with
development problems and creating a new situation in development.

3. advanced concepts proven by development practice

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the face of the new normal
of China's economic development, the transition period of world economic development, and the
new development pattern of new breakthroughs in the development of world science and technology,
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has adhered to the new
development concept to lead the new normal of economic development, accelerated the formation
of a mechanism and environment that advocates innovation, pays attention to coordination,
advocates green, cultivates openness, and promotes sharing, and promotes economic and social
development to achieve historic achievements.
First, adhere to innovative development and promote the transformation of growth momentum.
Vigorously implement the innovation-driven development strategy, the reform of the scientific and
technological system has been greatly promoted, a large number of major scientific and
technological achievements have come out one after another, and new technologies, new production
ports, new industries and new formats have flourished;

The supporting role of new momentum on the economy has been significantly enhanced, and the
contribution rate of scientific and technological progress has increased from 52.2% in 2012 to 57.5%
in 2018, and the country's comprehensive innovation ability ranks 17th in the world. Second, adhere
to coordinated development and enhance the integrity of development. Major strategies such as the
"Belt and Road" construction, the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and the
development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt have been implemented, the Guangdong-Hong
Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area has been planned and promoted, and the regional integration
development of the Yangtze River Delta, ecological protection and high-quality development of the
Yellow River Basin have been promoted, and the gap between regions has been narrowing. With the
implementation of the rural revitalization strategy, the gap between urban and rural income has
narrowed from 3.13 times in 2011 to 2.2 in 201869 times. The third is to adhere to green
development and enhance the sustainability of development. The concept of "green water and green
mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains" is deeply rooted in the hearts of the people,
the intensity of energy and resource consumption has been greatly reduced, the prevention and
control of air, water and soil pollution has achieved obvious results, and the environmental situation
has been improved. Fourth, adhere to open development and create a new pattern of opening up.
Advocating and promoting the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", initiating the establishment
of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, setting up the Silk Road Fund, and advocating the
concept of win-win cooperation, the international space has broadened the international space for
China's development. Holding high the banner of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation,
and actively guiding economic globalization in the right direction, China's influence on global
economic development and its voice in global economic governance have been greatly enhanced.
Fifth, adhere to shared development and enhance people's sense of gain, happiness and security.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, more than 78 million new jobs
have been created in cities and towns, the income of residents has generally increased faster than
economic growth, decisive progress has been made in the battle against poverty, and the number of
poor people has decreased by more than 93 million. The social security system covering urban and
rural residents has been basically established, the level of security has steadily improved, the
people's health and medical care level has been rapidly improved, and the degree of equalization of
basic public services has been continuously improved, forming the world's largest middle-income
group.

Under the guidance of the new development concept, China has successfully coped with the dual
pressure of the continuous fermentation of the domestic "three-phase superposition" and the impact
of the international financial crisis, maintained stable economic and social development, and
reached a new level of economic strength and comprehensive national strength. Since the 18th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's economy has grown by an average of
about 7% per year, and the total economic volume has increased from 54 trillion yuan in 2012 to 99
trillion yuan in 2019. China's contribution rate to the world economy exceeds 30% annually,
becoming the main power source and stabilizer of world economic growth.
Fundamentally speaking, the historic achievements of China's economic and social development are
the result of unswervingly implementing the new development concept, resolutely correcting the
concept of development, transforming the mode of development, and improving the quality and
efficiency of development. Practice has fully proved that the new development concept is an
advanced concept guiding China's development practice in the new era, and an important guideline
that China's economic and social development must adhere to for a long time.
