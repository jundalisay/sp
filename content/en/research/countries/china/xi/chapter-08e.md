2. deeply understand the connotation of high-quality development

High-quality economic development can be understood from both narrow and broad perspectives.
In a narrow sense, high-quality economic development means that an economy (or enterprise) can
rationally allocate production factors through scientific and technological means in terms of input,
promote efficiency changes, realize the allocation of resource factors from extensive operation to
intensive and economical operation, and greatly improve the utilization efficiency of resource
factors; It can promote quality change and power change through technological innovation and
management innovation, so that the output quality and efficiency can be significantly improved. In
a broad sense, understanding high-quality economic development is not only limited to the scope of
economic growth, but also considers social, political, cultural and ecological influencing factors.
Specifically, high-quality economic development should contain the following connotations.
First, high-quality development is the development that embodies the new development concept.
The Fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee proposed to establish and adhere to
the development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing.

Promoting China's economic and social development according to the new development concept is
a general trend, of which innovation is the first driving force to lead development, focusing on
solving the problem of development power; coordination is the inherent requirement of sustainable
and healthy development, focusing on solving the problem of unbalanced development; green is the
inevitable condition for sustainable development and an important embodiment of people's pursuit
of a better life, focusing on solving the problem of harmony between man and nature; opening up is
the only way for the country to prosper and develop, and focusing on solving the problem of internal
and external linkage of development; Sharing is the essence of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, focusing on solving the problem of social fairness and justice. The new development
concept is China's action guide to solve development problems, enhance development momentum,
and cultivate development advantages.

Second, high-quality development is the development of high-quality supply and high-quality
demand. From the perspective of supply, high-quality development should have a relatively
complete industrial system, networked and intelligent production organization, strong innovation,
brand influence, core competitiveness and the ability to discover and capture demand. From the
perspective of demand, high-quality development should continue to meet the personalized,
diversified and upgrading needs of the people, which in turn leads to changes in the supply system
and structure, and supply changes continue to generate new demand.

Third, high-quality development is the development that maximizes the benefits of input and output.
An important symbol of high-quality development is to continuously improve the input and output
efficiency of labor, capital, land, resources, environment and other factors, continuously improve
the contribution rate of scientific and technological progress, and continuously improve total factor
productivity. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "economic development is to improve the
efficiency of the allocation of resources, especially scarce resources, and to produce as many
products as possible with as few resources as possible and obtain the greatest possible benefits.‚Äù1
Fourth, the development of high seat capacity is the development of smooth economic circulation.
The economic cycle is the process of benign interaction between production and circulation,
distribution and consumption, virtual and physical, domestic and foreign, which is the basis for
sustainable economic development. At present, there are three major imbalances in China's economy:
the structural imbalance between supply and demand in the real economy, the imbalance between
finance and the real economy, and the imbalance between real estate and the real economy. This is
a concrete manifestation of the poor economic cycle. To promote high-quality development, we
must smooth the national economic cycle, accelerate the construction of a unified, open, competitive
and orderly modern market system, improve the ability of the financial system to serve the real
economy, and form a virtuous circle of domestic market and production subjects, economic growth
and employment expansion, and finance and real economy.

Fifth, high-quality development is development with scientific and rational distribution. Income
distribution is both the result of economic operation and the driving force of economic development.
The quality of income distribution directly reflects the advantages and disadvantages of the
economic structure. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out when talking about the new normal: "To
promote economic development, we must pay more attention to improving the quality and efficiency
of development. Measuring the quality and efficiency of development means that investment has a
return, products have a market, enterprises have profits, employees have income, the government
has taxes, and the environment has improvement, which is the development we want. 1 The
investment mentioned here has a return, the enterprise has profits, the employees have income, and
the government has taxes, which is how to distribute it reasonably.

3. Accelerate the construction of a modern economic system

To promote high-quality development, we must build a modern economic system. Building a
modern economic system is a major strategic deployment made by Comrade Xi Jinping for
economic construction at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. At present,
China's economic development is in the critical period of transforming the development mode,
optimizing the economic structure, and transforming the growth momentum, and building a modern
economic system is not only an urgent requirement for crossing the threshold, but also a strategic
goal of China's development.

To build a modern economic system, the basic principle is quality first, efficiency first; the main
line is to deepen supply-side structural reform; the basic path is to promote the quality change,
efficiency change, power change of economic development, and improve total factor productivity;
the focus is to accelerate the construction of the real economy, scientific and technological
innovation, modern finance, human resources coordinated development of the industrial system; the
institutional guarantee is to build an economic system with effective market mechanism, vitality of
micro subjects, and degree of macro-control; the fundamental goal is to continuously enhance the
innovation and competitiveness of China's economy. In short, the modern economic system is an
economic system led by the new development concept and high-quality development as the core,
with a reasonable economic structure, strong innovation momentum, intensive development
methods, real economic revitalization, and sound institutional mechanisms.

The modern economic system is an economic system in which the modernization of productive
forces and the modernization of production relations interact benignly. Comrade Xi Jinping was the
third in the 19th Politburo of the CPC Central Committee on January 30, 2018

The collective study pointed out: "The modern economic system is an organic whole composed of
the interrelationships and internal connections of all links, levels and fields of social and economic
activities.1 In this regard, he clearly put forward the organic composition and specific goals of the
"seven systems", that is, (1) build an industrial system led by innovation and coordinated
development, realize the coordinated development of the real economy, scientific and technological
innovation, modern finance, and human resources, and continuously increase the contribution share
of scientific and technological innovation in the development of the real economy. The ability of
modern financial services to the real economy has been continuously enhanced, and the role of
human resources in supporting the development of the real economy has been continuously
optimized(2) Build a unified, open and orderly market system, realize smooth market access, open
and orderly market, full market competition, and standardized market order, and accelerate the
formation of a modern market system in which enterprises operate independently and compete fairly,
consumers freely choose their own consumption, and commodities and factors flow freely and
exchange equally; (3) Build an income distribution system that embodies efficiency and promotes
fairness, and realizes reasonable income distribution, social fairness and justice, All the people will
prosper together, promote the equalization of basic public services, and gradually narrow the income
distribution gap ;(4) Build an urban and rural regional development system that highlights
advantages and coordinates linkages, realizes benign regional interaction, integrated urban and rural
development, and overall optimization of land and sea, and cultivates and gives play to regional
comparative advantages. Strengthen the complementarity of regional advantages and shape a new
pattern of coordinated regional development; (5) Build a resource-saving and environment-friendly
green development system, realize green cycle and low-carbon development, harmonious
coexistence between man and nature, firmly establish and practice the concept that green water and
green mountains are golden mountains and silver mountains, and form a new pattern of harmonious
development and modernization of man and nature;( 6) Build a diversified, balanced, safe and
efficient comprehensive opening system, develop a higher-level open economy, and promote the
transformation of opening up in the direction of optimizing structure, expanding depth and
improving efficiency; (7) Build an economic system that gives full play to the role of the market
and better plays the role of the government, so as to achieve effective market mechanisms, vitality
of micro-subjects, and degree of macro-control.

To build a modern economic system, it is necessary to fulfill the following tasks at present and for
some time to come.

First, vigorously develop the real economy and build a solid foundation for a modern economic
system. The real economy is the foundation of a country's economy, the fundamental source of
wealth creation, and an important pillar of national strength.

In order to create a down-to-earth, hard-working entrepreneurship, industrial prosperity
development environment and social atmosphere. The optimization and upgrading of industrial
structure is a key measure to improve the comprehensive competitiveness of the real economy. It is
necessary to accelerate the transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, deeply promote
the deep integration of informatization and industrialization, focus on cultivating strategic emerging
industries, vigorously develop the service industry, especially the modern service industry, actively
cultivate new formats and new business models, and build a new system for modern industrial
development. It is necessary to promote the deep integration of the Internet, big data, artificial
intelligence and the real economy, accelerate the digitalization and intelligence of traditional
industries, promote industrial technological change and optimization and upgrading with intelligent
manufacturing as the main direction of attack, promote the fundamental transformation of
manufacturing industry models and enterprise forms, drive "revolution" with "Dingxin", drive stock
with increments, and promote China's industry to move towards the middle and high end of the
global value chain.

The second is to accelerate the implementation of the innovation-driven development strategy and
strengthen the strategic support of the modern economic system. Strengthen the construction of the
national innovation system, step up the layout of national laboratories, reorganize the state key
laboratory system, increase support for the innovation of small and medium-sized enterprises,
strengthen the protection and application of intellectual property rights, and form an effective
innovation incentive mechanism. Promote the deep integration of scientific and technological
innovation and economic and social development, and shape more innovation-driven and first-
mover leading development.

The third is to actively promote the coordinated development of urban and rural areas and optimize
the spatial layout of the modern economic system. It is necessary to cultivate and give play to
regional comparative advantages, implement the main functional area system, strengthen the
complementarity of regional advantages, broaden the development space in coordinated
development, and enhance development stamina in strengthening weak areas. Implement the
coordinated regional development strategy, promote the coordinated development of the Beijing-
Tianjin-Hebei region and the development of the Yangtze River Economic Belt, build the
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and promote the integrated development of the
Yangtze River Delta, ecological protection and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin.
Solidly promote the strategy of rural revitalization, adhere to the priority development of agriculture
and rural areas, establish and improve the institutional mechanisms and policy systems for integrated
development of urban and rural areas in accordance with the general requirements of prosperous
industry, ecological livability, civilized rural customs, effective governance and rich life, make
overall plans to promote rural economic construction, political construction, cultural construction,
social construction, ecological civilization construction and party building, accelerate the
modernization of rural governance systems and governance capabilities, and accelerate the
modernization of agriculture and rural areas. Take the road of socialist rural revitalization with
Chinese characteristics, let agriculture become a leading industry, make farmers an attractive
occupation, and let the countryside become a beautiful home to live and work in peace and
contentment.

The fourth is to promote all-round opening up and enhance the international competitiveness of the
modern economic system. Make better use of global resources and markets, and promote the
transformation from the opening of commodity and factor flows to the opening of institutions such
as rules.

Relax market access, fully implement the pre-establishment national treatment plus negative list
management system, protect the legitimate rights and interests of foreign investors in China,
especially intellectual property rights, and allow sole proprietorship in more fields. We will continue
to actively promote international exchanges and cooperation under the framework of the Belt and
Road.

Fifth, deepen the reform of the economic system and improve the institutional guarantee for the
modern economic system. The reform of the economic system must focus on improving the property
rights system and the market-oriented configuration of factors, so as to achieve effective incentives
for property rights, free flow of factors, flexible price response, fair and orderly competition, and
survival of the fittest. Accelerate the improvement of basic economic systems such as the socialist
market economic system with public ownership as the mainstay, the common development of
various ownership economies, distribution according to work as the mainstay, and the coexistence
of various distribution methods; accelerate the reform of state-owned assets and state-owned
enterprises, further support the development of private enterprises, and stimulate the vitality of
innovation and entrepreneurship in the whole society; accelerate the reform of the fiscal, taxation,
and financial systems, and resolutely eliminate the shortcomings of various systems and
mechanisms.

Comrade Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out: "Building a modern economic system is a big article,
not only a major theoretical proposition, but also a major practical topic." 1 In accordance with the
arrangements and requirements of the Party Central Committee, we must enhance the innovation
and competitiveness of our economy by building a modern economic system, promote China's
economic development to a new vitality, move to a new level, and achieve high-quality development.
