2. the political development path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has demonstrated its unique advantages

The path of socialist political development with Chinese characteristics is conducive to giving play
to the characteristics and advantages of the socialist system, developing people's democracy,
promoting economic and social development, safeguarding national unity, ethnic unity, people's
well-being and social harmony, and providing a strong political guarantee for the Party to unite and
lead the people to realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

Demonstrate the superiority of socialism. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The socialist system
with Chinese characteristics insists on organically combining the fundamental political system and
basic political system with the basic economic system and various institutional mechanisms and
other specific systems, insists on organically combining the democratic system at the national level
with the grassroots democratic system, and insists on organically combining the party's leadership,
the people being masters of the country and governing the country according to law, which conforms
to China's national conditions, embodies the characteristics and advantages of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and is the fundamental institutional guarantee for China's development and
progress."1 The development and improvement of the political development path of socialism with
Chinese characteristics has effectively ensured that the people enjoy broader and fuller rights and
freedoms and ensured that the people have extensively participated in national and social
governance; effectively regulated state political relations, enhanced national cohesion, and formed
a stable and united political situation; effectively promoted the liberation and development of social
productive forces, promoted various undertakings of modernization, and promoted the continuous
improvement of the people's quality of life and standards;

It has effectively safeguarded national independence and self-determination, safeguarded national
sovereignty, security and development interests, safeguarded the well-being of the Chinese people
and the Chinese nation, and fully demonstrated the superiority of socialism.
Provide a fundamental guarantee for people's democracy. Democracy is fundamentally a political
institutional arrangement, involving major issues such as the state and the form of government. As
early as 1940, Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly pointed out in "On New Democracy" that "without
an appropriate form of political power organs, the state cannot be represented",1 which also clarified
the internal relationship between the state system determining the political system and the political
system reflecting the state system. China's Constitution stipulates: "The People's Republic of China
is a socialist state under the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on
the alliance of workers and peasants", and "all power in the People's Republic of China belongs to
the people."2 As far as the state system is concerned, socialist democracy is fundamentally different
from any form of democracy in Chinese history. As far as the form of government is concerned, the
Constitution stipulates that China implements the system of people's congresses to ensure that the
people are masters of their own country. This shows that socialist democracy with Chinese
characteristics adheres to the people's dominant position and protects the people's rights in political,
economic, cultural and social aspects in an institutionalized form. The people are guaranteed to
exercise their rights to democratic election, democratic decision-making, democratic management
and democratic supervision, and to administer state affairs, economic and cultural undertakings and
social affairs in accordance with the law; It is guaranteed that state organs and their functionaries
accept the people's supervision and serve the people wholeheartedly; and that the state's major
policies and policies embody the will of the people, safeguard the people's interests, and promote
all-round human development. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "In carrying out socialist
modernization, we aim to catch up with the developed capitalist countries economically, create a
higher and more effective democracy politically than the capitalist countries, and bring up more and
better qualified personnel than these countries."3
Comrade Xi Jinping put forward the criteria of "eight cans"4 with keen political vision and profound
theoretical thinking. Using such criteria to examine China's political practice can provide a clearer
understanding of the effectiveness of China's political system: First, whether the country's leadership
can be changed in an orderly manner in accordance with the law. After the reform and opening up,


China has abolished the lifelong system of leading posts that actually exists, universally
implemented the tenure system for leading cadres, and achieved an orderly replacement of the
country's leadership and leading cadres at all levels. Second, whether the entire people can manage
state and social affairs and economic and cultural undertakings in accordance with the law. Our
Constitution has special provisions to stipulate this, and at the same time has a fundamental political
system, a basic political system and a variety of democratic mechanisms, effectively guaranteeing
that the people enjoy a wide range of rights and freedoms and participate in national governance
and social management. Third, whether the masses of the people can freely express their interests
and demands. We have continuously expanded the orderly participation of citizens, and the content
and forms of people's mastery have become more and more extensive. Fourth, whether all sectors
of society can effectively participate in the country's political life. We have adhered to and
developed the broadest patriotic united front, developed unique socialist consultative democracy,
and effectively pooled forces from all sectors of society. Fifth, whether national decision-making
can be scientific and democratic. We continuously enhance the transparency and participation in
decision-making, strive to build a decision-making mechanism that understands public opinion,
reflects public sentiment, concentrates people's wisdom, and cherishes people's strength, so as to
ensure that decision-making conforms to the interests and aspirations of the people. Sixth, whether
talents from all walks of life can enter the national leadership and management system through fair
competition. We recruit a wide range of talented people and use systems and mechanisms to gather
outstanding talents in various undertakings of the party and the state. Seventh, whether the ruling
party can exercise leadership over state affairs in accordance with constitutional law. We adhere to
the joint advancement of governing the country according to law, ruling according to law and
administering according to law, and vigorously promoting the construction of a rule of law in China,
with remarkable results. Eighth, whether the use of power can be effectively checked and supervised.
We have established and improved a multi-level power supervision system, reformed the state
supervision system, and ensured that Party and state organs and personnel, as well as all kinds of
public power subjects, exercise their powers in accordance with legal authorities and procedures.
All this clearly shows that the socialist democratic political system with Chinese characteristics
plays a unique advantage and effectiveness in ensuring that the people are masters of their own
country. The realization of democratic political forms is rich and varied, and we cannot stick to rigid
models. Practice has fully proved that Chinese-style democracy works and works well in China.
Strong self-improvement ability. The historical process of the Communist Party of China in
promoting the construction of socialist democratic politics is a historical process of constantly
gaining insight into the development trend of the times and actively conforming to the expectations
of the people, a historical process of constantly deepening the reform of systems and mechanisms,
stimulating the creative vitality of the whole society, and constantly improving the socialist legal
system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the gradual deepening of the rule of law.
Persisting in advancing with the times and upholding the right and bringing forth the new is a
distinctive feature of China's socialist democratic political construction. "Socialist democracy with
Chinese characteristics is a new thing and a good thing.

Of course, this does not mean that China's political system is perfect and does not need to be
improved and developed.1 The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed
that by the middle of this century, China should be built into a prosperous, strong, democratic,
civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist country, which requires the comprehensive
improvement of material, political, spiritual, social and ecological civilizations, and the
comprehensive realization of the modernization of the national governance system and governance
capabilities. It is fully believed that the political development path of socialism with Chinese
characteristics will inevitably achieve a new and higher level of leap.
