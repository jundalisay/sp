2. "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" is the best way to achieve national reunification

The principle of "one country, two systems" on how to resolve the problem of relations between
regions with two different social systems within a country and the reunification of one country is an
invention of the Chinese Communists, a great initiative in the history of mankind, a new idea and
new plan provided by China for the international community to solve similar problems, and a new
contribution made by the Chinese nation to world peace and development. The concept of "one
country, two systems" adheres to the "one China" principle, maintains the coexistence of "two
systems," and allows Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao a high degree of autonomy, which not only
embodies the principle of realizing the reunification of the motherland and safeguarding national
sovereignty, but also fully considers the history and reality of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao,
embodies a high degree of flexibility, and is the basic principle for promoting the great cause of the
peaceful reunification of the motherland. Adhering to the principle of "one country, two systems"
and deeply promoting the practice of "one country, two systems" conforms to the interests of Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macao residents, the actual needs of prosperity and stability in Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macao, the fundamental interests of the country, and the common will of the people of the whole
country. With regard to the implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems," the CPC
should pay special attention to two points: First, it should be unswerving, unchanging, and
unwavering; second, it should be comprehensive and accurate, ensuring that "one country, two
systems" will not deviate or deform in practice, and will always advance in the correct direction.
The core of "one country, two systems" lies in "one country.” Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out:
"'One country' is the root, and deep roots can make Ye Mao; 'One country' is the foundation, and
the foundation can prosper.1 "One country" is the premise and basis for the implementation of "two
systems", which are subordinate to and derived from "one country" and unified within "one country.”
The "two systems" within "one country" are not equal and shoulder to shoulder, and the main body
of the country must implement the socialist system. Under this premise, proceeding from reality, we
should fully take into account the historical and current conditions of Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macao, and allow them to keep the capitalist system unchanged for a long time. Therefore, the
adherence of the main body of the state to the socialist system is the premise and guarantee for Hong
Kong and Macao to implement the capitalist system and maintain prosperity and stability. The
proposal of "one country, two systems" is first of all to realize and safeguard national unity.

During the Sino-British negotiations on Hong Kong's return, the Chinese government made a clear
statement that the sovereignty issue could not be discussed. After Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, it is all the more necessary to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and
development interests. In the practice of governance in Hong Kong and Macao, it is necessary to
firmly establish the awareness of "one country", adhere to the principle of "one country", and
correctly handle the relationship between the SAR and the central government. Any activity that
endangers national sovereignty and security, challenges the authority of the central authorities and
the Basic Law of the Special Administrative Region, and uses Hong Kong and Macao to infiltrate
and sabotage the mainland is a violation of the bottom line and must not be allowed. On the basis
of "one country," the relationship between the "two systems" should and can be harmonious and
mutually reinforcing.

"One country, two systems" is the best solution to problems left over from history and realize
national reunification. Different systems are not an obstacle to unification, let alone an excuse for
division. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that to solve the Taiwan issue and realize the complete
reunification of the motherland, we must continue to adhere to the principle of "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems", promote the peaceful development of cross-strait
relations, and advance the peace process of the motherland's reunification. "One country, two
systems" is not only the best solution to the Hong Kong and Macao issues left over from history,
but also the best way to resolve the Taiwan issue and realize the complete reunification of the
motherland, and the best system for maintaining Taiwan's long-term prosperity and stability after
cross-strait reunification. "One country, two systems" "embodies the Chinese wisdom of being
inclusive and tolerant, fully considers Taiwan's actual situation, and is conducive to Taiwan's long-
term peace and stability after reunification.”1
