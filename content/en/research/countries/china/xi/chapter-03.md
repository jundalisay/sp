Chapter 3: The leadership of the Communist Party of China is the most essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out in the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China: "The most essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of
the Communist Party of China, and the greatest advantage of the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the Party is the highest
political leading force."1 This major political thesis has further deepened the understanding of the
law of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, enriched and developed
the Marxist party theory and state theory, greatly expanded the theoretical and practical vision of
party building in the new era, and reached a new height in grasping the party's leadership and the
internal relationship between socialism.

Section 1: The party's leadership is the most fundamental
law summary for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics

After the founding of New China, the party made long-term explorations in socialist construction
and accumulated rich experience in both positive and negative aspects. After the Third Plenary
Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, a path of socialism with Chinese characteristics was
embarked upon, and many understandings of regularity were formed. The most fundamental law
summed up is that to build socialism, we must adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party of
China.

The party's leadership is the embodiment of the common will and fundamental interests of the whole
party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, and the fundamental guarantee for
the decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and winning
the great victory of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. Without the leadership of
the Party, other laws would become water without source and wood without roots.

1. The Party's leadership and the socialist cause are intrinsically unified
The Communist Party regards the realization of socialism as its phased goal and the realization of
communism as its highest ideal. Marx and Engels repeatedly expounded a truth in the Communist
Manifesto: socialized large-scale production will inevitably lead to the transformation of the means
of production into social ownership, laying the material foundation for the advent of socialism, and
at the same time inevitably lead the proletariat to form its own party organization. The Communist
Party, which provided the political guarantee for the advent of socialism. The proletarian party is
not only the product of socialized large-scale production, but also a political tool for realizing the
social appropriation of the means of production. "At all stages of development of the struggle
between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the Communists always represent the interests of the
movement as a whole.‚Äù1 In other words, socialism is the noble cause of the Communist Party, and
the establishment, improvement and consolidation of the socialist system cannot be separated from
the Communist Party. To establish the Communist Party is to establish and consolidate the socialist
system and uphold and develop socialism. Specific to China, socialism can only be led by the
Communist Party of China, and the cause led by the Communist Party of China can only be a
socialist cause. Upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and upholding socialism
are organically unified and mutually reinforcing. Without the leadership of the Communist Party,
the socialist cause will lose the necessary political, organizational, and ideological guarantees;
without socialism, the Communist Party will not be able to practice its original aspiration and
mission.
The intrinsic unity of the Communist Party and socialism has been repeatedly proved by the history
of socialism in the world. The success of the October Revolution in Russia marked that socialism
as an institutional form under the leadership of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party first
broke through the weak links of imperialism and changed from theory to reality. After the Second
World War, socialism expanded from one country to many countries, and the Communist Party
became the ruling party of these countries, writing a glorious chapter in the history of human
civilization. In the eighties and nineties of the 20th century, Eastern Europe underwent drastic
changes, the Soviet Union collapsed, the Communist Party lost power, and the socialist system was
subverted in these countries.

In sharp contrast, in the course of reform and opening up, China has always adhered to and
strengthened the party's leadership and always held high the great banner of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, so that scientific socialism has radiated strong vitality in China. Practice shows that
the stronger and more effective the leadership of the Communist Party is, the more steadily the
socialist cause will advance in the correct direction; the more prosperous the socialist cause is, the
more indestructible the leadership of the Communist Party will be.
This logic of governance and history is particularly fully reflected in China. Chinese and foreign
history shows that the key to what kind of doctrine a country practices and what kind of road it takes
depends on whether this doctrine and this road can solve the historical issues facing the country;
whether this doctrine or this road is good or bad depends on the historical role it plays, depends on
its actual results, and is judged by the people.
After the Opium War, the human invasion of the Western powers brought China to the brink of
extinction, and China was trapped in a dark situation of broken people, frequent wars, internal and
external troubles, and Chinese the people fell into the deep suffering of the people. In order to save
the country from peril and realize national rejuvenation, countless people with lofty ideals have
designed various political propositions, attracted many "isms", established various political parties,
and put forward various national salvation plans, but none of them can fundamentally solve China's
problems. The Taiping Rebellion failed; the peasant class was not the representative of the advanced
productive forces, could not put forward a system and program that represented the requirements
for the development of the advanced productive forces, and the old-style peasant revolution could
not defeat the feudal dynasty; the foreign affairs movement failed, the self-help movement of the
feudal clique could not resist the Western powers, and the establishment of "foreign affairs" could
not revive China; the reform of the law failed, the bourgeois reformists could not defeat the feudal
diehards, and the restoration and reform of the law could not save China; the Xinhai Revolution
overthrew the rule of the Qing dynasty. After the Xinhai Revolution, the Chinese ruling clique tried
the presidential system and parliamentary system, but they did not work, and finally fell under the
KMT-Party dictatorship, and the national rejuvenation still did not know where the road was.
History calls for truly qualified mission bearers. In the repeated comparisons of history, in the
repeated weighing of various propositions and roads, in the repeated contests of various political
forces, in the fierce struggle of the Chinese people against feudal rule and foreign aggression, and
in the process of combining Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese workers' movement, the Chinese
people finally chose the Communist Party of China and, under the leadership of the Party, finally
chose socialism.

From the Chinese Communists with Comrade Mao Zedong as the main representative exploring the
socialist road and laying the institutional foundation for socialism, to the Chinese Communists with
Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the main representative successfully opening up the road of socialism
with Chinese characteristics, to the Chinese Communists with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the main
representative successfully pushing socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century, to
the Chinese Communists mainly represented by Hu Jintao successfully adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics at a new historical starting point, the road of socialism with
Chinese characteristics has become more and more extensive under the leadership of the Communist
Party of China.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has united and led the whole party and the people of all ethnic
groups throughout the country to comprehensively examine the new international and domestic
situations, and by summarizing practice and looking forward to the future, has profoundly answered
the major topic of the times of "what kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics to adhere to and
develop in the new era, how to adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics", and
founded Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, promoting
the Party and the country's cause to achieve historic achievements. Historic changes have taken
place, and socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era.
It is precisely by relying on the relay struggle of generations of Chinese Communists that China has
made great strides along the socialist road to catch up with the times, and the Chinese nation has
ushered in a great leap from standing up, getting rich to becoming strong, and ushered in an
unprecedented bright prospect of great rejuvenation. In this way, the leadership of the Communist
Party of China is closely related to the creation, development and improvement of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and the leadership of the Communist Party of China determines the fate and
future of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
2. The greatest advantage of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics
is the leadership of the Party
The system manages the fundamentals, the overall situation, and the long term. The socialist system
with Chinese characteristics is a scientific system formed by the party and the people in long-term
practice and exploration, and it is the fundamental, basic and important systems that play the role of
"four beams and eight pillars.‚Äù This set of institutional systems includes the party's leadership
system, the people's mastery system, the socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics,
the socialist administrative system and government governance system with Chinese characteristics,
the basic socialist economic system, the system for prospering and developing advanced socialist
culture, the people's livelihood security system that coordinates urban and rural areas, the social
governance system of joint construction, co-governance and sharing, the ecological civilization
system, the party's absolute leadership system over the people's army, the "one country, two systems"
system, the independent foreign policy of peace, Party and state supervision system.

This system is suitable for China's national conditions, conforms to the trend of the times, has unique
advantages, and has played an irreplaceable and important role in the practice of governing the
country and achieved remarkable results. The dominant position in this system is the party's
leadership system. The party's leadership is the greatest advantage of the socialist system with
Chinese characteristics, and the party's leadership system is the fundamental leadership system of
our country, which determines the characteristics and advantages of other systems.
First, the Party's leadership ensures that the people enjoy broader and more fulfilling rights and
freedoms, and is conducive to mobilizing the people's enthusiasm and creativity to participate in
national construction and governance. The fundamental purpose of the Communist Party of China
is to serve the people wholeheartedly. The Party leads the people to establish a socialist democratic
political system with Chinese characteristics and develop socialist democracy, which is to embody
the people's will, protect the people's rights and interests, stimulate the people's creative vitality, use
the system to ensure that the people are masters of the country, and realize the organic unity of the
party's leadership, the people's mastery of the country and the rule of law. Among them, the party's
leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the people to be masters of the country and to govern
the country according to law, the people's mastery of the country is the essential feature of socialist
democratic politics, and governing the country according to law is the basic way for the party to
lead the people to govern the country, and the three are unified in the great practice of socialist
democratic politics. Since the reform and opening up, the leadership system of the party and the
state has become increasingly perfect, the comprehensive rule of law has been advanced, the
socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics has become increasingly perfect, the institutional
guarantee and legal guarantee for the people being masters of the country have become more
powerful, the cause of human rights has developed in an all-round way, the patriotic united front has
been further consolidated, the content of the people's enjoyment and exercise of democratic rights
in accordance with the law has become richer, the channels more convenient and the forms more
diverse, and the Chinese people have shown unprecedented enthusiasm, initiative and creativity.
Practice has proved that socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics is the most extensive,
authentic and effective democracy, and it is an institutional arrangement in which the people are
masters of their own affairs.
Second, the party's leadership has ensured the effective regulation of major political and economic
relations, which is conducive to maintaining a stable and united political situation. Comrade Deng
Xiaoping once pointed out: "In a big country like China, it is impossible to conceive of unifying the
thinking and strength of hundreds of millions of people to build socialism without a party composed
of party members with a high degree of consciousness, discipline and self-sacrifice that can truly
represent and unite the masses of the people, and without such a unified leadership of the party."

It will only fall apart and achieve nothing. "1 Since the reform and opening up, despite all kinds of
challenges, risks, resistances and contradictions, China's overall social stability and political
situation of stability and unity have always been maintained, and the most important reason behind
this is that the party's leadership has ensured the effective regulation of major relations in all aspects.
For example, in the relationship between political parties, adhering to the system of multi-party
cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China not
only ensures extensive political participation, fully reflects social conditions and public opinion, and
the interests of all strata, but also ensures the unity and harmony of political life and the effective
convergence of forces of all aspects, and avoids the drawbacks of party rivalry under the multi-party
system in the West. For example, in the relationship between the legislative, executive, and judicial
departments, the party insists on controlling the overall situation and coordinating all parties,
avoiding the situation of fighting and working separately. For example, in terms of different
ownership relations, the establishment of a basic economic system with public ownership as the
main body and the common development of various ownership economies, the unswerving
consolidation and development of the public ownership economy, and the unswerving
encouragement, support and guidance of the development of the non-public economy, which not
only conforms to the basic national conditions of the initial stage of socialism, but also reflects the
development direction of steadily realizing common prosperity. For example, in the relationship
between the government, the market and society, we insist on giving play to the decisive role of the
market in the allocation of resources, give better play to the role of the government, attach
importance to the role of social organizations, and effectively ensure social vitality and order. All
these have fundamentally safeguarded the political situation of national stability and unity, social
harmony and stability, and the people living and working in peace and contentment.
Third, the party's leadership ensures the overall planning and coordination of forces in all quarters,
which is conducive to concentrating forces to do major things. China is a big country, and the
Communist Party of China is a big party. To build and develop socialism in a large country with a
large population, a weak foundation, and an underdeveloped level of productive forces, a big party
must mobilize the enthusiasm of the whole party and the people of all nationalities throughout the
country, pool its limited resources and forces, concentrate its forces on doing major things, and
concentrate its forces on solving the most direct and realistic interests of the masses of the people.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "Compared with capitalism, the superiority of socialism lies
in its ability to play chess in the whole country, concentrate forces, and ensure key points."2 Comrade
Xi Jinping pointed out: "Our biggest advantage is that our socialist system can concentrate on doing
great things.

This is an important weapon for us to achieve our career.‚Äù1 Practice has shown that important fields,
key industries, and major projects related to the national economy and people's livelihood are
difficult to achieve by relying only on the strength of a certain region or department, and must be
promoted by the strength of the whole country. It is precisely because we have given full play to the
institutional advantages of concentrating forces to do great things that we have completed the "two
bombs and one satellite" project, which can be called a historical monument, and successively
completed the Three Gorges Project, high-speed railways throughout the country, world-class
projects that have attracted worldwide attention, such as the West-to-East Gas Transmission Project,
the West-to-East Power Transmission, the South-to-North Water Diversion Project, and the Cross-
Sea Bridge; completed high-tech projects such as the "Shenzhou", "Tiangong", "Tianhe", "Jiaolong",
quantum communications, and large aircraft. Major natural disasters or major diseases such as major
earthquakes, and major livelihood projects such as aid to Tibet, aid to Xinjiang, and targeted poverty
alleviation have been effectively implemented. It is precisely because of the institutional advantages
of concentrating on major things that we have effectively realized unified leadership, unified
command and unified action for the prevention and control of the new crown pneumonia epidemic,
formed a strategic pattern of comprehensive mobilization, comprehensive deployment, and
comprehensive strengthening of epidemic prevention and control, initially curbed the spread of the
epidemic in more than a month, controlled the daily new cases in the local area within single digits
in about two months, and achieved the Wuhan defense battle in about three months. The decisive
results of the Hubei defense war, the national epidemic prevention and control battle has achieved
major strategic results. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The strength of everyone is limited, but
as long as we are united in one heart and one mind, there will be no difficulties that cannot be
overcome."2 In a few decades, we have completed the process of industrialization that developed
countries have gone through for hundreds of years. In the hands of Chinese people, the impossible
becomes possible. This vividly reflects the extraordinary role and great significance of the party's
leadership, which is the essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Fourth, the party's leadership ensures the stability and continuity of the country's major policies and
policies, which is conducive to safeguarding the fundamental and long-term interests of the country.
Doing a good job of current affairs in a down-to-earth manner and strategically planning for long-
term development is the consistent leadership method of the Communist Party of China and an
important experience of the party in ruling and rejuvenating the country. This is conducive to
maintaining the stability and sustainability of the country's major policies, combining current
interests with long-term interests, and aligning partial interests with overall interests.

The reason why the road of rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has been moving fast and steadily,
and the reason why the cause of reform and opening up has achieved great success, is inseparable
from the work of the Chinese Communists from generation to generation and drawing a blueprint
to the end. Focusing on the realization of socialist modernization, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward
the "two-step" strategic consideration in 1963; at the beginning of reform and opening up, Comrade
Deng Xiaoping put forward the "three-step" strategic concept; in 1997, Comrade Jiang Zemin put
forward the new "three-step" strategic goal at the 15th CPC National Congress and put forward the
"two centenary goals" for the first time; and in 2007, Comrade Hu Jintao further perfected the "two
centenary goals" at the 17th CPC National Congress In 2017, Comrade Xi Jinping proposed at the
19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China to realize the Chinese dream of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in "two steps" after building a moderately prosperous society in
an all-round way. These major strategies are all top-level designs and practical arrangements
focusing on the long-term development of the country, reflecting the ruling character of the
Communist Party of China that is both in the same vein and advancing with the times.
Although some ruling parties in Western countries also try to plan for the long-term development of
the country, they are bound by the dilemma of interest games and the rotation of political parties,
and long-term reforms often become difficult. Political parties fight, focusing only on short-term
interests and ignoring long-term interests, focusing only on term goals and ignoring strategic goals,
which is the norm in Western multi-party politics. Political parties and politicians compete to curry
favor with voters for the sake of votes, and the ballot becomes the baton of the party. Comrade Deng
Xiaoping once pointed out sharply: "The United States has blown its system so well, but it was a
statement when the president campaigned, a statement just after taking office, a statement in the
midterm elections, and another statement when the next general election was approaching." The
United States also says that our policy is unstable, and that our policy is much more stable than that
of the United States. "1
Fifth, the Party's leadership ensures the concrete implementation of the principle of fairness and
justice, which is conducive to achieving common prosperity for all the people. Realizing social
fairness and justice and achieving common prosperity for all the people are the most fundamental
values of the Communist Party of China and the goal of the Chinese Communists. The most
fundamental thing for the Party to lead the people to socialize in China is to liberate and develop the
productive forces, eliminate exploitation, eliminate polarization, and ultimately achieve common
prosperity. The reason why China has been able to do this is because it has established a basic
economic system with public ownership as the main body and the common development of various
ownership economies, the state-owned economy firmly controls the country's economic lifeline, and
the material and economic forces that dominate society are always in the hands of the broad masses
of the people.

Today, China's basic national conditions that are still in the primary stage of socialism and will
remain for a long time have not changed, China's international status as the world's largest
developing country has not changed, and the problems of the gap between the rich and the poor and
the problems of fairness and justice facing our country are all in the process of being resolved. We
must not only give play to the decisive role of the market, but also avoid the negative impact of the
market; we must not only make various factors of production, including capital, active, but also
avoid the capriciousness of capital logic. Only by adhering to and strengthening the party's overall
leadership and adhering to the party's basic economic system in the initial stage of socialism can we
ensure that the development of the socialist market economy always advances in the right direction
and makes the fruits of development more and more equitable to benefit all the people.
In short, the party's leadership, as the greatest advantage of the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics, has been fully reflected in China's practice and widely recognized by more and more
foreign people of insight. Of course, any system must be continuously improved and developed in
practice, and the embodiment of any system's advantages will be a historical process. Under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the advancement of the cause of the Party and the
country, the socialist system with Chinese characteristics will certainly be more systematic,
scientific and standardized, and effective in operation, and the systems in all aspects will be more
mature and more formalized, and the greatest advantages of the leadership of the Communist Party
of China will be brought into full play.
3. the party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for the prosperity of the
cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics
The party's leadership is the fundamental and lifeline of the party and the country, and the interests
and happiness of the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country. Since the beginning of
reform and opening up, the Communist Party of China has persisted in strengthening and improving
the party's leadership, actively coped with various risks and tests faced by the party under the
conditions of long-term ruling and reform and opening up, continued to promote the new great
project of party building, maintained the party's advanced nature and purity, and maintained the
flesh-and-blood ties between the party and the masses. Practice has proved that the Communist Party
of China has undergone a long period of revolutionary forging and firmly walked in the forefront of
the times, always being the backbone of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation, and always the
leading core of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
For some time now, there has been a serious erroneous tendency inside and outside the party to
downplay or even negate the party's leadership.

Some people are secretive and vague about upholding the party's leadership, a major issue of
principle, and some people downplay or even openly deny the party's leadership, and so on. Since
the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has taken a clear
stand on upholding and strengthening the party's leadership, expounded a series of major issues with
direction and principle, effectively clarified ambiguous understanding, and declared a firm position
and high confidence in the party's leadership. Over the past few years, no matter what field and
aspect of work the Party Central Committee has promoted, it has always started by strengthening
the Party's leadership and eventually settled on strengthening Party building. Through unremitting
efforts, the weakening of the Party's leadership has been fundamentally reversed, the Party's
institutional mechanism for leadership over all work has been continuously improved, the Party's
political leadership, ideological leadership, mass organization and social appeal have been
continuously enhanced, and the political and organizational guarantees for the cause of socialism
with Chinese characteristics have become more powerful.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, and the Chinese nation has ushered
in a bright prospect of great rejuvenation, but it still faces risks and challenges on the way forward.
From an international point of view, the contest between the two roads and systems of socialism and
capitalism has never stopped, and hostile forces regard the development and growth of socialist
China as a challenge to the capitalist road, system and values, constantly change tactics and methods
to Westernize and divide China, strengthen political misdirection, strategic containment and value
containment against China, and the struggle between infiltration and anti-infiltration in the political
and ideological fields is complex and sharp, and there is no room for slackening in safeguarding
national political and cultural security. From a domestic point of view, with the comprehensive
construction of a moderately prosperous society entering the decisive stage of the people, the reform
entering the period of tackling tough problems and deep-water areas, various contradictions, risks
and challenges have become more severe, and the task of maintaining reform, development and
stability has become more arduous. Only by adhering to and strengthening the party's leadership
and giving play to the party's core role in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all parties
can we effectively prevent and resolve various risks and tests on the way forward and ensure the
stable and long-term development of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Section 2: The Party is the supreme political leading force
An important content of Xi Jinping's Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New
Era is to clearly state that the Communist Party of China is the supreme political leading force.
Comrade Mao Zedong once clearly pointed out: "In the seven aspects of industry, agriculture,
commerce, study, soldiers, government, and the party, the party leads everything."

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
The Party should lead industry, agriculture, commerce, culture and education, the army and the
government. "1 In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, Comrade Xi Jinping further
pointed out: "In today's China, there is no greater political force than the Communist Party of China
or any other force. In the study of the party, the government, the military, and the people, in the east,
west, south, north, and middle, the party is the leader of everything and the highest political leading
force. "2 The national governance system is a complex system of many subsystems, the core of
which is the Chinese Communist Party. The major political thesis that the Communist Party of China
is the supreme political leading force has directly and thoroughly revealed the status and role of the
Communist Party of China in the country's political life.
The Party is the supreme political leading force, which is determined by the nature of our country
and the state system of government, established by the national constitution, tested by the great
practice of China's revolution, construction and reform, and has undoubted historical rationality,
practical rationality and value rationality. The party is the highest political leading force, which is
mainly reflected in leading the political direction, ruling the political system, deciding major issues,
and leading social governance.
1. the Party is the leader of the political direction
The direction determines the path, and the road determines the destiny. Lenin pointed out: "Politics
is to participate in the affairs of the state, to set the direction of the state, to determine the form, tasks
and content of state activities.‚Äù3 The political direction pointed out by the Communist Party of China
to the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country is socialism, and the
ultimate goal pointed out is to realize communism. During the revolutionary war years, the Party
went through hardships and dangers, overcame one difficulty after another, corrected one deviation
after another, led the people to overthrow the "three mountains," won the great victory of the new
democratic revolution, and established New China.
After the founding of New China, the CPC, as the ruling party, inevitably had ties with various
democratic parties and political organizations. In all these connections, the Communist Party of
China "is the force of leadership", "the Party relies on politics to lead", and the Party always holds
the steering wheel.

In 1954, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed at the First National People's Congress that the core force
leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. In March 1957, he once again pointed out that
"China's reform and construction depend on our leadership."1 On May 25 of the same year, when
receiving delegates to the Third National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League,
he emphasized even more clearly: "The Communist Party of China is the core of leadership of the
entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the socialist cause cannot triumph.‚Äù 2 During the
exploration of the road of socialist construction, although the Party experienced setbacks of all kinds,
including the twists and turns and mistakes of the "Cultural Revolution", it always maintained the
spirit of self-revolution, persisted in self-correcting mistakes and deviations, firmly grasped the
direction of socialist progress, and finally established the correct political, ideological and
organizational lines, and successfully created socialism with Chinese characteristics.
In China, a large country with a history of more than 5,000 years of civilization and a population of
1.4 billion, there is no textbook that is regarded as the golden rule, and there is no teacher who can
command the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China firmly grasps the direction of progress
of socialism with Chinese characteristics, neither follows the old road of closure and rigidity, nor
does it take the evil road of changing the banner, fully mobilizes the enthusiasm of all parties under
the background of market economy and globalization, unites forces of all aspects, and gathers into
a majestic force to promote the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has held high the great banner of socialism with Chinese
characteristics and set the steering wheel of reform and opening up in the new era. This direction is
the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, not any other path. Today, reform and opening
up enter a new era, "what to change and how to change must be based on whether it meets the overall
goal of improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promoting
the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. "3 Make sure not to
make subversive mistakes in the political direction.

2. the Party is the leader of the political system
The national political system is a large system, which consists of the fundamental political system,
the basic political system and the specific institutional mechanisms of all aspects of national
governance, covering state organs, political party organizations and various political subjects. In
this large system, the Chinese Communist Party is in a dominant position.
The Communist Party of China is the ruling party, and the Party leads state and social affairs through
the system of people's congresses. The Party leads, supports and guarantees that the people are
masters of their own country, mobilizes and organizes the masses of the people to manage state and
social affairs and economic and cultural undertakings in accordance with the law. The Party leads
the people in formulating the Constitution and laws, and the Party itself operates within the scope
of the Constitution and laws. The Party's leading role in the system of people's congresses is good
at transforming the Party's propositions into the will of the State through legal procedures, at making
candidates recommended by the Party become leading personnel of organs of state power through
legal procedures, at implementing the Party's leadership over the state and society through organs
of state power, at using the principle of democratic centralism to safeguard the authority of the Party
and the State, safeguarding the unity of the whole Party and the whole country, and supporting and
ensuring that organs of state power carry out their work proactively, independently responsible, and
in a coordinated manner in accordance with the Constitution and laws.
The Communist Party of China is the core force leading China's various undertakings, and the
national governance system must adhere to the leadership of the party. Since the beginning of reform
and opening up, no matter how the party has adjusted the relationship between the party and the
government, one thing remains unchanged, that is, upholding the party's leadership has always been
the fundamental prerequisite for handling the relationship between the party and the government.
Compared with many large countries in the world, China's national governance system is unique.
Most of the world's countries with more than 100 million people are federal, and China's 1.4 billion
people, unitary production is the organizing principle of state power, and it is very successful, and
the secret is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. In contemporary China, the Communist
Party of China has inherited the idea of "one game of chess" national governance formed by Chinese
society for a long time, coordinated, comprehensive, and represented the interests of all parties,
sought the "greatest common divisor" of all interests, and coordinated all forces to advance in the
same direction, and the party's leadership has become the core component of the national governance
system.
"As a basic political system in our country, the system of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation under the leadership of the CPC is a great political creation of the CPC, China, various
democratic parties, and personages without party affiliation, and is a new-type political party system
that grows out of Chinese soil." "

"It is not only in line with the reality of contemporary China, but also in line with the excellent
traditional culture advocated by the Chinese nation, such as serving the common good, being
inclusive, and seeking common ground while reserving differences, and is a major contribution to
human political civilization."1 This political system is different from the multi-party system or two-
party system of many capitalist countries, nor the one-party system of some countries, but is an
original system rooted in China and has distinct Chinese characteristics. This characteristic is first
embodied in the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Party leadership is the conscious
choice of all democratic parties and is also the basic prerequisite of China's political party system.
The relationship between the CPC and other democratic parties is the leadership of the CPC, multi-
party cooperation, and the ruling power of the CPC and multi-party participation in politics. The
democratic parties are not opposition parties and opposition parties, but friendly parties and
participating parties that cooperate closely with the CPC. Adhering to the leadership of the
Communist Party of China is not to stop democracy, but to form a broader and more effective
democracy. The CPC and the democratic parties have conducted democratic consultations, made
concerted efforts on major national issues, and concentrated their efforts on major affairs.
3. The Party is the decider of major decisions
As the highest political leading force, it is very important for the Communist Party of China to make
decisions on major issues of the Party and the country. Without decision-making power, the so-
called leadership is an empty phrase. Along the way, the Communist Party of China has continuously
moved from victory to victory, and every step is inseparable from scientific and effective decision-
making, careful planning and effective implementation. Being good at grasping problems, thinking
of methods, and making decisions is a concentrated embodiment of the party's leadership level and
ruling ability.
The Chinese Communist Party uses scientific and democratic methods to make decisions. Formulate
lines, principles, policies, and make major policy decisions and arrangements, extensively solicit
the opinions and suggestions of the broad masses of the people, democratic parties and personages
without party affiliation, party-member cadres, experts, and scholars, and finally transform the
party's propositions into the will of the state through scientific demonstration and democratic
centralization. In decision-making,

The party has always adhered to the people-centered value concept and political stance, grasped the
most direct and practical interests of the masses, and formulated effective policies and measures.
The party formulates policies, adheres to the attitude of seeking truth from facts, scientifically
carries out investigation and research, persists in coming from the masses to the masses, and
analyzes specific problems in detail, so that policy decisions, programs and measures conform to
the spirit of the central authorities and local realities, meet the needs of the people and are feasible.
The Communist Party of China not only makes scientific decisions, but also pays attention to the
implementation of decisions. The Communist Party of China is a big party, China is a big country,
and to govern a big country, a big party first needs an authoritative party central committee that can
observe problems from the perspective of the overall situation and be able to make decisions "with
one hammer and the final word"; moreover, once the party Central Committee makes policy
decisions and arrangements, all party departments must resolutely implement them; the party
organizations of the people's congresses, governments, CPPCC, supervision commissions, courts,
and procuratorates must resolutely implement them; and party organizations such as public
institutions and people's organizations must also resolutely implement them.
4. the Party is the leader in social governance
Social governance is inseparable from a certain organizational form. The organizational form of the
Communist Party of China not only promotes the orderly governance of society, but also ensures
that society is full of vitality. First, the political function of the Chinese Communist Party provides
direction for social governance. The first attribute of the party is the political attribute, and the first
function is the political function. Political functions are embodied in political stance, political
direction, political road and other aspects, and the political function of the party can provide
direction, standards and values for social governance, and enhance the cohesion and sense of
direction of social governance. Second, the Communist Party of China promotes the effective
operation of society with the service function of the party. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once pointed
out: "What is leadership? Leadership is serving the people.‚Äù 1 Adhering to the mass line is the
fundamental method by which the Party leads the masses of the people. By serving the masses of
the people, solving the problems of their interests, the Party promotes the effective operation of
society. Finally, the Communist Party of China ensures harmonious and orderly social governance
with a strong organizational system. The party adheres to the principle that "where there are masses,
there is party organization, and where there are party members, there is party work", and vigorously
promotes the coverage of party organizations and party work. Over the past 40 years of reform and
opening up, China has been one of the countries with the most profound social transformation in the
world, facing domestic and foreign contradictions and risks rarely seen in the world

However, Chinese society has always maintained overall stability, which is inseparable from the
strong organizational ability and excellent governance ability of the Communist Party of China.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has closely focused on the social governance theme of co-
construction, co-governance and sharing, continuously improved the social governance system and
mechanism, established a social governance system under the leadership of the Party committee,
the responsibility of the government, social coordination, public participation, and the guarantee of
the rule of law, and continuously improved the socialization, rule of law, intelligence and
professionalism of social governance. For example, strengthen the construction of mechanisms for
preventing and resolving social contradictions, correctly handle contradictions among the people;
comprehensively improve the level and coverage of public services, continuously meet the people's
growing needs for a better life, and let the people have more sense of happiness, attainment, and
security; strengthen the construction of community governance systems, promote the focus of social
governance to shift down to the grassroots level, give play to the role of social organizations, and
realize benign interaction between government governance and social regulation and residents'
autonomy. In the practice of party leadership in social governance, leading grassroots social
governance with party building has become the consensus of Chinese society and a successful
experience of Chinese social governance.
Section 3: Resolutely achieve "two maintenances"
To uphold and strengthen the party's overall leadership and give full play to the role of the highest
political leadership force of the Communist Party of China, the most fundamental thing is to
resolutely safeguard the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Party Central
Committee and the core position of the whole party, and the most important thing is to resolutely
safeguard the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee.
Achieving the "two safeguards" is a major issue of principle that has a bearing on the future and
destiny of the party and the country, the primary task of the party's political construction, and the
fundamental political discipline and political rules that the whole party must abide by.
1. safeguarding the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Party Central
Committee and the core of the whole Party is where the fundamental interests of the
Party and the country lie
The Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee clarified the core position of General
Secretary Xi Jinping of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party. This is the
inevitable result of the party's adherence to the principle of democratic centralism and the solemn
choice of the whole party and the people of the whole country.

As the core of the Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party, General Secretary Xi
Jinping was formed in the practice of the new great struggle, reflects the common aspirations of the
whole Party, the whole army and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, is where
the fundamental interests of the Party and the country lie, is the fundamental guarantee for upholding
and strengthening the Party's leadership, and is an urgent need to carry out the great struggle with
many new historical characteristics and to uphold and develop the great cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
The historical mission of the proletarian party objectively requires a strong core of leadership. Marx
once vividly compared that "a single violinist conducts himself, and an orchestra needs an orchestra
director."1 Engels also used the example of sea navigation to illustrate the extreme importance of
the core of authority: "At a critical moment, whether everyone's life can be saved depends on
whether all people can immediately and absolutely obey the will of a person."2 Lenin also pointed
out: "It is a long-term and difficult task to bring up a group of experienced and extremely prestigious
party leaders. But without this, the dictatorship of the proletariat and the 'unity of will' of the
proletariat can only be empty words. "3 Comrade Mao Zedong stressed: "It is necessary to establish
a core of leadership and oppose 'one country, three publics.'"4 Comrade Deng Xiaoping had a deep
understanding and thorough explanation of the core issue of leadership, pointing out: "The key to
the China issue lies in the fact that the Communist Party must have a good Politburo, especially a
good Politburo Standing Committee. As long as there are no problems in this link, China will be as
stable as Mount Tai. "If it stays like this for fifty, sixty years, socialist China will be invincible."5
The historical experience of socialism in the world shows that in order for a Marxist political party
to safeguard the unity of the Party and effectively carry out struggle, it must form a strong core of
leadership and a strong leading collective at the level of the Party Central Committee. The historical
experience of the Communist Party of China shows that there must be a strong central leading
collective formed in practice, and there must be a strong leadership core in this leading collective.
Otherwise, the party's cause will not be able to advance from victory to victory.
Comrade Xi Jinping possesses the extraordinary political wisdom, superb leadership ability and
strong personality charm of a Marxist politician, and as the core of the Party Central Committee and
the core of the whole Party, he was formed in the long-term revolutionary practice, in the new great
struggle, in the close contact with the people and in the common struggle.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping, with a
strong sense of responsibility, has led the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout
the country to solve many difficult problems that have been wanted to be solved for a long time but
have not been solved, accomplished many major things that were wanted to be done in the past but
have not been accomplished, promoted historic changes in the cause of the party and the country,
promoted historic changes in the management of the party and the party, and promoted socialism
with Chinese characteristics into a new era. The fundamental reason why the cause of the Party and
the country can create a new situation in an all-round way lies in the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in raising the banner and strategizing, and in the scientific guidance
of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The Sixth Plenary
Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee made it clear that Comrade Xi Jinping is the core of the
Party Central Committee and the core of the whole Party, and the 19th CPC National Congress will
firmly safeguard the authority of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
and the centralized and unified leadership to write the Party Constitution, which is the choice of
practice, history, the choice of the whole Party and the choice of the people.
Safeguarding General Secretary Xi Jinping's position as the core of the Party Central Committee
and the core of the whole Party is an urgent need for the development of the cause of the Party and
the country. The Communist Party of China has more than 90 million members and more than 4.6
million grassroots party organizations, and the party unites and leads the people to carry out socialist
modernization. Having a leader recognized by the whole party and loved by the people is an
important sign of the maturity of the party. The ship weighs a thousand pounds and has one person
at the helm. To govern a large country with a population of 1.4 billion, to carry out great struggles
with many new historical characteristics, to cope with major changes unprecedented in a century, to
resist major risks and challenges, and to overcome major contradictions and resistances, it must have
a strong core of leadership. Without Comrade Xi Jinping, the core of the Party Central Committee
and the core of the whole Party, there would be no authority and centralized leadership of the Party
Central Committee, there would be no unified thinking and unified action, and there would be no
separate battles and separate administrations, and nothing would be accomplished.
2. Safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership is the highest principle of Party leadership
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The history of the Party and the history of the development of
New China tell us that in order to govern our big party and our big country well, it is very important
to ensure the unity and centralization of the party, and it is of great importance to maintain the
authority of the party Central Committee."

Resolutely safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership is a major founding principle of the Marxist ruling party, the primary political rule of the
Party, and a magic weapon to ensure that the whole Party is in lockstep.
1
First, safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership are the major founding principles of the Marxist ruling party. A Marxist political party is
not a free and loose club, but a new type of political party shouldering a major historical mission, a
fighting force with strict organization and strict discipline. Marx and Engels once severely criticized
Bakunin's views of "branch autonomy, free association of autonomous groups, anti-authoritarianism,
and anarchy", believing that these slogans were nothing more than an attempt to cover up the
extreme poverty of thought and the fundamental ignorance of the conditions of daily life in society.
When summing up the lessons of the failure of the Paris Commune, Engels clearly pointed out: "The
Paris Commune was destroyed because of the lack of centralization and authority. "2 Engels also
pointed out that authority is needed not only in the period of proletarian revolution, but also in the
period of peacebuilding. Whether it is factory production, railway management, ship navigation, or
even daily travel, it is necessary to obey the authority of rules and regulations. Without serious
authority and strict discipline, such a party can only be a loose club or social organization, and such
a party cannot unite its will and achieve political goals. The Communist Party of China is a Marxist
political party organized by revolutionary ideals and iron discipline, and safeguarding the authority
of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership is the fundamental experience
of China's revolution, construction and reform.
Second, safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership is the primary political rule of the Party. To uphold the party's leadership, we must first
uphold the centralized and unified leadership of the party Central Committee. The right to decide
on the major policies and policies of the party and the state rests with the party Central Committee,
and it is necessary to safeguard the authority of the party Central Committee with practical actions.
Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "The party is the core of our leadership in all undertakings, as the
ancients said; six contract winds, Kyushu cooperates', in contemporary China, without the
leadership of the party, this cannot be done." 3 Safeguarding the authority of the Party Central
Committee is a matter of direction and principle, and has a bearing on the future and destiny of the
Party, the nation, and the country.

Any organization and member of the Party, no matter what field, level or unit he or she works in,
must obey the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee and safeguard the
authority of the Party Central Committee.
Third, safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified
leadership is the magic weapon to ensure that the whole Party is in lockstep. The theories, lines,
principles, and policies formulated by the Party Central Committee are the basis and basis for the
whole Party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to unify their thinking, will,
and actions. Only when the Party Central Committee has authority can the whole Party be firmly
united, and then the people of all ethnic groups in the country can be closely united, forming a
majestic force that is united and invincible. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We are such a big
party and such a big country, if there is no authority of the Party Central Committee to set a statue,
and the Party Central Committee does not do what it decides, or if each says its own thing and does
its own thing, then nothing can be done." 1 In our party, we must never allow ourselves to act
independently and go our own way, we must not allow orders not to be carried out or prohibitions
to continue, and we will never allow policies at the top and countermeasures at the bottom. The
more complicated the situation facing the Party and the more arduous the tasks it shoulders, the
more it is necessary to safeguard the centralization and unity of the Party.
3. the practical requirements of "two maintenance"
Safeguarding the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping of the Party Central Committee and
the core of the whole Party, safeguarding the authority and centralized and unified leadership of the
Party Central Committee, is not abstract but concrete, and must be implemented in reality and seen
in action.
To achieve the "two safeguards," we must persist in being loyal to the party. This is the basic
requirement of the Party Constitution for Party members. Loyalty to the party must be pure, and one
must not be "two-faced" or engage in "pseudo-loyalty"; it must be embodied in loyalty to the party's
beliefs, loyalty to the party organization, and loyalty to the party's theory, line, principles, and
policies. If "loyalty" doesn't pass, nothing else.
To achieve the "two safeguards," we must strictly abide by political discipline and political rules.
Political discipline is the most important discipline of the Party, political discipline is the most
fundamental rule of the Party, and abiding by political discipline and political rules is the basis for
observing all discipline of the Party. First, we must safeguard the authority of the Party Central
Committee, never allow deviations from the Party Central Committee's requirements to set up
another set of things, maintain a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee ideologically,
politically, and in action, and obey the command of the Party Central Committee.

Second, it is necessary to safeguard the unity of the party, persist in all parts of the world, unite all
comrades loyal to the party, unite the majority, draw lines with others, engage in any form of
factional activities, and still less allow the cultivation of private forces within the party; third, it is
necessary to follow organizational procedures, and it is absolutely not allowed to make unauthorized
claims and opinions on major issues and reports. Fourth, we must obey the organization's decisions,
never allow non-organizational activities, bargain with the organization, go against the
organization's decision, seek and rely on the organization when encountering problems, and must
not deceive the organization or confront the organization.
To achieve the "two safeguards," we must firmly establish a political awareness, an awareness of
the overall situation, a core awareness, and a sense of alignment. The most important thing is to
highly identify ideologically, resolutely safeguard politically, fully trust organizationally, and
closely follow the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core in action. We must
achieve "two safeguards" and enhance the "four consciousnesses," and we must not shout empty
slogans, engage in formalism, and turn serious political discipline into "low-level red" and "high-
level black." The core consciousness is called "core", that is, the core of the Party Central Committee
and the whole party, and cannot be said to be "core" layer by layer; the "alignment" of aligning
consciousness means aligning with the Party Central Committee, General Secretary Xi Jinping, and
the party's basic theory, basic line, and basic strategy, and cannot shout "alignment" layer by layer.
Section 4: Establish and improve the institutional
mechanism for the party's comprehensive leadership
The party's overall leadership is concrete and must be embodied in all aspects of governing the
country and in the design, arrangement, and operation of the institutions, systems, and systems of
state power. Establishing and improving scientific and effective systems and mechanisms is the key
to implementing the party's comprehensive leadership.
1. Adhere to the Party's position as the core of leadership in controlling the overall
situation and coordinating all parties
Adhering to the party's position as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and
coordinating all parties is a prominent feature of the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics.

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that "the Party Central Committee is the brain and center, and the Party
Central Committee must have the authority to set a statue and hammer the final word."1 The Central
Committee, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the Standing Committee of the
Politburo of the CPC Central Committee are the core of the Party's leadership and decision-making;
the decisions and arrangements made by the Party Central Committee must be resolutely
implemented by the Party's discipline inspection organs and organizational, propaganda, united front,
political and legal departments, the Party organizations of the state's legislative, judicial,
administrative, and supervisory organs, and the Party organizations of enterprises, institutions, and
people's organizations. Local Party organizations must ensure that the decisions and arrangements
of the Party Central Committee are implemented as soon as orders are made and stopped when
prohibited. In the big chess game of the national governance system, the Party Central Committee
is the "handsome" who sits in the military tent in the town, and the horses and cannons each show
their strengths, and the overall situation is clearly defined, so that only in governing the country can
there be direction, rules, and strength.
Strengthen the leadership position of Party committees (Party groups) in organizations at the same
level. Straighten out the relationship between party organizations and other organizations, and better
play the role of overseeing the overall situation and coordinating all parties. Party committees
(leading Party groups) established in state organs, public institutions, mass organizations, social
organizations, enterprises and other organizations shall accept the unified leadership of the Party
committees approved for their establishment, report regularly on their work, and ensure that the
Party's principles, policies and decision-making arrangements are implemented in organizations at
the same level. Party committees at all levels should concentrate their energies on setting the
direction, grasping major matters, coming up with ideas, and managing cadres. Party committees at
all levels should give overall consideration to the overall work, plan as a whole, and form a working
mechanism for comprehensive advancement. It is necessary to rationally divide the work levels,
properly handle the relationship between key tasks, clarify which work is personally grasped by the
party committee, which is promoted by the party committee, and which is supported by the party
committee, and form a working mechanism for categorical promotion; within the party committee,
it is necessary to give play to the collective role of the leading body, and at the same time ensure
that the members of the leading body each shoulder their own responsibilities and carry out their
work in unison.

Enhance the organizational strength and leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations. Persist
in focusing on improving organizational strength, highlight political functions, and build the party's
grassroots organizations into strong fighting fortresses for publicizing the party's propositions,
implementing the party's decisions, leading grassroots governance, uniting and mobilizing the
masses, and promoting reform and development. Strengthen the building of grass-roots party
organizations in enterprises, rural areas, organs, institutions, and communities, strengthen the work
of grass-roots party building of social organizations, explore the building of grass-roots party
organizations in the fields of new business formats and the Internet, strengthen the standardization
and standardization of branches, and realize that all the party's work goes to the branches. Party
organizations in villages and communities should comprehensively lead all kinds of organizations
and all work subordinate to their own villages and communities.

Continue to promote the institutionalization of the party's comprehensive leadership and the rule of
law. Study and formulate inner-party laws and regulations on the party's leadership of important
economic and social work, and implement the party's comprehensive leadership in the entire process
and in all aspects of comprehensively governing the country according to law; implement the
provisions of the Constitution, formulate and revise relevant laws and regulations, and clearly
stipulate the legal status of work related to party leadership; enshrine the requirements for upholding
the party's comprehensive leadership in the organic laws of people's congresses, governments, courts,
and procuratorates, and enshrine the people's consultative conference, democratic parties, the
Federation of Industry and Commerce, people's organizations, state-owned enterprises, schools of
higher learning, and The charters of social organizations are to improve the Party's system for
exercising leadership over these organizations, ensuring that they are always active, independent,
responsible, and coordinated under the leadership of the Party.
2. Strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting from the Party
Central Committee
The system of requesting instructions and reporting is an important system of the Communist Party
of China, which fundamentally guarantees the authority and centralized and unified leadership of
the Party Central Committee. As early as 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong drafted the "Intra-Party
Directive on the Establishment of the Reporting System" for the Party Central Committee, and then
the Party Central Committee issued the "Supplementary Instructions on the Establishment of the
Reporting System.‚Äù This has played an important role in the political construction of the Party.
Timely reporting of major issues and important matters by party-member cadres is a political
discipline and political rule that must be observed. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "Party
organizations in all fields should be responsible to the party committee and report their work to the
party committee. Some comrades are accustomed to treating the work in charge as their own
forbidden, feeling that since they are in charge, there is no need to report, and they do not want
others to come and ask questions, and some do not even want the party committee to ask questions,
otherwise there is no separation between the party and the government. This thinking is incorrect.
"1
The Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee detailed the system of requesting
instructions and reports on major issues, stipulating that the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Supreme People's
Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, all departments of the central and state organs, all
people's organizations, and all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the
Central Government must regularly report their work to the Party Central Committee.

In February 2019, the CPC Central Committee issued the Regulations of the Communist Party of
China on Requesting Instructions and Reports on Major Matters, further improving the relevant
work system. In accordance with the Party Constitution and internal Party regulations, all members
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee report their duties in writing to the Party
Central Committee and the General Secretary every year; the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the leading party groups of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the leading party groups of the State Council,
the leading party groups of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, the leading party groups of the Supreme People's Court, and the leading party groups
of the Supreme People's Procuratorate report annually to the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau and the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee; and the party committees (leading
party groups) of all regions and departments have strengthened their reporting to the party Central
Committee. When studying major matters involving the overall situation or making major decisions,
it is necessary to promptly request instructions and report to the Party Central Committee, and
special reports should be made on the implementation of important decisions of the Party Central
Committee. In case of sudden major problems and major problems in work, it is necessary to
promptly ask for instructions and report to the Party Central Committee, and if the situation is urgent
and must be dealt with immediately, it is necessary to do a good job in their duties and report quickly.
3. Coordinate the reform of party and state institutions
The functional system of the party and state institutions is an important guarantee for the CPC's
governance of the country, and an important support for ensuring that the party always controls the
overall situation and coordinates all parties. In order to smoothly advance the cause of socialism
with Chinese characteristics in the new era, the party must give full play to the party's leadership,
which is the greatest institutional advantage, from the organizational structure, implement the party's
leadership in all fields and links of the party and state organs in comprehensively and correctly
performing their duties, and ensure the party's long-term ruling power and the country's long-term
peace and stability in terms of system.
The Third Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee focused on improving and
developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, promoting the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity, strengthening the party's long-term ruling
capacity, and promoting the comprehensive and strict management of the party, and made strategic
arrangements for deepening the reform of party and state institutions. The goal of the reform is very
clear, that is, to promote the optimization of the functions of the party and state institutions as the
focus of efforts, to form a leadership system that oversees the overall situation and coordinates all
parties, a government governance system with clear responsibilities and administration according
to law, a world-class armed forces system with Chinese characteristics, a mass work system with
extensive contacts and serving the masses, and to promote the coordinated actions of people's
congresses, governments, CPPCC, supervisory organs, judicial organs, procuratorial organs,
people's organizations, enterprises and institutions, social organizations, etc. under the unified
leadership of the party. Strengthen synergy and comprehensively improve national governance
capacity and governance level.
To deepen the reform of the Party and state institutions, the first thing is to establish and improve
the Party's leadership system and mechanism for major work, and improve the institutional
arrangements to ensure the Party's overall leadership;

Strengthen the party's centralized and unified leadership over major work involving the overall
cause of the party and the country, and enhance the party's ability and determination to set the
direction, seek the overall situation, formulate policies, and promote reform. At the central level, it
is to optimize the decision-making and deliberation coordination organs of the Party Central
Committee, and then strengthen and optimize the Party's leadership over deepening reform,
governing the country according to law, economy, agriculture and rural areas, discipline inspection
and supervision, organization, propaganda, ideology and culture, national security, political and
legal affairs, united front, ethnic and religious affairs, education, science and technology, Internet
information, diplomacy, auditing, etc. The Third Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central
Committee decided to set up the Central Committee for Comprehensive Rule of Law, the Central
Audit Commission, and the Central Leading Group for Education Work, and at the same time
renamed the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reform, the Central Leading
Group for Cybersecurity and Informatization, the Central Leading Group for Finance and
Economics, and the Central Leading Group for Foreign Affairs to the Committee, and adjusted and
optimized the leadership system of the Central Institutional Establishment Committee. These
institutions, as the decision-making and deliberation coordination bodies of the Party Central
Committee, work under the leadership of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and its
Standing Committee, and are responsible for the top-level design, overall layout, overall
coordination and overall promotion of major work in related fields, further ensuring the effective
implementation of the Party's leadership.
The functional departments of the Party are the political organs of the Party exercising political,
ideological and organizational leadership, and the executive organs that implement the decisions
and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and local Party committees at all levels,
implement the Party's leadership, strengthen Party building, and promote the Party's cause. To
coordinate the reform of party and state institutions and uphold and strengthen the party's overall
leadership, it is necessary to optimize the functional allocation of the party's organization,
propaganda, united front, political and legal affairs, party building in organs, education and training,
strengthen the coordination function, and coordinate the work of the system and its own field. At
the same time, it is also necessary to optimize the establishment of various party committee offices,
and the matters that can be undertaken by functional departments are undertaken by functional
departments; optimize and standardize the establishment of party dispatched organs, strengthen
leadership over relevant fields, industries, and system work; and set up institutions directly under
party committees at all levels in accordance with the principle of lean and efficient. The relevant
organs of the Party may be set up in an overall manner with other departments with similar functions
and close ties, and implement the merger and establishment or joint office to prevent overlapping of
institutions, functions and work, and then integrate and optimize forces and resources to bring into
play comprehensive benefits.

Top-level planning and overall design of the reform of party and state institutions is an important
embodiment of the party's leadership. Deepening the reform of party and state institutions, covering
the institutional reform of the Party Central Committee, the National People's Congress, the State
Council, the CPPCC National Committee, the administrative law enforcement system, the cross-
military reform, the mass organization reform, and the local institutional reform, is a systematic,
holistic and reconstructive major change. After the gradual advancement from the central to the local
level since the Third Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, a functional system of
party and state institutions that is compatible with upholding and strengthening the party's leadership
is taking shape.

4. Improve the specific system for strictly implementing democratic centralism
Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle and fundamental leadership
system of the Party. It regulates the relations between Party members and Party members, Party
members and organizations, subordinate organizations and higher-level organizations, and the
whole Party and the Central Committee, and standardizes the relations between Party and State
organs of power, administrative organs, supervisory organs, judicial organs and people's
organizations. Over the past some time now, quite a few problems have arisen in some party
organizations in the process of implementing democratic centralism: In some localities, "laissez-
faire democracy" has appeared, and "the number one" does not take responsibility, and the leading
body is weak and loose; in some localities, the number one leader "acts arbitrarily, inner-party
democracy is undermined, and the party's leadership has become individual leadership; in some
localities, the party-government relationship is not coordinated, and the so-called separation of the
party and the government is carried out without paying attention to preconditions, or the party
committee directly interferes in government work without any detail, resulting in tension between
the party and the government; in some places, the party and government are divided and departments
are hampered. Fights up and down, fragmentation of local governance; and so on. These problems
greatly restrict the role of the party's leadership as the core, and ultimately affect the comprehensive
economic and social development of a locality.
To uphold and strengthen the party's comprehensive leadership, it is necessary to improve and
implement various specific systems of democratic centralism and institutionalize, standardize, and
scientificize relations between the party and all quarters. In particular, it is necessary to improve the
system of the party leading organs of state power, administrative organs, supervisory organs, judicial
organs, and people's organizations, improve the work system and code of conduct of party
committees (leading party groups) at all levels; strictly implement the "Several Guidelines for Inner-
Party Political Life in the New Situation," improve the rules for deliberation and decision-making
of party committees at all levels, improve the specific system for correctly handling the working
relations between party organizations at higher and lower levels, and ensure that the whole party is
highly consistent ideologically, politically, and in action.
Safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership
are unified with promoting inner-Party democracy. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "Adhering to
the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership does not mean
that there is no need for democratic centralism, do not promote inner-party democracy, and it is
wrong to oppose the two."1 Democratic centralism organically combines the full development of
inner-party democracy with the correct practice of centralism; it can not only stimulate the creative
vitality of the whole party to the maximum, but also unify the thinking and actions of the whole
party, and effectively prevent and overcome decentralism in which deliberation is not decided and
decision is not done, and it is a scientific, rational, and efficient system.

Democratic centralism includes two aspects, democracy and centralization, which are mutually
conditional, complementary and opposite. It is necessary to organically unify democracy and
centralism, and truly turn the advantages of democratic centralism into the party's political,
organizational, systemic, and work advantages.
