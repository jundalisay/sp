Chapter II: Better Upholding and Developing Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics

Adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics is the theme of all the party's
theories and practices since the reform and opening up, and it is also the theme of Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. To realize the party's historical mission in
the new era, we must strengthen the "four self-confidences", unify the "four greatness", make overall
plans to promote the overall layout of the "five-in-one", coordinate the promotion of the "four
comprehensive" strategic layout, and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the great
practice of better adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Section 1: Adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics is the fundamental direction of
development and progress in contemporary China
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only way to develop China, stabilize China, make
China prosperous and prosperous, and also the only way to realize China's modernization. Only by
unswervingly adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics can we smoothly
advance the process of China's socialist modernization and constantly open up a new horizon for
China's development and progress.

1. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only way to realize socialist
modernization

Modernization is the product of the development of human social productive forces to a certain
stage, an important symbol of the progress of human social civilization, the embodiment of the law
of the development of human society, and a worldwide historical process.
Modernization originated in Western capitalist countries and was led by the West for a long time,
mainly due to the development of Western capitalism and the rise of the bourgeoisie, which
gradually dominated and dominated the life of the state and society. It is precisely because the
modernization process of human society first began in Western countries, so in a long historical
period, modernization through the development of capitalism has become the choice of many
countries.

The changes of times and history have made China choose a path of modernization different from
that of Western countries, that is, to achieve modernization by taking the socialist road on the basis
of the new democratic revolution. Before the Opium War, there was already a budding capitalism
within Chinese society, and the invasion of Western powers pulled China into the world capitalist
system and accelerated the growth of capitalist factors. However, the human invasion of Western
countries is to extract resources by colonizing China, not to promote China's modernization. In the
face of the country's internal and external troubles, some benevolent people who advocate following
the example of Western countries have made attempts at modernization, but they have not succeeded.
When China's social development was in a difficult situation, the victory of socialism in Russia
made the advanced elements who were struggling to find a way out for China see new hope and
gradually decided that China's way out could only be socialism. After the founding of the
Communist Party of China, it clearly put forward the idea of using socialism to save China, and
explored and opened up a revolutionary road from new democracy to socialism. After the
establishment of the socialist system, the Party finally created socialism with Chinese characteristics
after long-term exploration, making the development of socialism in China and China's
modernization a closer integration cause and integration process.
The modernization goal of China's socialist development and the socialist nature of China's
modernization have always been the political principles adhered to by the Communist Party of China.
Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out: "China's future is to engage in socialism" and "only
socialism can save China." 1 He repeatedly stressed that one of the arduous historical tasks
shouldered by the Communist Party of China is to build poor and backward China into a prosperous
and powerful modern country. "We will definitely build a socialist country with modern industry,
modern agriculture, and modern science and culture."

Later, the Communist Party of China clearly put forward the goal and strategic concept of realizing
the "four modernizations", led the people to gradually establish an independent and relatively
complete industrial system and national economic system, laid an important material and
technological foundation for promoting China's modernization, and accumulated valuable
experience in socialist construction.
1
In the process of creating socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Communist Party of China has
continuously deepened its understanding and grasp of the law of organic unity between socialist
development and modernization based on the new changes in the world and national conditions.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping stressed: "Whether or not we can realize the four modernizations
determines the fate of our country and the destiny of our nation."2 "If you do not take the socialist
road, China will have no future." 3 Only by "building our country into a modern and powerful
socialist country can we more effectively consolidate the socialist system."4 Comrade Jiang Zemin
proposed: "In the new situation, we attach greater importance to taking advantage of favorable
international conditions and persistently opening up to the outside world in order to accelerate
China's socialist modernization drive." 5 Comrade Hu Jintao stressed: "China's socialist
modernization drive is carried out on the basis of China's specific national conditions and under the
conditions of the development of the times, which requires us to profoundly understand and grasp
both the general law of modernization and the general law of socialist modernization, as well as the
special law of China's socialist modernization."6 Socialism with Chinese characteristics is not only
a new way for China to adhere to and develop socialism, but also a new way for China to realize
modernization. Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, the party's national congresses
have gradually drawn up a grand blueprint for China's realization of socialist modernization around
the theme of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Combining and unifying socialism with modernization is the great practice and great creation of the
Communist Party of China in contemporary China and the world today.

Socialism with Chinese characteristics contains the basic principles of scientific socialism, contains
the basic requirements of modernization, and embodies the particularity of China's social
development process. The reason why socialism with Chinese characteristics is groundbreaking is
that it has always deployed and promoted socialist construction in accordance with the process and
goals of China's modernization, and has always planned the consolidation and development of the
socialist system in China from the macro process of modernization.
Today's China is approaching the center of the world stage, and has grown from a participant in
economic globalization to an important force promoting the development of the world economy,
and has changed from a catcher of the trend of the times to a leader of the trend of the times.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics has profoundly influenced the world with its own
development. Seventy years ago, China was still the object of slaughter, Chinese called the "sick
man of East Asia"; 40 years ago, China had not yet got rid of poverty and the people had not yet
solved the problem of food and clothing; and now, an increasingly prosperous China is rising, and
the Chinese people are entering the world with a new image. The reason for this change boils down
to the fact that the Communist Party of China has created, adhered to and developed socialism with
Chinese characteristics. As Comrade Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out: "The direction determines
the future, and the road determines the destiny." If we want to take our destiny into our own hands,
we must have the firmness of unchanging our will and the same way. Over the past 40 years of
reform and opening up, the theme of all our party's theories and practices has been to uphold and
develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. In China, a large country with a history of more than
5,000 years of civilization and a population of more than 1.3 billion, there is no textbook that can
be regarded as the golden rule, and there is no teacher who can command the Chinese people. "The
road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a broad road for contemporary China to make great
strides to catch up with the times and lead the development of the times, and we must unswervingly
follow it."1
2. Strengthen self-confidence in the path, theory, system and culture of
socialism with Chinese characteristics
Socialism with Chinese characteristics includes four aspects: road, theory, system and culture. The
road is the way to realization, theory is the guide to action, system is the fundamental guarantee,
and culture is the spiritual force, these four aspects are unified in the great practice of socialism with
Chinese characteristics.

Confidence in the path, theory, system and culture of socialism with Chinese characteristics stems
from the great achievements made in the practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics and from
the CPC's firm belief in adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade
Xi Jinping pointed out: "In today's world, if any political party, country or nation can be confident,
then the Communist Party of China, the People's Republic of China and the Chinese nation have the
most reason to be confident."1 Adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics
requires that Communist Party members, especially leading Party cadres, must be confident in their
road, theory, system and culture.
Firm confidence in the road is because the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics has led
China to achieve world-renowned achievements and opened up broad prospects for promoting
China's development and progress. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The path of socialism with
Chinese characteristics is the only way to realize China's socialist modernization and create a better
life for the people.”2 He also particularly emphasized: "The road determines destiny, how difficult
it is to find a right path, we must unswervingly follow it."3 The historical process of contemporary
China has indisputably proved that the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics is plausible,
correct and good. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that this path is neither "traditional" nor "foreign",
nor "Westernized", but our "original.” In the new era, taking the road of socialism with Chinese
characteristics has an incomparably broad stage, an incomparably profound historical heritage, and
an incomparably strong determination to advance. We can neither follow the old road of closure and
rigidity, nor can we follow the evil road of changing the banner and changing the banner, and we
must unswervingly follow the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Strengthening theoretical self-confidence is because the theory of socialism with Chinese
characteristics is the correct theory to guide the Party and the people to continuously advance along
the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation, and it is a scientific theory that stands at the forefront of the times and advances with the
times. The theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics, composed of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, the important thinking of "three represents", the Scientific Outlook on Development and Xi
Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, has written a new chapter
in scientific socialism, condensed the wisdom and painstaking efforts of several generations of
Chinese communists in uniting and leading the people in unremitting exploration, is the theoretical
innovation achievement of the Communist Party of China in promoting the Sinicization of Marxism
since the reform and opening up, is the most valuable political and spiritual wealth of the party, and
is the common ideological basis for the people of all ethnic groups in the country to unite and
struggle.

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
This theoretical system, rooted in the great practice of reform, opening up and socialist
modernization, conforms to the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, conforms to the
development trend of today's world and contemporary China, and has a distinct scientific, people's
nature, practical and open nature. In contemporary China, adhering to Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is truly adhering to Marxism.
Strengthening institutional self-confidence is because the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics is an advanced system with distinctive Chinese characteristics, obvious institutional
advantages and strong self-improvement ability. The socialist system with Chinese characteristics
includes a series of fundamental systems, including the fundamental system of upholding the party's
centralized and unified leadership and comprehensive leadership, the fundamental system of the
people's congress system, the fundamental system of upholding the guiding position of Marxism in
the ideological field, and the fundamental system of upholding the party's absolute leadership over
the people's army; the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, the system of regional ethnic autonomy, the system of
grassroots mass autonomy, the public ownership as the mainstay, the common development of
various ownership systems, and distribution according to work as the mainstay. A variety of
distribution methods coexist, a series of basic systems such as the socialist market economic system,
and important systems such as legal rule of law, administrative management, cultural construction,
people's livelihood security, social governance, ecological civilization, "one country, two systems",
foreign affairs, party and state supervision, etc. This complete set of systems and governance
systems is guided by Marxism, rooted in the Chinese land, has a profound Chinese cultural
foundation, and is deeply supported by the people, a system and governance system with strong
vitality and great superiority, and a system and governance system that can promote the progress
and development of a country with a population of 1.4 billion and ensure that the Chinese nation,
which has a civilization history of more than 5,000 years, can achieve the "two centenary goals" and
then achieve great rejuvenation. Of course, with the continuous development of the cause of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, we must also continue to promote institutional innovation to
ensure that by the 100th anniversary of the founding of our party, obvious results will be achieved
in making all aspects of the system more mature and more stereotyped; by 2035, all aspects of the
system will be more perfect, and the national governance system and governance capacity will be
basically modernized; by the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the national
governance system and governance capacity will be fully modernized, so that the socialist system
with Chinese characteristics will be more consolidated and its superiority will be fully displayed.
Strengthening cultural self-confidence is because socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is
based on the excellent traditional Chinese culture, guided by Marxism, with socialist core values as
the soul, and advanced socialist culture as the main content and essential characteristics, which is
the fundamental spiritual driving force for enhancing China's self-confidence and realizing the "two
centenary goals.”

To strengthen cultural self-confidence is to have a high degree of cultural identification with
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Cultural self-confidence
is a more basic, broader and deeper self-confidence." 1 Only by strengthening cultural self-
confidence can we make the road, theory, and system more firm. We should run cultural self-
confidence through the whole process of road expansion, theoretical development and institutional
improvement, and give full play to the soulful guiding and promoting role of socialist culture with
Chinese characteristics in the practice of socialist construction with Chinese characteristics.
3. Constantly write a new chapter in socialism with Chinese characteristics
in the new era
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is a pioneering cause and a historical process that is
constantly advancing. The Chinese Communists, mainly represented by Comrade Xi Jinping, have
promoted historic achievements and changes in the cause of the Party and the country with great
political courage and strong responsibility, so that China's development will stand at a new historical
starting point. China's economy has sustained and stable growth, the economic structure has been
gradually optimized and upgraded; the coordination of development has been continuously
enhanced, the development gap between urban and rural areas and between regions has gradually
narrowed; the people's living standards and quality of life have been significantly improved, and the
people's sense of gain has been increasing; the comprehensive national strength has been
continuously enhanced, and the international influence has been significantly enhanced. Socialism
with Chinese characteristics has shown more and more beautiful development prospects, which has
not only won unprecedented international status and influence for China, but also won
unprecedented dignity and self-confidence for the Chinese people. This is an important embodiment
of writing a new chapter of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and it is also a
firm foundation for striving for good governance and forging ahead into the future.
Practice is unfolding at a new stage of development, and theoretical innovation must inevitably be
elevated to a new level. In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core focuses on the theme of adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics, has a profound insight into the trend of the times with the
strategic thinking of Marxist politicians, answers the new issues facing the development of the times
and practice with superb political wisdom and a high degree of theoretical consciousness, puts
forward a series of innovative new concepts, ideas and strategies, and creates Xi Jinping Thought
on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, which provides us with guiding ideology
and a program of action for understanding and solving new contradictions and problems in practice.

Adhering to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a
New Era is an inevitable requirement for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and also an inevitable requirement for writing a new chapter of socialism with
Chinese characteristics.
Socialism with Chinese characteristics is still in practice. Whether it is now or in the future, there
are many new questions that need to be explored and answered, requiring us to make unremitting
efforts in "keeping the right and making new things.” Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Our
understanding of socialism and our grasp of the law of socialism with Chinese characteristics have
reached an unprecedented new height, which is beyond doubt. At the same time, we must also realize
that socialism in our country is still in its initial stage, we are still facing many problems that have
not yet been clarified and difficult problems to be solved, and there is no doubt that our
understanding and handling of many major issues are still in the process of deepening." 1 We must
think about and grasp a series of major issues facing the country's future development with a broader
vision and a longer-term perspective, improve our ability of strategic thinking, more accurately
grasp the changing characteristics of the initial stage of socialism in our country, continuously
enhance the principled, systematic, foreseeable and creative nature of our work, improve the
development strategy and various policies, do a good job in reform, development and stability, and
push forward socialism with Chinese characteristics with a new mental state and fighting attitude.
Section 2: The Core Essence of Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics in the New Era
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China used "eight clear" and "Fourteen
Persistences" to systematically summarize and deeply explain Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with
Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. The "Eight Clarifications" are the action guide for adhering
to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, focusing on answering what
kind of socialism with Chinese characteristics to adhere to and develop; the "Fourteen Persistences"
is the program of action for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in
the new era, focusing on answering how to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese

The "eight clear" and "Fourteen Persistences" constitute the core essence of adhering to and
developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
1. The "Eight Clear" are the action guide for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics
The core content of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era is
the "Eight Clear" It is clear that the general task of adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics is to realize socialist modernization and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation, and on the basis of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, we should
take two steps to build a prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern
socialist country by the middle of this century; make it clear that the main contradiction in our
society in the new era is the contradiction between the people's growing need for a better life and
unbalanced and inadequate development. Common prosperity for all the people; it is clear that the
overall layout of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics is "five-in-one" and the strategic
layout is "four comprehensive", emphasizing firm confidence in the road, theory, system and culture;
it is clear that the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform is to improve and develop the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promote the modernization of the national
governance system and governance capacity; it is clear that the overall goal of comprehensively
promoting the rule of law is to build a socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics.
Build a socialist country ruled by law; make it clear that the party's goal of strengthening the army
in the new era is to build a force that obeys the party's command and can win battles. It is clear that
the people's army with excellent work style will build the people's army into a world-class army; it
is clear that the diplomacy of major countries with Chinese characteristics should promote the
construction of a new type of international relations and promote the construction of a community
with a shared future for mankind; it is clear that the most essential feature of socialism with Chinese
characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the greatest advantage of the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and
the party is the highest political leading force, put forward the general requirements for party
building in the new era, and highlight the important position of political construction in party
building.
These "Eight Definites" scientifically expounded a series of basic issues on adhering to and
developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and provided ideological guidance
for the party and the people to better adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics.
First, it clarifies the general task for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. This general task is to realize socialist modernization and the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and build a modern and powerful socialist country.
China Aerospace Studies Institute

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and building a modern and powerful socialist
country is a great goal established by the Communist Party of China. The Chinese Communists have
worked hard for a century and successfully opened up a path of socialist modernization with Chinese
characteristics that is different from the West. Standing at a new height in the overall development
of the cause of the party and the country, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China formulated a grand blueprint for building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-
round way, and made brand-new strategic arrangements for realizing the "two centenary goals": by
2020, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way; basically realize socialist
modernization by 2035; and build a modern and powerful socialist country by 2050 to realize the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This strategic arrangement is not only inspiring and urging
people to forge ahead, but also scientific, rational and in line with reality, and is a powerful spiritual
driving force that inspires the Chinese communists and Chinese people to continue to struggle for a
better life.
Second, for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, it has
clarified the fundamental strategic arrangements formulated for accomplishing the overall tasks and
achieving the overall goals, which must be based on an accurate judgment of the reality of national
development and the main contradictions in our society. The report of the 19th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China clearly pointed out that the main contradiction in our society has
been transformed into a contradiction between the people's growing need for a better life and
unbalanced and inadequate development. This transformation of the main contradiction in society
reflects the tremendous progress of China's social development and the new changes in stages of
development, reflects the new requirements for the development of the cause of the party and the
country, and is an important basis for determining the strategic deployment of socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era. Only by clarifying this main contradiction can we grasp the
overall situation of development and clarify the direction, tasks and key points of development.
Third, it has clarified a new layout for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. Based on the new historical orientation, Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era clearly points out that the overall layout for
promoting the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era is "five-in-one" and
the strategic layout is "four comprehensive.” The overall layout of the "five-in-one" clarifies the
overall deployment for promoting national modernization in the new era, that is, the comprehensive
advancement of economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social
construction and ecological civilization construction. The "four comprehensive" strategic layout has
clarified the important aspects that have overall driving and leading significance in the development
of the party and the country in the new era, that is, comprehensively building a moderately
prosperous society, comprehensively deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country
according to law, and comprehensively administering the party strictly. Promote the cause of
socialism with Chinese characteristics in an overall layout, and take the strategic layout as the
strategic goal and strategic measure of all work;

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
It has established the strategic direction, key areas and main targets for the development of the cause
of the party and the country in the new era, made top-level design and strategic deployment for
adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and also provided more scientific
layout arrangements.
Fourth, it has defined new requirements for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China proposed that the overall goal of China's comprehensive deepening
reform is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promote the
modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. This is to continuously
promote the maturity and improvement of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics by
comprehensively deepening reform, improving the system and updating the institutional mechanism,
and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. On
the basis of summing up China's historical experience, especially the lessons learned from the
governance of socialist countries, Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that "the national governance system
and governance capacity are a concentrated embodiment of a country's system and system
implementation ability." 1 This important thesis shows that through comprehensively deepening
reform, improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, it provides an
endogenous driving force and institutional guarantee for promoting the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity, and promotes the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity to prepare supporting forces and innovative
ways for the improvement and development of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.
Fifth, it clarifies the guarantee of the rule of law for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era clearly states that the overall goal of comprehensively promoting the
rule of law is to build a socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics and a socialist
country under the rule of law. "Law is the most important instrument of governance, and the rule of
law is an important support for the national governance system and governance capacity.
Comprehensively promoting the rule of law is the fundamental requirement for solving a series of
major problems facing the development of the cause of the party and the country, liberating and
enhancing social vitality, promoting social fairness and justice, maintaining social harmony and
stability, and ensuring the long-term peace and stability of the party and the country. In order to
promote the sustained and healthy development of China's economy and society and continuously
open up broader development prospects for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we
must comprehensively promote the construction of a socialist country under the rule of law and
provide institutionalized solutions to these problems from the perspective of the rule of law." 2
Governing the country according to law in an all-round way is a strategy for governing the country,
an essential requirement and important guarantee for socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a
profound revolution in national governance.

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
We must adhere to the path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, improve the socialist
legal system with Chinese characteristics with the Constitution as the core, and better play the role
of the rule of law as a guarantee for solidifying the foundation, stabilizing expectations, and
benefiting the long term.
Sixth, it has clarified the strategic support for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. A strong country must strengthen its military. Comprehensively
promoting the modernization of national defense and the armed forces, adhering to the road of
strengthening the military with Chinese characteristics, and building a world-class army are not only
important tasks for the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also an important
foundation and strategic support for safeguarding the stable development of the cause of socialism
with Chinese characteristics. In the face of the requirements of the times to strengthen the country
and the army, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has formed Xi
Jinping's thinking on strengthening the army around the major issue of "what kind of strong people's
army to build in the new era and how to build a strong people's army.” Xi Jinping Thought on
Strengthening the Army profoundly grasps the new requirements for national defense and army
building put forward by the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era,
and clarifies that the party's goal of strengthening the army in the new era is to build a people's army
that obeys the command of the party, can win battles and has excellent work style, and builds the
people's army into a world-class army, providing a strong guarantee for adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Seventh, it clarifies the diplomatic goal for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has focused on the development
trend of human society, continued to answer major issues related to national development and the
future and destiny of mankind, such as "what kind of world to build and how to build this world",
put forward the proposition of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and included
"persisting in promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind" into the
basic strategy of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, so as to achieve
the common development of human society. Continued prosperity has charted a new blueprint and
provided Chinese solutions to the complex problems facing humanity. Promoting the construction
of a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation as the core is a strategic choice
made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core based on the
development trend of the times and the fundamental interests of our country, which has created a
more favorable international environment for maintaining and extending the period of important
strategic opportunities for China's development, and for promoting the great cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics and realizing the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Eighth, it has clearly defined the political guarantee for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era. Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era,
and the environment facing China's development has become more complicated.

New changes have taken place in the international balance of forces, domestic reform has entered
the deep water area, and the task of comprehensively administering the party strictly remains
arduous. It is clear that the most essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the greatest advantage of the socialist system with
Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China, which provides a strong

Based on the new historical orientation and historical starting point, these "Eight Definites" form a
systematic, complete and logical scientific theoretical system, which concentrates on the new
development of Marxism in contemporary China and the 21st century.

First, the "Fourteen Persistences" answer the question of "who will lead" in the practice of adhering
to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. A prominent feature of the
superiority of China's political system is that it has always adhered to the party's leadership position
of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all parties. During the period of socialist
construction, Comrade Mao Zedong stressed: "In the seven aspects of industry, agriculture,
commerce, study, soldiers, government, and the party, the party leads everything. "1 In the new era,
Comrade Xi Jinping further proposed on the basis of summing up the historical experience of
socialism: "Adhere to the party's leadership over all work. "2 It clearly answers the question of "who
will lead" in adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. The
leadership of the Communist Party of China is the choice of history and the choice of the people; it
is the fundamental and lifeline of the country and the nation, and the interests and happiness of the
people of the whole country are related. In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, in
the face of the new situation and new tasks, ensuring the party's role as the core of leadership has
put forward new requirements for the party's self-building, and "persisting in comprehensively and
strictly administering the party" has become the top priority. Such a basic strategy is based on the
party's scientific Lan of its own development experience, correct judgment of the international and
domestic situation, and always adhere to the original mission. The Communist Party of China is
China's supreme political leading force, and all fields and aspects must consciously uphold the
party's leadership, including "upholding the party's absolute leadership over the people's army."
Only by always adhering to the party's leadership over all work can we achieve ideological unity,
political unity and unity in action of the whole party and society at a higher level, further enhance
the party's creativity, cohesion and combat effectiveness, and ensure the success of socialist
construction.
Second, the "Fourteen Persistences" clarify the question of "for whom and on whom" in the practice
of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. The great cause
of socialism with Chinese characteristics has the most profound and extensive people's character.
First, it has always regarded the realization, safeguarding and development of the fundamental
interests of the broadest masses of the people as its value orientation; second, it has always taken
the broadest masses of the people as the main body of practice. Important strategies such as
"persisting in taking the people as the center", "upholding the people as masters of the country" and
"persisting in ensuring and improving people's livelihood in the course of development" show that
building socialism with Chinese characteristics is an unprecedented great cause, and it is necessary
to closely unite and highly unite the strength of the whole nation and fight unremittingly for it with
one heart and one mind.

Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "The concept of the people has different contents in different
countries and in different historical periods of each country. "1 In contemporary China, all classes,
strata and social forces that support, support and participate in the construction of socialism with
Chinese characteristics belong to the category of the people and are all relying forces for the cause
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Our party must ensure that development is for
the people, development depends on the people, and the fruits of development are shared by the
people.
Third, the "Fourteen Persistences" respond to the question of "how to promote development" in the
practice of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era. As
socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, major changes have taken place in the main
contradictions in our society, but the basic national conditions of our country in the initial stage of
socialism have not changed, and our international status as the world's largest developing country
has not changed. This determines that development remains the foundation and key to solving all
our problems. "How to promote development" has become a question that the ruling party must
answer. "Persisting in comprehensively deepening reform" shows that reform and opening up is a
key measure and powerful driving force for promoting the realization of the "two centenary goals"
and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. In contemporary China, only reform and
opening up can develop China, socialism and Marxism. "Reform and opening up is only carried out
when it is not completed. "2 Adhering to the new development concept of "innovation, coordination,
green, openness and sharing" reflects the party's new thinking and understanding of the law of
economic and social development, points out China's development ideas, development directions,
and development focuses, and is an important follow-up that must be adhered to for a long time in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. "Adhering to the harmonious coexistence of man
and nature" reflects a major change in China's development mode, further enriches the connotation
of development, expands the vision of development, clarifies new requirements for development,
and has both theoretical innovation and practical breakthroughs.
Fourth, the "Fourteen Persistences" respond to the question of "how to provide effective guarantees"
in the practice of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Under the new historical conditions, to smoothly advance the cause of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, it is necessary to provide effective guarantees and favorable conditions. "Adhering
to the socialist core value system" fully embodies the powerful goal and guiding role of the lofty
ideal of communism and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics in promoting
the development of the cause, and embodies the profound nourishing role of China's excellent
traditional culture and the spiritual guiding role of revolutionary culture and advanced socialist
culture.

developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, an inevitable requirement for realizing the
modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, and is related to the
party's ruling and rejuvenating the country, the people's happiness and well-being, and the long-term

security" and taking national security as an important cornerstone of stability and stability are in the
fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and it will ensure the smooth
progress of the practical process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. "Persistently
promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind" has drawn a blueprint
for human society to achieve common development, sustained prosperity and long-term stability,
pointed out the way forward, and also created a good external environment for China's development.
"Upholding one country, two systems' and promoting the reunification of the motherland" is an
inevitable requirement for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and is also where
the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation lie.
The "14 Adherence Principles" basic strategy makes top-level designs for economic, political,
cultural, social, ecological and rule of law, national security, national defense and the military, "one
country, two systems" and the motherland's reunification, united front, diplomacy, party building
and other aspects, clarifies the major policies for the development of various undertakings in the
new era, points out the goals, paths and methods for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era, and is the "road map" for realizing the "two centenary goals"
and realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .
Section 3: Realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation on the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics
The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, as well as the vanguard
of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation. The Party takes the realization of socialism and
communism as its goal and undertakes the historical mission of realizing the great rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation. Adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics epitomizes
the organic combination of realizing socialism and communism and realizing the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation. To realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on the road of socialism
with Chinese characteristics, generations of Chinese communists need to lead the people to continue
to struggle.

1. Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the historical
mission of the Chinese Communists
Leading the Chinese nation toward rejuvenation is not only the historical mission entrusted to the
Chinese Communists by the development of China's modern history, but also the conscious choice
and initiative of the Chinese Communists. Since its birth, the Communist Party of China has
regarded seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation as its
original aspiration and mission. The nature, ideals and purposes of the Party doom it to take the
realization of national independence and the prosperity and strength of the country as her own
responsibility, to devote all her wisdom and painstaking efforts to the realization of national
rejuvenation, and to the fact that she must closely unite and rely on the broadest masses of the people
and gain from them the tremendous strength to promote historical progress.
In order to realize the historical mission of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, whether it
is weak or strong, whether in good times or bad, the Communist Party of China has never changed
its original intention and unswervingly determined, dared to overcome any difficulties, is willing to
make any sacrifice, has the courage to correct any mistakes, unites and leads the Chinese people to
carry out the new democratic revolution, socialist revolution, socialist construction, reform and
opening up, and the Chinese nation has ushered in a great leap from standing up, getting rich to
becoming strong. Facts have eloquently proved that it is precisely under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China that the Chinese nation has completely shaken off the miserable situation
of being slaughtered by others, and that the Chinese people have completely bid farewell to the weak
state of poverty and backwardness; in contemporary China, only the Communist Party of China and
no other political force can lead the Chinese people to realize the great historical cause of national
rejuvenation.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has taken over the baton of history, united and led the whole
party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to promote the overall layout of the
"five-in-one" and the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, promoted the historic achievements
and changes in the cause of the party and the country, entered a new era of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and entered the decisive stage of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-
round way, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation ushered in unprecedented bright
prospects. At the same time, China's reform into the "deep water area" is faced with "hard bones"
that are difficult to gnaw; development has entered a period of concave contradictions between
people, and various risks and tests are intertwined and superimposed. As Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out: "What we are now in is a time when the boat is wandering more urgently, and the road
to the middle of the mountain is steeper, and it is a time when it is more and more difficult to advance,
more and more dangerous, and if you do not advance, you must retreat, you must enter."

At this critical historical juncture, only the Communist Party of China can play its role as the
"backbone" ideologically and politically, maintain the political determination not to follow the old
road and not to take the evil road, unite the invincible and majestic strength of the whole party and
the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, and continue to forge ahead courageously
towards the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

2. the essence of the Chinese dream is national prosperity and strength,
national rejuvenation and people's happiness
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out: "Realizing the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is the greatest dream of the Chinese nation in modern times. "2
This great dream, with profound historical accumulation and rich ideological connotation, embodies
the long-cherished wishes of several generations of Chinese, embodies the overall interests of the
Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and is the common aspiration of every Chinese sons and
daughters. In November 2012, when Comrade Xi Jinping led all the comrades of the Standing
Committee of the 18th Politburo and the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee to visit the
exhibition "The Road to Rejuvenation", he first proposed the concept of the Chinese Dream. In
March 2013, in his speech at the first session of the 12th National People's Congress, Comrade Xi
Jinping pointed out: "To realize the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation
is to realize the prosperity and strength of the country, national rejuvenation and people's happiness,
which not only deeply embodies the ideals of today's Chinese, but also deeply reflects the glorious
tradition of our ancestors in their unremitting pursuit of progress", 3 further clarifying the basic
connotation of the Chinese dream.
The most distinctive feature of the Chinese dream is that it closely links the destinies of the country,
the nation and the people, and integrates the pursuit of the country, the yearning of the nation and
the expectations of the people. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "History tells us that everyone's
future and destiny are closely linked to the future and destiny of the country and the nation. If the
country is good and the nation is good, everyone will be good. "4

From the national level, the Chinese dream is the dream of a strong country, and it is necessary to
completely shake off the country's poverty and weakness and build a modern and powerful socialist
country in an all-round way; from the national level, the Chinese dream is the dream of rejuvenation,
to completely shake off backwardness, so that the Chinese nation can stand stronger and more on
its own feet among the nations of the world and make greater contributions to the noble cause of
pursuing peace and progress of mankind; from the people's level, the Chinese dream is the dream of
prosperity, and it is necessary to completely shake off poverty and strive to live a better life.
The Chinese dream is the dream of the country and the nation, but in the final analysis, it is the
dream of the people. The people are the main body of the Chinese Dream, the creators and enjoyers
of the Chinese Dream. The deepest foundation of the Chinese dream lies in the hearts of the Chinese
people, and we must rely closely on the people to realize it. The realization of the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation is not the dream of any one person or part of the people, but the common
pursuit of all Chinese people; the realization of the Chinese dream is not the achievement of any one
person or part of the people, but the benefit of all the people. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that all
people who are interested in this great cause can make great achievements, and should "consciously
integrate life ideals and family happiness into the great cause of national prosperity and national
rejuvenation, and closely link personal dreams with Chinese dreams.”1 Everyone is a participant and
writer of the Chinese Dream, and enjoys the opportunity to shine in life; everyone's continuous
efforts towards the dream are also a force for realizing the great Chinese Dream.
The dreams of the Chinese people are closely related to the dreams of the people of all countries.
The Chinese dream is a dream of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results. In the
process of realizing the Chinese dream, China will work with other countries to promote the people
of all countries to better realize their dreams. The realization of the Chinese Dream is inseparable
from a peaceful international environment and a stable international order, as well as the
understanding, support and assistance of the people of all countries. In the process of realizing the
Chinese Dream, "we will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development, unswervingly
pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy, not only devote ourselves to China's
own development, but also emphasize our responsibility and contribution to the world; not only
benefit the Chinese people, but also benefit the people of the world."2 China's development is the
growth of the world peace force and the positive energy of friendship. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed
out:

"China's development will surely be embedded in the trend of world development, and will also
inject more vitality and bring more opportunities for the common development of all countries in
the world." 1 History will prove that the realization of the Chinese dream brings to the world
opportunities rather than threats, peace rather than turmoil, and progress rather than retrogression.
3. to realize the Chinese dream, we must adhere to the Chinese path, carry
forward the Chinese spirit, and unite China's strength
In his speech at the first session of the 12th National People's Congress, Comrade Xi Jinping clearly
pointed out that to realize the Chinese dream, we must take the road of China as a country, carry
forward the Chinese spirit, and unite China's strength.
The Chinese road is the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics. History and reality tell us
that the road determines destiny, and it is extremely difficult to find a correct path. Since the reform
and opening up, the Communist Party of China has summed up historical experience, made
continuous arduous explorations, and finally found the correct path to realize the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation, which is the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The path of
socialism with Chinese characteristics is to base on the basic national conditions under the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, take economic construction as the center, adhere to the
four basic principles, adhere to reform and opening up, liberate and develop social productive forces,
build a socialist market economy, socialist democratic politics, advanced socialist culture, socialist
harmonious society and socialist ecological civilization, promote all-round human development,
gradually realize common prosperity for all the people, and build a prosperous, strong, democratic,
civilized, harmonious and beautiful modern socialist country. The connotation and orientation of
this road are completely consistent and highly unified with the grand goal of realizing national
rejuvenation. Practice has also fully proved that this is a bright road suited to China's national
conditions and guiding China's development and progress, and is of decisive significance to
realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This road has enabled
the Chinese nation to make great strides to catch up with the advancing trend of the times and
enabled the Chinese people and the Chinese nation to make more and more contributions to world
peace and development.
The Chinese spirit is the national spirit with patriotism as the core and the spirit of the times with
reform and innovation as the core. People cannot stand without spirit, and the spirit of the country
is not strong.

The Chinese spirit is the soul of rejuvenating the country and the soul of strengthening the country
that condenses the strength of the Chinese nation. The great national spirit is fostered, inherited and
developed by the Chinese people in their long-term struggle, and its core is patriotism, the main
content of which is unity and unity, peace-loving, industriousness and courage, and unremitting self-
improvement, which is embodied in the spirit of great creation, great struggle, great unity and great
dream. It is precisely with the great national spirit that the Chinese nation has created and developed
the splendid traditional Chinese culture and provided a strong spiritual impetus for China's
development and the progress of human civilization. The timeless great national spirit is the
foundation for strengthening the "four self-confidences" and the fundamental force for China's
march forward. Since the reform and opening up, the Party has injected a new connotation of the
times into the Chinese spirit in the innovative practice of leading the people, which is the spirit of
the times with reform and innovation as the core. The opening up of the road of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, the formation of the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, the continuous improvement of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and
the continuous development of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics shine everywhere with
the light of the spirit of the times. The spirit of reform and innovation of the times has become the
most important character of socialism with Chinese characteristics and the foundation of the
vigorous vitality of socialism with Chinese characteristics. On the new journey of realizing the
Chinese dream, only by vigorously carrying forward the great national spirit and the spirit of the
times, making the Chinese spirit an internal spiritual support for promoting social development and
progress, and becoming a spiritual bond to strengthen the unity and struggle of the people of the
whole country and a spiritual driving force for unceasing self-improvement, can we compose a
wonderful movement of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
China's strength is the strength of the great unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Among
them, the Communist Party of China is the core force. Without the leadership of the Communist
Party, an advanced Marxist political party, the Chinese people of all ethnic groups would have no
"backbone" and would find it difficult to form cohesion. To pool China's strength, we must, under
the leadership of the Communist Party of China, consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic
united front, unite all forces that can be united, mobilize all positive factors that can be mobilized,
fully stimulate everyone's enterprising spirit and creativity, and fully mobilize the initiative and
creativity of all social strata and social groups. The masses of the people are the main force, and
China's strength is fundamentally the strength of the people of all ethnic groups in China to unite
and struggle, and the strength of the 1.4 billion Chinese to think and work hard in one place. The
people's yearning for a better life, their desire for brilliant opportunities in life, and their pursuit of
making their dreams come true contain endless potential for struggle and creative vitality. The
strength of the Chinese people to realize their dreams will be incomparably strong, and everyone's
efforts to realize their dreams will have broad space, and the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation will certainly be realized.

To better adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, we must take
charge of the "four greatness", make overall plans to promote the overall layout of the "five-in-one",
and coordinate the promotion of the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, which is the overall plan
of the Communist Party of China to promote the great cause of socialism with Chinese
characteristics and the top-level design of the party to realize socialist modernization.
1. the "four greats" are closely linked, interconnected and interact
The proposal of the "four greats" as a whole is a major theoretical innovation, which clarifies the
party's general strategy for governing the country in the new era and the general blueprint for leading
the overall situation, embodies the high degree of unity of the goal of struggle, the path to realization,
and the driving force for progress, embodies the high degree of unity of historical inheritance,
practical tasks, and future direction, embodies the high degree of unity of the party's future and
destiny, the country's future and destiny, and the nation's future destiny, and profoundly answers
what is the party's historical mission in the new era. The major theoretical and practical issue of how
to realize the party's historical mission in the new era has brought the party's understanding of its
own historical mission to a new height.
Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "The great struggle, the great project, the great cause, and
the great dream are closely linked, interconnected and interacting, and the decisive role is the new
great project of party building."1 This is of crucial significance for the correct understanding of the
"Four Greats.”
The "four greats" are an organic and unified whole.

Great dreams guide the correct direction and provide the course for great struggles, great projects,
and great causes; great struggles show the spirit of responsibility and provide traction for great
projects, great causes, and great dreams; great projects forge leading forces and provide a strong
guarantee for great struggles, great causes, and great dreams; and great causes declare the banner of
the road and open up a path of advance for great struggles, great projects, and great dreams. The
"Four Greats" epitomize the new concepts, ideas and strategies of the Party Central Committee in
governing the country with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core since the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, highlight the historical mission and grand goal of the Communist Party
of China under the new historical conditions, and form the overall framework of the Party Central
Committee's governance of the country. The historic changes in the party and the country were
achieved precisely under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China in the great
struggle with many new historical characteristics, were guaranteed by the new great project of party
building, advanced in the direction of the great cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
were inspired by the dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Great projects play a decisive role in the "four greats.” To administer the country, we must first
administer the party, and we must administer the party strictly; this is the profound conclusion drawn
by the CPC in its own construction. Deepening the people's promotion of the new great project of
party building is an inevitable requirement for maintaining the party's advanced nature and purity,
for improving the party's ruling ability and level, and for ensuring the party's comprehensive
leadership. The reason why the great project plays a decisive role is because the Communist Party
of China is the leading body of the great cause, the great struggle and the great dream: advancing
the great cause cannot be separated from the party, the strong core of leadership; the party, the
backbone of the people of the whole country, cannot be separated from the party as the backbone of
the people of the whole country to carry out the great struggle; and the realization of the great dream
is even more inseparable from the party, the vanguard that will always walk in the forefront of the
times. The iron must be its own. In order to unite and lead the people in waging great struggles,
advancing great causes, and realizing great dreams, the party must unswervingly uphold and
improve the party's leadership, unswervingly promote the comprehensive and strict management of
the party, and build the party into a stronger and more powerful party. As long as the party builds
itself well and strongly, it will certainly be able to lead the ship carrying the great dream of the
Chinese nation to travel steadily and far.

Penetrating all aspects of socialist modernization is a scientific summary of the CPC's practical
experience in socialist construction.
The overall layout of the "five-in-one" is a major achievement of the party's deepening
understanding of the law governing socialist construction. Before the victory of the Chinese
revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed that the new country and society we want to build must
not only have a new politics and a new economy, but also a new culture. After the founding of New
China, the party united and led the people to carry out the comprehensive construction of socialism
and carried out profound explorations on the layout and construction methods of socialist
construction. In the new period of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, on the basis of
summing up the experience of socialist construction, put forward the idea of taking economic
construction as the center and promoting all-round social development and all-round progress. In
accordance with this important thought of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the Sixth Plenary Session of
the 12th CPC Central Committee put forward for the first time the concept of "the overall layout of
socialist modernization" and preliminarily established the overall layout of China's socialist
modernization construction, namely: "With economic construction as the center, unswervingly carry
out economic structural reform, unswervingly carry out political structural reform, unswervingly
strengthen the building of spiritual civilization, and make these aspects cooperate and promote each
other."1 Economy, politics and culture have become important contents of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics. The 15th and 16th National Congresses of the Communist Party of China
further clarified the goals and requirements for the comprehensive economic, political and cultural
construction and all-round development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and deepened the
understanding of the overall layout. After the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China, the Party put forward the task of social construction, so that the cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics has developed more clearly from the "trinity" to the "four-in-one.” The 17th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China further put forward the construction of
ecological civilization as a new requirement for achieving the goal of a moderately prosperous
society in all respects. The 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China formally
established the overall layout of the "five-in-one" construction of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.

3. Coordinate and promote the "four comprehensive" strategic layout
In the new era, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has formed a "four
comprehensive" strategic layout based on the overall situation of adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics, basing itself on the actual development of contemporary
China, and conforming to the new expectations and new requirements of the people.

It is also put forward to promote the resolution of the outstanding contradictions and problems we
are facing. "1 In November 2012, the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
proposed to build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way; In November 2013, the
Third Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee proposed to comprehensively deepen
reform; in October 2014, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee proposed
to comprehensively promote the rule of law; in October 2014, Comrade Xi Jinping proposed at the
summary meeting of the party's mass line education practice activities to comprehensively promote
strict party management; In November 2014, when Comrade Xi Jinping visited Fujian for inspection
and investigation, he proposed " In December 2014, during his investigation in Jiangsu, Comrade
Xi Jinping raised the "three comprehensives" to "four comprehensives", that is, "coordinating and
promoting the comprehensive construction of a moderately prosperous society, comprehensively
deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country according to law, comprehensively
administering the party strictly, and promoting reform, opening up, and socialist modernization to a
new level." Thus, the term "four comprehensives" was formally formed.
The "four comprehensive" strategic layout has expanded the new vision of the development strategy
of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that the "four
comprehensive" strategic layout, "both strategic goals and strategic measures, each 'comprehensive'
has great strategic significance." Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way is
our strategic goal, and "comprehensively deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country
according to law, and comprehensively administering the party strictly are the three major strategic
measures.” 2 The "four comprehensive" strategic layout is a strategic layout that organically
integrates goals and measures, and a top-level design that connects strategy and tactics, reflecting
the party's inheritance and development of strategic thinking, and the organic unity of persistence
and innovation.
Building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way is a development goal and is in a
leading position. On the basis of summing up the achievements and experiences in building a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, the 18th CPC National Congress clearly put
forward the grand goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way. To build a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, including sustained and healthy economic
development, continuous expansion of people's democracy, significant enhancement of cultural soft
power, comprehensive improvement of people's living standards, and major progress in the
construction of a resource-saving and environment-friendly society. "Achieving this goal is a crucial
step in realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."

It represents the pursuit of the Party and the aspirations of the people, strengthens the ideological
foundation of the Party and the people in unity and struggle, and plays a strategic leading role in the
development of the cause of the Party and the country at the present stage. After the comprehensive
construction of a moderately prosperous society is realized as scheduled in 2020, it will be followed
by the comprehensive construction of a modern socialist power, which still plays a leading role in
the "four comprehensive" strategic layout.

Comprehensively deepening reform is the fundamental driving force. To build a moderately
prosperous society in an all-round way and then build a modern and powerful socialist country in
an all-round way, we must comprehensively deepen reform, further eliminate all ideological
concepts and institutional mechanisms that hinder scientific development, build a systematic,
scientific, standardized, and effective institutional system, and make all aspects of the system more
mature and more formalized. To realize socialist modernization and realize the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation, the most fundamental and urgent task is still to further liberate and develop
the social productive forces. The purpose of comprehensively deepening reform is to let the vitality
of all labor, knowledge, technology, management, capital and other elements burst out and let all
the sources of creating social wealth fully flow. It is necessary to focus on the reform of the economic
system, give play to the leading role of the reform of the economic system, and at the same time
adhere to the direction of the reform of the socialist market economy and constantly improve the
socialist market economic system.
Comprehensively governing the country according to law is an important guarantee. To build a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and then build a modern and powerful socialist
country in an all-round way, the rule of law is needed as a reliable guarantee. At present, the
development of the cause of our party and country is facing many unprecedented contradictions,
risks and challenges, and the position and role of governing the country according to law in the
overall work of the party and the country are more prominent and more important. Comprehensively
promoting the rule of law is a major strategic issue related to our party's ruling and rejuvenating the
country, the happiness and well-being of the people, and the long-term peace and stability of the
party and the country, and is an important aspect of improving and developing the socialist system
with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national governance system
and governance capacity. Only by comprehensively promoting the rule of law can the state and
social life operate in an orderly manner, achieve social harmony and stability, and provide a reliable
guarantee for socialist modernization.
Strictly administering the party in an all-round way is the fundamental guarantee. Adhering to the
party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee for building a moderately prosperous society in an
all-round way and then building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way. Under
the new historical conditions, the environment in which the Party finds itself and the tasks
shouldered by it have undergone great changes;

The party's ideological, political, organizational, and work style building is facing many new
situations and problems, and the task of strictly administering the party is heavier and more urgent
than ever. Only by strengthening the party's self-building, keeping the party's self-building up with
the requirements of the times, continuously improving the party's leadership and ruling level,
continuously improving its ability to resist corruption, guard against degeneration, and resist risks,
and continuously improve its ability to control the overall situation, resolve contradictions, and cope
with risks, can the party's ruling foundation and mass foundation be consolidated and the party's
role as the core of leadership in the process of realizing socialist modernization and the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation be brought into full play.
To coordinate and promote the "four comprehensive" strategic layout, we must firmly grasp the
theme of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out: "Coordinating and promoting the four comprehensive and strategic layouts is the
strategic choice of the Party Central Committee to promote reform, opening up and socialist
modernization, and adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics under the
conditions of the new era to promote reform, opening up and socialist modernization, and adhere to
and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics under the conditions of the new era."1 Every
aspect of the "four comprehensive" strategic layout embodies the inherent requirements for adhering
to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and at the same time injects new
connotations into adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics.
