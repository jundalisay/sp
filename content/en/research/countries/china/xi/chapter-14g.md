3. Jointly build a new platform for international cooperation that conforms to the trend of economic globalization

The construction of the "Belt and Road", from initiative to action, from concept to practice, from
vision to reality, has continuously achieved fruitful results, has become a global public good
welcomed by all countries, and has become a process of promoting the construction of a community
with a shared future for mankind and making new progress. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out,
jointly building the "Belt and Road" is becoming China's plan to participate in global opening and
cooperation, improve the global economic governance system, promote global common
development and prosperity, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for
mankind. "We should focus on jointly building the Belt and Road, work with all parties to build a
new platform for international cooperation, and add new impetus to the common development of
the world."1 China will follow the Strategic Plan for the Construction of the Silk Road Economic
Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road adopted in 2014, the Vision and Actions for Jointly
Building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road issued in 2015, and
the Maritime Cooperation Vision for the Construction of the Belt and Road in 2017 , focus on key
points, intensive cultivation, promote the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" in the direction
of high-quality development, and make it a common road of opportunity and prosperity.
First, build the Belt and Road into a road of peace. The ancient Silk Road, the rise of the times, the
decline of wars. Once "the place of milk and honey", many places are now synonymous with
conflict and crisis. To promote the building of a new type of international relations and a community
with a shared future for mankind, countries along the Belt and Road need to respect each other's
sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity, respect each other's development paths and social
systems, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and create a security pattern of joint
construction and sharing. Especially in view of the characteristics of the security situation in the
regions through which the "Belt and Road" passes, China will work with countries along the route
to resolve hot spots and adhere to political solutions; Focus on mediation, adhere to fairness and
justice, and strive to promote counter-terrorism, treat both the symptoms and the root causes,
eliminate poverty and backwardness and social injustice, and contribute to the "Belt and Road";
Build an environment of peace and tranquility.

Second, build the Belt and Road into a road to prosperity. Development is the overall key to solving
all problems. China's promotion of the "Belt and Road" is precisely in view of the characteristics
that most countries along the route are developing countries, focusing on the fundamental issue of
development, and by redeploying their respective advantageous resources, releasing the
development potential of all countries, and realizing great economic integration, development
linkage and sharing of achievements. Grasp the industry as the foundation of the economy, promote
in-depth industrial cooperation among countries, run economic and trade and industrial cooperation
parks, make industrial development plans compatible and promote each other, especially grasp the
construction of large projects, strengthen international production capacity and equipment
manufacturing cooperation, seize the development of new opportunities of the new industrial
revolution, cultivate new business forms, and maintain the vitality of economic growth. Grasp
finance, the bloodline of the modern economy, promote all countries to jointly establish a stable,
sustainable and risk-controllable financial security system, innovate investment and financing
models, promote public-private cooperation, build a diversified financing system and multi-level
capital market, develop inclusive finance, and improve the financial service network. In particular,
we will seize the trend of a new round of energy structure adjustment and energy technology change,
build a global energy Internet, and achieve green and low-carbon development. In addition, China
will work with countries along the Belt and Road to improve the construction of cross-regional
logistics networks.
Third, build the "Belt and Road" into an open road. Openness leads to progress, closure leads to
backwardness. China promotes the construction of the "Belt and Road" with openness as the guide,
works with countries along the route to build an open cooperation platform, maintain and develop
an open world economy, and create an environment conducive to open development; promote the
construction of a fair, reasonable and transparent system of international economic, trade and
investment rules, promote the orderly flow of production factors, efficient allocation of resources
and deep market integration; jointly safeguard the multilateral trading system, promote the
construction of free trade areas, further promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation,
and solve the imbalance of economic growth and development, governance dilemmas, Digital divide,
distribution gap and other issues; help developing countries better integrate into and benefit from
global value chains, industrial chains and supply chains. At the same time, China supports countries
to actively develop an open economy in light of their own national conditions, participate in regional
and global governance, jointly create more public goods, and work together to build a broad
community of interests.

Fourth, build the "Belt and Road" into a road of innovation. Innovation is an important force for
development. The construction of the "Belt and Road" itself is an initiative, and to do a good job in
the construction of the "Belt and Road", we must also seek impetus for innovation. While China
adheres to innovation-driven development,

Strive to work with countries along the Belt and Road to conform to the development trend of the
fourth industrial revolution, jointly grasp the opportunities of digital, networked and intelligent
development, jointly explore new technologies, new formats and new models, explore new growth
drivers and development paths, strengthen cooperation in frontier fields such as digital economy,
artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, quantum computers, etc., promote the construction of big
data, cloud computing and smart cities, and build a digital Silk Road and innovative Silk Road in
the 21st century. We will continue to implement the "Belt and Road" action plan for science and
technology innovation, and work with all parties to promote the four major measures of scientific
and technological people-to-people exchanges, joint construction of joint laboratories, cooperation
in science and technology parks, and technology transfer; promote the deep integration of science
and technology with industry and science and technology with finance, optimize the innovation
environment, and gather innovation resources; Create entrepreneurial spaces and entrepreneurial
workshops for young people from all over the world in the Internet era, and realize the youthful
dreams of the future generation. At the same time, China will work with countries along the Belt
and Road to formulate the Green Investment Principles of the Belt and Road, work together to build
a "Green Silk Road", jointly implement the new concept of green development, and advocate green,
low-carbon, circular and Sustainable production and lifestyle, strengthen ecological and
environmental protection cooperation, build ecological civilization, and jointly achieve the 2030
sustainable development goals.

Fifth, build the "Belt and Road" into a road of civilization. "The friendship between countries lies
in the affinity of the people, and the affinity of the people lies in the common heart.‚Äù China is
committed to working with other countries to promote exchanges and mutual learning among other
countries, taking into account the rich and diverse characteristics of religions and civilizations along
the "Belt and Road", so as to enhance mutual understanding, mutual respect and mutual trust, and
