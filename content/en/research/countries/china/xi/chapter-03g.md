Section 4: Establish and improve the institutional mechanism for the party's comprehensive leadership

The party's overall leadership is concrete and must be embodied in all aspects of governing the
country and in the design, arrangement, and operation of the institutions, systems, and systems of
state power. Establishing and improving scientific and effective systems and mechanisms is the key
to implementing the party's comprehensive leadership.

1. Adhere to the Party's position as the core of leadership in controlling the overall
situation and coordinating all parties

Adhering to the party's position as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and
coordinating all parties is a prominent feature of the superiority of the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics.

Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that "the Party Central Committee is the brain and center, and the Party
Central Committee must have the authority to set a statue and hammer the final word."1 The Central
Committee, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the Standing Committee of the
Politburo of the CPC Central Committee are the core of the Party's leadership and decision-making;
the decisions and arrangements made by the Party Central Committee must be resolutely
implemented by the Party's discipline inspection organs and organizational, propaganda, united front,
political and legal departments, the Party organizations of the state's legislative, judicial,
administrative, and supervisory organs, and the Party organizations of enterprises, institutions, and
people's organizations. Local Party organizations must ensure that the decisions and arrangements
of the Party Central Committee are implemented as soon as orders are made and stopped when
prohibited. In the big chess game of the national governance system, the Party Central Committee
is the "handsome" who sits in the military tent in the town, and the horses and cannons each show
their strengths, and the overall situation is clearly defined, so that only in governing the country can
there be direction, rules, and strength.

Strengthen the leadership position of Party committees (Party groups) in organizations at the same
level. Straighten out the relationship between party organizations and other organizations, and better
play the role of overseeing the overall situation and coordinating all parties. Party committees
(leading Party groups) established in state organs, public institutions, mass organizations, social
organizations, enterprises and other organizations shall accept the unified leadership of the Party
committees approved for their establishment, report regularly on their work, and ensure that the
Party's principles, policies and decision-making arrangements are implemented in organizations at
the same level. Party committees at all levels should concentrate their energies on setting the
direction, grasping major matters, coming up with ideas, and managing cadres. Party committees at
all levels should give overall consideration to the overall work, plan as a whole, and form a working
mechanism for comprehensive advancement. It is necessary to rationally divide the work levels,
properly handle the relationship between key tasks, clarify which work is personally grasped by the
party committee, which is promoted by the party committee, and which is supported by the party
committee, and form a working mechanism for categorical promotion; within the party committee,
it is necessary to give play to the collective role of the leading body, and at the same time ensure
that the members of the leading body each shoulder their own responsibilities and carry out their
work in unison.

Enhance the organizational strength and leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations. Persist
in focusing on improving organizational strength, highlight political functions, and build the party's
grassroots organizations into strong fighting fortresses for publicizing the party's propositions,
implementing the party's decisions, leading grassroots governance, uniting and mobilizing the
masses, and promoting reform and development. Strengthen the building of grass-roots party
organizations in enterprises, rural areas, organs, institutions, and communities, strengthen the work
of grass-roots party building of social organizations, explore the building of grass-roots party
organizations in the fields of new business formats and the Internet, strengthen the standardization
and standardization of branches, and realize that all the party's work goes to the branches. Party
organizations in villages and communities should comprehensively lead all kinds of organizations
and all work subordinate to their own villages and communities.

Continue to promote the institutionalization of the party's comprehensive leadership and the rule of
law. Study and formulate inner-party laws and regulations on the party's leadership of important
economic and social work, and implement the party's comprehensive leadership in the entire process
and in all aspects of comprehensively governing the country according to law; implement the
provisions of the Constitution, formulate and revise relevant laws and regulations, and clearly
stipulate the legal status of work related to party leadership; enshrine the requirements for upholding
the party's comprehensive leadership in the organic laws of people's congresses, governments, courts,
and procuratorates, and enshrine the people's consultative conference, democratic parties, the
Federation of Industry and Commerce, people's organizations, state-owned enterprises, schools of
higher learning, and The charters of social organizations are to improve the Party's system for
exercising leadership over these organizations, ensuring that they are always active, independent,
responsible, and coordinated under the leadership of the Party.

2. Strictly implement the system of requesting instructions and reporting from the Party Central Committee

The system of requesting instructions and reporting is an important system of the Communist Party
of China, which fundamentally guarantees the authority and centralized and unified leadership of
the Party Central Committee. As early as 1948, Comrade Mao Zedong drafted the "Intra-Party
Directive on the Establishment of the Reporting System" for the Party Central Committee, and then
the Party Central Committee issued the "Supplementary Instructions on the Establishment of the
Reporting System.‚Äù This has played an important role in the political construction of the Party.
Timely reporting of major issues and important matters by party-member cadres is a political
discipline and political rule that must be observed. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "Party
organizations in all fields should be responsible to the party committee and report their work to the
party committee. Some comrades are accustomed to treating the work in charge as their own
forbidden, feeling that since they are in charge, there is no need to report, and they do not want
others to come and ask questions, and some do not even want the party committee to ask questions,
otherwise there is no separation between the party and the government. This thinking is incorrect.
"1
The Sixth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee detailed the system of requesting
instructions and reports on major issues, stipulating that the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Supreme People's
Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, all departments of the central and state organs, all
people's organizations, and all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the
Central Government must regularly report their work to the Party Central Committee.

In February 2019, the CPC Central Committee issued the Regulations of the Communist Party of
China on Requesting Instructions and Reports on Major Matters, further improving the relevant
work system. In accordance with the Party Constitution and internal Party regulations, all members
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee report their duties in writing to the Party
Central Committee and the General Secretary every year; the Secretariat of the CPC Central
Committee and the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the leading party groups of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the leading party groups of the State Council,
the leading party groups of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, the leading party groups of the Supreme People's Court, and the leading party groups
of the Supreme People's Procuratorate report annually to the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau and the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee; and the party committees (leading
party groups) of all regions and departments have strengthened their reporting to the party Central
Committee. When studying major matters involving the overall situation or making major decisions,
it is necessary to promptly request instructions and report to the Party Central Committee, and
special reports should be made on the implementation of important decisions of the Party Central
Committee. In case of sudden major problems and major problems in work, it is necessary to
promptly ask for instructions and report to the Party Central Committee, and if the situation is urgent
and must be dealt with immediately, it is necessary to do a good job in their duties and report quickly.

3. Coordinate the reform of party and state institutions

The functional system of the party and state institutions is an important guarantee for the CPC's
governance of the country, and an important support for ensuring that the party always controls the
overall situation and coordinates all parties. In order to smoothly advance the cause of socialism
with Chinese characteristics in the new era, the party must give full play to the party's leadership,
which is the greatest institutional advantage, from the organizational structure, implement the party's
leadership in all fields and links of the party and state organs in comprehensively and correctly
performing their duties, and ensure the party's long-term ruling power and the country's long-term
peace and stability in terms of system.

The Third Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee focused on improving and
developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, promoting the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity, strengthening the party's long-term ruling
capacity, and promoting the comprehensive and strict management of the party, and made strategic
arrangements for deepening the reform of party and state institutions. The goal of the reform is very
clear, that is, to promote the optimization of the functions of the party and state institutions as the
focus of efforts, to form a leadership system that oversees the overall situation and coordinates all
parties, a government governance system with clear responsibilities and administration according
to law, a world-class armed forces system with Chinese characteristics, a mass work system with
extensive contacts and serving the masses, and to promote the coordinated actions of people's
congresses, governments, CPPCC, supervisory organs, judicial organs, procuratorial organs,
people's organizations, enterprises and institutions, social organizations, etc. under the unified
leadership of the party. Strengthen synergy and comprehensively improve national governance
capacity and governance level.

To deepen the reform of the Party and state institutions, the first thing is to establish and improve
the Party's leadership system and mechanism for major work, and improve the institutional
arrangements to ensure the Party's overall leadership;

Strengthen the party's centralized and unified leadership over major work involving the overall
cause of the party and the country, and enhance the party's ability and determination to set the
direction, seek the overall situation, formulate policies, and promote reform. At the central level, it
is to optimize the decision-making and deliberation coordination organs of the Party Central
Committee, and then strengthen and optimize the Party's leadership over deepening reform,
governing the country according to law, economy, agriculture and rural areas, discipline inspection
and supervision, organization, propaganda, ideology and culture, national security, political and
legal affairs, united front, ethnic and religious affairs, education, science and technology, Internet
information, diplomacy, auditing, etc. The Third Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central
Committee decided to set up the Central Committee for Comprehensive Rule of Law, the Central
Audit Commission, and the Central Leading Group for Education Work, and at the same time
renamed the Central Leading Group for Comprehensively Deepening Reform, the Central Leading
Group for Cybersecurity and Informatization, the Central Leading Group for Finance and
Economics, and the Central Leading Group for Foreign Affairs to the Committee, and adjusted and
optimized the leadership system of the Central Institutional Establishment Committee. These
institutions, as the decision-making and deliberation coordination bodies of the Party Central
Committee, work under the leadership of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and its
Standing Committee, and are responsible for the top-level design, overall layout, overall
coordination and overall promotion of major work in related fields, further ensuring the effective
implementation of the Party's leadership.
The functional departments of the Party are the political organs of the Party exercising political,
ideological and organizational leadership, and the executive organs that implement the decisions
and arrangements of the Party Central Committee and local Party committees at all levels,
implement the Party's leadership, strengthen Party building, and promote the Party's cause. To
coordinate the reform of party and state institutions and uphold and strengthen the party's overall
leadership, it is necessary to optimize the functional allocation of the party's organization,
propaganda, united front, political and legal affairs, party building in organs, education and training,
strengthen the coordination function, and coordinate the work of the system and its own field. At
the same time, it is also necessary to optimize the establishment of various party committee offices,
and the matters that can be undertaken by functional departments are undertaken by functional
departments; optimize and standardize the establishment of party dispatched organs, strengthen
leadership over relevant fields, industries, and system work; and set up institutions directly under
party committees at all levels in accordance with the principle of lean and efficient. The relevant
organs of the Party may be set up in an overall manner with other departments with similar functions
and close ties, and implement the merger and establishment or joint office to prevent overlapping of
institutions, functions and work, and then integrate and optimize forces and resources to bring into
play comprehensive benefits.

Top-level planning and overall design of the reform of party and state institutions is an important
embodiment of the party's leadership. Deepening the reform of party and state institutions, covering
the institutional reform of the Party Central Committee, the National People's Congress, the State
Council, the CPPCC National Committee, the administrative law enforcement system, the cross-
military reform, the mass organization reform, and the local institutional reform, is a systematic,
holistic and reconstructive major change. After the gradual advancement from the central to the local
level since the Third Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee, a functional system of
party and state institutions that is compatible with upholding and strengthening the party's leadership
is taking shape.

4. Improve the specific system for strictly implementing democratic centralism
Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle and fundamental leadership
system of the Party. It regulates the relations between Party members and Party members, Party
members and organizations, subordinate organizations and higher-level organizations, and the
whole Party and the Central Committee, and standardizes the relations between Party and State
organs of power, administrative organs, supervisory organs, judicial organs and people's
organizations. Over the past some time now, quite a few problems have arisen in some party
organizations in the process of implementing democratic centralism: In some localities, "laissez-
faire democracy" has appeared, and "the number one" does not take responsibility, and the leading
body is weak and loose; in some localities, the number one leader "acts arbitrarily, inner-party
democracy is undermined, and the party's leadership has become individual leadership; in some
localities, the party-government relationship is not coordinated, and the so-called separation of the
party and the government is carried out without paying attention to preconditions, or the party
committee directly interferes in government work without any detail, resulting in tension between
the party and the government; in some places, the party and government are divided and departments
are hampered. Fights up and down, fragmentation of local governance; and so on. These problems
greatly restrict the role of the party's leadership as the core, and ultimately affect the comprehensive
economic and social development of a locality.

To uphold and strengthen the party's comprehensive leadership, it is necessary to improve and
implement various specific systems of democratic centralism and institutionalize, standardize, and
scientificize relations between the party and all quarters. In particular, it is necessary to improve the
system of the party leading organs of state power, administrative organs, supervisory organs, judicial
organs, and people's organizations, improve the work system and code of conduct of party
committees (leading party groups) at all levels; strictly implement the "Several Guidelines for Inner-
Party Political Life in the New Situation," improve the rules for deliberation and decision-making
of party committees at all levels, improve the specific system for correctly handling the working
relations between party organizations at higher and lower levels, and ensure that the whole party is
highly consistent ideologically, politically, and in action.
Safeguarding the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership
are unified with promoting inner-Party democracy. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "Adhering to
the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralized and unified leadership does not mean
that there is no need for democratic centralism, do not promote inner-party democracy, and it is
wrong to oppose the two."1 Democratic centralism organically combines the full development of
inner-party democracy with the correct practice of centralism; it can not only stimulate the creative
vitality of the whole party to the maximum, but also unify the thinking and actions of the whole
party, and effectively prevent and overcome decentralism in which deliberation is not decided and
decision is not done, and it is a scientific, rational, and efficient system.

Democratic centralism includes two aspects, democracy and centralization, which are mutually
conditional, complementary and opposite. It is necessary to organically unify democracy and
centralism, and truly turn the advantages of democratic centralism into the party's political,
organizational, systemic, and work advantages.
