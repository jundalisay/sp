<!-- Scientifically judging the historical orientation and formulating lines, principles, and policies based on this is the valuable experience accumulated by the CPC's long-term struggle. 

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the face of profound changes in the conditions of the world, the country and the party, the Party Central Committee with Comrade 

Xi Jinping has led the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to overcome difficulties and struggle, opening a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era scientifically marks the new historical orientation of the primary stage of socialism in China, gives the party's historical mission, theoretical follow-up, goals and tasks a new connotation of the times, and provides the coordinates of the times for deeply grasping Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era. -->


## Section 1: The basic basis for socialism with Chinese characteristics to enter a new era

<!-- The entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era is based on the characteristics of different stages in the process of socialist social development, marking a new stage in the process of the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and reflecting the new progress of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics. 

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The new era is a new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, not some other new era."1 -->

The new era is a stage in the initial stage of socialism, not any other stage.

<!-- Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era with a solid historical foundation and sufficient practical basis. -->


### 1. Solid historical foundation

<!-- Socialism with Chinese characteristics (SWCC) was founded in a new period in the history of reform and opening up, and was built on the basis of the long-term struggle of the Communist Party of China in the past century, and its origins in ideology, theory and practice can be traced back even further. 

When combing and reviewing the 500-year history of world socialism, Comrade  -->

Xi stressed that Socialism with Chinese characteristics (SWCC) was a fundamental achievement achieved through thousands of hardships at various costs, with profound historical origins and practical foundations.

<!-- The entry of socialism with Chinese characteristics into a new era was realized in the continuous struggle of several generations of Chinese communists to establish a new China, open a new era, cross the new century, and stand at a new starting point. -->

Mao integrated the basic tenets of Marxism-Leninism with the Chinese revolution and founded Mao Zedong Thought.

<!-- united and led the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, completed the new democratic revolution, established New China, established the basic socialist system, successfully realized the most profound and greatest social reform in Chinese history, and laid the fundamental political prerequisite and institutional foundation for all development and progress in contemporary China. In the process of exploring the road of socialist construction in China, although there have been twists and turns, the original theoretical achievements and tremendous achievements made by the Party in socialist revolution and construction have provided valuable experience, theoretical preparation and material foundation for the creation of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new historical period. -->

After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping created Deng Xiaoping Theory.

 <!-- united and led the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to profoundly sum up the positive and negative experiences of China's socialist construction, draw on the historical experience of socialism in the world, creatively answer the major questions of what socialism is and how to build socialism, create , and make a decision to shift the focus of the work of the party and the state to economic construction. The historic policy decision to implement reform and opening up has profoundly revealed the nature of socialism, established the basic line for the initial stage of socialism, clearly proposed to follow its own path and build socialism with Chinese characteristics, scientifically answered a series of basic questions on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, formulated a development strategy for basically realizing socialist modernization in three steps by the middle of the 21st century, and successfully opened a new period of socialism with Chinese characteristics. -->

After the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, Jiang Zemin created three represents.

<!--  as the main representative united and led the whole party and the people of
all nationalities throughout the country, adhered to the party's basic theory and basic line, deepened
their understanding of what socialism is, how to build socialism, what kind of party to build, and
how to build the party, and formed the important thinking of "." 

In the face of the
severe test of the very complicated situation at home and abroad and the serious twists and turns of
socialism in the world, we have defended socialism with Chinese characteristics, established the
reform objectives and basic framework of the socialist market economic system, established the
basic economic system and distribution system in the initial stage of socialism, opened up a new
situation of comprehensive reform and opening up, promoted the new great project of party building,
and successfully pushed socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st century. -->

After the 16th CPC National Congress, Hu Jintao:
- united and led the party and all ethnic groups throughout the country.
- took Deng Xiaoping Theory and its "three represents" as guide

<!-- , profoundly understood and answered major questions such as what kind of development to
achieve and how to develop in accordance with the new development requirements, and formed a
scientific outlook on development that is people-oriented and comprehensively coordinates
sustainable development. Seize the period of important strategic opportunities, promote practical
innovation, theoretical innovation and institutional innovation in the process of building a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, adhere to people-oriented, comprehensively
coordinated and sustainable development, form the overall layout of the cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, focus on ensuring and improving people's livelihood, promote social
fairness and justice, promote the construction of a harmonious world, promote the building of the
party's ruling capacity and advanced nature, and successfully adhere to and develop socialism with
Chinese characteristics at a new historical starting point. -->

<!-- Adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics requires Chinese communists to
keep pace with the times, constantly create new things in theory, and show new achievements in
practice. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics is a big article, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has defined the basic ideas and basic
principles for it, and the third generation of the party's central leading collective with Comrade Jiang
Zemin as the core and the party Central Committee with Comrade Hu Jintao as general secretary
have written wonderful chapters on this big article." Now, the task of our generation of communists
is to continue to write this big article."1 -->


### 2. Historic achievements and historic changes

<!--  of the Communist Party of China opened a new journey for the cause
of the Party and the country, and opened a new chapter in the great practice of socialism with
Chinese characteristics. In the face of profound and complex changes in the domestic and
international situation, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, with great
political courage and strong responsibility, has raised the banner and directed itself, strategized,
scientifically grasped the general development trend of today's world and contemporary China,
taken charge of great struggles,  -->

In the 18th National Congress, Xi led great projects, coordinated the promotion of the "five-in-one" economic construction,  political construction, cultural construction, etc.

<!-- social construction and ecological civilization construction, coordinated the
construction of a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way, comprehensively deepened
reform, and comprehensively governed the country according to law.  -->

He administered the party's "four comprehensive" strategic layout.

<!--  adhering to the general tone of
seeking progress while maintaining stability, and comprehensively opening up a new situation in
the cause of the party and the country. In the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping made a comprehensive summary of the development of the
cause of the Party and the country since the 18th National Congress, which was summarized as
follows: "historic achievements" and "historic changes.” -->

<!-- What can be called historic achievements and historic transformations are extraordinary
achievements that are extremely far-reaching, extremely unusual and able to leave a mark on history.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, it is precisely such
achievements and changes that socialism with Chinese characteristics has presented a new historical
atmosphere. -->

In the 19th National Congress, Xi Jinping summarized the progress by China in the past 5 years:

1. major achievements in economic construction, 
2. major breakthroughs in comprehensively deepening reform,
3. major strides in the construction of democracy and rule of law,
4. major progress in ideological and cultural construction, 
5. continuous improvement of people's lives, 
6. remarkable results in the construction of ecological civilization, 
7. new progress in strengthening the army and rejuvenating the army, 
8. new progress in the work of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, 
9. a comprehensive diplomatic layout has been carried out in depth,
10. outstanding results have been achieved in comprehensively administering the party strictly. 

<!-- These major achievements cover reform, development, stability, internal and foreign affairs, national defense, and the management
of the party and the country, and the military. At the same time, these major achievements are
groundbreaking and have had and will continue to have a profound impact on China's social
development. For example, it creatively proposed to let the poor people and poor areas join the
whole country in a well-off society in all respects, adhere to targeted poverty alleviation and targeted
poverty alleviation, and launch an unprecedented anti-poverty struggle in human history, so that
more than 93 million poor people can be stably lifted out of poverty, and the problem of absolute
poverty that has plagued the Chinese nation for thousands of years is about to come to a historic end. -->

<!-- Another example is the creation of socialism with characteristics, which creatively proposes that
green waters and green mountains are gold and silver mountains, and promotes the dual promotion
of economic development and ecological protection. Another example is creatively proposing to
promote the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind and the construction of
the "Belt and Road", contributing Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to global governance. This
series of all-round and groundbreaking historical achievements has pushed China closer to the center
of the world stage than ever before, to the goal of realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation as never before, and to have unprecedented ability and confidence to achieve this goal.
Let's look at historic change. Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the CPC Central Committee
has put forward a series of new concepts, ideas, and strategies, introduced a series of major
principles and policies, introduced a series of major measures, promoted a series of major tasks,
solved many difficult problems that have been wanted to be solved for a long time but have not been
solved, accomplished many major things that were wanted to be done in the past but failed to
accomplish, and promoted historic changes in the cause of the party and the country. These historic
changes are profound and fundamental, and can only be achieved with extraordinary efforts and
extraordinary efforts. For example, in the face of the continuous downturn in the world economy
and the new situation of the "three-phase superposition" of the domestic economy, the Party Central
Committee made a major conclusion that China's economic development has entered the new
normal, put forward a new development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and
sharing, accelerated the improvement of the institutional mechanism that makes the market play a
decisive role in resource allocation and better play the role of the government, unswervingly
promotes supply-side structural reform, and promotes the construction of the "Belt and Road", the
coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the development of the Yangtze River
Economic Belt, the construction of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, the
integrated development of the Yangtze River Delta, Major strategies such as ecological protection
and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin have promoted profound changes in
development concepts and development methods. Another example is that in the face of the reform
period and the deep-water area, we resolutely promote the comprehensive deepening of reform,
wade into deep water, break through dangerous shoals, gnaw hard bones, and promote
breakthroughs in reform in important fields and key links with unusual intensity, breadth and depth.
Another example is to make a historic decision to comprehensively deepen the reform of national
defense and the armed forces in view of the many institutional obstacles and structural
contradictions existing in national defense and army building, as well as unhealthy tendencies and
corruption within the armed forces, persist in reforming and strengthening the armed forces, and
promote the revolutionary reshaping of the organizational structure and force system of the people's
army. In particular, in the face of the major risks and tests facing the party and the conspicuous
problems existing within the party, we should comprehensively strengthen the party's leadership and
party building, resolutely change the lax and soft situation of managing the party and the party,
eliminate serious hidden dangers within the party and the state with tenacious will and quality,
uphold discipline and fight corruption, eliminate serious hidden dangers within the party and the
state, update the weather in the party's political life, markedly improve the party's political ecology,
markedly enhance the party's creativity, cohesion, and combat effectiveness, consolidate the party's
unity and unity, markedly improve the relationship between the party and the masses, and become
stronger in the revolutionary forging, and so on.

The changes promoted by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core are of
pioneering significance in the history of the Party, the development of New China and the
development of the Chinese nation.

The historic achievements and changes since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party
of China have covered all aspects from productive forces to production relations, from the economic
base to the superstructure, promoted the realization of the historic development and historic leap of
society as a whole, greatly changed the face of the Communist Party of China, the country, the
people, the army, and the Chinese nation, and pushed socialism with Chinese characteristics into a
new historical stage.
