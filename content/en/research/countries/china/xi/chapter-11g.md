4. Actively promote innovation in social governance systems

To promote the innovation of social governance systems in the new era, mainly to strengthen the
construction of mechanisms for preventing and resolving social conflicts, the construction of social
security prevention and control systems, the construction of social psychological service systems,
and the construction of grassroots community governance systems, so as to provide strong
institutional guarantees for long-term social harmony and stability.

It is necessary to focus on correctly handling contradictions among the people, and through
innovation in various systems and mechanisms, properly resolve the reasonable and legitimate
interests of the masses, and resolve social contradictions at the grassroots level and in the bud. With
early detection, early prevention, and early disposal as the basic principles, use big data technology
and information technology to gradually improve the early warning mechanism for social
contradictions, improve the social stability risk assessment mechanism for major decision-making,
and prevent and reduce contradictions from the source. Improve diversified dispute resolution
mechanisms that are organically connected and coordinated with each other, such as mediation,
arbitration, administrative rulings, administrative reconsideration, and litigation, establish
standardized and sound rules and procedures for public participation, and mobilize the whole of
society to participate in the resolution of conflicts and disputes. Improve the level of legalization of
social governance, guide the people to resolve social conflicts and all kinds of disputes through legal
procedures and legal means, and promote the formation of a good environment for handling affairs
in accordance with the law, finding the law when encountered, solving problems and using the law,
and relying on the law to resolve contradictions.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Peace is the first need of the people after solving the problem of
food and clothing, which is an extremely important livelihood for the people and the most basic
development environment.1 It is necessary to firmly establish the concept of safe development, fully
understand the full connotation of life first and safety first, always put the safety of people's lives in
the first place, pay close attention to the establishment and improvement of the responsibility system
for safe production, and implement the "one-vote veto" of safe production and the risk of major
production safety accidents. Improve the public safety system, resolutely curb the frequent
occurrence of serious and extraordinarily serious safety accidents, and continuously improve the
disaster prevention, mitigation and relief capabilities of the whole society.

Deeply promote the comprehensive management of public security and ensure that the people live
and work in peace and contentment. Further improve the all-round and three-dimensional public
security prevention and control system, curb the high incidence of serious criminal offenses, and
protect people's personal rights, property rights, and personality rights. Crack down on and punish
pornography, gambling, drugs, criminal trafficking, and other illegal and criminal activities in
accordance with law, and truly protect the safety of the lives and property of the broad masses of
the people. Improve the system and mechanism for comprehensive management of social security,
and build a grassroots comprehensive service management platform. Implement a social stability
risk assessment system for major decision-making, improve comprehensive mechanisms for
investigation, early warning, mediation, and resolution of social conflicts, strengthen and improve
petitioning and mediation efforts, and effectively prevent and resolve conflicts and disputes.
Human society has entered the Internet era, and we must fully understand the great challenges and
opportunities brought by the development of the Internet to social governance. 

It is necessary to
improve the comprehensive governance capacity of the network, and form a comprehensive
governance bureau with the participation of multiple subjects such as party committee leadership,
government management, enterprise performance of responsibilities, social supervision, and self-
discipline of netizens, and a combination of economic, legal, technical and other means. Increase
the intensity of managing networks in accordance with law, accelerate the improvement of the
Internet management leadership system, and form a joint force for Internet management from
technology to content, from daily security to combating crime, to ensure the correct use and security
of networks. Give full play to the function of the Internet in reflecting public opinion, promptly
collect, absorb and utilize all kinds of constructive opinions, promptly clarify erroneous trends of
thought, and promptly channel and resolve emotional discussions.

The social mentality is a barometer of economic and social development. The 19th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen the
construction of the social psychological service system and cultivate a self-esteem, self-confidence,
rationality, peace and positive social mentality. To this end, it is necessary to further improve the
methods and methods of ideological and political work, and take humanistic care and psychological
counseling as the focus of institutional innovation. It is necessary to establish mechanisms for
psychological social guidance, strengthen education in social morality, professional ethics, family
virtues, and personal morality, punish untrustworthy, unethical and irregular conduct, guide people
to form a good trend of conscientiously performing legally-prescribed obligations, social
responsibilities, and family responsibilities, and form a clean and upright social atmosphere.
Gradually standardize the psychological impact assessment process in decision-making, improve
the mechanisms for policy release, interpretation, and guidance, accurately grasp the interests of
various social groups, and stabilize the psychological expectations of the people. It is necessary to
improve the social psychological counseling mechanism, strengthen the psychological counseling
of members of society, improve the psychological counseling network, guide people to correctly
treat themselves and others, groups and society, correctly treat difficulties, setbacks, gains and losses,
honors and disgraces, and organically combine personal value orientation with the needs of social
development. It is necessary to improve the social psychological service mechanism, improve the
early warning and handling mechanism for social psychological risks, and improve the ability of
social psychological crisis intervention and guidance.

Community is the basic framework of society and the cornerstone of social governance. Comrade
Xi Jinping pointed out that "the community is the 'last mile' for the Party and the government to
connect and serve the residents.‚Äù1 It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the community
governance system, promote the shift of the focus of social governance to the grassroots level, invest
human, material, financial and technological resources into the community, apply new methods and
means of social governance to the grassroots level, and lay a solid foundation for social order.
Improve the new pattern of grassroots social governance with grassroots party organizations as the
core and the participation of the whole society, and provide sound institutional guarantees for
community service management. Strengthen the normalization of urban management, strengthen
management services for the floating population, and use market-oriented and rule-of-law means to
promote the orderly flow of population. Continuously innovate the rural social governance system
and mechanism, take the initiative to resolve basic social contradictions in rural areas, learn and
promote the "Fengqiao experience", strive for "small things do not leave the village, major matters
do not leave the town, and contradictions are not handed over", focus on the source and guarantee
from the root, and finally achieve long-term social harmony and stability.
