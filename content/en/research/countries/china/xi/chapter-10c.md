3. Accelerate the construction of philosophy and social sciences with Chinese characteristics

Philosophy and social sciences are important tools for people to understand and transform the world,
and an important force for promoting historical development and social progress. Comrade Xi
Jinping profoundly pointed out that "a country without developed natural sciences cannot be at the
forefront of the world, and a country without prosperous philosophy and social sciences cannot be
in the forefront of the world.”1 In the new era, philosophy and social sciences play an irreplaceable
and important role in adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and building
a socialist cultural power, and it is of great significance to accelerate the construction of philosophy
and social sciences with Chinese characteristics.

Adhering to Marxism as the guide is the fundamental mark that distinguishes contemporary Chinese
philosophy and social science from other philosophy and social sciences. History and reality show
that Marxism is a scientific theory, which still has strong vitality and still occupies the commanding
height of truth and morality. Without Marxist guidance, China's philosophy and social sciences
would lose their soul and disorientation. To persist in taking Marxism as the guide, we must first
solve the problem of truly understanding true faith, and the core is to solve the problem of who is
who, and finally how to apply it. Philosophy and social science workers should consciously run
Marxism through the entire process of research and teaching and transform it into sober theoretical
consciousness, firm political conviction, and scientific thinking methods. It is necessary to focus on
the great practice of the people for academic creation, consciously closely link personal academic
pursuit with the development of the cause of the party and the country, adhere to the people-centered
research orientation, establish the ideal of learning for the people, promote academic progress in
serving the people, strive to produce more research results that can stand the test of practice, the
people and history, and constantly enhance the attractiveness, appeal, influence and vitality of
philosophy and social sciences. It is necessary to unify adherence to Marxism with the development
of Marxism, enhance awareness of problems, listen to the voice of the times, respond to the call of
the times, conscientiously study the major theoretical and practical problems facing China's
development and the party's ruling power, earnestly combine new practice with new practice, and
strive to use the developing theory to guide practice.

Accelerating the construction of philosophy and social science with Chinese characteristics is a
major task entrusted by the new era. In accordance with the idea of basing ourselves on China,
learning from foreign countries, excavating history, grasping the contemporary, caring for mankind
and facing the future, we should fully embody Chinese characteristics, Chinese style and Chinese
style in guiding ideology, discipline system, academic system, discourse system, etc., and strive to
build an all-round, all-field and all-element philosophy and social science system that meets the
requirements of the times and adapts to the development of practice. It is necessary to embody the
inheritance and national character, persist in using the past for the present and the foreign for the
Chinese, and be good at integrating the essence of Marxism, the excellent traditional Chinese culture,
and foreign philosophy and social sciences; persist in proceeding from China's reality, and strive to
put forward concepts, propositions, and plans that are based on China's standpoint, have Chinese
wisdom, and reflect Chinese values. It is necessary to reflect originality and the nature of the times,
take what we are doing as the center, and excavate new materials, discover new problems, put
forward new views, and construct new theories from the practice of reform and development. It is
necessary to embody the systematic and professional nature, and strive to make the basic disciplines
sound and solid, the advantages of key disciplines outstanding, the innovative development of
emerging disciplines and interdisciplinary disciplines, the inheritance of unpopular disciplines, the
complementarity of basic and applied research, and the mutual promotion of academic research and
the application of achievements; and improve philosophy and social sciences

The teaching material system actively promotes the construction of a discourse system with Chinese
style, public compatibility and integration between China and foreign countries, creates new
concepts, new categories and new expressions that are easy to be understood and accepted by the
international community, enhances China's cultural soft power, and enhances the international
influence of China's philosophy and social science research.
To build philosophy and social science with Chinese characteristics, we must grasp prosperity and
development with one hand and guide management with the other. Give full play to the important
role of philosophy and social sciences in governing the country, promote Marxist theoretical
research and construction projects, strengthen the construction of new think tanks with Chinese
characteristics, and focus on forward-looking, targeted and reserve policy research around the major
strategic needs of the country. Philosophy and social science workers should aspire to do university
questions and true learning, consciously practice the core socialist values, take seriously the social
effects of academic research, win respect with profound academic accomplishment, lead the
atmosphere with noble personality charm, and be pursuers and disseminators of truth, goodness and
beauty. It is necessary to further improve the overall management ability and service level of
scientific research, earnestly optimize the layout of scientific research and rationally allocate
resources, earnestly handle the relationship between input and efficiency, quantity and quality, scale
and structure, improve the management system and operation mechanism with good leadership,
orderly organization, strong guarantees, and fair evaluation of science and awards, and enhance the
vitality of the development of philosophy and social sciences.

4. Prosper and develop socialist literature and art

Literature and art are the clarion call for the advancement of the times, which can best represent the
style of an era and lead the atmosphere of an era. To realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation, we need a great spirit of perseverance and great works that inspire people's hearts. Comrade
Xi Jinping pointed out: "Socialist literature and art is the people's literature and art, and we must
adhere to the people-centered creative orientation, and carry out literary and artistic creation worthy
of the times in deep life and rooted in the people."1
The question of why people are the fundamental issue and principle for the prosperity and
development of socialist literature and art. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Socialist literature and
art, in essence, is the people's literature and art. "2 The people need literature and art, literature and
art need the people, the people are the source of literary and artistic creation, once they leave the
people, literature and art will become rootless duckweed, diseaseless moans, soulless shells.

The people are both the creators and witnesses of history, the "people in the play" of history, and
the "playwrights" of history. People's lives are an inexhaustible source of creation for all literature
and art, and the people's needs are the fundamental value of the existence of literature and art.
Adhering to the people-centered creative orientation means adhering to the fundamental direction
of serving the people and serving socialism, taking satisfying the people's spiritual and cultural
needs as the starting point and foothold of literary and artistic work, taking the people as the main
body of literary and artistic expression, taking the people as connoisseurs and judges of literary and
artistic aesthetics, serving the people as the duty of literary and artistic workers, and striving to
lyricize, lyricize and complain for the people.
Cang!: Producing excellent works is the central part of literary and artistic work. It is necessary to
adhere to the unity of profound thinking, exquisite art, and excellent production, strengthen the
creation of realistic themes, and continuously launch masterpieces that praise the party, the
motherland, the people, and heroes. It is necessary to run the spirit of innovation through the whole
process of literary and artistic creation, work hard to improve originality, and expand the theme,
content, form and technique, so as to make the works more exciting and fascinating, seeing both the
"plateau" and the "peak.” It is necessary to hold high the main theme of patriotism, use vivid literary
language and dazzling artistic images to stimulate every Chinese's sense of national pride and
national honor, and guide the people to establish a correct view of history, nationality, country, and
culture. It is necessary to write about the vigorous practice of reform, opening up, and socialist
modernization, and about the colorful China, progressive China, and united China, and encourage
the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country to march vigorously into the future. It is
necessary to take the spiritual height, cultural connotation and artistic value as the creative pursuit,
create and produce excellent works with muscle, morality and warmth with abundant passion, vivid
brushstrokes, beautiful melodies and touching images, create rich and diverse Chinese stories,
Chinese images and Chinese melodies, let the people's spiritual and cultural life continue to step to
a new level, contribute special sounds and colors to the world, and show special poetry and artistic
conception.

Strengthening the building of the contingent of literary and artistic personnel is the fundamental
guarantee for the prosperity and development of socialist literature and art. "Those who are not
virtuous cannot be far-reaching, and those who are not great cannot be knowledgeable." Literary
and artistic workers should regard advocating virtue and art as a lifelong lesson, unify being a person,
doing things, and practicing art, become practitioners of advanced culture and leaders of social
customs, and achieve self-achievement and realize value in standing up for the motherland and the
people. It is necessary to strengthen the construction of the literary and artistic contingent, create a
large number of famous masters of both virtue and art, and cultivate a large number of high-level
creative talents.

It is necessary to respect and follow the laws of literature and art, and respect the creative
individuality and creative labor of literary and artistic workers. It is necessary to earnestly strengthen
the work of literary and art criticism, advocate stressing taste, style, and responsibility, and resist
vulgarity, vulgarity, and kitsch.
