<!-- Section 3: firmly grasps the leadership of ideological work -->

Ideological work is an extremely important task of the party, a work that establishes the heart of the
country and the soul of the nation, has a bearing on the future and destiny of the party, on the long-
term peace and stability of the country, and on national cohesion and centripetal force. Comrade Xi
Jinping stressed: "We must firmly grasp the leadership, management and discourse power of
ideological work, and we must not leave it aside at any time, otherwise we will make irreparable
historical mistakes."1 Building a socialist ideology with strong cohesion and leading force is a major
proposition for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era,
and a major strategic task for smoothly promoting the development of the cause of the party and the
country in the new era.

1. Recognize the opportunities and challenges facing ideological work under the new situation

Since its founding, the Communist Party of China has attached great importance to ideological work,
and it is precisely by relying on strong ideological work that it has effectively ensured the smooth
progress of the cause of revolution, construction and reform. Since the 18th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core
has placed ideological work in a prominent position, and the degree of attention, the intensity of
work, and the obvious changes in results have been rare since the reform and opening up. It is
reflected in a series of major issues of direction, fundamental, and overall importance, adopted a
series of groundbreaking major measures, solved many difficult problems that have been wanted to
be solved for a long time but have not been solved, fundamentally reversed the passive situation that
once appeared in the ideological field, and brought about an overall and fundamental change in the
situation in the ideological field; effectively reversed some propaganda and ideological positions,
and the party's leadership was once neglected and weakened. The weakened situation has effectively
reversed the erosion of the dominant position of mainstream ideology, effectively reversed the
situation of passively coping with and ineffective counterattack against false reasoning and heresies,
and effectively reversed the chaos on the Internet.

Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the development of scientific
socialism in China has entered a new stage, and the consolidation and development of socialist
ideology are facing new historical opportunities. The extraordinary achievements of reform,
opening up and socialist modernization, the historic changes and achievements of the Party and the
country since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the strong vitality of
Marxism and socialism demonstrated by adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and the profound changes in favor of Marxism and socialism brought about by the
historical evolution of the two ideologies and two social systems in the world and the contest
between them, have brought bright prospects for the development of the Party, the country and the
nation. It also provides a broad space for the development of socialist ideology. In particular, the
formation and establishment of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a
New Era has profoundly answered the "questions of the times", "practical questions" and "people's
questions", deepened the understanding of the laws governing the Communist Party, socialist
construction and the development of human society with a new vision, won the broad recognition
of the people with its powerful practical and theoretical forces, and greatly enhanced the extensive
influence of the Chinese road, Chinese thought and Chinese ideas in today's world.

All these provide a solid theoretical, practical, material, and popular foundation for the development
of socialist ideology. The general trend of development in which the party, the state, and the nation
become stronger implies the inevitable trend of becoming ideologically stronger.
At the same time, we must also realize that under the complex and changeable international and
domestic situation, in the historical journey of realizing the "two centenary goals" and the Chinese
dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, consolidating the guiding position of Marxism
and consolidating the common ideological foundation of the whole party and the people of the whole
country in unity and struggle still face severe tests and great challenges. Contemporary China is in
the midst of profound economic and social changes, people's ideological diversity and changeable
characteristics are becoming increasingly obvious, the phenomenon of different ideological and
cultural exchanges and confrontation is still very prominent, Western constitutional democracy,
universal values, neoliberalism, historical nihilism and other ideological trends strive to compete
for ideological discourse power, challenge China's political system and development path of
historical choice and theoretical foundation, unify thinking and gather strength The task of unifying
thinking and rallying forces is unprecedentedly arduous. Contemporary China is superimposed on
the profound changes in the political and economic pattern of the world today, and the great changes
unprecedented in a century, and the contest of cultural soft power is more prominent. Different
ideologies are not only the reflection of different social paths and social systems, but also the
ideological basis that supports the rationality of different social paths and social systems. The
contradiction between the two roads and systems of capitalism and socialism is a structural
contradiction that will accompany the whole process of China's comprehensive construction of a
modern and powerful socialist country, and the struggle between the two roads and systems will
inevitably be protracted, complex and acute. The hostile forces regard the development and growth
of socialist China as a challenge to the capitalist road and system, constantly change their tactics
and methods to implement Westernization and differentiation schemes, intensify political
misdirection, strategic containment, and all-round pressure on China, and intensify their efforts to
smear China's path, theory, system, and culture. It is necessary to maintain a clear understanding
and be mentally prepared and prepared to deal with risks and challenges in a lasting manner.

2. Build a socialist ideology with strong cohesion and leading force

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that building a socialist ideology with strong cohesion and leading
force is a strategic task that the whole party, especially the propaganda and ideological front, must
undertake. He emphasized: "Ideology determines the direction of cultural progress and development
path.

It is necessary to promote the Sinicization of Marxism and popularize it, build a socialist ideology
with strong cohesion and leading force, and closely unite all the people in ideals, beliefs, values and
moral concepts.1 "The hearts of the people are united, and Tarzan moves." "Great ideological and
political unity has always been our party's magic weapon for victory, and the first thing we must
pass over to climb the hill and overcome difficulties is the ideological will pass, and only with one
heart and one mind can we form an invincible and powerful force." 

Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly stressed that "as long as we are closely united, work as one, and strive for the realization of our common dream, the power to realize our dream will be incomparably strong.‚Äù2 To carry out
the great struggle with many new historical characteristics, grasp and make good use of the period
of historical opportunity, and effectively deal with various risks and challenges, it is urgent to
accelerate the construction of a socialist ideology with strong cohesion and leading force, form a
vivid situation in which the heart thinks in one place and works hard in one place, and gathers the
unified will and action force of one heart and one direction to overcome difficulties to ensure the
smooth advancement of the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Building a socialist ideology with strong cohesion and leading force has rich and profound
connotations, and there are two basic levels.

First, we want to build a socialist ideology, not any other ideology. This is a major issue that
embodies the nature of the party and the state and stipulates the basic orientation of ideological work.
Therefore, we must adhere to the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era, persist in not forgetting our original intention, keep our mission in
mind, strengthen the "four consciousnesses", strengthen the "four self-confidences", and achieve the
"two safeguards", constantly consolidate the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field,
and consolidate the common ideological foundation of the whole party and the people of all ethnic
groups in the country to unite and struggle.

Second, on the premise of adhering to the basic direction of socialist ideology, further enhance
cohesion and leadership. This is a focal point for basing ourselves on the new era and new mission
and giving play to the important role of ideological work. We must maintain a clear stand of the
people, represent the fundamental interests of the masses, conform to the aspiration and value
pursuit of the broadest masses of the people for a better life, grasp the greatest common divisor,
draw concentric circles of the people, and promote the close unity of all the people in ideals, beliefs,
values and moral concepts, and advance in unity towards the goal of struggle set by the Party Central
Committee;

It is necessary to pay attention to keeping up with the pace of development of the times and practice,
conform to the requirements of the times, lead the trend, keep pace with the times, keep the right
and make innovations, and firmly grasp the leadership, dominance, and discourse power of socialist
ideological work.

The basic orientation of socialist ideology and the basic requirements for strengthening cohesion
and leading force are intrinsically unified and interconnected, and the basic observance of
strengthening ideological work at a new historical starting point has been clarified. Building a
socialist ideology with strong cohesion and leading force is a complex process advancing from many
aspects, and we must base ourselves on the present and focus on the long term, pay attention to
grasping important aspects that have a bearing on the overall situation, grasp well the important
work with the significance of "four beams and eight pillars", and constantly make new
breakthroughs and new progress.
