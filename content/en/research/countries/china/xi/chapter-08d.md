3. the way of supply-side structural reform is to increase effective supply

The way of supply-side structural reform is mainly to increase the supply of effective systems,
increase the supply of effective technology, and increase the supply of high-quality products.
First, deepen the reform of the market economy system and increase the supply of effective systems.
Entering the new normal, whether China's economy has vitality and momentum, the key lies in the
market players. To stimulate the vitality of market entities, the key is to deepen reform, clearly
define the boundary between the government and the market, and change the adjustment of the
economic structure from government-led to market-led. It is necessary to give full play to the
decisive role of the market in the allocation of resources, give better play to the role of the
government, straighten out the relationship between the government and enterprises, the relationship
between the government and society, and release the vitality of economic subjects. To deepen
supply-side structural reform, we must focus on deepening economic structural reform by improving
the property rights system and market-oriented configuration of factors, and resolutely break down
the institutional obstacles that restrict the vitality and momentum of development. First, adhere to
and improve the basic economic system. We must unswervingly consolidate and develop the public-
owned economy, unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public-
owned economy, adhere to the principle of distribution according to work as the main body and the
coexistence of multiple distribution methods, accelerate the improvement of the socialist market
economic system, improve the scientific and technological innovation system and mechanism, and
build a new system of a higher-level open economy. In accordance with the spirit of the "Opinions
of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on Accelerating the Improvement of the
Socialist Market Economy System in the New Era", comprehensively improve the basic systems of
market economy such as property rights, market access, and fair competition. The second is to
deepen the reform of "decentralization, management and service" and promote the reduction of
institutional transaction costs. Further reduce the negative list of market quasi-persons, and promote
the universal implementation of "non-prohibited access.” The government should minimize the
direct allocation of market resources and direct intervention in microeconomic activities, strengthen
supervision during and after the event, accelerate the reform of factor marketization and the
formation of a competitive market system.

Let the market regulate everything that the market can regulate independently, and let the enterprise
do what it can do. The third is to innovate and improve macroeconomic regulation and control, give
play to the strategic guiding role of the national development plan, improve the coordination
mechanism of fiscal, monetary, industrial, regional, consumption, investment and other economic
policies, accelerate the establishment of a modern fiscal system, deepen the reform of the financial
system, reform and improve the basic system of the capital market, and promote the healthy and
stable development of the multi-level capital market.

Second, improve total factor productivity through scientific and technological innovation and
increase effective technology supply. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
clearly pointed out that "we must adhere to quality first, benefit first, take supply-side structural
reform as the main line, promote the quality change, efficiency change, power change of economic
development, and improve total factor productivity.”1 The so-called "total factor productivity", often
referred to as the rate of technological progress, is a measure of the contribution of technological
progress to economic growth. From the perspective of the imbalance, uncoordination and
unsustainability faced by China's economic development, based on the realization of the
transformation of economic growth power, it is necessary to adhere to innovation to lead
development, cultivate and expand new momentum, and strive to improve total factor productivity.
The innovation practice of various countries shows that enterprises are the main body of innovation
and the most active innovation unit, and the government needs to provide a good institutional
environment for enterprises to engage in innovation activities. To deepen supply-side structural
reform, we must increase effective technology supply through scientific and technological
innovation. First, it is necessary to increase the support for basic research and applied basic research,
strengthen original innovation, and strengthen the research of key core technologies; second,
promote the reform of the scientific and technological system and accelerate the transformation of
scientific and technological achievements into real productive forces; third, improve the integrated
innovation mechanism of production, education and research with enterprises as the main body;
fourth, improve the venture capital system and give play to the supporting role of finance in high-
tech industries and technological innovation; fifth, strengthen the protection of intellectual property
rights and improve relevant laws and regulations. Promote industrial upgrading through the
improvement of independent innovation capabilities, and give play to the leading and supporting
role of innovation driving in improving the quality and efficiency of enterprise supply.
Third, while moderately expanding aggregate demand, increase the supply of high-quality products.
Comrade Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out: "Supply and demand are the two basic aspects of the
internal relationship of the market economy, and they are both antagonistic and unified dialectical
relations

Without demand, supply cannot be realized, new demand can give birth to new supply; without
supply, demand cannot be satisfied, and new supply can create new demand. 1 Therefore,
emphasizing the adjustment of the supply structure does not mean ignoring demand. On the contrary,
the next stage of supply structure adjustment must be carried out around the transformation and
upgrading of consumer demand. Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, China has bid
farewell to the shortage economy, a new round of upgrading and transformation of the consumption
structure of residents, more to "personalized and diversified" consumption, and China's economy
has entered a consumption-oriented era. How to meet the needs of the people for a better life has
become a new space for economic development. It is necessary to promote the formation of a strong
domestic market and continue to release the potential of domestic demand. Give full play to the
basic role of consumption and the key role of investment, stabilize effective domestic demand, and
provide strong support for the smooth operation of the economy. It is necessary to strive to meet the
final demand, improve product quality, accelerate the development of service industries such as
education, childcare, pension, medical care, culture, and tourism, improve the consumption
environment, and enhance consumption capacity. In China's economic structure, investment still
has a lot of room for development. From the perspective of supply-side structural reform, the focus
of expanding investment is to increase infrastructure construction in emerging fields such as
artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, and increase intercity transportation, logistics,
municipal infrastructure, and rural infrastructure construction.
Section 3: Promoting high-quality economic development
The fundamental purpose of adapting to and leading the new normal of economic development is
to strive to achieve high-quality economic development. This has become the fundamental
requirement for determining development ideas, formulating economic policies, and implementing
macroeconomic regulation and control at present and for some time to come.

1. China's economy has shifted from a stage of high-speed growth to a stage of high-quality development

Practice is developing and awareness is increasing. On the basis of adhering to adapting to and
leading the new normal of economic development, the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China further clearly pointed out:

"China's economy has shifted from a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage",1
which is the basic feature of China's economic development at this stage. Shifting from a high-speed
growth stage to a high-quality development stage means that the growth rate will shift from the
original high-speed growth to medium-high-speed growth, which means that economic
development is in a critical period of transforming the development mode, optimizing the economic
structure, and transforming the growth momentum. This is highly consistent with the four basic
characteristics of the new normal of economic development, and is a deepening of the new normal
of economic development.

China's economy has shifted from a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage,
which is an important judgment made by the Party Central Committee in accordance with changes
in the international and domestic environment, especially changes in China's development
conditions and development stages. "From" means that the historical curtain has been opened from
the stage of high-speed growth to the stage of high-quality development, and it is inevitable;
"turning" means that China's economy is only marching towards high-quality development, and has
not "turned" to the stage of high-quality development. In a country with a huge economy and
population, it is not easy to shift from a high-speed growth stage to a high-quality development stage,
and it may be a long historical stage. In this process, our economy faces two types of thresholds.
One is the unconventional threshold unique to China's economic development at this stage, for
which it is necessary to fight the three major battles of preventing and resolving major risks, precise
poverty alleviation, and pollution prevention and control; the other is a conventional long-term
threshold, that is, transforming the mode of economic development, optimizing the economic
structure, and transforming the growth momentum, so it is necessary to build a modern economic
system. Only by crossing these two types of thresholds can China's economy truly achieve high-
quality development.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that promoting high-quality development "is an inevitable
requirement for maintaining sustained and healthy economic development", "this is an inevitable
requirement for adapting to the changes in the main contradictions in our society and
comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society and building a modern socialist country
in an all-round way", and "this is an inevitable requirement for development in accordance with
economic laws."2 From the perspective of economic development needs, China is currently in a
period of transformation of economic development mode, the demographic dividend has plummeted,
the marginal return on investment has declined, the resource and environmental constraints have
increased, and the traditional extensive economic development mode of unilaterally pursuing scale
and speed is no longer sustainable. Only by promoting high-quality development and forming a
high-quality, efficient and diversified supply system can we achieve a balance between supply and
demand at a new level and achieve sustained and healthy economic development

From the perspective of the main contradiction in society, the contradiction between the people's
growing need for a better life and unbalanced and inadequate development has become the main
contradiction in society, and the focus of the people's needs has shifted from "whether it is good or
not" to "whether it is good or not.” Whether it is to meet the needs of the people for a better life or
to solve the problem of unbalanced and insufficient development, it is necessary to pay more
attention to the quality of economic development. Judging from the requirements of building a
modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round way, the 19th CPC National Congress planned
the strategic goal of "two steps." To realize socialist modernization, the economy is the foundation,
the country must be strong, the economy must be strong; the economy must be strong, scale is the
foundation, and quality is the key. Today's world is ushering in a new round of industrial revolution
and technological revolution, scientific and technological strength, innovation ability, human capital,
etc. have become the focus of international competition, scale alone can no longer win in
international competition, must turn to high-quality development. From the perspective of the law
of economic development, economic development is a non-linear spiral upward process, the
accumulation of quantity to a certain stage must be turned to quality improvement, China's economic
development should also follow this law. In 2019, China's total economic volume has reached 99
trillion yuan, ranking second in the world. We must attach importance to quantitative development,
and even more to solving qualitative problems, and put the main energy on promoting high-quality
development.
