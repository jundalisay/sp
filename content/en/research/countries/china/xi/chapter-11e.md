3. resolutely win the battle against poverty

Poverty has been with human beings since its birth and is a persistent disease of human society.
Getting rid of poverty and moving towards material abundance is the good aspiration of human
society, and it is also the proper meaning of improving and developing the socialist system with
Chinese characteristics. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Eliminating poverty, improving people's
livelihood and achieving common prosperity are the essential requirements of socialism. " 1
According to international poverty alleviation standards, since 1978, China has reduced poverty by
780 million people, and the number of people lifted out of poverty exceeds the combined population
of the world's most populous countries, the United States, Russia, Japan and Germany, and the
country with the largest poverty reduction population in the world, contributing more than 70% to
world poverty reduction. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China
has made decisive achievements in poverty alleviation, the number of poor people has been reduced
from 98.99 million at the end of 2012 to 5.51 million at the end of 2019, the incidence of poverty
has dropped from 10.2% to 0.6%, and the poverty reduction has been reduced by more than 10
million people every year for seven consecutive years, and the overall regional poverty has been
basically solved.

In long-term practice, China's poverty alleviation work is based on rapid economic development,
with enhancing the intrinsic development capacity of poverty alleviation targets as the fundamental
way, both government-led and social assistance, more actively mobilizing and giving play to the
main role of the poor population, implementing inclusive policies and preferential policies, linking
long-term poverty alleviation planning with poverty alleviation, and achieving precise poverty
alleviation through targeted poverty alleviation, forming a poverty alleviation model with Chinese
characteristics. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, poverty
alleviation has provided Chinese experience and Chinese solutions for poverty alleviation around
the world, and has made significant contributions to the development and progress of human society.

And it has become an important part of the social development path with Chinese characteristics.
Allowing the poor people and impoverished areas to join the rest of the country in entering a
moderately prosperous society in all respects is our party's solemn commitment, and it is also China's
solemn commitment to the development and progress of the entire human society. Poverty
alleviation has entered the sprint period of tackling tough problems, with tight time and heavy tasks.
By 2020, the rural poor will be able to have no worries about food and clothing, and ensure
compulsory education, basic medical care and housing safety. The per capita disposable income of
farmers in poverty-stricken areas has increased higher than the national average, and the indicators
in the main areas of basic public services are close to the national average. Ensure that the rural poor
under China's current standards can be lifted out of poverty, remove all poor counties, and solve
regional overall poverty. In the end, this battle must be fought well so that the building of a
moderately prosperous society in an all-round way will be recognized by the people and can
withstand the test of history.

The focus of poverty alleviation is to get rid of real poverty. It is necessary to further improve the
poverty alleviation system, mobilize the whole party and the whole society to adhere to targeted
poverty alleviation and poverty alleviation, strengthen the responsibility system of the number one
party and government leader with overall responsibility, adhere to the pattern of large-scale poverty
alleviation, give full play to the institutional advantages of concentrating forces to do great things,
and focus on overcoming the task of poverty alleviation in deeply impoverished areas. The further
the future poverty alleviation, the more difficult it will be, because most of the remaining poverty
alleviation targets are areas and people with poor conditions, weak foundations, and deep poverty
levels, and they are all "hard bones" that need to be solved vigorously. According to the different
situations of poor households, we must identify the root causes, make precise efforts, and work for
a long time to ensure that no one is left behind on the road to poverty alleviation.
The goal of poverty alleviation is to truly get rid of poverty. To truly alleviate poverty, we must
solve the problem of endogenous driving force of development in poor areas and the problem of
poor people returning to poverty after being lifted out of poverty, that is, we must not only improve
the "blood transfusion" mechanism, but also form a "hematopoietic" mechanism. Since the 18th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has put forward the idea
of "social policies should be underpinned" to help low-income groups not only survive, but also
have development opportunities and realize the organic combination of blood transfusion
mechanism and hematopoietic mechanism. In terms of basic survival, the main thing is to build a
"bottom-up" social safety net to ensure that "no one can be left behind on the road to moderate
prosperity.‚Äù At the same time, poverty alleviation should be organically combined with support for
aspirations and wisdom, not only through the development of characteristic industries, but also
through ecological migration, as well as education poverty alleviation, medical poverty alleviation,
financial poverty alleviation and social security poverty alleviation.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Poverty alleviation is not the end, but the beginning of a new life
and a new struggle. "1 On the basis of resolutely winning the battle against poverty, it is necessary
to continue to promote the effective connection between comprehensive poverty alleviation and
rural revitalization, promote the smooth transformation of poverty reduction strategies and work
systems, integrate them into the rural revitalization strategy, establish an institutional mechanism
that combines long and short and cures both symptoms and root causes, stimulate the endogenous
driving force for the development of low-income populations in underdeveloped areas and rural
areas, implement precise assistance, and gradually achieve common prosperity.
Section 3: Strengthen and innovate social governance
Social governance is an important task of social construction. In the new era of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, it is necessary to adapt to the new situation and new challenges facing
economic and social development, adhere to the problem-oriented, strengthen and innovate social
governance, create a social governance pattern of joint construction, co-governance and sharing,
take the road of socialist social governance with Chinese characteristics, and ensure that the people
live and work in peace and contentment, social stability and order, and the country's long-term peace
and stability.

1. From "social management" to "social governance"

Social management is an indispensable management activity in human society. In order to form and
maintain a certain social order, it is necessary to have a certain form of social management. In
modern society, the role of social management is becoming increasingly important. In a country like
ours with a population of 1.4 billion and an accelerated economic and social transformation, the task
of social management is particularly arduous and arduous. The fundamental purpose of
strengthening and innovating social governance is to maintain social order, promote social harmony,
ensure that people live and work in peace and contentment, and create a stable and safe development
environment.

Since the founding of New China, the party and the state have always attached great importance to
social management, carried out long-term exploration and practice in the formation and
development of a social management system suited to China's national conditions, made major
achievements, and accumulated valuable experience.

Especially since the reform and opening up, we have continuously promoted the reform and
innovation of social management in line with the increasingly diversified development of social and
economic components, organizational forms, employment methods, interest relations and
distribution methods. From the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee proposing
to strengthen the government's social management functions, to the Fourth Plenary Session of the
16th CPC Central Committee proposing to strengthen social construction and management, to the
Sixth Plenary Session of the 16th CPC Central Committee emphasizing the innovation of the social
management system and integrating social management resources, and then to the 17th CPC
National Congress emphasizing the improvement of the social management pattern and the
grassroots social management system, the CPC's understanding of social management has been
continuously deepened. In the long-term exploration and practice, China has established a leadership
system for social management work, built a network of social management organizations,
formulated basic laws and regulations on social management, and continuously promoted the
adaptation of social management to China's national conditions and socialist system.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has deeply studied the new situation, new tasks and new
characteristics facing social management, focused on promoting innovation in social management
concepts, practices and systems, and clearly put forward the major proposition of "social
governance.‚Äù From "social management" to "social governance", although it is a word difference, it
is a comprehensive improvement of the party's ruling philosophy and policy ideas in the social field,
reflecting systematic governance, legal governance, source governance, comprehensive policies,
and the deepening of the party's understanding of the laws of social operation and governance.
To adapt to the change of "social governance", efforts need to be made from many aspects. In terms
of action concept, it is necessary to realize the transformation from management to service, all social
management departments are departments that serve the masses, and all social management work is
work for the interests of the masses; in terms of action subjects, it is necessary to shift from the
unified management system of the government in the past to a diversified and collaborative
governance system between the government and various social subjects, and promote the benign
interaction between government governance and social self-regulation and residents' autonomy; in
the orientation of action, it is necessary to shift from control and regulation to rule of law guarantees,
comply with the requirements of comprehensive rule of law, and take the spirit of rule of law as the
guide. Use legal means to solve difficult problems, and promote the construction of a rule-of-law
society with the rule of law in social governance.
Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that "social governance is a science.‚Äù 1 The key here is to
correctly handle some basic relationships in the process of social governance. First, properly handle
the relationship between maintaining stability and safeguarding rights.

Rights protection is the foundation of stability maintenance, and the essence of stability maintenance
is rights protection. It is necessary to properly resolve the reasonable and legitimate interests of the
broad masses of the people, so that the masses of the people sincerely feel that their rights and
interests are treated fairly and their interests are effectively safeguarded. Second, properly handle
the relationship between social vitality and social order. Social development needs to be dynamic,
but that dynamism must be orderly. It is necessary to pay attention to channeling and defusing,
flexible stability maintenance, mobilize the whole society to jointly do a good job in maintaining
social stability, and achieve a relative balance between social order and social vitality at a higher
level. Third, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between rule of law and rule of ethics,
autonomy. Law is written morality, and morality is the law of the heart. In the process of grassroots
autonomy, it is necessary to attach importance to the normative role of morality in citizens' behavior,
take the law as the benchmark, give full play to the normative role of township rules and people's
covenants, citizens' conventions, etc., so as to ensure that the enjoyment of rights and the
performance of obligations are consistent, and finally realize the benign interaction between the 3 and promote each other.
