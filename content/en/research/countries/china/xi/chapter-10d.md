5. Promote the development of cultural undertakings and cultural industries

The development of cultural undertakings and cultural industries is an inevitable requirement for
enriching the people's spiritual and cultural life and ensuring the people's cultural rights and interests,
and is also the proper meaning of stimulating the vitality of the whole nation's cultural innovation
and creativity and promoting cultural prosperity. The report of the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China stressed that "to meet the people's new expectations for a better life, we
must provide rich spiritual food" and made major arrangements for promoting the development of
cultural undertakings and cultural industries. This fully embodies our party's people-centered
development thinking, and is of great significance for achieving cultural development relying on the
people, cultural development for the people, sharing the fruits of cultural development by the people,
and improving cultural guidance, creativity and competitiveness.

- Cultural undertakings and cultural industries constitute the two wings of national cultural work.
Cultural undertakings are of a public interest and public nature, and cultural undertakings mainly
produce public cultural products, taking the needs of the state as the transfer, and focusing on
meeting the basic cultural needs of the broad masses of the people. The cultural industry sector
mainly produces cultural commodities, takes market needs as the transfer, and focuses on meeting
the diverse cultural needs of the broad masses of the people. Cultural undertakings and cultural
industries must insist on putting social benefits in the first place. Cultural undertakings put social
benefits in the first place, which is determined by their nature and tasks. Similarly, the cultural
industry must adhere to the organic integration of social and economic benefits, always give priority
to social benefits, and never allow economic benefits to be satisfied at the expense of social benefits.
Both cultural undertakings and cultural industries should be integrated into the socialist core value
system and sing the main melody. The state implements differentiated management and regulation
according to the distinction between cultural undertakings and cultural industries, and may directly
regulate cultural institutions, requiring them to produce what kind of cultural products and what
kind of cultural services they provide to the public; for cultural enterprise units, generally speaking,
they mainly guide the development of cultural industries through indirect regulation and control
such as laws, tax policies, and price levers.

Make overall plans for the development of cultural undertakings and cultural industries.

Cultural undertakings and cultural industries should not be abandoned, we must adhere to the new
development concept of innovation, coordination, green, openness and sharing, promote supply-
side structural reform in the cultural field, continuously develop and expand the cultural industry
while comprehensively prospering cultural undertakings, and jointly strive to build a socialist
cultural power. It is necessary to place the development of cultural undertakings and cultural
industries in an equally important position, make overall plans for the construction of a public
cultural service system and a modern cultural industry system, make overall plans to meet the basic
cultural needs and diversified cultural needs of the people, take into account the requirements of
public welfare and market, comprehensively consider the balance between economic and social
benefits, and plan and coordinate the construction of a public cultural service system covering the
whole society and the promotion of cultural industries as pillar industries of the national economy.
Deepen the reform of the cultural system and build a mechanism for the coordinated development
of cultural undertakings and cultural industries. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, as an important part of comprehensively deepening reform, the reform of the cultural
system has been steadily and steadily expanded, the important basic institutional framework in the
cultural field has been basically established, substantive breakthroughs have been made in key and
difficult reform tasks, the system of cultural policies and regulations has been continuously
improved, and the vitality of the development of cultural undertakings and cultural industries has
been significantly enhanced. The reform of the cultural system is always on the road, and we must
adhere to the correct direction of reform, improve the thinking of reform, grasp the key and difficult
points, innovate reform measures, and unswervingly deepen the reform of the cultural system. It
should be further recognized that the reform of the cultural system involves both the economic
foundation and the superstructure, and must conform to the requirements of the development of the
socialist market economy and follow the law of socialist spiritual civilization construction.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly handle the general and special requirements of reform, while
actively learning from the reform experience in other fields and linking it with the reform of all
aspects, pay attention to reflecting the requirements of cultural exceptions, focus on strengthening
institutional innovation, improve the cultural management system, and accelerate the construction
of an institutional mechanism that puts social benefits in the first place and integrates social benefits
with economic benefits.

6. Promote the creative transformation and innovative development of China's excellent traditional culture

The excellent traditional Chinese culture is the root and soul of the Chinese nation and the fertile
cultural soil for socialism with Chinese characteristics. The Communist Party of China is the faithful
inheritor and propagator of China's excellent traditional culture, and it is the cultural mission of the
new era to promote the creative transformation and innovative development of China's excellent
traditional culture. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that it is necessary to treat traditional culture with
an objective, scientific and respectful attitude.

Objectivity means to realize that the essence and dregs in traditional culture are mixed, positive and
negative coexist, not retro mud antiquity, do not copy and copy, do not simply deny, adhere to a
comprehensive, historical and dialectical view of traditional culture, scientifically distinguish the
essence of the waste, distinguish between advantages and disadvantages, both look at the historical
role and analyze from the present, to figure out which should be preserved and inherited, and which
must be transformed, adjusted or even abandoned. Science means respecting the law of cultural
development, making correct trade-offs in combination with the requirements of the new era and
practice, promoting the abandonment and inheritance of traditional culture, transforming and
innovating, enriching and reengineering, drawing on and absorbing beneficial cultural components,
giving new connotations of the era and modern forms of expression, activating its vitality, enhancing
its influence and appeal, and better being taken by today's people and used for development. Respect
means to adhere to the position of Chinese culture, strengthen cultural self-confidence, enhance
cultural consciousness, respect and cherish the excellent spiritual and cultural wealth created by our
ancestors, tap and carry forward the contemporary value of China's excellent traditional culture,
resolutely resist extreme trends of thought such as nihilism that ignores historical and cultural
traditions and revivalism that only supremacizes tradition, and resolutely safeguard the national
nature and uniqueness of Chinese culture. In this way, we can better inherit the Chinese cultural
genes, innovate, develop and make breakthroughs, and continuously promote the excellent
traditional Chinese culture to carry forward and carry forward the future.
To adhere to the creative transformation and innovative development of China's excellent traditional
culture, we must promote the integration of traditional culture and modern society, so that China's
excellent traditional culture can "live" in the present. The excellent traditional Chinese culture is a
complete and independent ideological and cultural system, which has formed a unique style in the
rise and fall of thousands of years. If it is not well integrated with modern society, it will not be
possible to have vigorous vitality. It is necessary to strengthen research and interpretation work,
deeply excavate and explain the contemporary value of China's excellent traditional culture, and
create more excellent works that embody the essence of China's excellent traditional culture and
disseminate contemporary Chinese values. Strengthen the protection and utilization of cultural relics
and the protection and inheritance of cultural heritage, embark on a road of protection and utilization
of cultural relics that conforms to national conditions, and let Chinese culture show its permanent
charm and the style of the times. Adapt to the development trend of new media and new technologies,
promote the integration of Chinese excellent traditional culture with new media and new
technologies, make it a modern "living water", continuously integrate into people's production and
life, and bloom more dazzling in the soil of the new era.
To promote the creative transformation and innovative development of China's excellent traditional
culture, it is necessary to carry forward the spirit of inclusiveness and inclusiveness, and enrich and
develop Chinese culture while constantly absorbing the nutrients of various civilizations.

Building a high level of cultural self-confidence does not mean engaging in self-isolation or even
solipsism. If a culture does not interact with foreign cultures and learn from each other, it is easy to
lose vitality and easily break away from the trend of world cultural development. The Chinese nation
is a nation that adheres to the concept of "new every day, new every day, and new every day", and
constantly creates and innovates. In order for China's excellent traditional culture to show new
vitality, it is necessary to learn from the beneficial elements of foreign culture, including Western
culture, with a broad mind. It is necessary to integrate excellent foreign culture with China's
traditional culture, integrate the elements of Chinese culture, and brand it with Chinese culture;
integrate it with China's actual needs to solve China's practical problems and serve the production
and life practices of the Chinese people; integrate it with the acceptance habits of the Chinese people,
and create an expression form suitable for the Chinese people's way of thinking and aesthetic taste,
so as to be popular with the Chinese people. At the same time, it is necessary to extract and display
the spiritual symbols of excellent traditional culture, extract and display the cultural essence of
excellent traditional culture with contemporary value and world significance, and profoundly reveal
the ideological concepts, humanistic spirit and moral norms contained in China's excellent
traditional culture. It is necessary to pay attention to displaying the development and progress of
contemporary China and the wonderful life of contemporary Chinese, promote the value concepts,
literary and artistic masterpieces, and cultural achievements that reflect the development and
progress of contemporary China to go overseas, and further enhance cultural soft power.
