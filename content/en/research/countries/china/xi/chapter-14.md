Chapter XIV: Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, faced with the new situation
that the world is undergoing major changes unprecedented in a century, and with China approaching
the center of the world stage as never before, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping
as the core has conformed to the trend of the times, based on China's reality, effectively coped with
the changing international situation, won many big battles, accomplished many major and difficult
things, and blazed a new path of major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics. In the
process of guiding practice innovation, Comrade Xi Jinping insisted on using Marxist positions and
views, closely centering on the general goal of promoting the construction of a new type of
international relations and promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for
mankind, which is a major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and put forward a series
of new concepts, propositions and initiatives with Chinese characteristics, embodying the spirit of
the times and leading the trend of human development and progress, forming Xi Jinping Diplomatic
Thought. Xi Jinping Diplomatic Thought is an important part of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, and is the fundamental compliance and action guide for
China's foreign affairs work in the new era.

Section 1: China's Plan for Human Development and the
Future of the World

Today's world is in a period of great development, great change and great adjustment, and peace
and development are still the main themes of the times. World multipolarization, economic
globalization, social informatization and cultural diversification have developed in depth, the reform
of the global governance system and international order has accelerated, countries are increasingly
interconnected and interdependent, the balance of international power is becoming more balanced,
and the general trend of peaceful development is irreversible. At the same time, the world is facing
outstanding instability and uncertainty, deep-seated contradictions in global development are sharp,
hegemonism and power politics still exist, protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise, regional
hotspot issues are emerging one after another, traditional and non-traditional security issues are
complex and intertwined, and the international community is facing a governance deficit, trust
deficit, peace deficit, and Four major challenges to the development deficit.

What is wrong with the world? What should we do? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or
closure; mutual benefit or zero-sum game? The Communist Party of China has not only sought
happiness for the Chinese of the people but also struggled for the cause of human progress, and has
made its own unique answers to these questions concerning the future and destiny of mankind.
Concentrated on one point, it is the major strategic thinking of "building a community with a shared
future for mankind" put forward by Comrade Xi Jinping. This major strategic thinking shows
China's good image as a world peace builder, a contributor to global development and a defender of
international order, points out the right direction for promoting the improvement of global
governance and building a better world, and becomes a clear banner for China to lead the trend of
the times and the direction of human civilization progress.
1. build a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity,
openness, inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty
The concept of "building a community with a shared future for mankind" demonstrates Comrade Xi
Jinping's responsibility as a world-class leader. In March 2013, he delivered a speech at the Moscow
Institute of International Relations, in which he clearly put forward the idea of "you have me and I
have your community of common destiny.” In September 2015, when attending the general debate
of the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly, he made the first comprehensive and
systematic exposition of the idea of a community with a shared future for mankind. In December
2017, in his keynote speech at the high-level dialogue between the Communist Party of China and
political parties around the world, Comrade Xi Jinping once again gave a profound explanation,
pointing out: "A community with a shared future for mankind, as the name implies. That is, the
future and destiny of every nation and country are closely linked, and we should share hardships
and hardships, share glory and disgrace, and strive to build the planet where we were born and grew
up in Sri Lanka into a big harmonious family, and turn the aspirations of the people of the world for
a better life into reality. 1 In March 2020, he pointed out in a telephone conversation with UN
Secretary-General António Guterres: "The outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic once
again shows that mankind is a community with a shared future"

"The international community must establish a sense of a community with a shared future for
mankind, watch over each other, work together to cope with risks and challenges, and jointly build
a better home for the earth."1 In May 2020, in his speech at the opening ceremony of the 73rd World
Health Assembly video conference, Comrade Xi Jinping put forward the initiative of "unity and
cooperation to overcome the epidemic and jointly build a human health community.”
The idea of a community with a shared future for mankind is extremely rich and profound, and its
core is what the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out:
"Build a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness,
cleanliness and beauty."2 The proposal of this initiative has undoubtedly pointed out the direction
and realistic path of common development, common progress, common security and common
prosperity for the international relations that are in confusion in the world today, and for the
countries of the world that are in constant strife, so it has been welcomed and recognized by more
and more countries and peoples, and has been written into important documents of the United
Nations.

Adhere to dialogue and consultation to build a world of lasting peace. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed
out that if the country is peaceful, the world will be safe; if the country fights, the world will be
chaotic. Building a world of lasting peace fundamentally lies in building a partnership of equal
treatment and mutual understanding among nations. All countries should adhere to the common
values of all mankind, namely peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom; adhere
to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; and inherit and carry forward the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations; Persist in resolving differences and disputes between
countries by peaceful means through dialogue and consultation; Adhere to multilateralism and do
not engage in unilateralism. Countries should build a partnership of dialogue, non-confrontation,
partnership and non-alignment; Big countries should respect each other's core interests and major
concerns, manage contradictions and differences, and strive to build a new type of relationship; big
countries should treat small countries as equals, and not engage in hegemony of self-respect, forced
buying and selling.
Adhere to joint construction and sharing, and build a world of universal security. There is no perfect
security in the world, the security of one country cannot be built on the turmoil of other countries,
and the threat of other countries may become a challenge for one's own country. All countries should
abandon all forms of Cold War mentality, establish a new security concept that is common,
comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable, promote all countries to take the road of jointly
building a win-win security, and strive to create a fair, just and generally stable security pattern

Promote the building of a platform for regional security dialogue and cooperation, establish a
framework for equal, transparent, open and inclusive regional and international security cooperation,
and jointly eliminate the root causes of war and endangering security; give full play to the central
role of the United Nations and its Security Council in stopping war and peacekeeping, and turn
conflict into a victory through peaceful settlement of disputes and coercive action; promote
international cooperation in the economic and social fields to advance in parallel to comprehensively
respond to traditional and non-traditional security threats and oppose all forms of terrorism.
Adhere to win-win cooperation and build a world of common prosperity. Economic development is
the material foundation for human existence, and prosperity is an important cornerstone of national
progress. All countries, especially major economies, should seize the historic opportunity of a new
round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, transform the mode
of economic development, adhere to innovation-driven, further develop social productive forces and
release social creativity; on the other hand, strengthen macro policy coordination, enhance mutual
assistance and mutual benefit, jointly create new technologies, new industries, new formats and new
models, and embark on a fair, open, comprehensive and innovative development path. All countries
should make good use of the "invisible hand" and the "visible hand" to organically unify and
promote each other's role and create a normative pattern that balances efficiency and fairness;
uphold the rules of the World Trade Organization and support an open, transparent, inclusive and
non-discriminatory multilateral trading system; strengthen coordination and improve governance,
promote the construction of an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win economic
globalization, and promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth of the world economy.
Adhere to exchanges and mutual learning to build an open and inclusive world. The diversity of
human civilizations is a fundamental feature of the world and a source of human progress. "The
beauty of harmony lies in the harmony of differences." We should adhere to the principles of
diversity, equality and inclusiveness among civilizations, transcend civilizational barriers through
exchanges among civilizations, transcend conflicts among civilizations through mutual learning
among civilizations, and transcend civilizational superiority through civilizational coexistence, and
promote dialogue among different civilizations and different development models. Exchanges and
mutual learning among civilizations are a bridge for enhancing friendship among peoples of all
countries and a link for safeguarding world peace. All civilizations should learn from each other's
strong points in competition and comparison, develop together through exchanges and mutual
learning, and jointly resist conceptual barriers that hinder the interaction between human hearts, so
that the people of the world can enjoy a more connotative spiritual life, gather more civilizational
wisdom, and create a better future with more choices.
Adhere to green and low-carbon, and build a clean and beautiful world. It is necessary to follow the
concept of the unity of nature and nature, and promote the construction of an ecological system that
respects nature and green development;
