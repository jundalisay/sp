What is wrong with the world? What should we do? Cooperation or confrontation? Openness or
closure; mutual benefit or zero-sum game? The Communist Party of China has not only sought
happiness for the Chinese of the people but also struggled for the cause of human progress, and has
made its own unique answers to these questions concerning the future and destiny of mankind.
Concentrated on one point, it is the major strategic thinking of "building a community with a shared
future for mankind" put forward by Comrade Xi Jinping. This major strategic thinking shows
China's good image as a world peace builder, a contributor to global development and a defender of
international order, points out the right direction for promoting the improvement of global
governance and building a better world, and becomes a clear banner for China to lead the trend of
the times and the direction of human civilization progress.
1. build a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity,
openness, inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty
The concept of "building a community with a shared future for mankind" demonstrates Comrade Xi
Jinping's responsibility as a world-class leader. In March 2013, he delivered a speech at the Moscow
Institute of International Relations, in which he clearly put forward the idea of "you have me and I
have your community of common destiny.” In September 2015, when attending the general debate
of the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly, he made the first comprehensive and
systematic exposition of the idea of a community with a shared future for mankind. In December
2017, in his keynote speech at the high-level dialogue between the Communist Party of China and
political parties around the world, Comrade Xi Jinping once again gave a profound explanation,
pointing out: "A community with a shared future for mankind, as the name implies. That is, the
future and destiny of every nation and country are closely linked, and we should share hardships
and hardships, share glory and disgrace, and strive to build the planet where we were born and grew
up in Sri Lanka into a big harmonious family, and turn the aspirations of the people of the world for
a better life into reality. 1 In March 2020, he pointed out in a telephone conversation with UN
Secretary-General António Guterres: "The outbreak of the new crown pneumonia epidemic once
again shows that mankind is a community with a shared future"

"The international community must establish a sense of a community with a shared future for
mankind, watch over each other, work together to cope with risks and challenges, and jointly build
a better home for the earth."1 In May 2020, in his speech at the opening ceremony of the 73rd World
Health Assembly video conference, Comrade Xi Jinping put forward the initiative of "unity and
cooperation to overcome the epidemic and jointly build a human health community.”
The idea of a community with a shared future for mankind is extremely rich and profound, and its
core is what the report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out:
"Build a world of lasting peace, universal security, common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness,
cleanliness and beauty."2 The proposal of this initiative has undoubtedly pointed out the direction
and realistic path of common development, common progress, common security and common
prosperity for the international relations that are in confusion in the world today, and for the
countries of the world that are in constant strife, so it has been welcomed and recognized by more
and more countries and peoples, and has been written into important documents of the United
Nations.
Adhere to dialogue and consultation to build a world of lasting peace. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed
out that if the country is peaceful, the world will be safe; if the country fights, the world will be
chaotic. Building a world of lasting peace fundamentally lies in building a partnership of equal
treatment and mutual understanding among nations. All countries should adhere to the common
values of all mankind, namely peace, development, fairness, justice, democracy and freedom; adhere
to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence; and inherit and carry forward the purposes and
principles of the Charter of the United Nations; Persist in resolving differences and disputes between
countries by peaceful means through dialogue and consultation; Adhere to multilateralism and do
not engage in unilateralism. Countries should build a partnership of dialogue, non-confrontation,
partnership and non-alignment; Big countries should respect each other's core interests and major
concerns, manage contradictions and differences, and strive to build a new type of relationship; big
countries should treat small countries as equals, and not engage in hegemony of self-respect, forced
buying and selling.
Adhere to joint construction and sharing, and build a world of universal security. There is no perfect
security in the world, the security of one country cannot be built on the turmoil of other countries,
and the threat of other countries may become a challenge for one's own country. All countries should
abandon all forms of Cold War mentality, establish a new security concept that is common,
comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable, promote all countries to take the road of jointly
building a win-win security, and strive to create a fair, just and generally stable security pattern

Promote the building of a platform for regional security dialogue and cooperation, establish a
framework for equal, transparent, open and inclusive regional and international security cooperation,
and jointly eliminate the root causes of war and endangering security; give full play to the central
role of the United Nations and its Security Council in stopping war and peacekeeping, and turn
conflict into a victory through peaceful settlement of disputes and coercive action; promote
international cooperation in the economic and social fields to advance in parallel to comprehensively
respond to traditional and non-traditional security threats and oppose all forms of terrorism.
Adhere to win-win cooperation and build a world of common prosperity. Economic development is
the material foundation for human existence, and prosperity is an important cornerstone of national
progress. All countries, especially major economies, should seize the historic opportunity of a new
round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, transform the mode
of economic development, adhere to innovation-driven, further develop social productive forces and
release social creativity; on the other hand, strengthen macro policy coordination, enhance mutual
assistance and mutual benefit, jointly create new technologies, new industries, new formats and new
models, and embark on a fair, open, comprehensive and innovative development path. All countries
should make good use of the "invisible hand" and the "visible hand" to organically unify and
promote each other's role and create a normative pattern that balances efficiency and fairness;
uphold the rules of the World Trade Organization and support an open, transparent, inclusive and
non-discriminatory multilateral trading system; strengthen coordination and improve governance,
promote the construction of an open, inclusive, inclusive, balanced and win-win economic
globalization, and promote strong, sustainable and balanced growth of the world economy.
Adhere to exchanges and mutual learning to build an open and inclusive world. The diversity of
human civilizations is a fundamental feature of the world and a source of human progress. "The
beauty of harmony lies in the harmony of differences." We should adhere to the principles of
diversity, equality and inclusiveness among civilizations, transcend civilizational barriers through
exchanges among civilizations, transcend conflicts among civilizations through mutual learning
among civilizations, and transcend civilizational superiority through civilizational coexistence, and
promote dialogue among different civilizations and different development models. Exchanges and
mutual learning among civilizations are a bridge for enhancing friendship among peoples of all
countries and a link for safeguarding world peace. All civilizations should learn from each other's
strong points in competition and comparison, develop together through exchanges and mutual
learning, and jointly resist conceptual barriers that hinder the interaction between human hearts, so
that the people of the world can enjoy a more connotative spiritual life, gather more civilizational
wisdom, and create a better future with more choices.
Adhere to green and low-carbon, and build a clean and beautiful world. It is necessary to follow the
concept of the unity of nature and nature, and promote the construction of an ecological system that
respects nature and green development;

climate change, and promote 2030 in a balanced manner. The sustainable development agenda of
the year, constantly open up the development path of civilization with production development, rich
life and good ecology.
2. Build a new type of international relations featuring mutual respect,
fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation
Building a community with a shared future for mankind and building a world of lasting peace,
universal security, common prosperity, openness, inclusiveness, cleanliness and beauty is a
historical process, which cannot be achieved overnight and smooth sailing, and it is necessary to
advance along the basic path of promoting the construction of a new type of international relations
featuring mutual respect, fairness and justice, and win-win cooperation. The essence of building a
new type of international relations is to embark on a new path of state-to-state exchanges based on
dialogue rather than confrontation and partnership rather than alliance, so as to open up the way and
accumulate conditions for building a community with a shared future for mankind.
As early as March 2013, in a speech at the Moscow Institute of International Relations, Comrade
Xi Jinping clearly pointed out that in the face of the objective requirement that all countries in the
world work together in the same boat, "to keep up with the pace of the times, we cannot enter the
21st century physically, and our heads are still stuck in the past, in the old era of colonial expansion,
in the Cold War mentality, and in the Cold War mentality." Inside the old box of zero-sum games.
"All countries should jointly promote the establishment of a new type of international relations with
win-win cooperation as the core, and the people of all countries should work together to safeguard
world peace and promote common development."1 To this end, it is necessary to go beyond those
ideas and principles in traditional international relations that do not adapt to the trend of the times
and should also be abandoned, such as the law of the jungle, the law of the jungle, you die and I live,
you lose and I win, zero-sum game, etc.; It is also necessary to inherit a series of universally
recognized principles and spirits accumulated in the evolution of international relations in modern
times, including the principles of equality and sovereignty established by the Peace of Westphalia
more than 370 years ago, the spirit of international humanism established by the Geneva
Conventions more than 150 years ago, the four major purposes and seven principles clearly defined
in the Charter of the United Nations more than 70 years ago, and the Bandung Conference more
than 60 years ago, "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence", etc.;

It is all the more necessary to actively advocate and firmly practice the principle of mutual respect
among all countries in the inheritance, jointly pursue fairness and justice in international relations
and international order, and work together for mutual benefit and win-win results.
Mutual respect is a prerequisite. All countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, are equal
members of the international community and have the right to participate in international affairs on
an equal footing. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries brook no infringement,
interference in the internal affairs of all countries, respect for the social system and development
path independently chosen by the people of all countries, and respect for the core interests and major
concerns of all countries. It is necessary to oppose the use of illegal means to subvert the legitimate
regimes of other countries out of one's own interests or one's own opinions. These are the last truths
that must not be discarded at any time and should not be shaken at any time.
Fairness and justice are the norm. "The journey of the avenue is also the world's public. "Fairness
and justice are the lofty goals pursued by the peoples of the world in the field of international
relations. All countries should jointly promote the democratization of international relations, so that
the people of all countries can jointly control the destiny of the world and jointly discuss and handle
the affairs of the world. Jointly promote the rule of law in international relations, ensure that all
parties abide by international law and the universally recognized basic principles of international
relations, use uniformly applicable rules to clarify right and wrong, promote peace and seek
development, and refrain from double standards and distortions of international law and oppose the
use of "rule of law.” In the name of infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of other countries
and undermining peace and stability, we will promote the rationalization of international relations,
adapt the reform of the global governance system to the new changes in the international balance of
power, reflect the concerns and demands of all parties, and better safeguard the legitimate rights and
interests of the vast number of developing countries.
Win-win cooperation is the goal. "Harmony is strong, solitude is weak. "Win-win cooperation is a
universally applicable principle, not only applicable to the economic field, but also to politics,
security, culture and other fields, and should become the basic policy orientation of all countries in
handling international affairs." All countries should combine their national interests with common
interests, strive to expand the convergence of common interests of all parties, and should not build
a stage here and tear it down there, but should complement each other and play a good show. All
countries should actively establish a new concept of win-win, multi-win and win-win, and abandon
the old thinking that you lose and I win, and the winner takes all. "The beauty of each is the beauty
of the beauty, the beauty of the beauty, the beauty of the world." "All countries should adhere to the
principle of working together in the same boat, sharing rights and responsibilities, working together
to address the increasing number of global issues such as climate change, energy resource security,
cyber security, and major natural disasters, and jointly protect the earth home on which human
beings depend."

3. consolidate the humanistic foundation for building a community with a
shared future for mankind
Civilizations communicate through diversity, learn from each other through exchanges, and develop
through mutual learning. Comrade Xi Jinping vigorously advocates strengthening exchanges and
mutual learning among different countries, ethnic groups and cultures in the world, and
consolidating the humanistic foundation for jointly building a community with a shared future for
mankind. He clearly proposed to establish a civilizational concept of equality, mutual learning,
dialogue and inclusiveness, seek wisdom and nourishment from different civilizations, provide
spiritual support and spiritual comfort for people, and work together to solve various challenges
facing mankind. In May 2019, China successfully hosted the Conference on Dialogue of Asian
Civilizations, and in his keynote speech at the opening ceremony, Comrade Xi Jinping interpreted
the ideas of civilization self-confidence, mutual learning among civilizations and tolerance among
civilizations, setting the tone for dialogue among civilizations and mutual learning among
civilizations. This is China's practical action to promote dialogue and mutual learning among
civilizations, and has far-reaching exemplary significance for Asia and the world.
Uphold harmony without difference and safeguard the diversity of civilizations. Comrade Xi Jinping
pointed out that all achievements of civilization deserve respect and should be recognized and
cherished. All countries and nationalities should not only cherish and safeguard their own
civilization, especially their own ideology and culture, but also recognize and respect the ideology
and culture of other nationalities; on the one hand, they should enhance their own ideological and
cultural self-respect, self-confidence, and self-reliance. Especially in the era of globalization, while
paying attention to maintaining and highlighting their own characteristics and iconic symbols,
different civilizations are forming more and more common elements and symbols in the process of
exchanges and blending. There are no so-called "universal values" in the world that can be
transmitted or even imposed on other civilizations, and openness, inclusiveness, diversity and
mutual learning and diversity integration have become the main keynote of the great homeland of
human civilization in the 21st century. The pattern of one civilization being high above and others
following the marginalized is dissolving; The intention and practice of treating one's own
civilization as the sole central or powerful civilization and denigrating or even transforming other
civilizations will only seriously undermine the achievements of civilization and will eventually
endanger itself.
Adhere to equality and mutual respect, and strengthen dialogue and exchanges among civilizations.
Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out:
China Aerospace Studies Institute

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
"Every civilization is rooted in its own soil of survival, embodies the extraordinary wisdom and
spiritual pursuit of a country and a nation, and has its own value for existence. Human beings only
have the difference between skin color and language, and civilization only has the difference
between surname Ziyan and red, but there is absolutely no distinction between high and low. " 1
Civilizations should uphold an attitude of humility and mutual respect, avoid arrogance, prejudice
and one-sided narrow cognition, and oppose mutual isolation, mutual exclusion and mutual
substitution. If a civilization treats another civilization condescendingly, it will not only fail to
understand the mystery of this civilization, understand the true meaning of this civilization, and
cannot learn from the strengths and essence of this civilization, but will also be incompatible with
it. If you see that other civilizations are different from your own, you feel unpleasant, attack and
belittle them, and do everything possible to transform, assimilate, or even try to impose your own
civilization on others, which will only widen differences and even cause conflicts. Both history and
reality show that arrogance and prejudice are the biggest obstacles to exchanges and mutual learning
among civilizations, and equality and respect are the prerequisites for exchanges and mutual
learning among civilizations. Any attempt to resolve the differences between civilizations by
coercive means will not succeed, and the hegemony of civilizations and the "clash of civilizations"
can only bring disaster to world peace and human civilization.
Adhere to inclusiveness and mutual learning and promote the development and prosperity of
civilization. Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "The diversity of human civilization gives this world
a red color, diversity brings exchanges, exchanges breed integration, and integration produces
progress." "Only by respecting each other, learning from each other, and coexisting harmoniously
in diversity can the world be rich and prosperous."2 "To learn alone and have no friends is to be
lonely and unheard." "Exchange and mutual learning are the essential requirements of the
development of civilization, and human history is originally a magnificent picture of mutual
exchanges, mutual learning and harmony among different civilizations. Of course, exchanges and
mutual learning among civilizations should be reciprocal and equal, pluralistic and multi-directional,
not coercive and coercive, and should not be single and unidirectional. Only through equal
exchanges and mutual learning can we seek common ground while reserving differences, learn from
each other's strengths, lead the excellent cultural genes of human civilization to adapt to
contemporary culture, harmonize with modern society, and lead the excellent cultural spirit to be
promoted. Only in this way can human civilization be full of vitality, continuous creative
transformation and innovative development, and all countries and peoples can find a way to achieve
common development, work together to cope with challenges, and jointly create a bright future of
a community with a shared future for mankind.

Section 2: Responsibilities and Responsibilities of Great
Power Diplomacy in the New Era
Contemporary China is an emerging developing country and a major country with decisive influence
on the world stage. The history, reality and humanistic endowments of major countries determine
that every big country is different, each big country has its own characteristics, and every big country
must follow a development path that suits its own characteristics. Historical inheritance and
historical encounters, national missions, cultural endowments, domestic and international
environments, objectively require that China's diplomacy in the new era must be a major country
diplomacy with distinctive Chinese characteristics. Guided by the grand goal of building a
community with a shared future for mankind, China's diplomacy has vigorously promoted
innovation in concepts and methods, fully demonstrated the responsibility and responsibility of
major-country diplomacy in the new era, demonstrated the distinctive character of major-country
diplomacy with Chinese characteristics, and created good external conditions for realizing the
Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and jointly creating a better future
for mankind.
Major country diplomacy with Chinese characteristics is a global-oriented diplomacy, with a major
pattern, vision and layout being a major feature. Major country diplomacy with Chinese
characteristics is based on China's diplomacy as a major country, which makes greater contributions
to human society with the responsibility and responsibility of a major country, not only seeks its
own growth and development, but also focuses on promoting the prosperity and development of
human society, not diplomacy against major powers, nor diplomacy competing with other major
powers in the world for dominance and hegemony.
1. Unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has
emphasized: "Taking the path of peaceful development is a strategic choice made by our Party in
accordance with the development trend of the times and the fundamental interests of our country. " 1
China is a country with a long civilization, a country that has experienced great suffering, a country
that practices socialism with Chinese characteristics, the largest developing country in the world,
and a country that is undergoing profound changes.

"Chinese people have unforgettable memories of the suffering caused by war, have a tireless pursuit
of peace, and cherish a peaceful and stable life. What the people are afraid of Chinese is turmoil,
what they seek is stability, and what they hope for is peace in the world.1 The socialist system with
Chinese characteristics, historical and cultural traditions, basic national conditions, the trend of the
times and the fundamental interests of the country all determine that China can only take the path
of peaceful development. This road was not easy to come by, and it was gradually formed by the
CPC through arduous exploration and continuous practice since the founding of New China,
especially in the more than 40 years of reform and opening up.
Over the years, with China's rapid development, some people in the world are worried that China
will follow the path of "national strength must be hegemonic", believing that China's development
must be a "threat", which is a deep-rooted prejudice. In this regard, Comrade Xi Jinping has
repeatedly pointed out on different occasions that "a strong country must hegemon.” It is not the
law of history, the Chinese nation does not have the gene in its blood to invade others and dominate
the world, and the Chinese people are willing to live in harmony and develop harmoniously with
the peoples of the world, and seek peace, protect peace and share peace. And that's exactly what
happened. The goal of China's development is to enable Chinese people to live a good life. China's
path and way to achieve development is based on the base point of its own strength, unswervingly
follows its own path, persists in exploring its own development path and solutions to problems from
the Chinese land, relies on its own continuous development strength to better follow the path of
peaceful development, and is committed to promoting open development, cooperative development
and win-win development. China's development will never come at the expense of the interests of
other countries, and it will never do anything that harms others and interests itself and beggars its
neighbors. No matter how the international situation changes, no matter how it develops, China will
never seek hegemony, never expand, and never seek spheres of influence. This has not wavered in
the past and will continue to do so in the future.
Comrade Xi Jinping declared to the international community China's firm belief in taking the path
of peaceful development, and at the same time deepened and developed the strategic thinking of
peace development at a new historical starting point, that is, "two intrinsically unified.”
First, it is intrinsically integrated to adhere to the path of peaceful development with resolutely
defending the core interests of the country. Comrade Xi Jinping solemnly declared at the meeting
to celebrate the 95th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China:

"China does not covet the rights and interests of other countries and is not jealous of the development
of other countries, but it will never give up our legitimate rights and interests." Chinese people do
not believe in evil and are not afraid of evil, do not cause trouble or fear trouble, and no foreign
country should expect us to trade with our core interests, and do not expect us to swallow the bitter
fruit that harms China's sovereignty, security and development interests. 1 When discussing the
adherence to the overall national security concept, Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that "we must
adhere to the supremacy of national interests.” 2 Some countries, some forces, and some public
opinion one-sidedly interpret China's path of peaceful development, believing that China's decision
to take the path of peaceful development as a national strategic choice will constrain its
determination, means, and ability to safeguard national interests; that China's external declaration
on taking the path of peaceful development is unwilling or daring to adopt non-peaceful means to
defend its core interests; and that China will lower or even give up its principles and bottom line in
order to seek development and stability. Constant provocations and even attempts to touch the red
line of China's core interests. This kind of thinking and behavior, which regards China's restraint
and tolerance as weakness and deception, and regards China's advocacy of resolving disputes
through political dialogue and diplomatic channels as an opportunity, is bound to pay a huge price.
China will never separate the path of peaceful development from safeguarding national interests;
while adhering to the path of peaceful development, it will never sacrifice its core national interests;
only by effectively safeguarding its core national interests can it more calmly and confidently adhere
to the path of peaceful development; China will adopt all necessary means to resolutely safeguard
its territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and resolutely safeguard national unity
and national dignity.
The second is to intrinsically integrate China's adherence to the path of peaceful development with
its active advocacy and promotion of all countries in the world to jointly follow the path of peaceful
development. For China to follow the path of peaceful development smoothly, other countries in the
world need to follow the path of peaceful development; it needs to transform the world's
opportunities into China's opportunities and China's opportunities into world opportunities; it needs
to strive for a peaceful international environment to develop China, and use China's development to
maintain and promote world peace. Without peace, neither China nor the world can develop
smoothly, and without development, there can be no lasting peace between China and the world.
China is unswervingly a practitioner of peaceful development and a promoter of common
development, and at the same time calls on, drives and urges other countries to walk shoulder to
shoulder and meet each other halfway. If certain countries and forces dare to undermine peace,
wantonly provoke, create conflicts or even impose wars, China will resolutely struggle and will not
give in.

Only when all countries abandon the Cold War mentality and zero-sum game, oppose power politics
and hegemonism, and follow the path of peaceful development can they coexist peacefully and
develop together.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, under the strong leadership of
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at the core, China's struggle practice on a
series of issues involving major core interests has not only demonstrated China's position and
conviction in adhering to the path of peaceful development, but also demonstrated its determination
and will to defend national sovereignty and security interests, greatly inspired the Party's heart, the
military and the people's heart, and won the wide respect of the international community.
2. build a more complete global partnership network
At the end of November 2014, Comrade Xi Jinping proposed at the Central Foreign Affairs Work
Conference that we should make friends and form a global partnership network on the premise of
adhering to the principle of non-alignment. Over the past few years, on the basis of the various forms
of partnership it has established with many countries in the world, China has comprehensively
planned and promoted diplomatic and multilateral cooperation among major countries, neighboring
countries and developing countries to build a more inclusive and constructive global partnership.
By building a global partnership network, China's "circle of friends" is getting bigger and bigger,
creating a favorable external environment and strategic support for domestic development.
It is of great importance to plan the relations between major countries, promote coordination and
cooperation among major countries, and build a framework for relations between major countries
with overall stability and balanced development. With the United States, we should firmly grasp the
general direction of the development of bilateral relations, adhere to the principles of non-conflict
and non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation, respect each other's core interests
and major concerns, pay attention to strategic communication, strengthen pragmatic cooperation,
manage differences in an equal and consultative manner, strive to maintain bilateral relations based
on coordination, cooperation and stability, and promote the sustained, healthy and stable
development of bilateral relations. Regarding the trade frictions provoked by the United States,
China has clearly expressed its position and attitude: China does not want to fight, does not want to
fight, and is not afraid of fighting, China will not succumb to any external pressure, and has the

3. Actively lead and promote the reform of the global governance system
In today's world, with the ebb and flow of international forces and the increasing number of global
challenges, it is the general trend to strengthen global governance and promote the reform of the
global governance system. Comrade Xi Jinping attaches great importance to the issue of global
governance, and presided over the collective study of the Politburo on this topic twice in October
2015 and September 2016. With a broad global vision and a world mind, he asked "what is wrong
with the world and what should we do? “It also accurately grasps the development trend of
increasingly interdependent countries in the world, puts forward the global governance concept of
consultation, co-construction and sharing, and leads the innovative development of global
governance concepts and practices with Chinese wisdom, Chinese propositions and Chinese
solutions.
As a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a defender of international
order, China insists on proceeding from its national conditions and actively playing its role as a
responsible major country in accordance with the principle of consistency of responsibilities, rights
and capabilities. Comrade Xi Jinping called on all countries to have the spirit of taking the world as
their own responsibility, actively acting as action-oriented and not spectators, and working together
to take the future and destiny of mankind into their own hands. He clearly proposed to "adhere to
fairness and reasonableness and solve the governance deficit", "Adhere to mutual consultation and
mutual understanding and solve the trust deficit", "Stick to working together to solve the peace
deficit", "Adhere to mutual benefit and win-win results, and solve the development deficit.”1 In

reality of the world economic pattern, increases the representation and voice of emerging economies
and developing countries, and ensures equal rights, equal opportunities and equal rules for all
countries in international economic cooperation.

Section 3: The Belt and Road Initiative is an important
platform for building a community with a shared future for
mankind
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has
organically combined China's development with the common development of the world, drawn
nourishment from the ancient Silk Road, and creatively proposed the "Silk Road Economic Belt"
and "The "21st Century Maritime Silk Road" initiative has created a new pattern of China's all-
round opening up, created a new platform for China and the world to share development
opportunities, and opened up a new model for international cooperation.

In May 2017 and April 2019, China successfully hosted the first and second Belt and Road Forum
for International Cooperation. Over the past few years, from top-level design to project
implementation, from planning to specific practice, the joint construction of the "Belt and Road"
has changed from initiative to action, and has changed from drawing "big letters" Turned to carving
"Gongbi Painting.”
1. the top-level design of China's opening up and economic diplomacy in the
new era
As socialism with Chinese characteristics enters a new era, the situation of international economic
cooperation and competition is undergoing profound changes, the global economic governance
system and rules are facing major adjustments, China's introduction and going out are incomparable
in depth, breadth and rhythm in the past, and the pressure to deal with external economic risks and
maintain national economic security is also incomparable in the past. And "China's level of opening
up to the outside world is not high enough, the ability to make good use of the two markets and
resources at home and abroad is not strong enough, the ability to deal with international economic
and trade frictions and win the right to speak in the international economy is still relatively weak,
and the ability to use international economic and trade rules is not strong enough, and it needs to be
made up for it faster.”1 To this end, we must adhere to the basic national policy of opening up to the
outside world, pursue a mutually beneficial and win-win opening strategy, persist in attaching equal
importance to bringing in and going out, deepen people-to-people exchanges, improve the layout of
opening up to the outside world, foreign trade layout and investment layout, form a new system of
opening up to the outside world, and develop a higher-level open economy, so as to expand opening
up to drive innovation, promote reform and promote development.
The construction of the "Belt and Road" not only makes overall planning for China's open space
layout in the new era, but also carries out the top-level design of the path for China and the world
to achieve openness and win-win results. For China, the construction of the "Belt and Road" is
"developed", China starts from a global perspective, consciously coordinates the overall situation at
home and abroad, and comprehensively plans the grand strategy of all-round opening up. It is a
major measure to go to the world with a more proactive attitude and maintain sustained and healthy
economic development.

It has and will continue to push China to further improve the level of opening up to the outside world
and enhance its ability to participate in international competitiveness, and at the same time, it will
also force the transformation of economic development mode and the optimization of economic
structure, and constantly expand new space for reform and development. For the world, the
construction of the "Belt and Road" requires China to actively guide the global economic agenda,
safeguard the multilateral trading system, accelerate the implementation of the free trade area
strategy, improve the level of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, and strive to
shoulder international responsibilities and obligations commensurate with China's capabilities and
status. China has taken the "Belt and Road" construction as an opportunity to carry out cross-border
connectivity, improve the level of trade and investment cooperation, and promote international
production capacity and equipment manufacturing cooperation, essentially to generate new demand
and achieve world economic rebalancing by improving effective supply. Especially in the context
of the continuous downturn in the world economy and the rapid development of developing
countries to achieve economic independence and national rejuvenation, China conforms to the
aspirations of all countries, especially the vast number of developing countries, to promote peace
and seek development, and supports the vast number of developing countries along the Belt and
Road to promote industrialization, modernization and improve the level of infrastructure. This is a
milestone in the history of world development.
The construction of the "Belt and Road" is based on the basic principle of consultation, joint
construction and sharing. "Consultation" means communication and consultation, fully respecting
the differences in the development level, economic structure, legal system, business environment
and cultural traditions of various countries. "Co-construction" means joint participation, in-depth
docking with relevant national and regional development strategies, establishing cooperation
projects and jointly promoting them. "Sharing" means mutual benefit and win-win results, and all
parties maximize their interests through cooperation. These three complement each other and are
inseparable, forming an organic and unified whole. The construction of the "Belt and Road" firmly
grasps the greatest common denominator of development, aims to share China's development
opportunities with countries along the route and other countries, welcomes all parties to take the
"fast train" and "free ride" of China's development, and promotes all countries and international
organizations to work together to meet the challenges of human development and achieve
complementary advantages and mutual benefit and win-win results.
"One Belt, One Belt' construction focuses on the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa, while
naturally extending to Oceania, Latin America and the Caribbean. The construction of the Silk Road
Economic Belt focuses on connecting the Eurasian continent, mainly including the construction of
six major economic corridors, namely the New Eurasian Land Bridge marked by the China-Europe
Express, the China-Central Asia-West Asia Economic Corridor, the China-Mongolia-Russia
Economic Corridor, the China-Indochina Peninsula Economic Corridor, the China-Pakistan
Economic Corridor, and the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor.

The construction of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road focuses on connecting the Pacific Ocean
and the Indian Ocean, mainly through the construction of fulcrums along the coasts of the Indian
Ocean, Red Sea and Mediterranean Sea, such as Kyaukpyu Port and Sittwe Port in Myanmar,
Colombo Port and Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka, Gwadar Port in Pakistan, Djibouti Support Base,
and Piraeus Port in Greece. The connectivity of North Africa, Europe, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian
Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean promotes economic and trade ties and
common development among countries and regions along the route. As an open and inclusive
process, the construction of the "Belt and Road" is open to all like-minded friends across different
regions, different stages of development and different civilizations, and is neither excluded nor
targeted at any party. It is not about closing the door to engage in closed and exclusive circles or
"China clubs"; it is not about geopolitical alliances or military alliances; Moreover, it is not
demarcated by ideology, does not engage in zero-sum games, and does not buy and sell by force.
2. strive to build an interconnected partnership
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The key to jointly building the Belt and Road is connectivity. "1
The core here is policy communication, facility connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration,
and people-to-people bonds. Comrade Xi Jinping has repeatedly explained the connotation of the
"five links" and put forward pragmatic measures to deepen the cooperation between the "five links.”
To promote international cooperation along the "Belt and Road" is to take the "five links" as the
starting point, widely condense cooperation consensus, and comprehensively improve the level of
cooperation.
First, strengthen policy communication. It is mainly to form a joint force of policy coordination and
planning docking, promote relevant countries to learn from each other, establish policy coordination
mechanisms, jointly formulate cooperation plans, and jointly take cooperative actions, form a
situation of planning convergence, development integration, benefit sharing, and coordinated
development, and continuously consolidate the "Belt and Road.” The political foundation of
construction. Relevant countries have fully exchanged economic development strategies and
countermeasures, based on the contact points and commonalities of development strategies, to
achieve resource reallocation, strategic docking and complementary advantages, and achieve the
effect of "one plus one is greater than two.”

affordable, inclusive and accessible infrastructure, and continuously improve the infrastructure
network of the "Belt and Road" construction. Relevant countries negotiate and sign and implement
transportation facilitation agreements, actively explore and improve cross-border transportation
infrastructure, and build a complex infrastructure network led by economic corridors such as the
New Eurasian Land Bridge, with China-Europe Express and New Land-Sea Corridor and other large
corridors and information highways as the framework, and relying on railway and port pipe
networks, so as to facilitate the economic development and personnel exchanges of various countries.
Third, strengthen unimpeded trade. It is mainly to promote trade and investment liberalization and
facilitation, take a clear stand against protectionism, and continuously release the vitality of mutually
beneficial cooperation. Relevant countries will discuss and make appropriate arrangements on trade
and investment facilitation, eliminate trade barriers, reduce trade and investment costs, strengthen
the compatibility of rules and standard systems, improve the speed and quality of regional economic
circulation, provide better business environment and institutional guarantees, and achieve mutual
benefit and win-win results. China will sign high-standard free trade agreements with more countries,

mechanism for tax collection and administration under the Belt and Road Initiative, accelerate the
promotion of international mutual recognition and cooperation among "authorized operators", and
build a broader platform for all parties to enter the Chinese market by holding the China International
Import Expo. From 2013 to 2018, China's trade in goods with Belt and Road-related countries
exceeded US$6 trillion and its outward direct investment exceeded US$90 billion.
Fourth, strengthen financial integration. It is mainly to deepen cooperation in the financial field and
continuously improve the diversified investment and financing system of the "Belt and Road"
construction. Relevant countries carry out various forms of financial cooperation to achieve local
currency exchange and settlement under current and capital accounts, so as to greatly reduce
circulation costs, enhance the ability to resist financial risks, and enhance the international
competitiveness of the region's economy.

the trend of economic globalization
The construction of the "Belt and Road", from initiative to action, from concept to practice, from
vision to reality, has continuously achieved fruitful results, has become a global public good
welcomed by all countries, and has become a process of promoting the construction of a community
with a shared future for mankind and making new progress. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out,
jointly building the "Belt and Road" is becoming China's plan to participate in global opening and
cooperation, improve the global economic governance system, promote global common
development and prosperity, and promote the construction of a community with a shared future for
mankind. "We should focus on jointly building the Belt and Road, work with all parties to build a

the world."1 China will follow the Strategic Plan for the Construction of the Silk Road Economic
Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road adopted in 2014, the Vision and Actions for Jointly
Building the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road issued in 2015, and
the Maritime Cooperation Vision for the Construction of the Belt and Road in 2017 , focus on key
points, intensive cultivation, promote the joint construction of the "Belt and Road" in the direction
of high-quality development, and make it a common road of opportunity and prosperity.
First, build the Belt and Road into a road of peace. The ancient Silk Road, the rise of the times, the
decline of wars. Once "the place of milk and honey", many places are now synonymous with
conflict and crisis. To promote the building of a new type of international relations and a community
with a shared future for mankind, countries along the Belt and Road need to respect each other's
sovereignty, dignity and territorial integrity, respect each other's development paths and social
systems, respect each other's core interests and major concerns, and create a security pattern of joint
construction and sharing. Especially in view of the characteristics of the security situation in the
regions through which the "Belt and Road" passes, China will work with countries along the route
to resolve hot spots and adhere to political solutions; Focus on mediation, adhere to fairness and
justice, and strive to promote counter-terrorism, treat both the symptoms and the root causes,
eliminate poverty and backwardness and social injustice, and contribute to the "Belt and Road";
Build an environment of peace and tranquility.

Second, build the Belt and Road into a road to prosperity. Development is the overall key to solving
all problems. China's promotion of the "Belt and Road" is precisely in view of the characteristics
that most countries along the route are developing countries, focusing on the fundamental issue of
development, and by redeploying their respective advantageous resources, releasing the
development potential of all countries, and realizing great economic integration, development
linkage and sharing of achievements. Grasp the industry as the foundation of the economy, promote
in-depth industrial cooperation among countries, run economic and trade and industrial cooperation
parks, make industrial development plans compatible and promote each other, especially grasp the

capital market, develop inclusive finance, and improve the financial service network. In particular,
we will seize the trend of a new round of energy structure adjustment and energy technology change,
build a global energy Internet, and achieve green and low-carbon development. In addition, China
will work with countries along the Belt and Road to improve the construction of cross-regional
logistics networks.

to actively develop an open economy in light of their own national conditions, participate in regional
and global governance, jointly create more public goods, and work together to build a broad
community of interests.
Fourth, build the "Belt and Road" into a road of innovation. Innovation is an important force for
development. The construction of the "Belt and Road" itself is an initiative, and to do a good job in
the construction of the "Belt and Road", we must also seek impetus for innovation. While China
adheres to innovation-driven development,
