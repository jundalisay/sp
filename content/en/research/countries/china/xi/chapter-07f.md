Opening up to the outside world is China's basic national policy. Over the past 40 years, China has
persisted in opening its doors to construction, transforming itself from a relatively closed economy
into an economy that is deeply integrated with the world economy and increasingly open, and has
achieved development achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. Since the 18th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the face of the new era and new situation,
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has accurately judged the general
trend of world development, accurately grasped the connotation of comprehensive opening up,
persisted in actively participating in and actively promoting the process of economic globalization,
developed a higher-level open economy, and promoted the formation of a new pattern of
comprehensive opening up.

1. The new situation and new requirements facing opening up to the outside world

The world now is an open world. Facing the world, the implementation of economic opening up and
the implementation of different degrees of opening up in various fields has become an inevitable
requirement for the development of all countries in the world today. Opening up is the trend of the
times and the aspiration of the people. Openness leads to progress, closure leads to backwardness.
The CPC's regard of opening up to the outside world as its basic national policy means conforming
to the trend of development of the times and building, consolidating and developing socialism under
the conditions of opening up to the outside world and in the process of linking with economic
globalization. It is precisely in the process of opening up to the outside world that China has become
the world's second largest economy, contributing more than 30% to world economic growth for
many consecutive years, and scientific socialism has shown vigor and vitality in China.
In the new era, the international and domestic situations facing opening up to the outside world are
undergoing profound and complex changes. Internationally, the world today is experiencing major
changes unprecedented in a century, with the economic and social development of countries
becoming increasingly closely linked, and the reform of the global governance system and
international order accelerating.

At the same time, the world economy has been deeply adjusted, the problem of insufficient new
momentum is prominent, the problems of unbalanced development and income distribution have
intensified, the new challenges brought by new technologies, new industries and new formats have
become prominent, some countries have obvious policy preferences, international trade and
investment barriers have been continuously raised, global unilateralism, protectionism and populism
have gradually spread and fermented, economic globalization has encountered twists and turns,
multilateralism and free trade system have been impacted, there are still many unstable and uncertain
factors, and risks and challenges have intensified. The world faces important choices between
openness and conservatism, cooperation and closure, change and conservatism, which are both full
of hope and challenges.

From a domestic point of view, China's economic development has entered the new normal, labor
costs continue to rise, resource constraints are becoming increasingly tight, environmental carrying
capacity is close to the upper limit, the traditional competitive advantage of open economy has been
weakened, and the traditional development model has encountered bottlenecks. At the same time,
China is rich in human resources, the market scale is large, the infrastructure is relatively perfect,
the industrial facilities are complete, the institutional environment and policy environment for
innovative development are constantly improving, and the open economy still has comprehensive
competitive advantages. Under the pressure of severe and complex domestic and foreign
environment, China's processing trade has accelerated transformation and upgrading, service trade
has continued to develop rapidly, new foreign trade new products, new formats and new models
have continued to emerge, the international operation ability of enterprises has been significantly
enhanced, and its status in the international division of labor has gradually improved. Reality
requires us to accelerate the transformation of the open economy from factor-driven to innovation-
driven, from scale and speed to quality and efficiency, and from cost and price advantages to
comprehensive competitive advantages with technology, standards, brands, quality and service as
the core.

With the increase of China's national strength, China's relations with the world are also undergoing
profound changes, China's status and role in the international arena have been greatly enhanced, and
its interaction with the international community has been unprecedentedly close. China's every
move attracts the world's attention. Comrade Xi Jinping solemnly declared: "The door of China's
opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider." China's pace of promoting a higher
level of opening up will not stagnate! China's pace of promoting the construction of an open world
economy will not stagnate; China's pace of promoting the construction of a community with a shared
future for mankind will not stagnate!"1 In the new era, China will make greater contributions to the
common prosperity of all countries in the world while achieving its own development with a more
responsible spirit, a more inclusive mind and higher quality growth.

2. New measures to promote the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening up

The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China summed up China's valuable
experience in opening up to the outside world, conformed to the general trend of economic
globalization, and made a major strategic plan to promote the formation of a new pattern of
comprehensive opening up. This strategic deployment, which includes the expansion of the scope
of opening up, the broadening of the field and the deepening of the level, as well as the innovation
of open methods, the optimization of layout, and the improvement of quality, is the proper meaning
of the basic strategy of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new
era, and is the basic compliance of China's opening up to the outside world.
The new pattern of comprehensive opening up is reflected in the open space, that is, optimizing the
layout of regional opening-up, increasing the intensity of opening up in the west, changing the
regional pattern of China's opening up to the outside world that is fast and slow in the west and
strong and weak in the coastal interior, and gradually forming an open pattern of division of labor
and cooperation along the coastal inland border, interactive development, and mutual assistance
between the east and the west Construction, adhere to independent opening up and reciprocal
opening-up, accelerate the strategic planning of going out, coordinate multilateral, bilateral and
regional opening up and cooperation, and accelerate the implementation of the free trade area
strategy; reflected in the content of opening-up, that is, greatly relax the market quasi-personnel,
further liberalize the general manufacturing industry, orderly expand the opening up of the service
industry, expand the two-way opening up of the financial industry, and promote infrastructure
interconnection. According to this new pattern, China has taken a series of major measures in
opening up to the outside world.

First, solidly promote the construction of the "Belt and Road.‚Äù The construction of the "Belt and
Road" is a major strategic measure for China to expand opening up to the outside world, and it is
also the focus of opening up in the coming period. With the joint efforts of all parties, the
construction of the "Belt and Road" has gradually changed from concept to action, from vision to
reality. In order to promote the construction of the "Belt and Road", China has held the "Belt and
Road" Summit Forum for International Cooperation. This not only builds a new platform for China
to expand opening up, but also helps promote world economic growth and deepen regional
cooperation. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that in
accordance with the principle of consultation, co-construction and sharing, actively promote
international cooperation on the "Belt and Road", strive to achieve policy coordination, facility
connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bonds, create a new
platform for international cooperation, and add new impetus to common development. To this end,
it is necessary to strengthen the docking with the development strategies of countries along the Belt
and Road, enhance strategic mutual trust, seek the greatest common denominator of cooperation,
and build the "One Belt, One Road" into a road of peace, prosperity, openness, innovation and
civilization.

The second is to promote the construction of a strong trade country. From a major trading country
to a trading power, we must consolidate the traditional advantages of foreign trade, cultivate new
competitive advantages, expand the space for foreign trade development, and actively expand
imports. It is necessary to expand foreign trade, accelerate the transformation of trade development
mode, change from focusing on trade in goods to coordinated development of trade in goods and
services, from relying on imitation and following to relying on innovation and creation, and from
large input and large output to high quality, high price, and excellent input. It is necessary to cultivate
new trade formats and models, support the healthy development of cross-border e-commerce,
market procurement trade, and comprehensive foreign trade services, and create new growth points
for foreign trade. We must promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, oppose trade
protectionism, support the multilateral trading system, promote international cooperation in
production capacity, participate in international cooperation at a higher level and in a wider space,
form a global-oriented trade, investment and financing, production and service network, and
accelerate the cultivation of new advantages in international economic cooperation and competition.
We must innovate foreign investment methods, strengthen guidance for overseas mergers and
acquisitions, standardize overseas business behavior, and strive to achieve common and sustainable
development. China has held the China International Import Expo since 2018, which is the world's
first import-themed national-level exhibition so far, which is a major innovation in the history of
international trade development. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "China's initiative to expand
imports is not an expedient measure, but a long-term consideration for facing the world, facing the
future and promoting common development."1 "The China International Import Expo should not
only be held every year, but also run at a high level, achieve results, and do better and better."2 These
loud words have fully demonstrated to the world China's sincerity and goodwill in opening up its
own market and sharing development opportunities. At the second China International Import Expo
held as scheduled in November 2019, Comrade Xi Jinping put forward three suggestions for jointly
building an open and cooperative, open innovation and open and shared world economy, indicating
China's positive attitude of further opening up and promoting trade facilitation.
The third is to actively create a world-class business environment. The business environment is also
productivity. China has vigorously strengthened the construction of the rule of law in the use of
foreign investment, unified domestic and foreign investment laws and regulations, improved an
open and transparent foreign-related legal system, comprehensively implemented the pre-national
treatment plus negative list management system for prospective personnel, created a fair market
environment, continued to relax market access, and respected international business practices.

All types of enterprises registered in China will be treated equally and equally, the legitimate rights
and interests of foreign-funded enterprises will be protected, intellectual property protection will be
strengthened, and entrepreneurs from all over the world will strive to provide a better environment
and conditions for entrepreneurs from all over the world to invest and develop their businesses in
China, and improve the level of open economy in a larger scope, in a wider range of fields and at a
deeper level. In recent years, through large-scale tax and fee reductions, and the in-depth promotion
of the reform of decentralization, management and service, on October 24, 2019, the World Bank
released the "2020 Business Environment Report", ranking China's business environment ranked
first46th place rose to 31st place, up 15 places. The Foreign Investment Law, passed in March 2019,
establishes the basic framework of China's foreign investment legal system, making unified
provisions on the access, promotion, protection and management of foreign investment. In October,
the Regulations on Optimizing the Business Environment were promulgated. This is an important
measure for China to create a business environment based on the rule of law, internationalization
and facilitation, marking that China's business environment will reach a new level.
The fourth is to optimize the layout of regional opening up and create a new highland for opening
up to the outside world. In the pattern of China's opening up to the outside world, the eastern part
started early and developed rapidly, while the western region started late and developed slowly.
Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the western region has continuously accelerated the pace of
opening up to the outside world, maintained a good development trend in foreign trade and attracted
foreign investment, and achieved good results. However, due to the weak development foundation
and the overall low base, the western region is still a "short board" in China's regional opening
layout. Data show that the western region has 72 percent of the country's land area, 27 percent of
the population, and 20 percent of the total economy, while foreign trade accounts for only 7 percent
of the country's total, and the use of foreign capital and foreign investment account for 7.6 percent
and 7.7 percent respectively. The 19th CPC National Congress proposed to optimize the layout of
regional opening up and intensify the opening up of the western region. The western region should
give full play to its advantages of abundant natural resources, abundant labor, and increased state
policy support, deepen and expand opening up, and promote a more optimized pattern of opening
up.

Fifth, coordinate multilateral and bilateral and regional opening up and cooperation, and accelerate
the implementation of the free trade area strategy. Since the beginning of the new century, the
development process of the multilateral trading system has been blocked, and regional trading
arrangements with a higher level of openness and greater flexibility have flourished, becoming the
main engine driving economic globalization. In the report of the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that he should actively participate in
the reform and construction of the global governance system, support the multilateral trading system,
promote the construction of free trade areas, and promote the construction of an open world
economy. This is not only the need to expand its own open space, but also reflects the responsibility
of maintaining the international economic order. The implementation of the free trade area strategy
is a major measure for China to optimize the layout of opening up and create a new highland of
opening up.

By the end of 2019, China had established a total of 18 pilot free trade zones, covering all directions
in the southeast, northwest, and central regions. In November 2018, the State Council issued the
Notice on Several Measures to Support the Deepening Reform and Innovation of the Pilot Free
Trade Zones, giving the pilot free trade zones greater autonomy in reform, continuing to deepen
differentiated exploration, increasing stress testing, and giving full play to the role of the pilot free
trade zones as a pilot field for reform and opening up. China should not only build the whole island
of Hainan into a pilot free trade zone, but also support Hainan to gradually explore and steadily
promote the construction of a free trade port with Chinese characteristics, establish a free trade port
policy and institutional system step by step and in stages, and build the Hainan free trade port into
a clear banner and an important open door leading China's opening up in the new era, and drive the
formation of a new pattern of higher-level reform and opening up.
In order to further expand opening up, China not only actively promotes the transformation from
the opening up of commodity and factor flows to rules and other institutional opening-up, promotes
the construction of a fair, reasonable and transparent system of international economic, trade and
investment rules, maintains and develops an open world economy, jointly creates an environment
conducive to open development, promotes the orderly flow of production factors and efficient
allocation of resources. The deep integration of the market also repeatedly emphasizes that China
adheres to win-win opening up and does not pursue a zero-sum game. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly
pointed out: "China's opening up to the outside world is not to sing a one-man show, but to welcome
the participation of all parties; it is not to seek a sphere of influence." It is to support the common
development of all countries; not to create their own back gardens, but to build a hundred gardens
shared by all countries.‚Äù1 This strongly declares to the world that China's opening up to the outside
world is committed to win-win and win-win results.
"If you are connected, you will advance together, and if you are closed, you will retreat." "Looking
back at history, open cooperation is an important driving force for enhancing the vitality of
international economy and trade. Today, open cooperation is a realistic requirement for promoting
the stable recovery of the world economy. Looking to the future, openness and cooperation are the
requirements of the times to promote the continuous progress of human society. China unswervingly
pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win opening up strategy, achieves greater intensity and higher
levels of opening up, and provides countries with broader markets, more abundant capital, richer
products and more opportunities for cooperation. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "China is the
world's second largest economy, with a large market of more than 1.3 billion people and a land area
of more than 9.6 million square kilometers. The sea has calm times and stormy times. Without the
wind and rain, it would not be the sea.

Storms can overturn small ponds, but not the sea. After more than 5,000 years of hardship and
hardship, China is still here! facing the future, China will always be here!"1 Openness should be
two-way and mutually beneficial, rather than one-way and beneficial to one party. In the face of
profound changes in the world economic pattern, all countries should join hands to actively promote
openness and cooperation, support the multilateral trading system, and oppose unilateralism and
protectionism. In the Sino-US trade frictions, there are voices in the United States that they want to
decouple the United States from China, and even decouple China from the world. As the world's
largest developing country, the largest developed country and the top two economies, China and the
United States have frequent exchanges and converged interests, which is already "you have me, I
have you", and the so-called decoupling is unimaginable. Decoupling from China means decoupling
from opportunities and decoupling from the future. Today's China is not only the China of China,
but also the China of the world. In the future, China will embrace the world with a more open attitude,
form a more benign interaction with the world, and bring a more progressive and prosperous China
and the world.
