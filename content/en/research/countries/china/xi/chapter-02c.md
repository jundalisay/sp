1. The "Eight Clear" are the action guide for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics

socialist system with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and

building in the new era, and highlight the important position of political construction in party building.

These "Eight Definites" scientifically expounded a series of basic issues on adhering to and
developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and provided ideological guidance
for the party and the people to better adhere to and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics.
First, it clarifies the general task for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. This general task is to realize socialist modernization and the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and build a modern and powerful socialist country.

Realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and building a modern and powerful socialist
country is a great goal established by the Communist Party of China. The Chinese Communists have
worked hard for a century and successfully opened up a path of socialist modernization with Chinese
characteristics that is different from the West. Standing at a new height in the overall development
of the cause of the party and the country, the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China formulated a grand blueprint for building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-
round way, and made brand-new strategic arrangements for realizing the "two centenary goals": by
2020, build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way; basically realize socialist
modernization by 2035; and build a modern and powerful socialist country by 2050 to realize the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. This strategic arrangement is not only inspiring and urging
people to forge ahead, but also scientific, rational and in line with reality, and is a powerful spiritual
driving force that inspires the Chinese communists and Chinese people to continue to struggle for a
better life.
Second, for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, it has
clarified the fundamental strategic arrangements formulated for accomplishing the overall tasks and
achieving the overall goals, which must be based on an accurate judgment of the reality of national
development and the main contradictions in our society. The report of the 19th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China clearly pointed out that the main contradiction in our society has
been transformed into a contradiction between the people's growing need for a better life and
unbalanced and inadequate development. This transformation of the main contradiction in society
reflects the tremendous progress of China's social development and the new changes in stages of
development, reflects the new requirements for the development of the cause of the party and the
country, and is an important basis for determining the strategic deployment of socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era. Only by clarifying this main contradiction can we grasp the
overall situation of development and clarify the direction, tasks and key points of development.
Third, it has clarified a new layout for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. Based on the new historical orientation, Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era clearly points out that the overall layout for
promoting the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era is "five-in-one" and
the strategic layout is "four comprehensive.‚Äù The overall layout of the "five-in-one" clarifies the
overall deployment for promoting national modernization in the new era, that is, the comprehensive
advancement of economic construction, political construction, cultural construction, social
construction and ecological civilization construction. The "four comprehensive" strategic layout has
clarified the important aspects that have overall driving and leading significance in the development
of the party and the country in the new era, that is, comprehensively building a moderately
prosperous society, comprehensively deepening reform, comprehensively governing the country
according to law, and comprehensively administering the party strictly. Promote the cause of
socialism with Chinese characteristics in an overall layout, and take the strategic layout as the
strategic goal and strategic measure of all work;

It has established the strategic direction, key areas and main targets for the development of the cause
of the party and the country in the new era, made top-level design and strategic deployment for
adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and also provided more scientific
layout arrangements.

Fourth, it has defined new requirements for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China proposed that the overall goal of China's comprehensive deepening
reform is to improve and develop the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promote the
modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. This is to continuously
promote the maturity and improvement of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics by
comprehensively deepening reform, improving the system and updating the institutional mechanism,
and promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity. On
the basis of summing up China's historical experience, especially the lessons learned from the
governance of socialist countries, Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that "the national governance system
and governance capacity are a concentrated embodiment of a country's system and system
implementation ability." 1 This important thesis shows that through comprehensively deepening
reform, improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, it provides an
endogenous driving force and institutional guarantee for promoting the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity, and promotes the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity to prepare supporting forces and innovative
ways for the improvement and development of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.
Fifth, it clarifies the guarantee of the rule of law for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese
Characteristics for a New Era clearly states that the overall goal of comprehensively promoting the
rule of law is to build a socialist rule of law system with Chinese characteristics and a socialist
country under the rule of law. "Law is the most important instrument of governance, and the rule of
law is an important support for the national governance system and governance capacity.
Comprehensively promoting the rule of law is the fundamental requirement for solving a series of
major problems facing the development of the cause of the party and the country, liberating and
enhancing social vitality, promoting social fairness and justice, maintaining social harmony and
stability, and ensuring the long-term peace and stability of the party and the country. In order to
promote the sustained and healthy development of China's economy and society and continuously
open up broader development prospects for the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we
must comprehensively promote the construction of a socialist country under the rule of law and
provide institutionalized solutions to these problems from the perspective of the rule of law." 2
Governing the country according to law in an all-round way is a strategy for governing the country,
an essential requirement and important guarantee for socialism with Chinese characteristics, and a
profound revolution in national governance.

We must adhere to the path of socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics, improve the socialist
legal system with Chinese characteristics with the Constitution as the core, and better play the role
of the rule of law as a guarantee for solidifying the foundation, stabilizing expectations, and
benefiting the long term.

6. The strategic support for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. A strong country must strengthen its military. Comprehensively
promoting the modernization of national defense and the armed forces, adhering to the road of
strengthening the military with Chinese characteristics, and building a world-class army are not only
important tasks for the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, but also an important
foundation and strategic support for safeguarding the stable development of the cause of socialism
with Chinese characteristics. In the face of the requirements of the times to strengthen the country
and the army, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has formed Xi
Jinping's thinking on strengthening the army around the major issue of "what kind of strong people's
army to build in the new era and how to build a strong people's army.‚Äù Xi Jinping Thought on
Strengthening the Army profoundly grasps the new requirements for national defense and army
building put forward by the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era,
and clarifies that the party's goal of strengthening the army in the new era is to build a people's army
that obeys the command of the party, can win battles and has excellent work style, and builds the
people's army into a world-class army, providing a strong guarantee for adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.
Seventh, it clarifies the diplomatic goal for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has focused on the development
trend of human society, continued to answer major issues related to national development and the
future and destiny of mankind, such as "what kind of world to build and how to build this world",
put forward the proposition of building a community with a shared future for mankind, and included
"persisting in promoting the construction of a community with a shared future for mankind" into the
basic strategy of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, so as to achieve
the common development of human society. Continued prosperity has charted a new blueprint and
provided Chinese solutions to the complex problems facing humanity. Promoting the construction
of a new type of international relations with win-win cooperation as the core is a strategic choice
made by the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core based on the
development trend of the times and the fundamental interests of our country, which has created a
more favorable international environment for maintaining and extending the period of important
strategic opportunities for China's development, and for promoting the great cause of socialism with
Chinese characteristics and realizing the goal of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
Eighth, it has clearly defined the political guarantee for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era. Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era,
and the environment facing China's development has become more complicated.

New changes have taken place in the international balance of forces, domestic reform has entered
the deep water area, and the task of comprehensively administering the party strictly remains
arduous. It is clear that the most essential feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the
leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the greatest advantage of the socialist system with
Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Communist Party of China, which provides a strong
political guarantee for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics under
complex historical conditions. Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a
New Era, based on historical experience and practical requirements, further clearly emphasizes the
party's core position and leading role in the cause of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
provides a fundamental political guarantee for the new victory of socialism with Chinese
characteristics in the new era.

Based on the new historical orientation and historical starting point, these "Eight Definites" form a
systematic, complete and logical scientific theoretical system, which concentrates on the new
development of Marxism in contemporary China and the 21st century.
