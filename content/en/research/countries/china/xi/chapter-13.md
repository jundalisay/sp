Chapter XIII: A Strong Guarantee for National Rejuvenation

Safeguarding national security, strengthening military support, and realizing the complete
reunification of the motherland are the inevitable requirements for adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and are also a strong guarantee for realizing
the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has grasped the
overall strategic situation of realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation, conducted in-depth theoretical and practical explorations, creatively put forward the
adherence to the overall concept of national security, established and formed Xi Jinping Thought on
strengthening the military, profoundly expounded the basic position and major principles of
adhering to "one country, two systems" and promoting the great cause of the complete reunification
of the motherland, and raised the CPC's understanding of the law of national security, the law of
strengthening the people's army and the practical law of "one country, two systems" to a new height:
The new realm has become an important part of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese
characteristics for a new era.

Section 1: Adhere to the overall concept of national security
Adhering to the overall concept of national security is put forward by Comrade Xi Jinping based on
the new characteristics and new trends of the development of the national security situation, on the
basis of better coordinating the overall situation at home and abroad, security and development, in
order to better solve the new problems and challenges facing national security. The overall concept
of national security profoundly reveals the essence of China's national security, scientifically
answers how as a large developing socialist country can solve the common security problems faced
in the process of development and the special security problems faced by itself, and realize the
party's historic leap in national security theory.

It is the latest achievement of China's national security theory, which provides a program of action
and scientific guide for better safeguarding national security in the new era.

1. national security is a top priority
National security is the basic prerequisite for the survival and development of the country, and the
fundamental guarantee for ensuring that the Party will never degenerate, that the red rivers and
mountains will never change color, and that the process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation will not be slowed down or interrupted.

Since the founding of New China, the party has always attached great importance to the issue of
national security, always regarded safeguarding national security as a basic task of the party and the
state, accumulated rich experience in practice, formed national security thinking in different periods,
and provided a strong guarantee for safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic
groups and promoting the historic achievements of the cause of the party and the country. In the
early days after the founding of New China, the main characteristic of national security was to
safeguard sovereignty and security. Comrade Mao Zedong regarded defending the newborn regime,
ensuring national independence, and safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity as
the primary tasks of safeguarding national security, and made full use of the characteristics and main
contradictions of the world pattern at that time to effectively safeguard and improve the national
security environment. In the new period of reform and opening up, the main feature of national
security is to maintain development security. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that peace and
development are the two major themes in today's world, and national security should escort
economic construction. We must adhere to the four basic principles and adhere to "stability above
all", not only to ensure the socialist direction of reform and opening up, but also to create a stable
domestic and international environment for socialist modernization. In view of the complex and
ever-changing regional environment, Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward a new security concept of
"mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, and cooperation." Comrade Hu Jintao stressed the need to
examine national security issues from a broader perspective, put forward the concept of peaceful
development, and promote the building of a harmonious world of lasting peace and common
prosperity.

Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the connotation and extension of
China's national security are richer than at any time in history, the field of time and space is broader
than at any time in history, internal and external factors are more complex than at any time in history,
and various foreseeable and unforeseeable security risks and challenges are unprecedented.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Enhancing the awareness of adversity and being prepared for
danger in times of peace is a major principle that we must always adhere to in administering the
party and the country."

Our party should consolidate its ruling position, unite and lead the people to uphold and develop
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and ensure national security as the top priority. ”1
From the perspective of the external environment, the world today is in a major change
unprecedented in a century, and the instability and uncertainty it faces are becoming increasingly
prominent. Great development brings great changes, and great changes promote great adjustments.
The trend of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results of the times has become stronger,
but in the changing world, dangerous shoals and reefs have become prominent, and various risks
and challenges have accelerated the accumulation. First, the complexity is prominent. The
momentum of world economic growth is insufficient, protectionism and unilateralism are becoming
increasingly serious, competition among major countries is becoming increasingly fierce, regional
hot spots are emerging one after another, non-traditional security threats such as terrorism, cyber
security, and climate change are complex and severe, and continue to spread, and various security
risks are transmitted and superimposed, accumulating and escalating. Second, the transnational
nature is prominent. The security shortcomings of any country will lead to a large influx of external
risks, forming a security risk depression. The accumulation of security risks in any country to a
certain extent will spill over into regional or even global security issues. Third, diversity is
outstanding. Old problems have emerged under the means of new technologies, and security threats
in new fields such as the deep sea, polar regions, outer space, and the Internet are constantly breeding.
Fourth, the linkage is outstanding. Security issues are closely linked to political, economic, cultural,
religious and ethnic issues, and traditional and non-traditional security threats are intertwined.
Various security issues are intertwined and interact with each other, creating a fission effect. The
probability of small risks evolving into large risks, individual risks into comprehensive risks, local
risks into systemic risks, economic risks into socio-political risks, and international risks into
domestic risks has increased significantly. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Change will give
rise to new opportunities, but the process of change is often full of risks and challenges, and mankind
once again stands at a crossroads."2
Judging from its own situation, China is in a new historical position, and the connotation and
extension of national security have undergone profound changes. At present, China is in a critical
period of development and transformation from a big country to a strong country. This is not only a
period of historical convergence for the realization of the "two centenary goals", but also a period
of mutual agitation that is synchronously intertwined with the great changes in the world that have
not been seen in a century; it is not only a period of important strategic opportunities, but also a
period of highlighting major security risks; it is not only a period of shaping global security, but also
a critical period for improving capabilities, making up for shortcomings, and strengthening
weaknesses.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is by no means easy
and can be achieved by banging gongs and drums.1 In modern times, the process of the rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation has been interrupted many times, leaving us with a profound warning.
Historical opportunities are fleeting, and risks and challenges are everywhere. The road ahead
cannot be smooth, and the closer we get to the goal, the greater the resistance and risk pressure to
move forward. In the face of the treacherous international situation, the complex and sensitive
surrounding environment, the arduous and arduous tasks of reform, development, and stability, and
the requirement of decisively building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and
marching toward the goal of the second centenary struggle, in order to win the initiative in the era
of profound changes and win victory in the great struggle, it is necessary to grasp the new issues
facing national security from a longer-term strategic perspective and constantly open up a new
situation in national security.

In this context, the overall concept of national security came into being. Since the 18th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's national security work system and mechanism
have been continuously improved, the national security legal system has gradually taken shape, the
national security strategy has been continuously improved, and the national security capability has
been significantly improved, which fundamentally lies in the strong leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core and the strategic guidance of the overall national
security concept.

2. Deeply grasp the overall concept of national security

On April 15, 2014, at the first plenary meeting of the Central National Security Commission,
Comrade Xi Jinping put forward for the first time the major strategic thinking of the overall national
security concept, emphasizing that the overall national security concept should be adhered to and
the road of national security with Chinese characteristics should be followed. "Adhering to the
overall concept of national security" was also written into the report of the 19th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China as the basic strategy for adhering to and developing socialism with
Chinese characteristics in the new era, and was written into the revised Constitution of the
Communist Party of China. This is the first time in the history of the Communist Party of China that
the theory of national security has been included in the report of the party congress, and it is also
the first time that the theory of national security has been taken as an important part of the party's
guiding ideology. Adhering to the overall national security concept is not only an important part of
Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era, but also a practical
requirement for implementing Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a
New Era.

The philosophical implications of the overall view of national security. The overall is a concept,
emphasizing the comprehensive and systematic nature of national security.

The overall emphasis is on "general security", which includes traditional security such as political,
territorial and military, as well as non-traditional security such as economy, culture, society, network
and ecology; includes both the current security field and new fields such as space, deep sea, polar
and biological fields; and includes both physical and human security. In addition, the overall
emphasis is on comprehensiveness rather than comprehensiveness, and security issues must not be
generalized, and security boundaries must be grasped well. It is not feasible to talk about security
without basic national conditions, security without the international environment, and security
without development.

The overall is a state that emphasizes the relativity and sustainability of national security. Safety is
relative, risk factors are always present, there is no absolute security. Overall security emphasizes
maintaining a state of relative freedom from danger and internal and external threats. It is necessary
to base ourselves on the present and the long term; we must base ourselves on the dynamic
perception and dynamic assessment of the situation, and on the foresight of the medium- and long-
term development trend; we must have a goal-oriented general idea, general framework, and general
layout, and be good at adjusting the strategy and tactics of national security in a timely manner
according to the new situation, new problems, and new tasks.
The overall is a methodology, emphasizing the scientific integration of national security. The overall
goal is to build a national security system that integrates security in various fields and properly
respond to various complex security challenges. In seeking overall national security, it is necessary
to advance as a whole while highlighting key points; stress both principles and strategies; stress both
needs and capabilities; and stress both safeguarding and reshaping. In particular, we must always
grasp national security in the overall situation of the party and the country, fully mobilize the
enthusiasm of all parties in all fields, perform their respective duties and work together, so as to
unite a strong joint force.

The connotation and extension of the overall national security concept. The summary of the
connotation and extension of national security in the overall national security concept can be
summarized into five major elements and five pairs of relationships.
The five major elements are to take people's security as the purpose, political security as the
foundation, economic security as the foundation, military, cultural and social security as the
guarantee, and international security as the basis. Taking people's security as the purpose is to always
put people's security in the highest position, adhere to the people-oriented and people-oriented,
adhere to national security for the people and rely on the people, and consolidate the mass foundation
of national security. Taking political security as the foundation means unswervingly adhering to the
party's leadership and the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, putting institutional security
and regime security in the first place, and providing political guarantees for national security. Basing
on economic security is to ensure that the country's economic development is not encroached upon,
promote sustained, healthy and stable economic development, improve the country's economic
strength, and provide a material basis for national security.

Taking military, cultural and social security as the guarantee means paying attention to the new
situations and problems facing these fields, following the security laws in different fields,
establishing countermeasures to consolidate the foundation and turn dangers into disasters, and
providing hard and soft power guarantees for safeguarding national security. Relying on promoting
international security means unswervingly following the path of peaceful development, paying
attention to safeguarding national interests, while paying attention to safeguarding common security
and building a community with a shared future. These five aspects jointly support the overall
structure of the national security system and determine the basic orientation of the national security
path with Chinese characteristics.

The five-pair relationship is to attach importance to both external and internal security, emphasizing
the interconnection and mutual influence of external security and internal security; attaching
importance to both homeland security and national security, and emphasizing the organic unity of
homeland security and national security; attaching importance to both traditional and non-traditional
security, emphasizing that traditional security threats and non-traditional security threats affect each
other and may be transformed into each other under certain conditions; and attaching importance to
development issues. It also attaches importance to security issues, emphasizing that development
and security are two sides of the same coin, that development is the foundation of security, and that
security is the condition for development, so that a rich country can strengthen its troops and defend
its country; it attaches importance to both its own security and common security, and stresses that
the security of China and the world in the context of globalization are inseparable.
In short, national security is an inseparable security system, each element has its own focus, and
each element is interrelated and affects each other. The five major elements and the five pairs of
relationships accurately reflect the internal logic of China's national security, accurately reflect the
dialectical, comprehensive and systematic concept of national security, and profoundly reveal the
principle requirements and rich connotations of the overall national security concept. The overall
concept of national security is the concentrated application and latest embodiment of Marxist
positions and views and methods in the field of national security, which is both epistemological and
methodological, embodies a high degree of unity between people's security, political security, and
the supremacy of national interests, embodies a high degree of unity in historical thinking, world
vision and the spirit of the times, and embodies a high degree of unity in theory, practice, and system.

3. Safeguard and shape national security with Chinese characteristics
National security with Chinese characteristics should be both safeguarded and shaped, and shaping
is a higher-level and more forward-looking safeguard.

It is necessary to strengthen follow-up, study, and judgment of the national security situation, strive
to grasp the law in the changing situation, seek advantages and avoid disadvantages in chaos, and
strive for the initiative in struggle. It is necessary to strengthen strategic planning, persist in planning
the layout with global thinking, and shape an overall favorable national security strategic situation.
Uphold the party's absolute leadership over national security work. This is the fundamental principle
for doing a good job in national security work and the fundamental guarantee for safeguarding
national security and social stability. "Absolute" means unconditional and without dead ends, that
is, at any time and under any circumstances, take the party's banner as the banner, the party's
direction as the direction, and the party's will as the will, strengthen the "four consciousness",
strengthen the "four self-confidence", and achieve "two safeguards.” Adhere to the party's overall
control of the overall situation, coordinate all parties, resolutely safeguard the centralized, unified,
efficient and authoritative national security leadership system, and fully implement the major
strategic deployment of national security. Give full play to the role of the Central National Security
Commission in coordinating national security affairs, do a good job in implementing national
security principles and policies, improve the national security work mechanism, and focus on
improving the party's strategic ability to grasp the star situation and plan for development.
Conscientiously implementing the national security responsibility system is an important
institutional guarantee for strengthening the party's leadership over national security work. Party
committees (leading party groups) at all levels are the main body responsible for safeguarding
national security, and should follow the decisions and arrangements of the Central National Security
Commission, properly manage national security affairs in their respective regions and departments,
lawfully exercise the functions and powers entrusted by national security laws and regulations, and
ensure that they have a responsibility to defend the land and fulfill their responsibilities.
Complete and improve the national security system. It is necessary to improve national security
strategies and policies, improve national security systems and mechanisms, strengthen the
organization and coordination of national security work, and establish and improve cross-
departmental and cross-regional joint work mechanisms. Improve the national security system, raise
the level of national security rule of law, and make full use of legal means to preserve national
security. On the basis of implementing the National Security Law and promulgating and
implementing national security laws and regulations such as the Counter-espionage Law, the
Counter-Terrorism Law, the Foreign NGO Domestic Activities Management Law, the
Cybersecurity Law, and the Nuclear Security Law, accelerate the formation of a set of national
security legal systems with Chinese characteristics that are based on the basic national conditions,
reflect the characteristics of the times, adapt to the strategic security environment, have coordinated
content, strict procedures, complete supporting facilities, and effective operation.
Safeguard national security in key areas. The key areas are the main position and the main battlefield
for safeguarding national security. It is necessary to give prominence to security work in various
aspects, such as political security, economic security, homeland security, social security, network
security, biological security, and the security of overseas interests.

Persist in ensuring political security as the first priority, firmly hold the soul of political security,
tighten the string of political security at all times, and promote national security work in key areas
with political security as the guide; persist in administering the party strictly in an all-round way,
firmly grasp the leadership, management and discourse power of ideological work, strictly guard
against and resist "color revolutions", and ensure the safety of the party's governance; adhere to the
basic economic system of socialism with Chinese characteristics without wavering, fight the battle
of preventing and defusing financial risks, and resolutely guard the bottom line of not occurring
systemic financial risks. Consolidate the foundation of economic security; strengthen the
construction of border, coastal and air defense, crack down in depth on the "three forces", resolutely
guard against "Xinjiang independence" and "Tibet independence", resolutely thwart any form of
separatist attempts for "Taiwan independence", safeguard the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong
and Macao, and build a solid wall of homeland security; improve the three-dimensional social
security prevention and control system, severely crack down on violent terrorist forces, properly
respond to major natural disasters and emergencies, and vigorously promote the construction of a
safe China; earnestly safeguard the sovereignty and security of cyberspace, and strengthen
cyberspace governance in accordance with the law. Continuously enhance cybersecurity defense
and deterrence capabilities; incorporate biosecurity into the national security system, systematically
plan the establishment of a national biosecurity risk prevention and control and governance system,
and comprehensively improve national biosecurity governance capabilities; adhere to peaceful
development, take the path of common security, form a strong security guarantee system for
overseas interests, and truly safeguard the security of overseas interests.
Strive to prevent and resolve major risks. Adhere to the basic judgment that China's development is
still in a period of important strategic opportunities and will be for a long time, enhance the
awareness of risk prevention and control, adhere to bottom-line thinking, keep pace with the times
to understand and grasp various actual and potential major risks, guard the bottom line of no
systemic and subversive risks, and look at the worst and strive for the best results. It is necessary to
be highly vigilant against both "black swan" events and "gray rhino" incidents; it is necessary to
have the first hand in preventing risks and also have high tactics to deal with and defuse risks and
challenges; and it is necessary to fight a prepared battle to prevent and resist risks, and also to fight
a strategic initiative battle to turn dangers into opportunities and turn crises into opportunities.
Improve risk prevention and control capabilities, improve risk prevention and control mechanisms,
grasp key points, make up for shortcomings, strengths and weaknesses, strictly prevent
superimposed and upgraded risk transmission, and be good at solving complex problems, handling
complex contradictions, and controlling complex situations. Comprehensively implement the party's
mass line, strengthen national security education, enhance the national security awareness of the
whole party and the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country, and promote the formation
of a strong joint force in the whole society to safeguard national security.

Section 2: Continuously open up a new situation of  strengthening the army and rejuvenating the army

A strong country must strengthen its military. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has focused on realizing the Chinese dream of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, closely focusing on what kind of strong people's army to build
in the new era and how to build a strong people's army, forming Xi Jinping Thought on strengthening
the army. Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the Army clarifies a series of fundamental
directional, overall and major issues in national defense and army building in the new era, opens up
the road to strengthening the army with Chinese characteristics, and creates a new situation of
strengthening the army and rejuvenating the army.

1. Build a people's army that obeys the command of the party and has a good
style of winning battles

Clearly defining the goal of army building is a successful experience of the CPC in building and
managing the army. In various historical periods, in accordance with changes in the situation and
tasks, the Party has clearly put forward the goals and requirements for the building and development
of the people's army, leading the continuous development of the building of our army. Comrade
Mao Zedong led the formulation of the general principle of building an excellent modern
revolutionary army, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward the general goal of building a powerful
modernized and regularized revolutionary army, and Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward the general
requirements for army building that is politically qualified, competent in military affairs, excellent
in work style, strict in discipline, and effective in guarantees. Comrade Hu Jintao put forward the
important idea of strengthening the comprehensive building of the armed forces in accordance with
the principle of combining revolutionization, modernization, and regularization, profoundly
revealed the objective law governing army building, and guided our army to continuously win new
victories from small to large and from weak to strong.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has focused on realizing the "two centenary goals" and realizing
the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, adhered to and developed Marxist
military theory, and established the principle of "building a team that obeys the command of the
Party and can win battles, The goal of strengthening the people's army with a good work style" has
issued the call of the times to "build the people's army into a world-class army in an all-round way."

Answering the major questions of why to strengthen the army, what is the goal of strengthening the
army, and how to take the road of strengthening the army with Chinese characteristics is the general
strategy of the CPC for building and managing the army in the new era, and provides fundamental
guidance for promoting national defense and army building at a new starting point.
Obeying the party's command is the soul and determines the political direction of army building.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that obeying the command of the party is the primary task of our
army construction and the lifeblood of our army. If this one is lost, no matter how other work is
done, it will eventually be completely lost. The key to our army's invincibility and ultimate victory
over all enemies without being overwhelmed by the enemy lies in resolutely obeying the command
of the party, which is the soul of army building and strengthening the army. This is the fundamental
magic weapon for the party's long-term ruling power and the country's long-term peace and stability,
and it is also the point that all enemies fear us the most. Under the new situation, we must firmly
obey the party's command, which is the soul of strengthening the army; persist in building and
mastering the troops ideologically and politically, unswervingly adhere to the fundamental principle
and system of the party's absolute leadership over the army, conscientiously implement the
responsibility system of the chairman of the Central Military Commission, and resolutely maintain
consistency, safeguard authority, and obey commands at all times and under all circumstances, and
ensure the absolute loyalty, absolute purity, and absolute reliability of the troops.
Being able to win battles is the core, reflecting the fundamental functions of the army and the
fundamental orientation of army building. The army is first and foremost a combat team, and it must
persist in focusing all construction and work on winning battles. If the army cannot win on the
battlefield, it will produce serious political backlash. As the saying goes, there is no first in literature
and no second in martial arts. Our army has always been known for its ability to fight good battles
and has created many brilliant achievements. However, the standard of ability to win wars is
constantly changing with the development of war practice, and being able to win a war in the past
does not mean that you can win a war now. Judging from the situation of the army's modernization
construction and the fulfillment of the tasks of preparing for military struggle in recent years, the
problem of our army's insufficient ability to fight a modern war and the insufficient ability of cadres
at all levels to command a modern war have not yet been completely resolved. Under the new
situation, we must grasp the key to being able to fight and win wars, firmly establish combat
effectiveness as the only fundamental criterion, more firmly and consciously grasp the preparation
for war and plan to win, carry forward our army's fearless heroic spirit and heroic and tenacious
fighting style, enhance our army's deterrence and actual combat capability under the conditions of
informationization, and ensure that it can fight when called upon, and win when it is called.
A good work style is a guarantee and has a bearing on the nature, purpose, and true colors of the
military. Only with a good style can a heroic army be shaped, and a loose style can bring down a
division that wins often.

In long-term practice, our army has cultivated and formed a whole set of glorious traditions and fine
work styles, which are the distinctive characteristics and political advantages of the people's army.
Whether or not we can maintain the glorious traditions and fine work style of our party and our army
has a bearing on the survival of the army, on the success or failure of the cause of the party and the
country, and on the fact that the red rivers and mountains of socialism will never change color. In
the new era, we must consolidate the foundation of a strong army of managing the army according
to law and administering the army strictly, regard the building of work style as a basic and long-
term task of the army, pay close attention to it, adhere to the fundamental purpose of serving the
people wholeheartedly, carry forward the spirit of arduous struggle, forge iron discipline, purify the
atmosphere of the army, consolidate and develop good internal and external relations, and ensure
that our army's bloodline is forever, its foundation is solid, and its superiority is eternal.
The goal of strengthening the army, which obeys the party's command, can win battles, and has a
good work style, is consistent with the party's consistent guiding ideology and principles for building
and managing the army, and is consistent with the comprehensive construction thinking that is
unified with revolutionization, modernization, and regularization. Obedience to the party's
command, ability to win battles, and excellent work style are interrelated and inseparable, and are
unified in the great practice of building a strong people's army.

2. Promote political army building, reform and strengthening the army,
rejuvenating the army with science and technology, and managing the army
according to law

As the core of the Party Central Committee, the core of the whole Party and the commander-in-chief
of the armed forces, Comrade Xi Jinping has made strategic plans for national defense and army
building, put forward strategic ideas and strategic measures for adhering to political army building,
reforming and strengthening the army, rejuvenating the army with science and technology, and
managing the army according to law, fully promoting national defense and army building, and
creating a new situation of strengthening the army and rejuvenating the army.
Persist in political army building. Political army building is the foundation of our army, and we must
not slacken at any time or under any circumstances. The key to our army's ability to be loyal to the
party, the people, and the country at all times, to forge ahead courageously and without flinching
under any difficult and difficult circumstances, and to maintain a strong revolutionary will and
combat effectiveness lies in always firmly adhering to political army building. The 19th CPC
National Congress proposed that it is necessary to strengthen party building in the military, carry
out education on the theme of "inheriting red genes and shouldering the heavy responsibility of
strengthening the army", promote the construction of the honor system for soldiers, cultivate
revolutionary soldiers in the new era with soul, ability, blood, and moral character, and always
maintain the nature, purpose and true color of the people's army. First, uphold the party's absolute
leadership over the military. At the celebration of the 90th anniversary of the founding of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army, Comrade Xi Jinping stressed that on the issue of upholding the
fundamental principle of the party's absolute leadership over the military:

"The mind must be particularly clear-headed, the attitude should be particularly clear, and the action
should be particularly resolute, without any wavering, any hesitation, any ambiguity.”1 The key to
upholding the party's absolute leadership over the military lies in meeting the requirements of the
word "absolute" and upholding the uniqueness, thoroughness, and unconditional nature of the party's
leadership. We must always maintain a high degree of unity with the party Central Committee in
both ideology and action; we must obey the command in all our actions, whether in peacetime or
wartime; we must implement to the letter the major principles and policies of the party and the army
and the specific work arrangements. Second, it is necessary to establish four fundamental things:
ideals and convictions, party spirit and principles, standards for combat effectiveness, and prestige
in political work. Communists have always adhered to the party's principle first, the party's cause
first, and the people's interests first as the creed of life and work, taken the initiative to speak for the
party, worry about the party, and serve the party in the party, and consciously implement loving the
party, worrying about the party, rejuvenating the party, and protecting the party in all links of work.
Persist in reforming and strengthening the army. Deepening the reform of national defense and the
armed forces with greater wisdom and courage is the requirement of the times to realize the Chinese
dream and the dream of strengthening the army, the only way to strengthen the army and rejuvenate
the army, and also a key move to determine the future of the army. Since the 18th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee with
Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, a complete set of reform designs that solve deep-seated
contradictions, make major innovations and breakthroughs, and reflect the characteristics of our
army have emerged from the cocoon. It is necessary to break the long-practiced system of
headquarters, military regions, and the army, form a new pattern in which the Central Military
Commission is in charge of the overall operation, the theater is in charge of the battle, and the
services are in charge of construction, and 15 functional departments of the five major theaters, five
major services and arms, and organs of the Central Military Commission are readjusted and
established. This is the biggest change in the military's leadership and command system since the
founding of New China, and it is a structural the most active and revolutionary factors in military
development, and every major scientific and technological progress and innovation will cause
profound changes in the form of war and the mode of warfare. It is necessary to establish the idea
that science and technology are the core combat effectiveness, promote major technological
innovation and independent innovation, strengthen the construction of the military personnel and
revolutionary reshaping of the system, which has a major and far-reaching impact on the
construction and development of our army. Through major changes and reshaping, the people's army
has a new system, structure, pattern, and appearance. In the new era, it is necessary to continue to
deepen the reform of national defense and the armed forces, deepen the reform of major policies
and systems such as the professional system of officers, the civilian personnel system, and the
military service system, promote the revolution in military management, and improve and develop
the socialist military system with Chinese characteristics.
Persist in rejuvenating the army through science and technology. Science and technology are
training system, and build an innovative people's army.
1 Xi Jinping on Governing the Country, Volume 2, Foreign Languages Publishing House, 2017, p. 416.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that the ability to innovate is the core competitiveness of an army
and an accelerator for generating and improving combat effectiveness. Historical experience and
practical exploration tell us that the real core key technology cannot be bought with money. In order
to take the initiative, occupy the high ground, and be undefeated in the fierce international military
competition, we must persist in independent innovation and greatly enhance our ability to innovate
independently in science and technology for national defense. To increase the contribution rate of
scientific and technological innovation to army building and combat effectiveness, only by applying
the results of scientific and technological innovation to the practice of national defense and army
building in a timely and effective manner can it play an important role. At present, the development
of China's national defense science and technology is in a critical period of climbing up the hill and
crossing difficulties, and it is necessary to choose the breakthrough point, advance the layout,
strengthen forward-looking, leading, exploratory, and subversive major technology research and
new concept research, and actively seek military technological competitive advantages.
Persist in managing the army according to law. A modern army must be an army ruled by law.
Comrade Xi Jinping clearly demanded that managing the army according to law and strictly
managing the army should be included in the overall layout of governing the country according to
law. He stressed: "The whole country is building a socialist rule of law system with Chinese
characteristics and building a socialist country under the rule of law, and if the construction of the
rule of law in the military is not stepped up, it will not be able to keep up at that time." 1 The 19th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China clearly proposed to comprehensively
administer the army strictly, promote a fundamental change in the way of administering the army,
and improve the level of rule of law in national defense and army building. To further promote the
management of the army according to law and the strict management of the army, it is first necessary
to make the spirit of the rule of law and the concept of the rule of law deeply rooted in the hearts of
the people, so that all officers and men will believe in and adhere to the rule of law. The law must
be observed, and the rule of law must be believed, otherwise it will be useless. It is necessary to
carry out in-depth publicity and education on the rule of law throughout the army, incorporate
education and training on the rule of law into the education and training system of the troops, regard
the cultivation of the spirit of rule of law as an important part of the building of a culture of
strengthening the army, and guide the vast number of officers and soldiers to internalize the rule of
law into political conviction and moral accomplishment, and externalize it into a code of conduct
and conscious action. It is necessary to let iron discipline exert its strength, and discipline inspection,
inspection, and auditing departments must hold high their swords and perform their supervisory
functions well. Through effective rule of law supervision, tighten the system of restraint and
supervision of the operation of power, and ensure the correct use of power in accordance with the
rules, prudent use of power, and clean use of power. It is necessary to bring about profound changes
in the way of administering the armed forces, and bring about a fundamental change from the
practice of relying solely on administrative orders to administering according to law, and from the
way of carrying out work solely on habit and experience to carrying out work by relying on laws
and regulations.

The fundamental change from the method of grasping work by surprise and movement to the act of
handling affairs according to rules and regulations has created a good situation in the whole army
in which party committees make decisions according to law, organs give guidance according to law,
troops act according to law, and officers and men perform their duties according to law.

3. Build the people's army into a world-class army

Speeding up the building of the people's army into a world-class army is the political demand and
ardent expectation of the party and the people for the people's army in the new era, an inevitable
requirement for realizing the "two centenary goals" and realizing the Chinese dream of the great
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and also a call to action for all officers and men to promote the
practice of strengthening the army.

The people's army shoulders the historical mission of providing strategic support for the realization
of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. In the new era, profound changes have taken place
in the connotation and extension of China's security, in the field of time and space, and in internal
and external factors. The period when we move from big to strong and strong is often a high-risk
period for national security, and the more we develop and grow, the greater the pressure and
resistance we face. This is an unavoidable challenge in the process of China's development from big
to strong, and it is the threshold that cannot be bypassed to realize the great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation. "A strong country must strengthen its army, and a strong army can ensure national
security."1 National defense and army building are the strong backing of national security, military
means are the means to guarantee the realization of great dreams, military struggle is an important
aspect of waging great struggle, and the ability to win is a strategic capability for safeguarding
national security. Comrade Xi Jinping profoundly pointed out that our military must provide
strategic support for consolidating the leadership of the Communist Party of China and China's
socialist system, providing strategic support for safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and
territorial integrity, providing strategic support for expanding China's overseas interests, and
providing strategic support for promoting world peace and development. This is the mission and
task entrusted by the party and the people to the people's army in the new era, the strategic
requirement to support the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, and the full value of our army.
This requires the whole army to strengthen its mission responsibility, enhance its sense of distress
and enterprising spirit, and accelerate its ability to fulfill its mission and tasks in the new era with a
sense of urgency that time does not wait for us and only seize the day.

The people's army has taken firm steps on the road of strengthening the army with Chinese
characteristics. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi
Jinping has focused on realizing the Chinese dream and the dream of strengthening the army

Comprehensively grasp the general international and domestic trends, closely focus on building a
people's army that obeys the command of the party, can win battles and has a good work style, put
forward a series of major principles and principles, made a series of major policy decisions and
arrangements, promoted a series of major tasks, made a series of major tasks, made every effort to
promote the modernization of national defense and the army, led the people's army to take firm steps
on the road of strengthening the army with Chinese characteristics, achieved historic achievements
and historic changes, and led national defense and army building into a new era. This is mainly
reflected in: revitalizing the political program, unswervingly promoting political rectification and
training, and effectively solving the conspicuous problem of weakening the party's absolute
leadership over the army; reshaping the organizational form, boldly deepening reform in an all-
round way, and effectively solving the conspicuous problems restricting the institutional structure
of our army's construction; reorganizing the pattern of struggle, firmly defending the core interests
of the country, and effectively solving the outstanding problems in the use and use of military forces;
reconstructing the layout of construction, innovating development concepts and methods, and
effectively solving the problem that our army's construction is not enough to focus on actual combat.
The conspicuous problem of poor quality and efficiency; re-establishing the image of work style,
vigorously promoting healthy tendencies, discipline and anti-corruption, and effectively solving the
conspicuous problems of unhealthy tendencies and corruption breeding and spreading. The
achievement of these historic achievements and the occurrence of historic changes fundamentally
lie in the strong leadership of Comrade Xi Jinping, the core of the Party Central Committee, the core
of the whole Party and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and in the scientific guidance
of Xi Jinping's thinking on strengthening the military. Xi Jinping Thought on Strengthening the
Army, leading the practice of strengthening the army and sublimating it in the practice of
strengthening the army, is the crystallization of the practical experience and wisdom of the people's
army since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and is a fundamental
achievement in building and managing the army and strengthening the army in the new era. To
realize the modernization of national defense and the armed forces, we must firmly establish the
guiding position of Xi Jinping's thinking on strengthening the military in national defense and army
building.

Grasp the strategic arrangements for comprehensively promoting the modernization of national
defense and the armed forces. The 19th CPC National Congress put forward a road map, timetable,
and mission statement for comprehensively promoting the modernization of national defense and
the armed forces. That is, to adapt to the development trend of the world's new military revolution
and the needs of national security, improve the quality and efficiency of construction, ensure that
mechanization is basically realized by 2020, major progress has been made in informationization
construction, and strategic capabilities have been greatly improved. In line with the process of
national modernization, we will comprehensively promote the modernization of military theory, the
organizational form of the armed forces, the modernization of military personnel, and the
modernization of weapons and equipment, strive to basically modernize national defense and the
armed forces by 2035, and comprehensively build the people's army into a world-class army by the
middle of this century. This strategic arrangement embodies the requirements of the times in line
with the process of national modernization and development, embodies the strategic requirements
of socialist construction with Chinese characteristics for strengthening the army in the new era, and
demonstrates the determination and courage of the Communist Party of China to accelerate the pace
of building a strong army.

The whole army should firmly grasp the goals and tasks of national defense and army building,
concentrate efforts to tackle tough problems, grasp quick work, and work through to the end with a
blueprint to ensure that it is built into a world-class army as scheduled.
Grasp the strategic priorities of national defense and army modernization. The modernization of
national defense and the armed forces is a systematic project, with a myriad of problems, and it is
necessary to pinpoint strategic priorities and promote overall improvement with key breakthroughs.
The first is to build a joint operations command system, build a strong and efficient theater joint
operations command organization, open up the command link of the whole system and process of
joint operations, and promote the improvement of the joint operation capability of the whole army.
The second is to build a new type of military management system, improve the strategic
management link of "demand one planning, one budget, one implementation and one assessment",
and improve the operational efficiency of military systems and the quality and efficiency of our
military construction. The third is to build a modern military force system, coordinate the
construction of all parties in various fields, coordinate the construction of combat forces, support
and support forces, and promote the overall improvement of our military's force system. The fourth
is to build a new-type military training system, persist in actual combat training and joint combat
training, persist in promoting construction with training and combining training with application,
and improve the level of actual combat training. Fifth, vigorously implement the strategic project of
qualified personnel, strengthen the construction of a new-type military personnel training system of
"trinity" in military academies and schools, military training practice, and military vocational
education, and promote the overall leap in the level of personnel construction. Sixth, build a national
defense science and technology innovation system, accelerate the development of high-tech
weapons and equipment, and improve the quality of weapons and equipment and the scientific level
of architecture. The seventh is to build a modern military policy and institutional system,
systematically plan, forward-looking, and overall reshape the policy system, and create an
institutional environment with strong constraints and effective incentives. The eighth is to build a
military-civilian integration development system, gradually realize the integration of the country's
strategic layout in all fields, the integration of strategic resources, and the integrated use of strategic
forces, accelerate the formation of an all-factor, multi-field, and high-efficiency pattern of in-depth
development of military-civilian integration, give play to the political advantages of the socialist
system that can concentrate on major things, and maximize the comprehensive benefits of economic
construction and national defense construction. At the same time, we should vigorously carry
forward the glorious tradition of loving the people and supporting the army, improve and implement
the honor system for military personnel, strengthen the management and guarantee of retired
servicemen, safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of military personnel and their families,
strengthen national defense education for the whole people, improve the national defense
mobilization system, consolidate and develop rock-solid military-government and military-civilian
relations, and unite the powerful force for building a world-class army.

Section 3: Promoting the complete reunification of the motherland

Accomplishing the reunification of the motherland is one of the three major historical tasks of the
CPC and is where the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation lie.

Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping, based on
the long-term development of the cause of the party and the country, has systematically summed up
the successful experience of the practice of "one country, two systems", profoundly expounded the
basic position and major principles of adhering to the principle of "one country, two systems" and
promoting the great cause of the reunification of the motherland, and clearly established adherence
to "one country, two systems" and the promotion of the reunification of the motherland as the basic
strategy for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, fully
reflecting that the party's understanding of the law of the practice of "one country, two systems" has
reached a new height.

1. National reunification is a historical necessity for the Chinese nation to move toward great rejuvenation

National rejuvenation and national reunification are the trend of the times, the great righteousness,
and the aspiration of the people. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Maintaining the long-term
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao and realizing the complete reunification of the
motherland are inevitable requirements for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 1
"Unification is strong, division must be chaotic", this is a historical law. The American Civil War
stopped the division of the country, safeguarded the unity of the United States, and laid an objective
foundation for the United States to become a world power. As a country with an ancient civilization
of 5,000 years, China has encountered many times in history and has a profound understanding of
the harm of national division. After the modern era, due to the corruption and incompetence of the
feudal ruling clique, the gradual decline of national strength, and the deep suffering of the Chinese
nation, Macao and Hong Kong were forced to leave the embrace of the motherland, especially after
the Sino-Japanese War in 1894, the Qing Dynasty was forced to cede Taiwan to Japan, and Taiwan
was invaded and occupied by foreign peoples for half a century, "leaving heart-wrenching pain for
compatriots on both sides of the strait.”2 At that time, the history of China was full of national
humiliation and the sorrow and indignation of the people. In 1945, the victory of the War of
Resistance and the restoration of Taiwan washed away half a century of national humiliation. In
1949, the Communist Party of China led the Chinese people to win national independence and
people's liberation, established New China, and achieved the complete reunification of the mainland
of the motherland by 1951. 3 But Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao are still floating away. After
several generations of Chinese Communists' relay struggle, in the 90s of the 20th century, Hong
Kong and Macao successively returned to the embrace of the motherland, and the great cause of the
motherland's reunification took solid steps.

Resolving the Taiwan issue and realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is the
common aspiration of all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and the fundamental interests
of the Chinese nation.

The fact that the two sides of the strait have not yet been completely reunified is a wound left by
history to the Chinese nation. Cross-strait Chinese should make joint efforts to seek national
reunification and heal the wounds of history. The broad masses of Taiwan compatriots are all
members of the Chinese nation, and they should do their Chinese in an upright manner and regard
promoting the complete reunification of the country and jointly seeking the great rejuvenation of
the nation as the most glorious cause. At present, to grasp the overall situation of cross-strait
relations from the overall interests of the Chinese nation, the most fundamental and core thing is to
safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. Since 2016, Taiwan's political situation has
undergone major changes, and the Taiwan authorities do not recognize that both sides of the strait
belong to "one China", which has undermined the political foundation for the peaceful development
of cross-strait relations. Comrade Xi Jinping has made many important speeches on the situation in
the Taiwan Strait, expounding the principled position of adhering to the "consensus of '92" and
safeguarding the peaceful development of cross-strait relations, and declaring his firm will and
determination to oppose and curb any form of "Taiwan independence.” Comrade Xi Jinping stressed:
"We have firm will, full confidence and sufficient ability to thwart any form of 'Taiwan
independence' separatist attempt." We will never allow anyone, any organization, any political party,
at any time, in any form, to separate any piece of Chinese territory from China!" 1 These solemn
declarations of "any" embody the firm will of the whole party and the people of all ethnic groups
throughout the country to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
To realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Taiwan compatriots will certainly not be
absent. Taiwan's future lies in national reunification, and the well-being of Taiwan compatriots
depends on national rejuvenation. The peaceful development of cross-strait relations is the correct
path for safeguarding cross-strait peace, promoting common development between the two sides of
the strait and benefiting compatriots on both sides of the strait. The peaceful development of cross-
strait relations should be jointly promoted by compatriots on both sides of the strait, jointly
safeguarded by compatriots on both sides of the strait, and shared by compatriots on both sides of
the strait. The Chinese dream is the common dream of compatriots on both sides of the strait, and
only when the nation is rejuvenated and the country is strong and prosperous can the Chinese on
both sides of the strait live a prosperous and beautiful life. In the process of the great rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation, compatriots on both sides of the strait should join hands to realize the Chinese
dream, shoulder the responsibility of national rejuvenation, and share the glory of national
rejuvenation. The Taiwan issue arises from national weakness and chaos, and it is bound to end with
national rejuvenation! Supporting and pursuing national reunification is a national righteousness
and should be affirmed by the whole nation. After peaceful reunification,


With a strong motherland to rely on, Taiwan will always maintain peace, the people will live and
work in peace and contentment, the livelihood and well-being of Taiwan compatriots will be better,
the space for development will be greater, and the waist pole will be harder, the confidence will be
more sufficient, and it will be safer and more dignified in the international arena.

2. "peaceful reunification and one country, two systems" is the best way to
achieve national reunification

The principle of "one country, two systems" on how to resolve the problem of relations between
regions with two different social systems within a country and the reunification of one country is an
invention of the Chinese Communists, a great initiative in the history of mankind, a new idea and
new plan provided by China for the international community to solve similar problems, and a new
contribution made by the Chinese nation to world peace and development. The concept of "one
country, two systems" adheres to the "one China" principle, maintains the coexistence of "two
systems," and allows Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao a high degree of autonomy, which not only
embodies the principle of realizing the reunification of the motherland and safeguarding national
sovereignty, but also fully considers the history and reality of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao,
embodies a high degree of flexibility, and is the basic principle for promoting the great cause of the
peaceful reunification of the motherland. Adhering to the principle of "one country, two systems"
and deeply promoting the practice of "one country, two systems" conforms to the interests of Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Macao residents, the actual needs of prosperity and stability in Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macao, the fundamental interests of the country, and the common will of the people of the whole
country. With regard to the implementation of the principle of "one country, two systems," the CPC
should pay special attention to two points: First, it should be unswerving, unchanging, and
unwavering; second, it should be comprehensive and accurate, ensuring that "one country, two
systems" will not deviate or deform in practice, and will always advance in the correct direction.
The core of "one country, two systems" lies in "one country.” Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out:
"'One country' is the root, and deep roots can make Ye Mao; 'One country' is the foundation, and
the foundation can prosper.1 "One country" is the premise and basis for the implementation of "two
systems", which are subordinate to and derived from "one country" and unified within "one country.”
The "two systems" within "one country" are not equal and shoulder to shoulder, and the main body
of the country must implement the socialist system. Under this premise, proceeding from reality, we
should fully take into account the historical and current conditions of Taiwan, Hong Kong and
Macao, and allow them to keep the capitalist system unchanged for a long time. Therefore, the
adherence of the main body of the state to the socialist system is the premise and guarantee for Hong
Kong and Macao to implement the capitalist system and maintain prosperity and stability. The
proposal of "one country, two systems" is first of all to realize and safeguard national unity.

During the Sino-British negotiations on Hong Kong's return, the Chinese government made a clear
statement that the sovereignty issue could not be discussed. After Hong Kong's return to the
motherland, it is all the more necessary to firmly safeguard national sovereignty, security and
development interests. In the practice of governance in Hong Kong and Macao, it is necessary to
firmly establish the awareness of "one country", adhere to the principle of "one country", and
correctly handle the relationship between the SAR and the central government. Any activity that
endangers national sovereignty and security, challenges the authority of the central authorities and
the Basic Law of the Special Administrative Region, and uses Hong Kong and Macao to infiltrate
and sabotage the mainland is a violation of the bottom line and must not be allowed. On the basis
of "one country," the relationship between the "two systems" should and can be harmonious and
mutually reinforcing.

"One country, two systems" is the best solution to problems left over from history and realize
national reunification. Different systems are not an obstacle to unification, let alone an excuse for
division. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that to solve the Taiwan issue and realize the complete
reunification of the motherland, we must continue to adhere to the principle of "peaceful
reunification and one country, two systems", promote the peaceful development of cross-strait
relations, and advance the peace process of the motherland's reunification. "One country, two
systems" is not only the best solution to the Hong Kong and Macao issues left over from history,
but also the best way to resolve the Taiwan issue and realize the complete reunification of the
motherland, and the best system for maintaining Taiwan's long-term prosperity and stability after
cross-strait reunification. "One country, two systems" "embodies the Chinese wisdom of being
inclusive and tolerant, fully considers Taiwan's actual situation, and is conducive to Taiwan's long-
term peace and stability after reunification.”1

3. Maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao

Since the return of Hong Kong and Macao, the practice of "one country, two systems" has achieved
universally recognized success. For more than 20 years, "one country, two systems" has been
successfully practiced in Hong Kong and Macao, and has grown vigorously and yielded fruitful
results in the storm. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Hong Kong's economic growth
rate has been in the forefront of developed economies, and its status as an international financial,
shipping and trade center has been further consolidated, and it has become one of the most dynamic
cities in Asia, one of the freest economies in the world and one of the most competitive economies
in the world. Since Macao's return to the motherland, Macao has enjoyed social stability, economic
development, residents living and working in peace and contentment, and multiculturalism has
developed well, and is striving to achieve its goal of becoming a world center of tourism and leisure.
The development of Hong Kong and Macao has fully proved that the principle of "one country, two
systems" is correct and that the practice of "one country, two systems" is successful.

To maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, it is necessary to fully
and accurately implement the principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong", "Macao people administering Macao" and a high degree of autonomy,
improve the system for the central authorities to exercise overall jurisdiction over the SAR in
accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, improve the system and mechanism for the
appointment and removal of the chief executive and principal officials of the SAR, the system of
interpretation of the Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and
exercise the powers entrusted to the Central Committee by the Constitution and the Basic Law in
accordance with the law. Persist in administering Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the
law, safeguard the constitutional order established by the Constitution and the Basic Law, establish
and improve the SAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security,
and support the SAR in strengthening its law enforcement forces; improve the degree of
accountability of the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region to the Central
Government, and support the Chief Executive and the SAR Government in their administration in
accordance with the law. To fully and accurately implement the principles of "one country, two
systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong", "Macao people administering Macao"
and a high degree of autonomy, it is necessary to combine upholding the principle of "one country"
with respecting the differences between the "two systems", safeguarding the central government's
overall jurisdiction over the SAR and guaranteeing the SAR's right to a high degree of autonomy,
giving play to the strong backing role of the motherland's hinterland, and enhancing the SAR's own
competitiveness. Improve the SAR's systems and mechanisms related to the implementation of the
Constitution and the Basic Law, adhere to the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and "Macao people administering Macao" with patriots as the main body, and improve the
SAR's ability and level of governance according to law.

To maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, we will never tolerate
any behavior that challenges the bottom line of "one country, two systems" and any act of separatism,
and resolutely prevent and curb the interference of external forces in Hong Kong and Macao affairs
and separatism, subversion, infiltration and sabotage activities. Hong Kong is a pluralistic society,
and it is not surprising that there are different opinions or even major differences on some specific
issues, but it should not fall into the vortex of "pan-politicization" and trample on the political
bottom line of "one country, two systems.” Hong Kong is an inseparable part of the country, and
under no circumstances will it be allowed to engage in "Hong Kong independence" or so-called
"self-determination" in any form, which is the untouchable bottom line under "one country, two
systems.” In September 2014, a small number of people in Hong Kong launched an illegal assembly
to "Occupy Central", which seriously affected Hong Kong's rule of law tradition, disrupted Hong
Kong's social order, and affected the lives of Hong Kong people. The CPC Central Committee with
Comrade Xi Jinping at the core has fully and accurately implemented the principle of "one country,
two systems", firmly grasped the central government's overall jurisdiction over Hong Kong and
Macao under the Constitution and the Basic Law, and thwarted the "Occupy Central" farce plotted
by separatist forces at home and abroad to disrupt Hong Kong, and has maintained the prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong and Macao. On 7 November 2016, the 24th Session of the Standing
Committee of the 12th National People's Congress adopted the Interpretation of Article 104 of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

This interpretation of the law conforms to the voice of the people and declares the central
government's firm stand of safeguarding national security and the strong will of the entire Chinese
people to oppose separatism. On September 24, 2018, the Secretary for Security of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Government issued an order prohibiting the pro-independence
"Hong Kong National Party" from operating in Hong Kong. On 19 February 2019, the Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Council made a decision confirming
the validity of the order of the Secretary for Security and that the Central People's Government
supports the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in banning the "Hong
Kong National Party" operate in accordance with the law. In April 2019, the Government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region introduced into the Legislative Council the Fugitive
Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment) Bill 2019 to enable Hong
Kong to commence case-by-case co-operation with jurisdictions that do not yet have long-term
mutual legal assistance arrangements. The initial aim was to address the issue of the transfer of Hong
Kong residents suspected of murder in Taiwan while closing loopholes in Hong Kong's existing
legal system. On June 9, the Hong Kong opposition and "Hong Kong independence" forces carried
out various radical protest activities in the name of "anti-extradition bill" peaceful marches and
rallies, causing a "storm over the amendment of the extradition bill." ”. With the demagoguery and
incitement of the opposition and the intervention of external forces, various illegal activities such as
"Hong Kong independence", separatism, violent terrorist activities have intensified, and the national
security risks of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have become increasingly
prominent. In this regard, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that the continuous radical and violent
crimes in Hong Kong have seriously trampled on the rule of law and social order, seriously
undermined Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and seriously challenged the bottom line of the
"one country, two systems" principle. The Chinese government is unswerving in its determination
to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, unswervingly in its
determination to implement the principle of "one country, two systems", and unswerving in its
determination to oppose interference in Hong Kong affairs by any external forces.1 This provides
important guidelines for safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests,
adhering to and improving the "one country, two systems" institutional system, safeguarding Hong
Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of
Hong Kong residents.

On 28 May 2020, the Third Session of the 13th National People's Congress voted to adopt the
Decision of the National People's Congress on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and
Implementation Mechanism for Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region. On June 30, the 20th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th
National People's Congress unanimously passed the vote

The Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (hereinafter referred to as the "Hong Kong National Security Law")
and listed it in Annex III of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the
People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the "Hong Kong Basic Law"). The Hong Kong
National Security Law clearly stipulates the duties and institutions of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region for safeguarding national security, four types of crimes and punishments:
secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, collusion with foreign countries or external
forces to endanger national security, case jurisdiction, application of law and procedures, and the
organs of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for
safeguarding national security, etc., and establishes a legal system and enforcement mechanism for
safeguarding national security in the Region. This is the second important law specially formulated
by the central government for Hong Kong after the Hong Kong Basic Law, which is of great and
far-reaching significance for adhering to and improving the "one country, two systems" institutional
system, safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, and ensuring Hong
Kong's long-term peace and stability, long-term prosperity and stability. In accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region has established a Committee for Safeguarding National Security, which is
responsible for safeguarding national security affairs in the Region, assumes the primary
responsibility for safeguarding national security, and accepts supervision and accountability from
the Central People's Government. The Central People's Government shall establish the Office for
Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to perform its
duties and exercise relevant powers in accordance with law. Since its promulgation and
implementation, the Hong Kong National Security Law has formed a powerful deterrent to various
anti-China and destabilizing forces inside and outside Hong Kong, providing a solid institutional
guarantee for safeguarding Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.

To maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, it is necessary to
improve the mechanism for integrating Hong Kong and Macao into the overall development of the
country, complementing each other's advantages with the mainland and coordinating development,
promoting the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, supporting
Hong Kong and Macao in developing the economy and improving people's livelihood, and focusing
on resolving deep-seated contradictions and problems affecting social stability and long-term
development. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "In the process of national reform and opening up in
the new era, Hong Kong and Macao still have special status and unique advantages, and can still
play an irreplaceable role." "For Hong Kong and Macao, 'one country, two systems' is the biggest
advantage, the country's reform and opening up is the biggest stage, and the implementation of
national strategies such as the joint construction of the 'Belt and Road' and the construction of the
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is a new major opportunity.1 The construction of
the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is a new measure to promote the formation
of a new pattern of comprehensive opening up in the new era, and it is also a new practice to promote
the development of the cause of "one country, two systems.”

Since the reform and opening up, especially after the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the
motherland, the cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao has been continuously
deepened, the economic strength and regional competitiveness of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-
Macao Greater Bay Area have been significantly enhanced, and the basic conditions for building a
world-class bay area and a world-class city cluster have been met. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao
Bridge spans the Lingding Ocean, connects Hong Kong to the east, Zhuhai and Macao to the west,
connecting the world's most dynamic economic circle, and is of far-reaching significance to the
integration of Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai. Relying on the advantages of Hong Kong and Macao

4. Resolutely advance the process of peaceful reunification of the motherland
The motherland must and will be reunified. This is the historical conclusion of the development of
cross-strait relations, and it is also an inevitable requirement for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation in the new era. Cross-strait Chinese and the sons and daughters of China at home and abroad
should shoulder the great national righteousness, conform to the general trend of history, and jointly
promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations and the process of peaceful reunification
of the motherland.

First, explore the "one country, two systems" Taiwan plan to enrich the practice of peaceful
reunification. "One country, two systems" was originally proposed to take care of Taiwan's actual
situation and safeguard the interests and well-being of Taiwan compatriots. The specific form of
realizing "one country, two systems" in Taiwan will give full consideration to Taiwan's actual
situation, fully absorb the opinions and suggestions of all circles on both sides of the strait, and fully
take into account the interests and feelings of Taiwan compatriots. Under the premise of ensuring
national sovereignty, security and development interests, after peaceful reunification, the social
system and way of life of Taiwan compatriots will be fully respected, and their private property,
religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests will be fully guaranteed.
Cross-strait political consultations will be held on the basis of the one-China principle. Compatriots
on both sides of the strait are one family, and cross-strait affairs are family affair of compatriots on
both sides of the strait, and of course they should also be discussed and handled by family members.
Peaceful reunification means consultation on an equal footing and joint discussion of reunification.
The long-standing political differences between the two sides of the strait are the general root cause
affecting the stability and long-term development of cross-strait relations, and they cannot be passed
on from generation to generation.

The two sides of the strait should adopt an attitude of responsibility to the nation and future
generations, pool wisdom, give play to creativity, converge and assimilate differences, strive to
resolve political confrontation at an early date, realize lasting peace in the Taiwan Strait, and achieve
the vision of national reunification. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that on the basis of the one-
China principle, there are no obstacles to any political party or group in Taiwan interacting with us.
Only by replacing confrontation with dialogue, replacing strife with cooperation, and replacing zero-
sum with win-win can cross-strait relations be stable and far-reaching. We are willing to conduct
dialogue and communication with all political parties, organizations and personages in Taiwan on
cross-strait political issues and issues related to promoting the process of peaceful reunification of
the motherland, extensively exchange views, seek social consensus and advance political
negotiations. Comrade Xi Jinping also proposed that "on the common political basis of adhering to
the '92 consensus' and opposing 'Taiwan independence', all political parties and sectors on both sides
of the strait should nominate representative personages to carry out extensive and in-depth
democratic consultations on cross-strait relations and the future of the nation, and reach institutional
arrangements for promoting the peaceful development of cross-strait relations."1
Second, adhere to the one-China principle and safeguard the prospects for peaceful reunification.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out, "Reunification is the general trend of history and the right path.
'Taiwan independence' is a historical countercurrent and a dead end. " 2 Although the two sides of
the Taiwan Strait have not yet been completely reunified, China's sovereignty and territory have
never been divided, and the fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to the same China has never
changed. The reunification of the two sides of the strait is an end to political confrontation, not a
rebuilding of territory and sovereignty. The one-China principle is the political foundation of cross-
strait relations. By adhering to the one-China principle, cross-strait relations can be improved and
developed, and Taiwan compatriots will benefit. Deviating from the one-China principle will lead
to tension and turbulence in cross-strait relations and harm the vital interests of Taiwan compatriots.
We adhere to the policy of pinning our hopes on the Taiwan people, respect Taiwan compatriots,
care for them, unite with Taiwan compatriots, rely on Taiwan compatriots, and wholeheartedly do
practical things, do good deeds, and solve difficulties for Taiwan compatriots. We are willing to
create broad space for peaceful reunification, but we will never leave any space for various forms
of "Taiwan independence" separatist activities. Chinese don't hit Chinese. We do not undertake to
renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary measures, which are aimed
at the interference of external forces and the very small number of "Taiwan independence"
separatists and their separatist activities, and absolutely not at Taiwan compatriots. Compatriots on
both sides of the strait should work together for peace, safeguard peace, and share peace.
Third, deepen cross-strait integration and development and lay a solid foundation for peaceful
reunification. Compatriots on both sides of the strait are linked by blood.

Dear friends, Chinese to help Chinese. We treat Taiwan compatriots equally, take the lead in sharing
mainland development opportunities with Taiwan compatriots, and provide equal treatment for
Taiwan compatriots and Taiwan enterprises, so that everyone can have more sense of gain. Since
the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the degree of cross-strait economic
and cultural exchanges and cooperation has been continuously deepened, and the integration and
development of the two sides of the strait has reached a new level. In 2018, the mainland's trade
volume with Taiwan reached US$226.24 billion, and Taiwan is the mainland's fifth largest trading
partner and third largest source of imports, and the mainland is Taiwan's largest trading partner and
source of trade surplus. Among them, the mainland's exports to Taiwan were $48.647 billion, up
10.6 percent, imports from Taiwan were $177.598 billion, up 13.9 percent, and the mainland's trade
deficit with Taiwan was $128.951 billion. By the end of 2018, a total of 107,190 Taiwan-funded
projects had been approved, accounting for 11.2% of the total number of foreign-funded projects
actually used. By the end of 2018, more than 100 million Taiwan residents had come to the mainland.
The two associations have continuously strengthened consultations in the economic fields such as
finance, agriculture, shipping, taxation and nuclear power, as well as in the fields of people's
livelihood such as medicine and health, disaster monitoring and food safety, and established
institutionalized contact mechanisms for information exchange, personnel exchange visits and crisis
management, greatly expanding the fields of cross-strait exchanges and cooperation and enhancing
the well-being of compatriots on both sides of the strait.

It is necessary to actively promote the institutionalization of cross-strait economic cooperation, build
a cross-strait common market, add impetus to development, add vitality to cooperation, and
strengthen the economy of the Chinese nation. The two sides of the strait should make every effort
to improve smooth economic and trade cooperation, infrastructure connectivity, energy and resource
connectivity, and common industry standards, and take the lead in realizing water, electricity, gas,
and bridges between Kinmen and Matsu and the coastal areas of Fujian. It is necessary to promote
cross-strait cooperation in culture and education, medical and health care, social security and sharing
of public resources, and support the equalization, universalization and convenience of basic public
services in areas adjacent to the two sides of the strait or with similar conditions. The 2017 Central
Work Conference on Taiwan proposed to provide "national treatment" for the Taiwanese people.
On February 28, 2018, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, the Organization Department
of the Central Committee of the National Development and Reform Commission and other
departments issued Several Measures on Promoting Cross-Strait Economic and Cultural Exchanges
and Cooperation ("31 Measures to Benefit Taiwan from the Mainland"). It clearly points out that
we should actively promote the acceleration of equal treatment for Taiwan-funded enterprises and
mainland enterprises in the field of investment and economic cooperation, and gradually provide
Taiwan compatriots with the same treatment as mainland compatriots in studying, starting
businesses, employment, and living on the mainland. On November 4, 2019, 20 relevant
departments, including the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and the Organization
Department of the Central Committee of Economic and Commercial Affairs of the National
Development and Reform Commission, issued Several Measures on Further Promoting Cross-Strait
Economic and Cultural Exchanges and Cooperation ("26 Measures");

It involves 13 measures to provide equal treatment for Taiwan enterprises to participate in
investment and construction of major technical equipment, 5G, circular economy, civil aviation,
theme parks, new financial organizations, etc., and 13 measures to provide more convenience and
support for Taiwan compatriots in consular protection, agricultural cooperation, transportation,
communication fees, housing purchase qualifications, culture and sports, title evaluation, classified
recruitment, etc. These measures have brought great opportunities and a real sense of gain to
Taiwan-funded enterprises and Taiwan compatriots.

Fourth, realize the spiritual unity of compatriots on both sides of the strait and enhance the identity
of peaceful reunification. The soul of the country is forged by culture. Compatriots on both sides of
the strait share the same roots, the same language, and the same species, and Chinese culture is the
root vein and belonging of the hearts of compatriots on both sides of the strait. The national
reunification we are pursuing is not only formal reunification, but more importantly, the spiritual
unity of compatriots on both sides of the strait. We understand the mentality formed by Taiwan
compatriots due to special historical encounters and different social environments, respect the social
system and way of life chosen by Taiwan compatriots themselves, and are willing to use sincerity,
goodwill and family affection to narrow the psychological distance between compatriots on both
sides of the strait. At the same time, Taiwan compatriots also need to know and understand more
about the feelings and mentality of mainland compatriots, and respect the choices and pursuits of
mainland compatriots. The fellowship of people is in the heart. No matter how many disturbances
and obstacles we encounter, exchanges and cooperation between compatriots on both sides of the
strait cannot be stopped, interrupted, or reduced. Compatriots on both sides of the strait should
jointly inherit the excellent traditional Chinese culture and promote its creative transformation and
innovative development. Compatriots on both sides of the strait should exchange and learn from
each other, engage in dialogue and tolerance, promote themselves and others, compare hearts to
hearts, deepen mutual understanding, and enhance mutual trust and recognition. It is necessary to
uphold the feelings of compatriots and empathy, educate future generations with a correct view of
history, nationality, and country, and carry forward the great national spirit. Between relatives, there
is no knot that cannot be untied. After a long period of meritorious service, we will certainly be able
to achieve the spiritual harmony of compatriots on both sides of the strait.

In short, "one country, two systems" has strong vitality, and realizing the complete reunification of
the motherland in accordance with the principle of "one country, two systems" is the common
aspiration of all Chinese people and the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation. As long as all
the sons and daughters of China, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, conform
to the general trend of history, shoulder the great national righteousness, and firmly hold the destiny
of the nation in their own hands, they will certainly be able to realize the peaceful reunification of
the motherland and jointly create a bright future for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
