Chapter XIII: A Strong Guarantee for National Rejuvenation

Safeguarding national security, strengthening military support, and realizing the complete
reunification of the motherland are the inevitable requirements for adhering to and developing
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and are also a strong guarantee for realizing
the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has grasped the
overall strategic situation of realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation, conducted in-depth theoretical and practical explorations, creatively put forward the
adherence to the overall concept of national security, established and formed Xi Jinping Thought on
strengthening the military, profoundly expounded the basic position and major principles of
adhering to "one country, two systems" and promoting the great cause of the complete reunification
of the motherland, and raised the CPC's understanding of the law of national security, the law of
strengthening the people's army and the practical law of "one country, two systems" to a new height:
The new realm has become an important part of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese
characteristics for a new era.

Section 1: Adhere to the overall concept of national security
Adhering to the overall concept of national security is put forward by Comrade Xi Jinping based on
the new characteristics and new trends of the development of the national security situation, on the
basis of better coordinating the overall situation at home and abroad, security and development, in
order to better solve the new problems and challenges facing national security. The overall concept
of national security profoundly reveals the essence of China's national security, scientifically
answers how as a large developing socialist country can solve the common security problems faced
in the process of development and the special security problems faced by itself, and realize the
party's historic leap in national security theory.

It is the latest achievement of China's national security theory, which provides a program of action
and scientific guide for better safeguarding national security in the new era.

1. national security is a top priority
National security is the basic prerequisite for the survival and development of the country, and the
fundamental guarantee for ensuring that the Party will never degenerate, that the red rivers and
mountains will never change color, and that the process of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation will not be slowed down or interrupted.

Since the founding of New China, the party has always attached great importance to the issue of
national security, always regarded safeguarding national security as a basic task of the party and the
state, accumulated rich experience in practice, formed national security thinking in different periods,
and provided a strong guarantee for safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic
groups and promoting the historic achievements of the cause of the party and the country. In the
early days after the founding of New China, the main characteristic of national security was to
safeguard sovereignty and security. Comrade Mao Zedong regarded defending the newborn regime,
ensuring national independence, and safeguarding national sovereignty and territorial integrity as
the primary tasks of safeguarding national security, and made full use of the characteristics and main
contradictions of the world pattern at that time to effectively safeguard and improve the national
security environment. In the new period of reform and opening up, the main feature of national
security is to maintain development security. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that peace and
development are the two major themes in today's world, and national security should escort
economic construction. We must adhere to the four basic principles and adhere to "stability above
all", not only to ensure the socialist direction of reform and opening up, but also to create a stable
domestic and international environment for socialist modernization. In view of the complex and
ever-changing regional environment, Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward a new security concept of
"mutual trust, mutual benefit, equality, and cooperation." Comrade Hu Jintao stressed the need to
examine national security issues from a broader perspective, put forward the concept of peaceful
development, and promote the building of a harmonious world of lasting peace and common
prosperity.

Socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the connotation and extension of
China's national security are richer than at any time in history, the field of time and space is broader
than at any time in history, internal and external factors are more complex than at any time in history,
and various foreseeable and unforeseeable security risks and challenges are unprecedented.
Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Enhancing the awareness of adversity and being prepared for
danger in times of peace is a major principle that we must always adhere to in administering the
party and the country."

Our party should consolidate its ruling position, unite and lead the people to uphold and develop
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and ensure national security as the top priority. ‚Äù1
From the perspective of the external environment, the world today is in a major change
unprecedented in a century, and the instability and uncertainty it faces are becoming increasingly
prominent. Great development brings great changes, and great changes promote great adjustments.
The trend of peace, development, cooperation and win-win results of the times has become stronger,
but in the changing world, dangerous shoals and reefs have become prominent, and various risks
and challenges have accelerated the accumulation. First, the complexity is prominent. The
momentum of world economic growth is insufficient, protectionism and unilateralism are becoming
increasingly serious, competition among major countries is becoming increasingly fierce, regional
hot spots are emerging one after another, non-traditional security threats such as terrorism, cyber
security, and climate change are complex and severe, and continue to spread, and various security
risks are transmitted and superimposed, accumulating and escalating. Second, the transnational
nature is prominent. The security shortcomings of any country will lead to a large influx of external
risks, forming a security risk depression. The accumulation of security risks in any country to a
certain extent will spill over into regional or even global security issues. Third, diversity is
outstanding. Old problems have emerged under the means of new technologies, and security threats
in new fields such as the deep sea, polar regions, outer space, and the Internet are constantly breeding.
Fourth, the linkage is outstanding. Security issues are closely linked to political, economic, cultural,
religious and ethnic issues, and traditional and non-traditional security threats are intertwined.
Various security issues are intertwined and interact with each other, creating a fission effect. The
probability of small risks evolving into large risks, individual risks into comprehensive risks, local
risks into systemic risks, economic risks into socio-political risks, and international risks into
domestic risks has increased significantly. As Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Change will give
rise to new opportunities, but the process of change is often full of risks and challenges, and mankind
once again stands at a crossroads."2
Judging from its own situation, China is in a new historical position, and the connotation and
extension of national security have undergone profound changes. At present, China is in a critical
period of development and transformation from a big country to a strong country. This is not only a
period of historical convergence for the realization of the "two centenary goals", but also a period
of mutual agitation that is synchronously intertwined with the great changes in the world that have
not been seen in a century; it is not only a period of important strategic opportunities, but also a
period of highlighting major security risks; it is not only a period of shaping global security, but also
a critical period for improving capabilities, making up for shortcomings, and strengthening
weaknesses.

Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation is by no means easy
and can be achieved by banging gongs and drums.1 In modern times, the process of the rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation has been interrupted many times, leaving us with a profound warning.
Historical opportunities are fleeting, and risks and challenges are everywhere. The road ahead
cannot be smooth, and the closer we get to the goal, the greater the resistance and risk pressure to
move forward. In the face of the treacherous international situation, the complex and sensitive
surrounding environment, the arduous and arduous tasks of reform, development, and stability, and
the requirement of decisively building a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way and
marching toward the goal of the second centenary struggle, in order to win the initiative in the era
of profound changes and win victory in the great struggle, it is necessary to grasp the new issues
facing national security from a longer-term strategic perspective and constantly open up a new
situation in national security.

In this context, the overall concept of national security came into being. Since the 18th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's national security work system and mechanism
have been continuously improved, the national security legal system has gradually taken shape, the
national security strategy has been continuously improved, and the national security capability has
been significantly improved, which fundamentally lies in the strong leadership of the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core and the strategic guidance of the overall national
security concept.
