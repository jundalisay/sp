Section 3: Adhere to the new development concept to lead the overall development situation

The implementation of the new development concept is a profound change that has a bearing on the
overall development of our country, and we must accelerate the transformation of ideology and
concepts, promote the reform of systems and mechanisms, and earnestly transform the new
development concept into a program of action for the overall situation, specific ideas for planning
development, work measures for implementing development tasks, and practical results in
promoting scientific development.

1. Comprehensively promote the reform of the development concept

Concept is the precursor of action, and certain development practices are led by certain development
concepts. Whether the development concept is correct or not fundamentally determines the
development effectiveness and even the success or failure. Practice tells us that development is a
process of constant change, the development environment will not remain static, the development
conditions will not remain static, and the concept of development will naturally not remain static.
Looking back at the course of development since China's reform and opening up, from the great
discussion on the criterion of truth to the establishment of economic construction as the center, from
the reform of the planned economic system to the establishment of the socialist market economic
system, from the addition of the WTO to the leadership of economic globalization, every great leap
in development is the result of ideological emancipation and conceptual change.

To establish a new development concept, we must comprehensively promote the reform of the
development concept.

To comprehensively promote the reform of the development concept, we must persist in
emancipating the mind and updating the concept. Establishing and practicing the new development
concept means a fundamental change in the traditional development thinking and development
mode, which will inevitably be accompanied by the emancipation of the mind and the renewal of
concepts. Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "The establishment of a new concept is always
accompanied by the destruction of the old concept. "1 In the face of new development practices,
some things that were effective in the past may not be effective now; some things that were out of
date in the past are imperative now; and some things that were insurmountable in the past and need
breakthroughs now. For example, China's economy has shifted from a high-speed growth stage to a
high-quality development stage, and we can no longer simply judge the heroes by GDP and measure
the quality of economic development, not because the speed is higher, the situation is "very good",
nor is the speed down, the situation is very bad, but depends on whether there is quality and
efficiency. For another example, in the face of the dash to build a moderately prosperous society in
an all-round way and the task of building a modern and powerful socialist country in an all-round
way, it is no longer possible to simply work fast and fast, and we can no longer rely on extensive
development methods and strong stimulation to raise the speed, we must take emancipation of the
mind as the "general switch", establish a way of thinking that is compatible with the development
of the times and practice, resolutely break the outdated concepts of one-sided pursuit of GDP,
fighting for resources and people, emphasizing cities over rural areas, pollution before treatment,
and efficiency over fairness, and lead new development practices with new development concepts.
To establish and practice the new development concept, we should not stop at words, but should be
used as a yardstick for behavior, consciously check the actual work in all aspects, encourage and
support those that meet the requirements, oppose and discard those that do not conform, and better
keep up with the times in the process of emancipating the mind and win new development in the
process of changing concepts.

To comprehensively promote the reform of development concepts, we must persist in seeking truth
from facts and acting according to laws. On the issue of development, we have both successful
experiences and profound lessons. Successful experience lies in persistently proceeding from reality
and acting in accordance with objective laws; lessons are mainly reflected in being divorced from
reality and violating laws. For example, some localities develop one-sidedly and deformed
development, some localities exhaust their resources to fish and eat too much food, and some
localities compete with the people for profits and neglect people's livelihood, etc., which have
brought many contradictions and problems to economic and social development. Comrade Xi
Jinping stressed: "Development must be scientific development that follows economic laws,
sustainable development that follows natural laws, and inclusive development that follows social
laws."

Fundamentally speaking, the new development concept is to build development on the basis of
better grasping the law and acting according to the law, so as to achieve more quality and higher
level of development. To implement the new development concept, it is necessary to enhance the
awareness of laws, promote the transformation of economic development mode in accordance with
the requirements of economic laws, adhere to the organic unity of development speed, quality and
efficiency, and promote scientific development and high-quality development; in accordance with
the requirements of natural laws, respect nature, conform to nature, protect nature, promote the
formation of green development methods and lifestyles, and achieve sustainable development; in
accordance with the requirements of social laws, strengthen social construction. Innovate social
governance, make the results of reform and development more equitable and benefit all the people,
and achieve inclusive development.

To comprehensively promote the reform of development concepts, we must adhere to systematic
thinking and grasp them as a whole. The new development concept contains all aspects with the
same theme and goal, each with its own focus and mutual support, forming an internal logical system
of a system. Among them, innovation is the core and soul of development, coordination is the basic
method of development, green is the inherent requirement of development, openness is the
characteristics of the era of development, and sharing is the starting point and fundamental
destination of development. All aspects are interconnected and mutually reinforcing, and run
through the entire development process. Therefore, we must understand the new development
concept as an inseparable whole, think systematically and grasp it comprehensively. In line with
this, in the specific work practice of implementing the new development concept, we must also
adhere to the systematic viewpoint, carry out systematic design in accordance with the integrity and
relevance of the new development concept, adhere to and implement as one, so as to promote and
complement each other. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "The comrades of the whole party must
improve the ability and level of unified implementation of the five major development concepts and
constantly open up new realms of development."2 This requires us to enhance our ability to think
systematically, persist in observing things in a developmental rather than static manner,
comprehensively rather than partially, systematically rather than piecemeal, and universally linked
rather than singular and isolated, properly handle various major relations in development, seek
advantages and avoid disadvantages while weighing advantages and disadvantages, and make the
most favorable strategic choice.

2. Accelerate the construction of institutional mechanisms based on the new development
concept

To implement the new development concept, involving the change of way of thinking, behavior and
working mode, and involving the adjustment of social relations, interest relations and work relations,
we must comprehensively innovate the development system, reshape the development ecology,
solve problems and build mechanisms in solving the development momentum and enhancing the
integrity, coordination, balance and inclusiveness of development, so that various reform measures
can take root, ensure that the new ideas are transformed into new practices and new actions, and
form a conducive to innovative development, coordinated development, green development, open
development, Institutional mechanisms for shared development.
First, adhere to innovation to lead development, and accelerate the construction of innovative
development systems and mechanisms. Under the situation of increasingly fierce international
development competition and the transformation of China's development momentum, we must focus
on innovation and form an institutional framework to promote innovation. The first is to deepen the
reform of the scientific and technological system and give play to the leading role of scientific and
technological innovation in comprehensive innovation. Reform the investment system for scientific
and technological innovation, establish a categorized investment mechanism for scientific research
and technological innovation, and strengthen the main position of enterprises in innovation. The
government should vigorously support scientific and technological products and services with
"public goods" attributes and externalities, such as cutting-edge technologies, major common key
technologies, and public welfare technologies. Improve the organizational mechanism of scientific
and technological innovation, and give play to the guiding role of the market in the direction of
technology research and development, the choice of routes, and the allocation of various innovative
resources. At the same time, we should give full play to the institutional advantages of concentrating
forces to do major things, pay attention to major technologies that break through the overall situation
of related development, and concentrate on overcoming a number of "stuck neck" technologies.
Improve the incentive mechanism for scientific and technological innovation, improve the
distribution mechanism that fully reflects the value of intellectual labor, accelerate the
decentralization of the right to use, dispose of and benefit from scientific and technological
achievements, and allow scientific and technological personnel to receive reasonable returns in
innovation activities. The second is to deepen the reform of the talent system and innovate the
mechanism for training, using and attracting talent. Focusing on building a large-scale, innovative
spirit and risk-taking innovative talent team, build an innovative talent training model, establish and
improve the two-way flow mechanism for scientific research talents, implement a more competitive
talent attraction system, train and attract talents in accordance with the law of innovation, and realize
the full use of talents, talents and achievements. The third is to build an open innovation mechanism.
Adhere to the combination of bringing in and going out, integrate the global innovation network
with a more proactive attitude, absorb global innovation resources with a broader mind, and promote
the output of technology and standards with a more active strategy at a higher level. Next, build an
open innovation mechanism to promote the formation of a deeply integrated open innovation
situation.

Second, persist in enhancing the comprehensive effectiveness of overall development and accelerate
the construction of institutional mechanisms for coordinated development. Focusing on solving the
problem of unbalanced and insufficient development, reform and improve relevant mechanisms and
policies. First, it is necessary to improve the mechanism for the coordinated development of material
civilization and spiritual civilization. While building a highly developed material civilization, we
should vigorously promote the building of spiritual civilization, further strengthen overall planning
and coordination, improve the leadership system and working mechanism, form a work pattern of
joint grasp and joint management, and ensure that the achievements of the "two civilizations" are
shared by all the people. Second, we should build a new mechanism for coordinated regional
development. Strive to promote the large-scale development of the western region to form a new
pattern, promote the comprehensive revitalization of the northeast, give full play to its advantages
to promote the rise of the central region, take the lead in innovation and take the lead in realizing
the optimal development of the eastern region, focus on the implementation of the "Belt and Road"
construction, the coordinated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the development of the
Yangtze River Economic Belt and other strategies, and accelerate the construction of a new
mechanism for the coordinated development of regions with orderly and free flow of factors,
effective constraints on main functions, equal basic public services, and bearable resources and
environment. Third, we should establish and improve the institutional mechanism for integrated
urban and rural development. Adhere to the priority development of agriculture and rural areas,
consolidate and improve the basic rural management system, deepen the reform of the rural land
system, improve the reform of the "separation of powers" of contracted land, and deepen the reform
of the rural collective property rights system. Deeply has implemented the strategy of rural
revitalization and accelerated the modernization of agriculture and rural areas in accordance with
the general requirements of prosperous industry, ecological livability, civilized rural customs,
effective governance, and rich life. Promote people-centered new-type urbanization, deepen the
reform of the household registration system, accelerate the urbanization of the rural migrant
population, and strive to achieve equality between urban and rural areas for basic public services.
Fourth, it is necessary to establish a mechanism for coordinated development of economic
construction and national defense construction. Adhere to the integration of military and civilian use,
integrate military with civilian use, accelerate the formation of an all-factor, multi-field, and high-
efficiency military-civilian integration development pattern, and enhance the coordination of
military-civilian sharing of advanced technologies, industrial products, and infrastructure.
Third, adhere to resource conservation and ecological protection, and accelerate the construction of
green development systems and mechanisms. Firmly adhere to the basic national policy of saving
resources and protecting the environment, and continuously promote institutional innovation and
policy system improvement. First, we must start from the source, reshape the endogenous power
mechanism, and form a green development mode and lifestyle. Accelerate the establishment of a
legal system and policy guidance for green production and consumption, establish and improve an
economic system for green and low-carbon circular development, build a market-oriented green
technology innovation system, accelerate the construction of ecological function zones, and
establish a market-oriented and diversified ecological compensation mechanism. Second, we must
comprehensively strengthen the construction of the ecological civilization system.

We will establish and improve an ecological and cultural system with ecological values as the
criterion, an ecological economic system with industrial ecology and ecological industrialization as
the main body, a target responsibility system with improving the quality of the ecological
environment as the core, an ecological civilization system guaranteed by the modernization of the
governance system and governance capacity, and an ecological security system focusing on the
virtuous cycle of the ecosystem and the effective prevention and control of environmental risks.
Third, we should focus on solving prominent environmental problems and build an environmental
governance system led by the government, with enterprises as the main body, social organizations
and the public participating. Through raising pollution discharge standards, strengthening the
responsibility of polluters, and improving systems such as environmental credit evaluation,
mandatory disclosure of information, and severe punishments, we will achieve fundamental
solutions to prominent environmental problems.

Fourth, adhere to the basic national policy of opening up to the outside world and accelerate the
construction of an open development system and mechanism. Take the initiative to participate in
and actively promote the process of economic globalization, develop a higher-level open economy,
and promote the formation of a new pattern of comprehensive opening up. First, we must promote
the joint construction of the "Belt and Road.” Following the principle of consultation, co-
construction and sharing, with policy communication, facility connectivity, unimpeded trade,
financial integration and people-to-people ties as the main contents, we will strive to build the "Belt
and Road" into a road of peace, prosperity, openness, innovation and civilization. Second, we should
promote the construction of a strong trade country. Accelerate the transformation of foreign trade
development mode, innovate cross-border e-commerce, market procurement trade development,
foreign trade comprehensive service enterprises and other foreign trade development models,
innovate foreign investment methods, implement active import policies, create a world-class
business environment, greatly relax market standards, and expand the opening up of the service
industry. Third, it is necessary to speed up the cultivation of new advantages in international
economic cooperation and competition. Promote international production capacity cooperation,
form a global-oriented trade, investment and financing, production and service network, support
enterprises to expand foreign investment, promote equipment, technology, standards and services to
go global, and build a number of world-class multinational enterprises with global competitiveness.
Fourth, efforts should be made to promote global economic governance. Strengthen international
economic policy coordination, actively participate in the formulation of international rules in new
fields such as the deep sea, polar regions, outer space and the Internet, promote the process of
multilateral trade negotiations, accelerate the implementation of the free trade area and free trade
island strategy, and promote the reform of the international monetary system and international
financial regulation.

Fifth, persist in promoting and safeguarding social fairness and justice, and accelerate the
construction of institutional mechanisms for shared development. First, it is necessary to ensure that
educational development is fairer and more quality. Deepen educational reform, improve the quality
of education, promote educational equity, promote the balanced development of compulsory
education, and enable all people to share the dividends of education reform. Second, it is necessary
to ensure higher-quality employment in terms of system. Adhere to the employment priority strategy
and place the employment priority policy at the macro policy level;

Completely break down barriers and identity discrimination in the employment and
entrepreneurship markets, improve entrepreneurship support policies, build a good entrepreneurial
platform, create a new engine for mass entrepreneurship and innovation, and create more
opportunities for participation in shared development. Third, we should continue to deepen the
reform of the medical and health system and implement the Healthy China Strategy. Establish a
basic medical and health system covering urban and rural areas and a modern hospital management
system, accelerate the pace of reform of public hospitals, optimize the layout of medical and health
institutions, promote the flow of medical resources to the grassroots and rural areas, and encourage
social forces to develop health services. Fourth, it is necessary to strengthen the construction of the
social security system. Establish a fairer and more sustainable social security system, implement a
universal participation plan, basically achieve full coverage of statutory personnel, realize the
national overall planning of basic pensions for employees, establish a reasonable adjustment
mechanism for basic pensions, fully implement the serious illness insurance system for urban and
rural residents, coordinate the social assistance system, promote the integration of relevant systems,
and ensure the basic livelihood of the people in difficulty. From the strategic perspective of the
transformation of major social contradictions, examine the relationship between fairness and
efficiency, strengthen and innovate social governance, divide the "cake" well while making the
"cake" bigger, ensure that the fruits of development benefit all the people, let the people have more
sense of gain, gradually realize common prosperity, and promote social fairness and justice.
The new development concept points out the right direction and follows the development of
contemporary China. To successfully realize the party's historical mission and goal in the new era,
we must unify our thinking and action with the new development concept, strive to improve the
ability and level of overall implementation of the new development concept, resolutely change the
understanding that it is not suitable or even contrary to the new development concept, resolutely
correct behaviors that are not suitable for the new development concept, and constantly make new
breakthroughs in enhancing the ability to innovate, promote the balance of development, improve
the ecological environment, raise the level of openness, and promote shared development.
