3. Maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao

Since the return of Hong Kong and Macao, the practice of "one country, two systems" has achieved
universally recognized success. For more than 20 years, "one country, two systems" has been
successfully practiced in Hong Kong and Macao, and has grown vigorously and yielded fruitful
results in the storm. Since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Hong Kong's economic growth
rate has been in the forefront of developed economies, and its status as an international financial,
shipping and trade center has been further consolidated, and it has become one of the most dynamic
cities in Asia, one of the freest economies in the world and one of the most competitive economies
in the world. Since Macao's return to the motherland, Macao has enjoyed social stability, economic
development, residents living and working in peace and contentment, and multiculturalism has
developed well, and is striving to achieve its goal of becoming a world center of tourism and leisure.
The development of Hong Kong and Macao has fully proved that the principle of "one country, two
systems" is correct and that the practice of "one country, two systems" is successful.

To maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, it is necessary to fully
and accurately implement the principles of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong", "Macao people administering Macao" and a high degree of autonomy,
improve the system for the central authorities to exercise overall jurisdiction over the SAR in
accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, improve the system and mechanism for the
appointment and removal of the chief executive and principal officials of the SAR, the system of
interpretation of the Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and
exercise the powers entrusted to the Central Committee by the Constitution and the Basic Law in
accordance with the law. Persist in administering Hong Kong and Macao in accordance with the
law, safeguard the constitutional order established by the Constitution and the Basic Law, establish
and improve the SAR's legal system and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security,
and support the SAR in strengthening its law enforcement forces; improve the degree of
accountability of the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region to the Central
Government, and support the Chief Executive and the SAR Government in their administration in
accordance with the law. To fully and accurately implement the principles of "one country, two
systems", "Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong", "Macao people administering Macao"
and a high degree of autonomy, it is necessary to combine upholding the principle of "one country"
with respecting the differences between the "two systems", safeguarding the central government's
overall jurisdiction over the SAR and guaranteeing the SAR's right to a high degree of autonomy,
giving play to the strong backing role of the motherland's hinterland, and enhancing the SAR's own
competitiveness. Improve the SAR's systems and mechanisms related to the implementation of the
Constitution and the Basic Law, adhere to the principle of "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and "Macao people administering Macao" with patriots as the main body, and improve the
SAR's ability and level of governance according to law.

To maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, we will never tolerate
any behavior that challenges the bottom line of "one country, two systems" and any act of separatism,
and resolutely prevent and curb the interference of external forces in Hong Kong and Macao affairs
and separatism, subversion, infiltration and sabotage activities. Hong Kong is a pluralistic society,
and it is not surprising that there are different opinions or even major differences on some specific
issues, but it should not fall into the vortex of "pan-politicization" and trample on the political
bottom line of "one country, two systems.” Hong Kong is an inseparable part of the country, and
under no circumstances will it be allowed to engage in "Hong Kong independence" or so-called
"self-determination" in any form, which is the untouchable bottom line under "one country, two
systems.” In September 2014, a small number of people in Hong Kong launched an illegal assembly
to "Occupy Central", which seriously affected Hong Kong's rule of law tradition, disrupted Hong
Kong's social order, and affected the lives of Hong Kong people. The CPC Central Committee with
Comrade Xi Jinping at the core has fully and accurately implemented the principle of "one country,
two systems", firmly grasped the central government's overall jurisdiction over Hong Kong and
Macao under the Constitution and the Basic Law, and thwarted the "Occupy Central" farce plotted
by separatist forces at home and abroad to disrupt Hong Kong, and has maintained the prosperity
and stability of Hong Kong and Macao. On 7 November 2016, the 24th Session of the Standing
Committee of the 12th National People's Congress adopted the Interpretation of Article 104 of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

This interpretation of the law conforms to the voice of the people and declares the central
government's firm stand of safeguarding national security and the strong will of the entire Chinese
people to oppose separatism. On September 24, 2018, the Secretary for Security of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Government issued an order prohibiting the pro-independence
"Hong Kong National Party" from operating in Hong Kong. On 19 February 2019, the Chief
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Council made a decision confirming
the validity of the order of the Secretary for Security and that the Central People's Government
supports the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in banning the "Hong
Kong National Party" operate in accordance with the law. In April 2019, the Government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region introduced into the Legislative Council the Fugitive
Offenders and Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters (Amendment) Bill 2019 to enable Hong
Kong to commence case-by-case co-operation with jurisdictions that do not yet have long-term
mutual legal assistance arrangements. The initial aim was to address the issue of the transfer of Hong
Kong residents suspected of murder in Taiwan while closing loopholes in Hong Kong's existing
legal system. On June 9, the Hong Kong opposition and "Hong Kong independence" forces carried
out various radical protest activities in the name of "anti-extradition bill" peaceful marches and
rallies, causing a "storm over the amendment of the extradition bill." ”. With the demagoguery and
incitement of the opposition and the intervention of external forces, various illegal activities such as
"Hong Kong independence", separatism, violent terrorist activities have intensified, and the national
security risks of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have become increasingly
prominent. In this regard, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that the continuous radical and violent
crimes in Hong Kong have seriously trampled on the rule of law and social order, seriously
undermined Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, and seriously challenged the bottom line of the
"one country, two systems" principle. The Chinese government is unswerving in its determination
to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests, unswervingly in its
determination to implement the principle of "one country, two systems", and unswerving in its
determination to oppose interference in Hong Kong affairs by any external forces.1 This provides
important guidelines for safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests,
adhering to and improving the "one country, two systems" institutional system, safeguarding Hong
Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, and safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of
Hong Kong residents.

On 28 May 2020, the Third Session of the 13th National People's Congress voted to adopt the
Decision of the National People's Congress on Establishing and Improving the Legal System and
Implementation Mechanism for Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region. On June 30, the 20th meeting of the Standing Committee of the 13th
National People's Congress unanimously passed the vote

The Law of the People's Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (hereinafter referred to as the "Hong Kong National Security Law")
and listed it in Annex III of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the
People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the "Hong Kong Basic Law"). The Hong Kong
National Security Law clearly stipulates the duties and institutions of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region for safeguarding national security, four types of crimes and punishments:
secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities, collusion with foreign countries or external
forces to endanger national security, case jurisdiction, application of law and procedures, and the
organs of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region for
safeguarding national security, etc., and establishes a legal system and enforcement mechanism for
safeguarding national security in the Region. This is the second important law specially formulated
by the central government for Hong Kong after the Hong Kong Basic Law, which is of great and
far-reaching significance for adhering to and improving the "one country, two systems" institutional
system, safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, and ensuring Hong
Kong's long-term peace and stability, long-term prosperity and stability. In accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region has established a Committee for Safeguarding National Security, which is
responsible for safeguarding national security affairs in the Region, assumes the primary
responsibility for safeguarding national security, and accepts supervision and accountability from
the Central People's Government. The Central People's Government shall establish the Office for
Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to perform its
duties and exercise relevant powers in accordance with law. Since its promulgation and
implementation, the Hong Kong National Security Law has formed a powerful deterrent to various
anti-China and destabilizing forces inside and outside Hong Kong, providing a solid institutional
guarantee for safeguarding Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.

To maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and Macao, it is necessary to
improve the mechanism for integrating Hong Kong and Macao into the overall development of the
country, complementing each other's advantages with the mainland and coordinating development,
promoting the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, supporting
Hong Kong and Macao in developing the economy and improving people's livelihood, and focusing
on resolving deep-seated contradictions and problems affecting social stability and long-term
development. Comrade Xi Jinping stressed: "In the process of national reform and opening up in
the new era, Hong Kong and Macao still have special status and unique advantages, and can still
play an irreplaceable role." "For Hong Kong and Macao, 'one country, two systems' is the biggest
advantage, the country's reform and opening up is the biggest stage, and the implementation of
national strategies such as the joint construction of the 'Belt and Road' and the construction of the
Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is a new major opportunity.1 The construction of
the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is a new measure to promote the formation
of a new pattern of comprehensive opening up in the new era, and it is also a new practice to promote
the development of the cause of "one country, two systems.”

Since the reform and opening up, especially after the return of Hong Kong and Macao to the
motherland, the cooperation between Guangdong, Hong Kong and Macao has been continuously
deepened, the economic strength and regional competitiveness of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-
Macao Greater Bay Area have been significantly enhanced, and the basic conditions for building a
world-class bay area and a world-class city cluster have been met. The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao
Bridge spans the Lingding Ocean, connects Hong Kong to the east, Zhuhai and Macao to the west,
connecting the world's most dynamic economic circle, and is of far-reaching significance to the
integration of Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai. Relying on the advantages of Hong Kong and Macao
as free and open economies and Guangdong as the vanguard of reform and opening up, we should
continue to deepen reform and expand opening up, lead the country in building an institutional
mechanism for high-quality economic development, play an exemplary and leading role, accelerate
institutional innovation and pilot projects, build a modern economic system, better integrate into the
global market system, build a base for emerging industries, advanced manufacturing and modern
service industries in the world, and build a world-class city cluster.
