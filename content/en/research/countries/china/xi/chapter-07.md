Chapter VII: Persisting in Comprehensively Deepening Reform and Comprehensively Opening Up

Reform and opening up is the most distinctive feature of contemporary China and the most
distinctive character of contemporary Chinese communists. Without reform and opening up, there
would be no socialism with Chinese characteristics, and there would be no excellent situation in
which China is prosperous today. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China,
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has held high the banner of reform
and opening up, carried forward the spirit of reform and opening up, persisted in comprehensively
deepening reform and comprehensive opening up, and promoted major breakthroughs in the theory
and practice of reform and opening up, creating a new situation in contemporary China's reform and
opening up.

Section 1: Reform and opening up is a new great revolution

The essence of China's reform and opening up is to fundamentally change various specific systems
that restrict the development of productive forces and social progress in order to meet the needs of
socialist modernization. Whether viewed from the tremendous historical role played by reform and
opening up in liberating and developing the productive forces, or from the depth and breadth of
changes in China's social relations and social life, it can be said that "reform and opening up is a
great revolution in the history of the development of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation."
This new great revolution has pushed the Party and the people to make great strides to catch up with
the times, become the only way to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
become a key move to determine the fate of contemporary China.

1. The party and the people are an important magic weapon for making great
strides to catch up with the times

Catching up with the trend of the times and speeding up its own development is an important starting
point for the CPC's reform and opening up, and it is also a great awakening of the party. Since the
establishment of the socialist system in the mid-50s of the 20th century, China's socialist
construction has made important achievements, but due to the large population and weak foundation,
coupled with the mistakes in the guiding principles of the party's work, especially the occurrence of
such an overall and long-term serious mistake as the "Cultural Revolution", China's economy is on
the verge of collapse, the people's food and clothing are all problems, and China is still one of the
poor countries. During this period, the world economy accelerated and science and technology
progressed with each passing day, and Western capitalist countries and some countries and regions
around China seized the opportunity to achieve rapid economic and technological development. The
gap between China and developed countries and regions has widened significantly.
Regarding the changes in the international community and the gap between China's development
level and the world, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said when receiving foreign guests that year:
"Recently, our comrades went out to take a look, and the more they looked, the more they felt that
we were backward. The fifties were the same, the sixties were different, and the seventies were even
more different. "1 He also pointed out clearly: "In the early sixties, there was a gap between us and
the international level of science and technology, but it was not very large, but in the past decade or
so, the world has developed by leaps and bounds, and the gap has widened very widely." Compared
with developed countries, the economic gap is not only 10 years, it may be 10 years, 30 years, and
in some respects it may even be 50 years. "2 "If we do not carry out reform now, our modernization
and socialist cause will be destroyed."3 At the important historical juncture when the Party and the
country were facing what to do, the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee
conformed to the will of the Party and the people and the trend of the times and resolutely made the
major policy decision of shifting the focus of the work of the Party and the State to socialist
modernization and carrying out reform and opening up. As a result, the process of comprehensive
reform, from the countryside to the cities, from the economic field to other fields, is unstoppable;

From the coast to the river, from the east to the central and western regions, the door to the outside
world is resolutely opened.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out in the 80s of the 20th century: "We must catch up with
the times, and this is the goal of reform."1 "Catching up with the times" actually means vigorously
developing social productive forces, getting rid of poverty and backwardness, and promoting
China's modernization. Reform and opening up have profoundly changed China and promoted the
vicissitudes of change in China. In 1978, China's total GDP was only 367.9 billion yuan, and the per
capita disposable income of urban residents was only 343 yuan. By 2010, China's total GDP jumped
to 41. 2 trillion yuan, surpassing Japan to become the world's second largest economy, per capita
GDP reached more than 30,000 yuan. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China, we have always adhered to reform and opening up without wavering, properly responded to
the complex and changeable domestic and international situations, and achieved rapid economic
growth, with a total GDP of more than 99 trillion yuan in 2019 and a per capita GDP of more than
70,000 yuan.
More importantly, China has embarked on a new path for developing countries to achieve
modernization in the course of reform and opening up. Historically, modernization programs in
developing countries have mostly been designed based on the experience of developed Western
countries. Especially after the end of World War II, Japan, South Korea and other countries and
regions imitated the Western model to achieve modernization, while the drastic changes in Eastern
Europe and the disintegration of the Soviet Union in the late 80s and early 90s of the 20th century
made the modernization model of Western countries seem to be the only choice for developing
countries. However, the reality of more than 70 years since the end of the Second World War shows
that the modernization model of the developed countries has not achieved the expected results.
According to World Bank statistics, between 1960 and 2008, 101 economies in the world entered
the middle-income stage, but only 13 achieved the leap to high-income economies. The vast majority
of countries and the vast majority of their populations have not escaped poverty through the Western
model of modernization. The path of modernization that China has explored in the course of reform
and opening up suited to China's national conditions has expanded the ways for developing countries
to modernize.
Reform and opening up has not only won unprecedented international status and influence for China,
but also won unprecedented self-confidence and dignity for Chinese people.

Reform and opening up have broken the shackles of the system that shackles people's thinking,
prompted hundreds of millions of people to awaken from dullness and rigidity, and displayed
unprecedented creative vitality; reform and opening up has promoted the development of ideology
and theory, promoted the innovation of ruling concepts and methods, and rejuvenated the vitality of
the party. The reform and opening up, which lasted for more than 40 years, has promoted China to
achieve a great leap from "lagging behind the times" to "catching up with the times" and even
"leading the times.‚Äù
2. The only way to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics
Reform and opening up went hand in hand with socialism with Chinese characteristics. The great
practice of reform and opening up is an inexhaustible source of power for the formation and
development of socialism with Chinese characteristics. The reason why socialism with Chinese
characteristics has vigorous vitality lies in the fact that it is a socialism that implements reform and
opening up. It is in the great practice of reform and opening up that socialism with Chinese
characteristics has ushered in a great leap from its founding, development to perfection.
Reform and opening up have deepened the understanding of the law of socialist construction and
provided strong support for adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics. The
CPC's understanding and grasp of the law governing socialist construction has gone through a
process of moving from shallow to deep. On the basis of summing up the experience of socialist
construction and in the magnificent practice of reform and opening up, we have gradually realized
that socialist society is a society of constant change and change, and there is no immutable socialism;
socialism is a kind of socialism that can have "multiple ways" and has no fixed and unique model;
socialism is a socialism that is rejuvenated and manifests world significance through integration
with China's practice, and there is no abstract socialism that departs from the specific national
conditions and actual conditions. Based on these understanding of laws, one of the basic conclusions
drawn by the CPC in summing up its long-term historical experience is to follow its own road and
build socialism with Chinese characteristics. Adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese
characteristics has become the theme of all the Party's theories and practices since the reform and
opening up.
Reform and opening up have provided a practical basis for the creation, development and
improvement of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Socialism is not only a political proposition,
but also a movement, which cannot be separated from practice. In the great practice of reform and
opening up, the Communist Party of China has insisted on proceeding from reality and basing itself
on the actual national conditions.

"Do what Comrade Mao Zedong has proposed but has not done, correct what he opposes and is
wrong, and do well what he has not done well." 1 He pioneered socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and in practice, it continues to develop and gradually improve. At every major
historical juncture facing the development of socialism with Chinese characteristics, we have relied
on deepening reform and opening up to get out of the predicament and successfully break through.
This is true whether it is to get rid of the domestic predicament after the end of the "Cultural
Revolution" or to face the grim situation at home and abroad in the late 80s and early 90s of the 20th
century; whether it is to respond to the domestic and foreign concerns after the death of Comrade
Deng Xiaoping in 1997, or to cope with the new phased characteristics that emerged at the turn of
the century; whether it is to cope with the huge impact of the international financial crisis in 2008,
or to properly handle the main social contradictions that have been transformed in the new era.
Reform and opening up have indeed become a key move to determine China's future and destiny.
Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: During the Cultural Revolution, when the 'Gang of Four' was
in power, the people were in a dull mood, and it could even be said that they were in a state of worry,
and the whole society was in a state of stagnation. After the end of the Cultural Revolution, there
are still two years to go. China really became active and really concentrated its efforts on what the
people wanted to do after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee at the end
of 1978. " 2 With its revolutionary shaping of contemporary China, reform and opening up has
injected strong vitality into socialism with Chinese characteristics.
From the implementation of household joint production contracting, the sudden emergence of
township enterprises, the abolition of agricultural taxes, animal husbandry taxes and special product
taxes, to the separation of "three powers" in rural contracted land, winning the battle against poverty,
and implementing the strategy of rural revitalization; from doing a good job in large and medium-
sized state-owned enterprises and developing individual and private economies to deepening the
reform of state-owned assets and state-owned enterprises, and developing a mixed-ownership
economy; from single public ownership to public ownership as the mainstay, the common
development of multiple ownership economies and adherence to the "two unwavering" principle;
From the traditional planned economic system to the unprecedented socialist market economic
system, to making the market play a decisive role in the allocation of resources and giving better
play to the role of the government; from focusing on economic structural reform to comprehensively
deepening the reform of economic, political, cultural, social and ecological civilization systems and
party building systems. It is precisely because of the bold reform of production relations that do not
adapt to the productive forces and the superstructure that does not adapt to the economic base that
the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people has been aroused, the creativity and development
vitality of the whole society have been greatly stimulated, and the appearance of China's urban and
rural areas has undergone tremendous changes.

Opening up to the outside world means boldly absorbing and borrowing all the achievements of
civilization created by human society, and absorbing and borrowing all the advanced business and
management methods that reflect the laws of modern socialized production in all countries in the
world, including the capitalist developed countries, so as to enrich and enhance their own
development capabilities. From the establishment of special economic zones such as Shenzhen, the
opening up of coastal border and riverine cities and inland central cities to the Canadian World Trade
Organization, the joint construction of the "Belt and Road", the establishment of pilot free trade
zones, the planning of free trade ports with Chinese characteristics, and the successful holding of
two sessions of the China International Import Expo, it has both "brought in" and "gone out.‚Äù It is
precisely by opening our minds and embracing the world that we can truly integrate the tide of
development of the era and realize the historic transformation from closed and semi-closed to open
to the outside world. Practice has proved that socialism is not a complacent and self-enclosed system,
but a society that continues to grow and develop through openness and exchanges. The history of
more than 40 years has proved that socialist China has not changed its banner in opening up to the
outside world, but has made scientific socialism shine with new vigor in the 21st century through
the vivid practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
To sum up, socialism with Chinese characteristics was born in the reform and opening up, and it
also developed and expanded in the reform and opening up. Reform and opening up is the logical
starting point for opening up the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it is also a
powerful driving force for continuously expanding this road; reform and opening up is the practical
source for forming and developing the theoretical system of socialism with Chinese characteristics,
and it is also the practical basis for constantly improving this theoretical system; reform and opening
up is a distinctive feature of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and an important magic
weapon for enhancing the vitality of this system; reform and opening up is the source of living water
for the formation of socialist culture with Chinese characteristics and an important driving force for
the development and prosperity of this culture. Reform and opening up is the "magic weapon" for
adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics, and writing a new chapter in
socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era still requires comprehensively deepening
reform and continuously expanding opening up.
3. the key to realizing the "two centenary goals" and realizing the Chinese dream of the
great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation
Since the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China first put forward the "two
centenary goals", the Communist Party of China has been working hard for them. Shortly after the
18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012, Comrade Xi Jinping clearly put
forward the new goal of "realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.‚Äù

The 19th CPC National Congress made important arrangements for realizing the "two centenary
goals" and realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly
pointed out that reform and opening up is "a key move to decide to achieve the two centenary goals
and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation." This is a new incisive summary of the
great role and significance of reform and opening up.
The achievement of any ambitious goal will not be smooth sailing. The great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation is by no means easy and can be achieved by banging gongs and drums. In the process
of building socialist modernization and striving toward the grand goal, there will always be various
difficulties and resistances. Some of these difficulties and obstacles come from the level of
institutional mechanisms, some from the level of ideology and concepts, and some from external
interference and obstruction. For more than 40 years, through reform and opening up, we have
boldly broken through the shackles of institutions and mechanisms, promoted the modernization of
the national governance system and governance capacity, and continuously broken the resistance
caused by outdated systems and mechanisms. Through reform and opening up, we have constantly
broken the shackles of rigid and conservative ideology and concepts, stood taller, seen farther, and
governed the country with a new perspective. Through reform and opening up, our comprehensive
national strength has continued to develop and grow, and we have the confidence and strength to
deal with such interference and sabotage, and "let the wind and waves rise and sit firmly on the
fishing boat." Looking forward to the future, in the journey of realizing the "two centenary goals"
and realizing the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, we still need to
persevere in comprehensively deepening reform, continuously expanding opening up, and
constantly overcoming resistance and breaking waves.
At present, the environment at home and abroad is undergoing extremely extensive and profound
changes, China's development is facing a series of contradictions and challenges, and there are still
many difficulties and problems on the way forward. For example, the problems of imbalance,
incoordination and unsustainability in development are still prominent, the ability of scientific and
technological innovation is not strong, the industrial structure is irrational, the development mode
is still extensive, the gap between urban and rural development and the distribution of residents'
income is still large, social contradictions have increased significantly, education, employment,
social security, medical care, housing, ecological environment, food and drug safety, safe production,
social security, law enforcement and justice, and other problems related to the vital interests of the
masses are more, some people have difficulties in life, formalism and bureaucracy problems are
prominent, and so on. To solve these intertwined and complex contradictions and problems, resolve
risks and challenges from all sides, and promote sustained and healthy economic and social
development, we fundamentally rely on reform and opening up.
Without reform and opening up, there would be no China's today; without reform and opening up,
there would be no China's tomorrow.

Over the past 40 years and more, the Communist Party of China has united and led the people to
emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts, boldly try and bravely reform, and create a new world.
Reform and opening up have greatly changed the face of China, the face of the Chinese nation, the
face of the Chinese people, and the face of the Communist Party of China. The Chinese nation has
ushered in a great leap from standing up and getting rich to becoming strong, socialism with Chinese
characteristics has ushered in a great leap from its founding, development to perfection, and the
Chinese people have ushered in a great leap from insufficient food and clothing to moderate
prosperity, and the Chinese nation is standing tall in the east of the world with a brand-new attitude.
Practice has proved that reform and opening up is the only way to strengthen the country and enrich
the people. In the new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics, as long as we persist in holding
high the great banner of reform and opening up, constantly deepen our understanding of the laws of
reform and opening up, dare to face difficulties, dare to overcome difficulties, carry out reform and
opening up to the end, and constantly realize the people's yearning for a better life, we can create
new and greater miracles that will impress the world, realize the "two centenary goals" and realize
the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation as scheduled.
Section 2: Persist in comprehensively deepening reform
China's reform and opening up began with the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central
Committee, adhered to the principle of prioritizing the easy before the difficult, and gradually
progressively to the convening of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China.
After the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China's reform entered the
period of tackling tough problems and deep waters, "It can be said that the easy and happy reforms
have been completed, the delicious meat has been eaten, and the rest are hard bones."1 It can be said
that the complexity, sensitivity and arduousness of further promoting reform are no less than more
than 30 years ago, when reform and opening up reached a new and important juncture. The Third
Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee deliberated and adopted the Decision of the
CPC Central Committee on Several Major Issues Concerning Comprehensively Deepening Reform,
which put forward the guiding ideology, goals, tasks and major principles for comprehensively
deepening reform, rationally laid out the strategic priorities, priorities, main directions of attack,
working mechanisms, promotion methods, timetables, and road maps for comprehensively
deepening reform, and opened a new era of comprehensively deepening reform and promoting
reform through the overall design of the system.

1. Comprehensively deepen the basic observance of reform
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping has
repeatedly pointed out that the success of China's reform is because we have adhered to the correct
direction and position and maintained political firmness. To promote comprehensive deepening of
reform in the new era, we must also adhere to the correct direction, adhere to the people-centered
reform position, and resolutely implement the general requirements for reform put forward by the
Party Central Committee. This is the experience of reform, and it is also the follow-up of reform.
Reform and opening up is a profound revolution, and we must adhere to the correct direction and
advance along the correct road. In the early days of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping
stressed: "Adhering to the socialist orientation in reform is a very important issue. "1 If reform and
opening up are not carried out, "reform and opening up" that negates the socialist direction is also a
dead end. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "Of course, we must hold high the banner of
reform, but our reform is a reform that continues to advance on the road of socialism with Chinese
characteristics, and we will neither follow the old road of closure and rigidity, nor take the evil road
of changing the banner.‚Äù2 "The purpose of promoting reform is to continuously promote the self-
improvement and development of China's socialist system and give socialism new vitality.‚Äù3 These
loud declarations show that the direction of China's reform is to continuously promote the self-
improvement and development of the socialist system, rather than to change the course of the
socialist system. Over the past 40 years, China's reform process has also experienced twists and
turns, but because of the correct direction and proper control, problems can be corrected in time, so
it can always move forward along the right path. At present, reform is facing a very complex
domestic and international environment, and various ideologies and interests are stirring each other.
In order to grasp the pulse of reform from the appearance of complicated things and prescribe reform
remedies amid the divergence of opinions, we must keep a sober mind and have sufficient strategic
concentration. We are highly vigilant against the danger of the country being invaded, subverted and
split, the danger of undermining the overall situation of reform, development and stability, and the
danger of interrupting the development process of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

As Comrade Xi Jinping emphasized: "We will resolutely change what should be changed and can
be changed, and resolutely do not change what should not and cannot be changed." 1 To ensure that
the correct direction of reform is always adhered to, we must always adhere to the party's basic line
as the lifeline of the party and the country, and always adhere to the four basic principles of economic
construction as the center. The two basic points of reform and opening up are unified in the great
practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics; we must continue to adhere to the four basic
principles, which are the foundation of the country, not only ensure the correct direction of reform
and opening up with the four basic principles, but also give the four basic principles a new
connotation of the times through reform and opening up, eliminate all kinds of interference, and
unswervingly follow the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
China's reform has a standpoint, and this is the people's stand that the Chinese Communists have
always adhered to. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly pointed out: "The fundamental purpose of our reform
is to make the country richer and stronger, make the society more fair and just, and make the people's
life better." 2 Comprehensively deepen reform, no matter what is changed or what step it takes,
adhere to the people-centered reform value orientation cannot change. To implement this reform
value orientation, we must embody the people-centered development thinking in the whole process
of reform, so that what the people care about and expect, what the reform should grasp and promote,
and bring more sense of gain to the people through reform. It is necessary to take the promotion of
social fairness and justice and the improvement of people's well-being as the starting point and
foothold of comprehensively deepening reform, focus on creating a fairer and more just social
environment, constantly overcome various phenomena that violate fairness and justice, and make
the results of reform and development more and more equitable to benefit all the people. We must
adhere to the original intention of reform and opening up, regard seeking happiness for the people
as the criterion for testing the results of reform, and ensure that everything that is beneficial to the
cause of the party and the people will be resolutely done, refueled, and worked without stopping;
and everything that is detrimental to the cause of the party and the people should be resolutely
reformed, thoroughly reformed, and changed without delay. It is necessary to introduce a number of
hard tricks and practical measures that can be loud, stand up, and be recognized by the masses,
properly handle the relationship between the "first kilometer" and the "last kilometer" of reform,
break through the "middle obstruction," and prevent inaction. The heavier the tasks of reform,
development and stability, the more it is necessary to maintain the flesh-and-blood ties between the
party and the masses, be good at improving policies and propositions from the people's practice,
creation, and development requirements, and constantly consolidate the mass foundation for
comprehensively deepening reform.
Further emancipating the mind, further emancipating and developing the social productive forces,
and further emancipating and enhancing social vitality are both the purpose and the conditions for
reform.

Among them, emancipating the mind is the premise, the general switch for liberating and developing
social productive forces, and emancipating and enhancing social vitality. Without the liberation of
Tian Xiang, it would be impossible to make the historic policy decision of reform and opening up,
and it would be impossible to promote theoretical innovation on the basis of practice. Without the
great emancipation of the mind, there will be no great breakthrough in reform. Emancipating and
developing the social productive forces and emancipating and enhancing social vitality is the
inevitable result of emancipating the mind and is also an important foundation for emancipating the
mind. Development is the last word, and only by further liberating and developing the social
productive forces can the grand goal of national rejuvenation be achieved. Emancipating the mind
and emancipating and enhancing social vitality is for the purpose of better emancipating and
developing the social productive forces. Through deepening reform, we should let the vitality of all
labor, knowledge, technology, management, capital and other elements burst out in a competitive
manner, and let all the sources of creating social wealth fully flow.
2. the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform
Since the reform and opening up, the Communist Party of China has governed the country from a
new perspective, attached great importance to system building, and emphasized that institutional
issues are more fundamental, overall, stable and long-term. The Party Central Committee with
Comrade Xi Jinping as the core, with great political courage and wisdom, put forward the overall
goal of comprehensively deepening reform with the overall goal of improving and developing the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics and promoting the modernization of the national
governance system and governance capacity. This general goal responds to the objective
requirements put forward by the forward expansion of the reform process, embodies the deepening
and systematization of the party's understanding of reform, and is a major breakthrough in the party's
theoretical innovation process.
A deep understanding and accurate grasp of the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform
is the key to implementing various reform measures. In response to some people who only talk about
the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, while ignoring
"improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics", Comrade Xi Jinping
stressed that the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform is a whole composed of two
sentences. The latter sentence stipulates a clear orientation for improving and developing the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics under the guidance of the fundamental direction.
Speaking both sentences is complete. To speak only the second sentence and not the first is
incomplete and incomplete."1

Improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics has laid down the
fundamental direction for comprehensively deepening reform. Promoting the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity is an inevitable requirement for improving and
developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, and it is also the proper meaning of
adhering to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics and building a modern and powerful
socialist country.
The national governance system and governance capacity are the concentrated embodiment of a
country's system and system implementation ability. The national governance system is the
institutional system for managing the country under the leadership of the party, and the national
governance capacity is the ability to use the national system to manage all aspects of social affairs.
The national governance system and governance capacity are an organic whole and complement
each other, and only with a good national governance system can we improve governance capacity,
and only by improving national governance capacity can we give full play to the effectiveness of
the national governance system. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We have talked about many
modernizations, including agricultural modernization, industrial modernization, scientific and
technological modernization, national defense modernization, etc., and the modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity is the first time.‚Äù1 The modernization of the
national governance system and governance capacity is the result of the Party's continuous
deepening of understanding of the laws governing the country in the practice of leading reform and
opening up, and marks a major innovation and development of the theory of socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
From the perspective of historical development, how to govern a brand-new society such as a
socialist society has not been well solved in the past practice of world socialism. In the process of
leading China's revolution and construction, the Communist Party of China has constantly
considered and explored what kind of national governance system to establish in the future and
achieved important results. Since the reform and opening up, more attention has been paid to
institutional construction, a complete set of national governance systems has been basically formed,
and governance capabilities have been continuously improved. On the whole, China's national
governance system and governance capacity have unique advantages and are adapted to national
conditions and development requirements. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has coordinated
the reform of systems and mechanisms in various fields such as economy, politics, culture, society,
and ecological civilization, involving an unprecedented scope, introducing many plans, touching on
the depth of interests, and promoting unprecedented intensity, improving the socialist system with
Chinese characteristics, and significantly improving the modernization level of the national
governance system and governance capacity.

At the same time, we must also realize that compared with China's economic and social development
and the requirements of the people, compared with the increasingly fierce international competition
in today's world, and compared with the realization of long-term peace and stability of the country,
we still have many areas for urgent improvement in the national governance system and governance
capacity, and the system has not yet reached the requirements of full maturity and stereotype, and
some aspects have even become an important factor restricting development and stability. Therefore,
we must continuously improve the national governance system and improve the ability to use the
system to effectively govern the country through comprehensive deepening reform. In February
2014, in a speech at the seminar for major leading cadres at the provincial and ministerial levels to
study and implement the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee and
comprehensively deepen reform, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Today, a major historical task
before us is to promote the socialist system with Chinese characteristics to be more mature and more
formalized, and to provide a complete set of more complete, stable and effective institutional
systems for the development of the cause of the party and the country, for the happiness and well-
being of the people, for social harmony and stability, and for the long-term peace and stability of
the country."1 From the point of view of becoming a more mature and stereotyped system, the main
historical task of socialism in our country in the past was to establish a basic socialist system and
carry out reform on this basis. The main historical task in the future is to improve and develop the
socialist system with Chinese characteristics.
The Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee held in October 2019 focused on
the theme of "adhering to and improving the socialist system with Chinese characteristics,
promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity", starting
from the strategic goals and major tasks established by the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, focusing on adhering to and consolidating the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics, ensuring the long-term rule of the Party and the long-term peace and stability of the
country, and focusing on improving and developing the socialist system with Chinese characteristics.
Comprehensively building a modern socialist country, focusing on giving full play to the superiority
of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, promoting the modernization of the national
governance system and governance capacity, comprehensively sums up the achievements,
accumulated experience and principles formed by the party and the people in the construction of
China's national system and national governance, focuses on adhering to and improving the
fundamental, basic and important systems that support the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics, and deploys major institutional reforms that need to be deepened and key tasks that
need to be promoted. The plenary session not only pointed out the great significance and overall
requirements for adhering to and improving the socialist system with Chinese characteristics and
promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity, but also
summarized the significant advantages of China's state system and national governance system from
13 aspects

It also made arrangements on how to uphold and improve the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics and promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance
capacity from 13 aspects, including adhering to and improving the party's leadership system. On the
basis of the "two-step" strategic arrangement made by the 19th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the Fourth Plenary Session of the 19th CPC Central Committee further clarified that
the adherence to and improvement of the socialist system with Chinese characteristics, The overall
goal of promoting the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity is
to achieve obvious results in making all aspects of the system more mature and more stereotyped
by the 100th anniversary of the founding of our party; by 2035, the system in all aspects will be
more perfect, and the national governance system and governance capacity will be basically
modernized; by the 100th anniversary of the founding of New China, the national governance
system and governance capacity will be fully modernized, so that the socialist system with Chinese
characteristics will be more consolidated and its superiority fully displayed. This further clarifies
the internal logic of the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform and the ideas for future
development.
To promote the modernization of the national governance system and governance capacity in the
new era, it is necessary to adapt to the changes of the times, constantly reform the systems and
mechanisms that do not meet the requirements of practical development, and make the various
systems and mechanisms more scientific and perfect in the process of innovation; it is necessary to
continuously improve the party's level of scientific governance, democratic governance, and ruling
according to law, improve the ability of state institutions to perform their duties, and enhance the
ability of the people to manage state affairs, economic, social, and cultural affairs, and their own
affairs according to law; and it is necessary to improve the ideological and political, scientific, and
cultural quality of cadres at all levels and managers in all fields as soon as possible. It is necessary
to enhance the work ability of party and state organs, enterprises and institutions, people's
organizations, social organizations, and so on as soon as possible; proceed from the actual conditions
of our country and creatively study and draw on all the excellent achievements of human civilization.
3. important arrangements for comprehensively deepening reform
Comprehensively deepening reform is a major strategic deployment related to the overall
development of the cause of the party and the country, not a reform in a certain field or aspect, but
needs to be promoted in an overall manner, strengthening top-level design and overall planning.
Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Party Central Committee
with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has scientifically formulated a blueprint for reform, carefully
drawn up a road map for reform, firmly grasped the key point of economic system reform, and
promoted the comprehensive deepening of reform to continue to develop in depth.
The road map for comprehensively deepening reform is to achieve the "six tight surrounds" clearly
put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China under the overall goal of comprehensively deepening reform.

The first is to deepen the reform of the economic system around making the market play a decisive
role in the allocation of resources, adhere to and improve the basic economic system, accelerate the
improvement of the modern market system, macro-control system and open economic system,
accelerate the transformation of economic development mode, accelerate the construction of an
innovative country, and promote more efficient, fairer and more sustainable economic development.
The second is to deepen the reform of the political system closely centering on adhering to the party's
leadership, the people being masters of the country, and the organic unity of governing the country
according to law, accelerate the institutionalization, standardization and procedure of socialist
democratic politics, build a socialist country under the rule of law, and develop a broader, fuller and
more sound people's democracy. The third is to deepen the reform of the cultural system closely
centering on the construction of the socialist core value system and the socialist cultural power,
accelerate the improvement of the cultural management system and cultural production and
operation mechanism, establish and improve the modern public cultural service system and modern
cultural market system, and promote the great development and prosperity of socialist culture. The
fourth is to deepen the reform of the social system around better protection and improvement of
people's livelihood, promote social fairness and justice, reform the income distribution system,
promote common prosperity, promote institutional innovation in the social field, promote the
equalization of basic public services, accelerate the formation of a scientific and effective social
governance system, and ensure that the society is both vibrant and harmonious and orderly. The fifth
is to deepen the reform of the ecological civilization system closely around the construction of a
beautiful China, accelerate the establishment of the ecological civilization system, improve the
institutional mechanisms for land space development, resource conservation and utilization, and
ecological environmental protection, and promote the formation of a new pattern of harmonious
development and modernization of man and nature. Sixth, closely centering on improving the level
of scientific governance, democratic governance, and ruling according to law, deepen the reform of
the party building system, strengthen the construction of democratic centralism, improve the party's
leadership system and ruling methods, maintain the party's advanced nature and purity, and provide
a strong political guarantee for reform, opening up, and socialist modernization. On the one hand,
this reform roadmap clarifies the main contents of comprehensively deepening reform and
highlights the comprehensiveness of reform; on the other hand, it clarifies the key points of reform
in the economic, political, cultural, social, ecological and party building fields, so that the top-level
design, priority order, key areas and key links of comprehensively deepening reform are clear at a
glance, which is conducive to the combination and promotion of overall promotion and key
breakthroughs.
To comprehensively deepen reform, we must persistently focus on economic structural reform.
China's basic national conditions are still in the primary stage of socialism and will remain for a
long time, which determines that economic construction is the party's long-term central task. We
must unswervingly persist in taking economic construction as the central task, and we must
unswervingly adhere to the focus on economic structural reform. To promote the reform of the
economic system, we must adhere to the direction of socialist market economic reform, and in
particular, we must properly handle the core issue of the relationship between the government and
the market.

In 1992, the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of China put forward that the goal of
economic structural reform is to establish a socialist market economic system, and proposed that the
market should play a basic role in the allocation of resources under the state's macro-control. This
major theoretical breakthrough has played an extremely important role in China's reform, opening
up, and economic and social development. Since the 14th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, the Party has continuously deepened its understanding of the relationship between
the government and the market. The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
proposed "making the market play a basic role in the allocation of resources under the state's macro-
control", the 16th National Congress of the Communist Party of China proposed "giving greater
play to the basic role of the market in the allocation of resources", the 17th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China proposed "giving better play to the basic role of the market in the
allocation of resources from the perspective of system", and the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China proposed "giving greater play to the basic role of the market in resource
allocation to a greater extent and on a wider scale.‚Äù The Third Plenary Session of the 18th Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly proposed to "make the market play a decisive
role in the allocation of resources and better play the role of the government.‚Äù This is another major
breakthrough in theory and practice by the party, which is conducive to establishing a correct
concept of the relationship between the government and the market in the whole party and society,
to changing the mode of economic development, to changing government functions, and to curbing
negative and corrupt phenomena. The market plays a decisive role in the allocation of resources, not
the whole role. To develop the socialist market economy, it is necessary to give play to both the role
of the market and the role of the government, but the functions of the role of the market and the role
of the government are different. The Party Central Committee put forward clear requirements for
better playing the role of the government, emphasizing that "the duties and roles of the government
are mainly to maintain macroeconomic stability, strengthen and optimize public services, ensure fair
competition, strengthen market supervision, maintain market order, promote sustainable
development, promote prosperity, and make up for market failures."1
Persist in taking economic structural reform as the traction to drive reform in other fields. The
economic base determines the superstructure. Economic structural reform has an important
influence and transmission effect on reform in other fields, and the progress of major economic
structural reform determines the progress of structural reform in other fields, and has the effect of
affecting the whole body. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "In comprehensively deepening reform,
we must adhere to the reform of the economic system as the main axis, strive to make new
breakthroughs in the reform of important areas and key links, so as to drive and drive reform in
other fields, so that all aspects of reform can be promoted in a coordinated manner and form a joint
force, rather than separate and scattered efforts." 2 Since the 18th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China.

With the reform of the economic system as the traction, we have led to the reform of the political,
cultural, social and ecological civilization system, the reform of the party and state institutions, the
reform of the administrative management system, the reform of the system of governing the country
according to law, the reform of the judicial system, the reform of the foreign affairs system, the
reform of the social governance system, the reform of the ecological environment supervision
system, the reform of the national security system, the reform of the national defense and the army,
the reform of the party leadership and party building system, the reform of the discipline inspection
and supervision system, and a series of major reforms have been solidly advanced. A good situation
for in-depth advancement.
Section 3: Adhere to comprehensive openness
Opening up to the outside world is China's basic national policy. Over the past 40 years, China has
persisted in opening its doors to construction, transforming itself from a relatively closed economy
into an economy that is deeply integrated with the world economy and increasingly open, and has
achieved development achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. Since the 18th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China, in the face of the new era and new situation,
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core has accurately judged the general
trend of world development, accurately grasped the connotation of comprehensive opening up,
persisted in actively participating in and actively promoting the process of economic globalization,
developed a higher-level open economy, and promoted the formation of a new pattern of
comprehensive opening up.
1. The new situation and new requirements facing opening up to the outside
world
The world now is an open world. Facing the world, the implementation of economic opening up and
the implementation of different degrees of opening up in various fields has become an inevitable
requirement for the development of all countries in the world today. Opening up is the trend of the
times and the aspiration of the people. Openness leads to progress, closure leads to backwardness.
The CPC's regard of opening up to the outside world as its basic national policy means conforming
to the trend of development of the times and building, consolidating and developing socialism under
the conditions of opening up to the outside world and in the process of linking with economic
globalization. It is precisely in the process of opening up to the outside world that China has become
the world's second largest economy, contributing more than 30% to world economic growth for
many consecutive years, and scientific socialism has shown vigor and vitality in China.
In the new era, the international and domestic situations facing opening up to the outside world are
undergoing profound and complex changes. Internationally, the world today is experiencing major
changes unprecedented in a century, with the economic and social development of countries
becoming increasingly closely linked, and the reform of the global governance system and
international order accelerating.

At the same time, the world economy has been deeply adjusted, the problem of insufficient new
momentum is prominent, the problems of unbalanced development and income distribution have
intensified, the new challenges brought by new technologies, new industries and new formats have
become prominent, some countries have obvious policy preferences, international trade and
investment barriers have been continuously raised, global unilateralism, protectionism and populism
have gradually spread and fermented, economic globalization has encountered twists and turns,
multilateralism and free trade system have been impacted, there are still many unstable and uncertain
factors, and risks and challenges have intensified. The world faces important choices between
openness and conservatism, cooperation and closure, change and conservatism, which are both full
of hope and challenges.
From a domestic point of view, China's economic development has entered the new normal, labor
costs continue to rise, resource constraints are becoming increasingly tight, environmental carrying
capacity is close to the upper limit, the traditional competitive advantage of open economy has been
weakened, and the traditional development model has encountered bottlenecks. At the same time,
China is rich in human resources, the market scale is large, the infrastructure is relatively perfect,
the industrial facilities are complete, the institutional environment and policy environment for
innovative development are constantly improving, and the open economy still has comprehensive
competitive advantages. Under the pressure of severe and complex domestic and foreign
environment, China's processing trade has accelerated transformation and upgrading, service trade
has continued to develop rapidly, new foreign trade new products, new formats and new models
have continued to emerge, the international operation ability of enterprises has been significantly
enhanced, and its status in the international division of labor has gradually improved. Reality
requires us to accelerate the transformation of the open economy from factor-driven to innovation-
driven, from scale and speed to quality and efficiency, and from cost and price advantages to
comprehensive competitive advantages with technology, standards, brands, quality and service as
the core.
With the increase of China's national strength, China's relations with the world are also undergoing
profound changes, China's status and role in the international arena have been greatly enhanced, and
its interaction with the international community has been unprecedentedly close. China's every
move attracts the world's attention. Comrade Xi Jinping solemnly declared: "The door of China's
opening will not be closed, but will only open wider and wider." China's pace of promoting a higher
level of opening up will not stagnate! China's pace of promoting the construction of an open world
economy will not stagnate; China's pace of promoting the construction of a community with a shared
future for mankind will not stagnate!"1 In the new era, China will make greater contributions to the
common prosperity of all countries in the world while achieving its own development with a more
responsible spirit, a more inclusive mind and higher quality growth.

2. New measures to promote the formation of a new pattern of
comprehensive opening up
The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China summed up China's valuable
experience in opening up to the outside world, conformed to the general trend of economic
globalization, and made a major strategic plan to promote the formation of a new pattern of
comprehensive opening up. This strategic deployment, which includes the expansion of the scope
of opening up, the broadening of the field and the deepening of the level, as well as the innovation
of open methods, the optimization of layout, and the improvement of quality, is the proper meaning
of the basic strategy of adhering to and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new
era, and is the basic compliance of China's opening up to the outside world.
The new pattern of comprehensive opening up is reflected in the open space, that is, optimizing the
layout of regional opening-up, increasing the intensity of opening up in the west, changing the
regional pattern of China's opening up to the outside world that is fast and slow in the west and
strong and weak in the coastal interior, and gradually forming an open pattern of division of labor
and cooperation along the coastal inland border, interactive development, and mutual assistance
between the east and the west Construction, adhere to independent opening up and reciprocal
opening-up, accelerate the strategic planning of going out, coordinate multilateral, bilateral and
regional opening up and cooperation, and accelerate the implementation of the free trade area
strategy; reflected in the content of opening-up, that is, greatly relax the market quasi-personnel,
further liberalize the general manufacturing industry, orderly expand the opening up of the service
industry, expand the two-way opening up of the financial industry, and promote infrastructure
interconnection. According to this new pattern, China has taken a series of major measures in
opening up to the outside world.
First, solidly promote the construction of the "Belt and Road.‚Äù The construction of the "Belt and
Road" is a major strategic measure for China to expand opening up to the outside world, and it is
also the focus of opening up in the coming period. With the joint efforts of all parties, the
construction of the "Belt and Road" has gradually changed from concept to action, from vision to
reality. In order to promote the construction of the "Belt and Road", China has held the "Belt and
Road" Summit Forum for International Cooperation. This not only builds a new platform for China
to expand opening up, but also helps promote world economic growth and deepen regional
cooperation. The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out that in
accordance with the principle of consultation, co-construction and sharing, actively promote
international cooperation on the "Belt and Road", strive to achieve policy coordination, facility
connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration and people-to-people bonds, create a new
platform for international cooperation, and add new impetus to common development. To this end,
it is necessary to strengthen the docking with the development strategies of countries along the Belt
and Road, enhance strategic mutual trust, seek the greatest common denominator of cooperation,
and build the "One Belt, One Road" into a road of peace, prosperity, openness, innovation and
civilization.

The second is to promote the construction of a strong trade country. From a major trading country
to a trading power, we must consolidate the traditional advantages of foreign trade, cultivate new
competitive advantages, expand the space for foreign trade development, and actively expand
imports. It is necessary to expand foreign trade, accelerate the transformation of trade development
mode, change from focusing on trade in goods to coordinated development of trade in goods and
services, from relying on imitation and following to relying on innovation and creation, and from
large input and large output to high quality, high price, and excellent input. It is necessary to cultivate
new trade formats and models, support the healthy development of cross-border e-commerce,
market procurement trade, and comprehensive foreign trade services, and create new growth points
for foreign trade. We must promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, oppose trade
protectionism, support the multilateral trading system, promote international cooperation in
production capacity, participate in international cooperation at a higher level and in a wider space,
form a global-oriented trade, investment and financing, production and service network, and
accelerate the cultivation of new advantages in international economic cooperation and competition.
We must innovate foreign investment methods, strengthen guidance for overseas mergers and
acquisitions, standardize overseas business behavior, and strive to achieve common and sustainable
development. China has held the China International Import Expo since 2018, which is the world's
first import-themed national-level exhibition so far, which is a major innovation in the history of
international trade development. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "China's initiative to expand
imports is not an expedient measure, but a long-term consideration for facing the world, facing the
future and promoting common development."1 "The China International Import Expo should not
only be held every year, but also run at a high level, achieve results, and do better and better."2 These
loud words have fully demonstrated to the world China's sincerity and goodwill in opening up its
own market and sharing development opportunities. At the second China International Import Expo
held as scheduled in November 2019, Comrade Xi Jinping put forward three suggestions for jointly
building an open and cooperative, open innovation and open and shared world economy, indicating
China's positive attitude of further opening up and promoting trade facilitation.
The third is to actively create a world-class business environment. The business environment is also
productivity. China has vigorously strengthened the construction of the rule of law in the use of
foreign investment, unified domestic and foreign investment laws and regulations, improved an
open and transparent foreign-related legal system, comprehensively implemented the pre-national
treatment plus negative list management system for prospective personnel, created a fair market
environment, continued to relax market access, and respected international business practices.

All types of enterprises registered in China will be treated equally and equally, the legitimate rights
and interests of foreign-funded enterprises will be protected, intellectual property protection will be
strengthened, and entrepreneurs from all over the world will strive to provide a better environment
and conditions for entrepreneurs from all over the world to invest and develop their businesses in
China, and improve the level of open economy in a larger scope, in a wider range of fields and at a
deeper level. In recent years, through large-scale tax and fee reductions, and the in-depth promotion
of the reform of decentralization, management and service, on October 24, 2019, the World Bank
released the "2020 Business Environment Report", ranking China's business environment ranked
first46th place rose to 31st place, up 15 places. The Foreign Investment Law, passed in March 2019,
establishes the basic framework of China's foreign investment legal system, making unified
provisions on the access, promotion, protection and management of foreign investment. In October,
the Regulations on Optimizing the Business Environment were promulgated. This is an important
measure for China to create a business environment based on the rule of law, internationalization
and facilitation, marking that China's business environment will reach a new level.
The fourth is to optimize the layout of regional opening up and create a new highland for opening
up to the outside world. In the pattern of China's opening up to the outside world, the eastern part
started early and developed rapidly, while the western region started late and developed slowly.
Since the 18th CPC National Congress, the western region has continuously accelerated the pace of
opening up to the outside world, maintained a good development trend in foreign trade and attracted
foreign investment, and achieved good results. However, due to the weak development foundation
and the overall low base, the western region is still a "short board" in China's regional opening
layout. Data show that the western region has 72 percent of the country's land area, 27 percent of
the population, and 20 percent of the total economy, while foreign trade accounts for only 7 percent
of the country's total, and the use of foreign capital and foreign investment account for 7.6 percent
and 7.7 percent respectively. The 19th CPC National Congress proposed to optimize the layout of
regional opening up and intensify the opening up of the western region. The western region should
give full play to its advantages of abundant natural resources, abundant labor, and increased state
policy support, deepen and expand opening up, and promote a more optimized pattern of opening
up.
Fifth, coordinate multilateral and bilateral and regional opening up and cooperation, and accelerate
the implementation of the free trade area strategy. Since the beginning of the new century, the
development process of the multilateral trading system has been blocked, and regional trading
arrangements with a higher level of openness and greater flexibility have flourished, becoming the
main engine driving economic globalization. In the report of the 19th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China, Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out that he should actively participate in
the reform and construction of the global governance system, support the multilateral trading system,
promote the construction of free trade areas, and promote the construction of an open world
economy. This is not only the need to expand its own open space, but also reflects the responsibility
of maintaining the international economic order. The implementation of the free trade area strategy
is a major measure for China to optimize the layout of opening up and create a new highland of
opening up.

By the end of 2019, China had established a total of 18 pilot free trade zones, covering all directions
in the southeast, northwest, and central regions. In November 2018, the State Council issued the
Notice on Several Measures to Support the Deepening Reform and Innovation of the Pilot Free
Trade Zones, giving the pilot free trade zones greater autonomy in reform, continuing to deepen
differentiated exploration, increasing stress testing, and giving full play to the role of the pilot free
trade zones as a pilot field for reform and opening up. China should not only build the whole island
of Hainan into a pilot free trade zone, but also support Hainan to gradually explore and steadily
promote the construction of a free trade port with Chinese characteristics, establish a free trade port
policy and institutional system step by step and in stages, and build the Hainan free trade port into
a clear banner and an important open door leading China's opening up in the new era, and drive the
formation of a new pattern of higher-level reform and opening up.
In order to further expand opening up, China not only actively promotes the transformation from
the opening up of commodity and factor flows to rules and other institutional opening-up, promotes
the construction of a fair, reasonable and transparent system of international economic, trade and
investment rules, maintains and develops an open world economy, jointly creates an environment
conducive to open development, promotes the orderly flow of production factors and efficient
allocation of resources. The deep integration of the market also repeatedly emphasizes that China
adheres to win-win opening up and does not pursue a zero-sum game. Comrade Xi Jinping clearly
pointed out: "China's opening up to the outside world is not to sing a one-man show, but to welcome
the participation of all parties; it is not to seek a sphere of influence." It is to support the common
development of all countries; not to create their own back gardens, but to build a hundred gardens
shared by all countries.‚Äù1 This strongly declares to the world that China's opening up to the outside
world is committed to win-win and win-win results.
"If you are connected, you will advance together, and if you are closed, you will retreat." "Looking
back at history, open cooperation is an important driving force for enhancing the vitality of
international economy and trade. Today, open cooperation is a realistic requirement for promoting
the stable recovery of the world economy. Looking to the future, openness and cooperation are the
requirements of the times to promote the continuous progress of human society. China unswervingly
pursues a mutually beneficial and win-win opening up strategy, achieves greater intensity and higher
levels of opening up, and provides countries with broader markets, more abundant capital, richer
products and more opportunities for cooperation. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "China is the
world's second largest economy, with a large market of more than 1.3 billion people and a land area
of more than 9.6 million square kilometers. The sea has calm times and stormy times. Without the
wind and rain, it would not be the sea.

Storms can overturn small ponds, but not the sea. After more than 5,000 years of hardship and
hardship, China is still here! facing the future, China will always be here!"1 Openness should be
two-way and mutually beneficial, rather than one-way and beneficial to one party. In the face of
profound changes in the world economic pattern, all countries should join hands to actively promote
openness and cooperation, support the multilateral trading system, and oppose unilateralism and
protectionism. In the Sino-US trade frictions, there are voices in the United States that they want to
decouple the United States from China, and even decouple China from the world. As the world's
largest developing country, the largest developed country and the top two economies, China and the
United States have frequent exchanges and converged interests, which is already "you have me, I
have you", and the so-called decoupling is unimaginable. Decoupling from China means decoupling
from opportunities and decoupling from the future. Today's China is not only the China of China,
but also the China of the world. In the future, China will embrace the world with a more open attitude,
form a more benign interaction with the world, and bring a more progressive and prosperous China
and the world.
Section 4: Persist in using scientific methods to promote
reform and opening up
For a country and a nation, reform and opening up is a profound social change and a complex system
project, and we must adhere to scientific methods. Looking around the world, some countries have
fallen into civil war and turmoil due to poor decision-making and improper methods on the issue of
reform and opening up, and there are many examples of people living in poverty and national
division. A very important reason for the success of China's reform and opening up is that it has
adhered to the world outlook and methodology of dialectical materialism and historical materialism,
and accurately grasped the internal laws of reform and opening up. Both positive and negative
experiences show that reform and opening up do not necessarily bring success; Successful reform
and opening up must adhere to scientific methods. Whether it is summing up the historical
experience of reform and opening up for more than 40 years or deploying a new era to
comprehensively deepen reform, Comrade Xi Jinping attaches great importance to and repeatedly
emphasizes the importance of adhering to scientific methods.

1. Persist in combining strengthening the party's leadership with respecting
the people's initiative
The party's leadership is the key and fundamental to the success of reform and opening up. It is
precisely by always adhering to the party's centralized and unified leadership that we can achieve a
great historical turning point and open a new period of reform and opening up. In the process of
reform and opening up for more than 40 years, the Party has adhered to the correct direction of
reform, maintained the determination of reform, and ensured that no subversive mistakes occurred
on fundamental issues; the Party proceeded from the overall situation, carefully deployed reform
tasks, and accurately promoted opening up. Let reform and opening up promote and complement
each other, and inject strong impetus into China's economic and social development; the Party
focuses on the prominent contradictions and problems facing development, conducts in-depth
investigation and research, and encourages bold exploration at the grassroots level. Adhere to the
connection between reform decision-making and legislative decision-making, and continuously
improve the scientific nature of reform decision-making, so as to promote the continuous success of
reform and opening up. Looking at the present, comprehensively deepening reform in the new era
is a complex system project, and the correlation and coupling requirements between various reform
measures are very high, and it is necessary to gather forces from all aspects and levels in order to
advance as a whole. Moreover, every step of reform and opening up is not easy, and the future will
inevitably face such risks and challenges, and even unimaginable stormy waves. To continue to
promote the comprehensive deepening of reform, we must give full play to the party's role as the
core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all parties, continuously
improve the party's ability and determination to set the direction, seek the overall situation,
formulate policies, and promote reform, and ensure that the ship of reform and opening up always
moves forward along the correct course and breaks the waves.
Reform and opening up is the cause of hundreds of millions of people, and there is endless wisdom
among the masses of the people. Every breakthrough and development in the understanding and
practice of reform and opening up, the emergence and development of every new thing in reform
and opening up, and the creation and accumulation of experience in every aspect of reform and
opening up all come from the practice and wisdom of hundreds of millions of people. To
comprehensively deepen reform and opening up in the new era, we must still closely rely on the
people, attach importance to giving play to the initiative of localities, grassroots units and the masses,
give full play to the subjective initiative of the masses, and gather majestic people's hearts and
people's strength for reform and opening up.
The party's leadership provides a strong political guarantee and a correct direction for reform and
opening up, and the people's initiative provides a steady stream of wisdom and strength for reform
and opening up. In the whole process of reform and opening up, we must always pay attention to
combining upholding the party's leadership with respecting the people's initiative. As Comrade Xi
Jinping pointed out:
China Aerospace Studies Institute

Translation published Fall 2023Basic Issues of Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era
"Sum up the fresh experience created by the masses in a timely manner, fully mobilize the
enthusiasm, initiative and creativity of the masses to promote reform, pool the wisdom and strength
of the broadest masses of the people on reform, and work with the people to push reform forward."1
2. adhere to the combination of "crossing the river by feeling the stones" and
the top-level design
"Crossing the river by feeling the stones" is a reform method rich in Chinese wisdom and in line
with China's national conditions, and it is also a scientific method that conforms to Marxist
epistemology and practical theory. "Crossing the river by feeling the stones" means feeling the law
and the law of reform and opening up. To carry out reform and opening up and develop the socialist
market economy, the ancestors did not talk about it, and other socialist countries did not do it, but
we can only gain true knowledge from practice through repeated exploration through practice,
understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding. China's reform and opening up has come about in
this way, which is a process of continuous accumulation of experiments, then summing up, and then
popularization, and a process of continuous deepening from rural to urban, from coastal to inland,
and from part to whole. This kind of gradual reform has avoided social unrest caused by unclear
circumstances and improper measures, and has provided a guarantee for steadily advancing reform
and smoothly achieving its goals. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "Crossing the river by feeling
the stones is in line with the process of people's understanding of objective laws and the dialectic of
things changing from quantity to quality." It cannot be said that in the early days of reform and
opening up, we had to cross the river by feeling the stones, and now we cannot mention crossing the
river by feeling the stones. "2 To comprehensively deepen reform and open up, we also need to cross
the river by feeling the stones. "Of course, there are rules for crossing the river by feeling the stones,
and it is necessary to do it according to the laws that have been recognized, and then deepen the
understanding of the laws in practice, rather than stepping on the watermelon skin and sliding where
it counts."3
Reform and opening up has entered a period of tackling tough problems and deep waters, and has
reached the stage of gnawing hard bones, the relevance and interaction have been significantly
enhanced, and it is difficult to rely only on reforms in a single field and a single level to be effective,
we must strengthen top-level design and overall planning, make overall design for the economic
system, political system, cultural system, social system, ecological civilization system, etc.,
strengthen the study and judgment of the correlation of various reforms, and strive to achieve overall
and local coordination, the combination of root cause and symptom treatment, and gradual and
breakthrough promotion.

"Crossing the river by feeling the stones" and top-level design are both important methods to
promote reform and opening up, and the dialectical unity between the two. Promoting partial phased
reform and opening up should be carried out on the premise of strengthening the top-level design,
and strengthening the top-level design should be planned on the basis of partial phased reform and
opening up. It is necessary to strengthen macro-control and top-level design, pay more attention to
the systematic, holistic and coordinated nature of reform, and continue to encourage bold
experimentation and breakthroughs, and constantly deepen reform and opening up.
3. adhere to the unity of problem-oriented and goal-oriented
The CPC's efforts in revolution, construction, and reform have always been aimed at solving China's
practical problems. Reform and opening up is caused by the reversal of problems, and it has been
deepened in the continuous solution of problems. In the process of deploying and promoting reform
and opening up, the Party Central Committee has always upheld a strong sense of problems, whether
it is formulating plans, or deploying to promote and supervise implementation, and has taken
practical solutions to problems as the goal. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out: "We must have a strong
sense of problems, be guided by major issues, grasp key issues for further research and thinking,
and focus on promoting the resolution of a series of prominent contradictions and problems facing
our country's development."1 Over the past 40 years of reform and opening up, the Party has led the
people of the whole country to work as one, open roads in every mountain, build bridges when
encountering water, and constantly solve problems in the process of advancing. Old problems are
solved, and new problems arise. We must carry forward the spirit of struggle, dare to face problems
head-on, improve our ruling skills, be good at solving problems, and promote the continuous
advancement of reform and opening up.
Adhering to goal orientation is an important method to promote reform and opening up, and it is
also an important experience of the Communist Party of China in leading reform and opening up.
Scientific and reasonable goals guide the direction of efforts and provide spiritual inspiration. On
the basis of the "four modernizations" put forward by the party in the fifties and sixties of the 20th
century, in the 80s it proposed to achieve moderate prosperity and "build a prosperous, strong,
democratic, and civilized modern socialist country," and in the 90s it proposed "two hundred years."
In the new century, the goal of struggle is to "build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round
way," "build a moderately prosperous society in an all-round way," and build a prosperous, strong,
democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful modern socialist country. Realize new goals such
as the Chinese dream of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

These beautiful goals inspire the Chinese people to unite and firmly march towards a better life,
injecting strong spiritual power into reform and opening up.
Looking back at the process of reform and opening up, we can find that the goal is a concentrated
embodiment of the problem, and the problem should be solved in the process of accomplishing the
goal. The process of solving problems is the process of achieving goals, and the process of achieving
goals is also the process of solving problems, and the two are unified in the great practice of reform
and opening up. After arduous exploration in the early stage of reform and opening up, the party
overcame the old concept of opposing the market and planning in the reform and opening up, and
clarified the economic reform goal of establishing a socialist market economic system, which is a
model for adhering to the unity of goal orientation and problem orientation in reform and opening
up. In comprehensively deepening reform and opening up in the new era, it is all the more necessary
to unify goal-oriented and problem-oriented enemies, and achieve the set goals in the process of
solving problems.
4. adhere to the pilot project and promote the comprehensive promotion
Adhering to the principle of pilot projects and promoting them in an all-round way is an important
method and important experience of reform and opening up. The pilot project is to accumulate
experience and find out the rules for comprehensive promotion. Comprehensive promotion is based
on the pilot first, which is the goal pursuit and final embodiment of the pilot first. Reform and
opening up has been continuously developed in the course of promoting pilot projects to
comprehensive and local to the overall situation.
China's reform and opening up began with pilot projects. This is true of the pilot reform of state-
owned enterprises in the early stage of reform and opening up, the four special economic zones of
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen as "test fields" for opening up to the outside world, or the
establishment of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free Trade Zone after the 18th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China to explore new forms of trade facilitation. To promote reform and
opening up, it is not necessary to carry out pilot projects in all aspects and fields. In practice, for
reforms that must make breakthroughs but are not so sure for the time being, we adopt the method
of pilot exploration and throwing stones to ask for directions, carry out experiments first, respect
practice and creation, encourage bold exploration, dare to open up, gain experience, see it accurately,
and then push it away. For reforms that are not yet deep enough in understanding, but must be
promoted, we must boldly explore and pilot the reforms. Some reforms involve deep-seated
institutional factors and complex interest relationships, and it is difficult to push them out on the
surface for a while; it is necessary to give play to the role of scouts and advance teams in the pilot
reforms, find out the rules, build consensus, and accumulate experience and create conditions for
comprehensively pushing them out. Seeking comprehensive advancement on the basis of pilot
projects can effectively reduce the overall cost and risk of promotion, and is more conducive to
steadily advancing reform and opening up.

When advancing in an all-round way, it is necessary to properly handle the relationship between the
whole and the key points, pay attention to grasping the main aspects of the main contradictions and
contradictions, and grasp the important areas and key links, and also focus on proceeding from the
system and the whole, carry out overall planning, and promote the development of work in all
aspects.

5. correctly handle the relationship between reform, development and stability

Reform involves in-depth interest adjustment and system adjustment, and we must properly handle
the relationship between reform, development, and stability. Reform, development and stability are
the three important fulcrums of China's socialist modernization construction and the three key chess
pieces in the overall situation. Reform is a powerful driving force for economic and social
development, development is the key to solving all economic and social problems, and stability is
the prerequisite for reform and development. At present, China is not only in a period of important
strategic opportunities for development, but also in a period of prominent social contradictions, and
it is particularly important to properly handle the relationship between reform, development and
stability, and promote reform and development in social stability. It is necessary to persistently unify
the intensity of reform, the speed of development and the degree of social tolerance, take the
improvement of people's living standards as the point of integration in correctly handling the
relationship between reform, development and stability, promote reform and development while
maintaining social stability, and promote social stability through reform and development. It is
necessary to enhance the coordination of reform measures, development measures, and stability
measures, properly grasp the relationship between current interests and long-term interests, partial
interests and overall interests, and individual interests and collective interests, and strive to solve
problems related to the vital interests of the masses, and also focus on guiding the masses to correctly
handle various interest relations, rationally and lawfully express their interest demands, and create
a stable and united social atmosphere.
The new era is an era of comprehensive rule of law. Comrade Xi Jinping pointed out in particular:
"Throughout the reform process, we must attach great importance to the use of rule of law thinking
and methods, give play to the leading and promoting role of the rule of law, strengthen the
coordination of relevant legislative work, and ensure that reform is promoted on the track of rule of
law."1 The deeper the reform and opening up, the more emphasis should be placed on the rule of
law. We must not violate the law under the guise of reform, nor can we not use the excuse that the
law is not perfect and does not promote reform. In the practice of reform, the study of reform plans
and reform measures should simultaneously consider the legislative issues involved, and put
forward legislative needs and suggestions in a timely manner.

The results of reform that have proved effective in practice should be upgraded into law in a timely
manner. Where the conditions for practice are not yet ripe and it is necessary to carry out a trial first,
authorization should be made in accordance with legal procedures. Laws and regulations that do not
meet the requirements of reform should be promptly revised or abolished.
Comrade Xi Jinping has stressed many times that the advancement of reform and opening up to this
day is more important than understanding determination, and more important than method is
responsibility. In order to implement the plan for comprehensively deepening reform, the central
authorities have clarified the responsibilities and requirements of all departments and units for
implementing the reform plan, stressed that the central and local governments should work together
to form a joint force, and make it clear that the relevant central departments that undertake the
leading tasks are the main units responsible for implementation, and must earnestly shoulder the
responsibility for the implementation of reform, especially paying attention to opening up the "last
mile" of reform promotion. In the concrete practice of promoting reform and opening up, we must
focus on the concrete implementation of relevant important reform arrangements, and the vast
number of party-member leading cadres must earnestly "understand the reform in a practical way,
plan for the reform, implement the reform, and act as both a promoter of reform and a doer of
reform.‚Äù1
"To govern a big country, if you cook small food. "China is a big country, and it must not make
subversive mistakes on fundamental issues, and once they occur, they cannot be irreparable or
compensated. In the new era, comprehensively deepening reform and opening up, just like moving
forward in deep water, encountering more and more resistance, facing more and more reefs,
undercurrents, and whirlpools, we must understand the water nature, grasp the overall situation, seek
progress in stability, must adhere to scientific methodology, pay attention to systematic, holistic and
synergistic, not only adhere to emancipating the mind, dare to be the first in the world, dare to dare
to try, but also adhere to seeking truth from facts, actively and steadily, and step steadily to unify
reform and development, adhere to the direction of unchanged, the road is not biased, The intensity
will not be reduced, and the reform and opening up will go more steadily and further.
