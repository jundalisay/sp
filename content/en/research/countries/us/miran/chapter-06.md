The next Trump term presents potential for sweeping change in the international economic system and possible
accompanying volatility. It is important for investors to understand the tools that might be employed for such
purposes, as well as the means by which government may attempt to avoid unwelcome consequences. This essay
attempts to provide a user’s guide: a survey of some tools, their economic and market consequences, and steps
that can be taken to mitigate unwanted side effects.

Wall Street consensus that an Administration has no means by which to affect the foreign exchange value of the
dollar, should it desire to do so, is wrong. Government has many means of doing so, both multilaterally and unilaterally.

No matter what approach it takes, however, attention must be paid to steps to minimize volatility. Assistance from
trading partners or the Federal Reserve can be helpful in doing so.

In any case, because President Trump has shown tariffs are a means by which he can successfully extract negotiating
leverage—and revenue—from trading partners, it is quite likely that tariffs are used prior to any currency tools.
Because tariffs are USD-positive, it will be important for investors to understand the sequencing of reforms to the
international trading system. The dollar is likely to strengthen before it reverses, if it does so.

There is a path by which the Trump Administration can reconfigure the global trading and financial systems to
America’s benefit, but it is narrow, and will require careful planning, precise execution, and attention to steps to
minimize adverse consequences.
