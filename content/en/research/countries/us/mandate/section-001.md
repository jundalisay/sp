America’s Bicentennial, which culminated on July 4, 1976, was a spirited and unifying celebration of our country, its Founding, and its ideals. As we approach our nation’s 250th anniversary, which will take place during the
next presidency, America is now divided between two opposing forces: woke revolu-
tionaries and those who believe in the ideals of the American revolution. 

The former believe that America is—and always has been—“systemically racist” and that it is not worth celebrating and must be fundamentally transformed, largely through a cen- tralized administrative state. The latter believe in America’s history and heroes, its principles and promise, and in everyday Americans and the American way of life. They believe in the Constitution and republican government. Conservatives—the Ameri- canists in this battle—must fight for the soul of America, which is very much at stake. Just two years after the death of the last surviving Constitutional Convention delegate, James Madison, Abraham Lincoln warned that the greatest threat to America would come not from without, but from within.

This is evident today: Whether it be mask and vaccine mandates, school and business closures, efforts to keep Americans from driving gas cars or using gas stoves, or efforts to defund the police, indoctrinate schoolchildren, alter beloved books, abridge free speech, undermine the colorblind ideal, or deny the biological reality that there are only two sexes, the Left’s steady stream of insanity appears to be never-ending. The next Administration must stand up for American ideals, American families, and American culture—all things in which, thankfully, most Americans still believe. Highlighting this need, former director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought writes in Chapter 2, “The modern conservative President’s task is to limit, control, and direct the executive branch on behalf of the American people.”

At the core of this goal is the work of the White House and the central personnel
agencies. Article II of the Constitution vests all federal executive power in a Pres-
ident, made accountable to the citizenry through regular elections. Our Founders
wrote, “The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States
of America.” Accordingly, Vought writes, “it is the President’s agenda that should
matter to the departments and agencies,” not their own.

Yet the federal bureaucracy has a mind of its own. Federal employees are often
ideologically aligned—not with the majority of the American people—but with one
another, posing a profound problem for republican government, a government
“of, by, and for” the people. As Donald Devine, Dennis Kirk, and Paul Dans write
in Chapter 3, “An autonomous bureaucracy has neither independent constitu-
tional status nor separate moral legitimacy.” Byzantine personnel rules provide the
bureaucrats with their chief means of self-protection. What’s more, knowledge of
such rules is used to thwart the President’s appointees and agenda. As Devine, Kirk,
and Dans write, “Managing the immense bureaucracy of the federal government
is impossible without an understanding of the key central personnel agencies and
their governing laws and regulations.”

Many of these laws and regulations governing a largely underworked, over-
compensated, and unaccountable federal civilian workforce are so irrational that
they would be comical in a less important context. This is true whether it comes to
evaluating employees’ performance or hiring new employees. Only in the federal
government could an applicant in the hiring process be sent to the front of the
line because of a “history of drug addiction” or “alcoholism,” or due to “morbid
obesity,” “irritable bowel syndrome,” or a “psychiatric disorder.” The next Admin-
istration should insist that the federal government’s hiring, evaluation, retention,
and compensation practices benefit taxpayers, rather than benefiting the lowest
rung of the federal workforce.

In order to carry out the President’s desires, political appointees must be
given the tools, knowledge, and support to overcome the federal government’s
obstructionist Human Resources departments. More fundamentally, the new
Administration must fill its ranks with political appointees. Devine, Kirk, and Dans
observe that “the Trump Administration appointed fewer political appointees in
its first few months in office” than any other recent presidency. This left career
employees in charge in many places. This can occur even after departments have
been fully staffed with political appointees. Vought writes that the White House
Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should establish a “reputation as the
keeper of ‘commander’s intent,’” yet OMB is dominated by career employees who
often try to overrule political appointees serving in the various executive depart-
ments. Empowering political appointees across the Administration is crucial to
a President’s success.


Above all, the President and those who serve under him or her must be commit-
ted to the Constitution and the rule of law. This is particularly true of a conservative
Administration, which knows that the President is there to uphold the Constitu-
tion, not the other way around. If a conservative Administration does not respect
the Constitution, no Administration will. In Chapter 1, former deputy chief of
staff to the President Rick Dearborn writes that the White House Counsel “must
take seriously the duty to protect the powers and privileges of the President from
encroachments by Congress, the judiciary, and the administrative components of
departments and agencies.” Equally important, the President must enforce the
Constitution and laws as written, rather than proclaiming new “law” unilaterally.
Presidents should not issue mask or vaccine mandates, arbitrarily transfer student
loan debt, or issue monarchical mandates of any sort. Legislatures make the laws
in a republic, not executives.

It is crucial that all three branches of the federal government respect what Mad- ison called the “double security” to our liberties: the separation of powers among the three branches, and the separation of powers between the federal government and the states. This double security has been greatly compromised over the years. Vought writes that “the modern executive branch...writes federal policy, enforces that policy, and often adjudicates whether that policy was properly drafted and enforced.” He describes this as “constitutionally dire” and “in urgent need of repair,” adding: “Nothing less than the survival of self-governance in America is at stake.” When it comes to ensuring that freedom can flourish, nothing is more import- ant than deconstructing the centralized administrative state. Political appointees who are answerable to the President and have decision-making authority in the executive branch are key to this essential task. The next Administration must not cede such authority to non-partisan “experts,” who pursue their own ends while engaging in groupthink, insulated from American voters. The following chapters detail how the next Administration can be responsive to the American people (not to entrenched “elites”); how it can take care that all the laws are “faithfully exe- cuted,” not merely those that the President desires to see executed; and how it can achieve results and not be stymied by an unelected bureaucracy.﻿1

WHITE HOUSE OFFICE
Rick Dearborn

From popular culture to academia, the American presidency has long been a
prominent fixture of the national imagination—naturally so since it is the
beating heart of our nation’s power and prestige. It has played, for instance,
a feature role in innumerable movies and television shows and has been prodded,
analyzed, and critiqued by countless books, essays, and studies. But like nearly
everything else in life, there is no substitute for firsthand experience, which this
manual has compiled from the experience of presidential appointees and provides
in accessible form for future use.


With respect to the presidency, it is best to begin with our Republic’s founda-
tional document. The Constitution gives the “executive Power” to the President.1
It designates him as “Commander in Chief”2 and gives him the responsibility to
“take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”3 It further prescribes that the
President might seek the assistance of “the principal Officer in each of the execu-
tive Departments.”4 Beginning with George Washington, every President has been
supported by some form of White House office consisting of direct staff officers as
well as a Cabinet comprised of department and agency heads.

Since the inaugural Administration of the late 18th century, citizens have chosen
to devote both their time and their talent to defending and strengthening our nation
by serving at the pleasure of the President. Their shared patriotic endeavor has
proven to be a noble one, not least because the jobs in what is now known as the
White House Office (WHO) are among the most demanding in all of government.
The President must rely on the men and women appointed to the WHO. There
simply are not enough hours in the day to manage the affairs of state single-handedly,
so delegation is not just advisable: It is essential. The decisions that assistants and
senior advisers make will directly impact the Administration, its legacy, and—most
important—the fate of the country. Their agenda must therefore be the President’s
agenda. Choosing who will carry out that agenda on a daily basis is not only one of
the first decisions a President makes in office, but also one of the most critical. The
tone and tempo of an administration are often determined on January 20.

CHIEF OF STAFF

As with most of the positions that will be covered in this first chapter, the Chief of Staff is also an Assistant to the President. However, the chief is truly first among equals. Of all presidential staff members, the chief is the most critical to implementa- tion of the President’s vision for the country.

The chief also has a dual role as manager of the staffs of both the WHO and the Executive Office of the President (EOP).5 The Chief of Staff’s first managerial task is to establish an organizational chart for the WHO. It should be simple and contain clear lines of authority and respon- sibility to avoid conflicts. It should also identify specific points of contact for each element of the government outside of the White House. These contacts should include the White House Liaisons who are selected by the Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO).


Receiving guidance from the President, the chief endeavors to implement the
President’s agenda by setting priorities for the WHO. This process begins by taking
stock of the President’s campaign promises, identifying current and prospective
opportunities, and then delegating policy priorities among the departments and
agencies of the Cabinet and throughout the three White House policy councils:

lThe National Economic Council (NEC);
lThe Domestic Policy Council (DPC); and
lThe National Security Council (NSC).

The President is briefed on all of his policy priorities by his Cabinet and senior
staff as directed by the chief. The chief—along with senior WHO staff—maps out
the issues and themes that will be covered daily and weekly. The chief then works
with the policy councils, the Cabinet, and the Office of Communications and Office
of Legislative Affairs (OLA) to sequence and execute the rollout of policies and
announcements. White House Counsel and senior advisers and senior counselors
are also intimately involved.

All senior staff report to the Chief of Staff, either directly or through his two
or three deputies, unless the President determines that a particular Assistant to
the President reports directly to him. Most chiefs have interacted directly with Cabinet officers and a select number of direct reports. In most cases, the direct
reports to the chief are his two or three deputies, the Communications Director,
PPO Director, White House Counsel, and senior advisers. Occasionally, the Office
of Public Liaison (OPL), the Cabinet Secretary, and Intergovernmental Affairs
(IGA) also report directly to the chief. Usually, however, they report instead to a
Deputy Chief of Staff.

The Chief of Staff’s main challenge is time management. His use of his deputies,
meetings with senior staff, and direction provided to the WHO must all balance
with the daily needs of the President. A successful chief steers the West Wing using
his management of and influence with the various individuals and entities around
him. It goes without saying that selecting the right person to be chief is vital.
