STAFF SECRETARY

The Office of the Staff Secretary is rarely visible to the outside world, but it
performs work of tremendous importance. The office is similar to a military com-
mander’s adjutant as it is responsible for fielding and managing a vast amount of
information at the top of its organization. This includes information on its way into
the Oval Office as well as information flowing out from the Oval Office. Because
of its gatekeeping function, the position of Staff Secretary is one of extreme trust,
and the individual who possesses it should be vetted to work as an “honest broker”
in the President’s service.

OFFICE OF COMMUNICATIONS

The Office of Communications, which operates under the Director of Com- munications, conveys the President’s agenda to the public through various media, including speeches and remarks, press briefings, off-the-record discussions with reporters, and social media. Depending on how a President chooses to structure his White House, the Office of Communications may include the Office of the Press Secretary (Press Office), but no matter how it is structured, the office must work closely with the Press Office as well as the President’s speechwriters and digital strategists.

Operational functions of the Office of Communications include scheduling and running press briefings, interviews, meetings, media appearances, speeches, and a range of other events. The Office of Communications must maintain robust rela- tionships with the White House Press Corps, the White House Correspondents’ Association, regional stakeholders, and key interest groups. No legal entitle- ment exists for the provision of permanent space for media on the White House campus, and the next Administration should reexamine the balance between media demands and space constraints on the White House premises. Leadership within the Office of Communications should include a Com- munications Director (who is a direct report to the Chief of Staff ), a Deputy

The Office of the Staff Secretary has been described as the last substantive control point before papers reach the Oval Office. A great deal of information is headed toward the Oval Office at any moment. This includes presidential decision memos; bills passed by Congress (which may be accompanied by signing or veto statements); and briefing books, reading materials, samples of constituent mail, personal mail, and drafts of speeches. The Staff Secretary makes certain that these materials are complete, well-ordered, and up to date before they reach the Presi- dent. This necessarily means that the Staff Secretary plays a key role in determining who weighs in on policy matters and when.

As noted above, the Staff Secretary also handles information leaving the Oval Office. The President may have questions after reviewing incoming material, may wish to seek more information, or may demand revisions. The Staff Secretary is often responsible for directing these requests to the appropriate places and fol- lowing up on them to ensure that they are completed. One of the Staff Secretary’s critical functions is managing and overseeing the clearance process for the President’s daily/nightly briefing book. This book is filled with all the reading material and leading documentation the President needs in the morning and the evening to help him make decisions. The Staff Secretary also oversees the use of the President’s signature, whether by hand or by autopen, and manages the Office of the Executive Clerk, Office of Records Management, and Office of Presidential Correspondence.﻿

Communications Director, a Deputy Director for Strategic Communications, and a Press Secretary. This leadership team must work together closely to drive the national narrative about the White House. The best resource for the Office of Communications is the President. The Pres- ident conveys the White House’s overall message through one or two inaugural addresses, State of the Union addresses, speeches to Congress, and press confer- ences. The office must also ensure that the various White House offices disseminate a unified message to the public. The Communications Director and Press Secretary in particular should be careful to avoid contradicting the President or delivering conflicting information.

The speechwriting team is a critical component of the communications team. Speechwriting is a unique talent: The writers selected must understand policy, should have a firm grasp of history and other liberal-arts disciplines, and should be able to learn and adopt the President’s style of rhetoric and mode of delivery. The Press Secretary is the President’s spokesperson, communicating to the American people through the media. The Press Secretary engages with the White House Press Corps formally through press briefings and informally through impromptu gaggles and meetings. Individuals who serve in this role must be quick on their feet, which means, when appropriate, deftly refuting and rebutting corre- spondents’ questions and comments.


The Communications Director must convey the President’s mission to the American people. Especially for conservatives, this means navigating the main- stream media to ensure that the President’s agenda is conveyed effectively and accurately. The Communications Director must be politically savvy and very aware of the ongoing activities of the other White House offices. The new Administration should examine the nature of the relationship between itself and the White House Correspondents Association and consider whether an alternative coordinating body might be more suitable.


OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS (OLA)

Created by President Dwight Eisenhower, the OLA has continued to serve as the liaison between the White House and Congress. The White House must work with congressional leaders to ensure presidential nominees, for roles such as Cabinet secretaries and ambassadors, are confirmed by the Senate. The White House also relies on Congress to enact reforms promised by the President on the campaign trail, whether those promises relate to health care, education, or national defense. Because Congress holds the power of the purse, White House staffers must ensure that there is enough support on the Hill to secure the necessary funding through the appropriations process to fulfill the President’s agenda. The OLA reports directly to the Chief of Staff and in some Administrations has done so under the guidance of a Deputy Chief of Staff (usually the Deputy Chief


OFFICE OF PRESIDENTIAL PERSONNEL (PPO)

The political axiom that “personnel is policy” was popularized under President Ronald Reagan during the 1981 presidential transition. One of the most important offices in the White House is the PPO, which was created under President Richard Nixon to centralize political appointments. Departments and agencies had and still have direct legal authority on hiring and firing, but the power to fill Schedule C posi- tions—the core of political jobs—is vested with the President. Therefore, the White House, not the department or agency, has the final word on political appointments. PPO’s primary responsibility is to staff the executive branch with individuals who are equipped to implement the President’s agenda. Although its focus should be identifying and recruiting leaders to fill the approximately 1,000 appointments that require Senate confirmation, PPO must also fill approximately 3,000 political jobs that require dedicated conservatives to support the Administration’s political leadership.

for Policy). Regardless of the person to whom the OLA reports, however, the office exercises a certain autonomy on behalf of the President and the Chief of Staff in directly influencing congressional leaders of both major political parties. The OLA often must function as the mediator among the parties and find common ground to facilitate the successful enactment of the President’s agenda. As is the case with many White House offices (but especially the Office of Com- munications), the OLA must ensure that congressional leaders receive one unified message. If other actors within the White House maintain their own relationships with congressional leaders and staffers, it may appear that the President’s agenda is fractured and lacks consensus. This dynamic has caused real problems for many Presidents in the past.


Internally, OLA staffers need to be involved in policy discussions, budget reviews, and other important meetings. They must also provide advice to policy staffers regarding whether certain ideas are politically feasible. Externally, OLA staffers have to communicate continuously with congressional offices of both parties in both the House and the Senate to ensure that the President has enough support to enact his legislative priorities or sustain votes.

The OLA requires staffers who are effective communicators and can provide a
dose of reality to other White House staffers when necessary. Although a policy
proposal from within the White House may be a great idea, OLA staffers must
ensure that it is politically feasible. OLA staffers must therefore be skilled in both
politics and policy. Furthermore, the President should seek out individuals who
can advance his agenda and at the same time forge pathways with members of the
opposing political party on other priorities.
Most important, the OLA must function as a well-oiled machine: precisely
synced. The President cannot afford to have a tennis player on—much less as the
leader of—his football team.


Frequently, many medium-tier and top-tier jobs have been filled by policy
experts tasked with accomplishing much of the work of the Administration. At
the same time, appointees in the entry-level jobs have brought invaluable energy
and commitment to the White House and have proved to be the “farm team” for
the conservative movement.
The Office of Presidential Personnel is responsible for:
l
l
l
Vetting potential political personnel by conducting political background
checks and reviewing any clearance and fitness assessments by departments
and agencies.
Making recommendations to the President and to other appointment
authorities on behalf of the President.
Identifying programmatic political workforce needs early and developing
plans (for example, Schedule F).
﻿
l
Identifying potential political personnel both actively through recruitment
and passively by fielding resumes and adjudicating requests from
political actors.

Maintaining a strong relationship with the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) both for operational purposes and to effectuate the President’s direct
Title 5 authorities. The President is in charge of the federal workforce and
exercises control principally by working through the Director of the Office
of Personnel Management.
Training and connecting political personnel.
Playing “bad cop” in a way that other White House offices cannot
(including serving as the office that takes direct responsibility for firings
and hirings).
Serving as a personnel link between conservative organizations and the
executive branch.


In most Administrations, PPO will staff more than 100 positions during a transi-
tion and thousands of noncareer positions during the President’s first term. Direct
authority and a strong relationship with the President are necessary attributes for
any PPO Director. Historically, PPO has had direct review and control of personnel
files, including security clearance dossiers.

At the highest level, PPO is tasked with long-term, strategic workforce devel-
opment. The “billets” of political appointments are of immense importance in
credentialing and training future leaders. In addition, whatever one’s view of the
constitutionality of various civil service rules (for example, the Federal Vacancies
Reform Act of 19986) might be, it is necessary to ensure that departments and
agencies have robust cadres of political staff just below senior levels in the event
of unexpected vacancies.

OFFICE OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS (OPA)
OFFICE OF CABINET AFFAIRS (OCA)

The OCA’s role has changed to some degree over the course of various Adminis-
trations, but its overriding function remains the same: to ensure the coordination
of policy and communication between the White House and the Cabinet. Most
important, the OCA coordinates all Cabinet meetings with the President. It should
also organize and administer regular meetings of the Deputy Secretaries because
they also typically serve vital roles in the departments and agencies and, further,
often become acting secretaries when Cabinet members resign.

The OPA is the primary office within the executive branch for managing the
President’s political interests. Although its specific functions vary from Admin-
istration to Administration, the OPA typically serves as the liaison between the
President and associated political entities: national committees, federal and state
campaigns, and interest groups. Within legal guidelines, the OPA engages in out-
reach, conducts casework, and—if the President is up for reelection—assists with
his campaign. The OPA may also monitor congressional campaigns, arrange pres-
idential visits with other political campaigns, and recommend campaign staff to
the Office of Presidential Personnel for service in the executive branch.

The OPA further serves as a line of communication between the White House
and the President’s political party. This includes both relaying the President’s
ambitions to political interests and listening to the needs of political interests. This
relationship allows for the exchange of information between the White House and
political actors across the country. The OPA should have one director of political
affairs who reports either to the Chief of Staff or to a Deputy Chief of Staff. The
OPA should also include various deputy directors, each of whom is responsible for
a certain geographical region of the country.

Because nearly all White House activities are in some way inherently political,
the OPA needs to be aware of all presidential actions and activities—including
travel, policy decisions, speeches, nominations, and responses to matters of
national security—and consider how they might affect the President’s image. The
OPA must therefore have a designated staffer who communicates not only with
other White House offices, but also with the Cabinet and executive branch agencies.﻿

There should be one Cabinet Secretary who reports to the Chief of Staff’s office,
either directly or through a deputy chief, according to the chief’s preference and
focus. The Cabinet Secretary maintains a direct relationship with all members of
the Cabinet.

The OCA further consists of deputies and special assistants who work with each
department’s principal, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries,
and other senior staff. The OCA also connects the departments to WHO offices.
The OCA coordinates with the Chief of Staff’s office and the Office of Communi-
cations to promote the President’s agenda through the Cabinet departments and
agencies. The Cabinet’s communications staffers are obviously another critical
component of this operation.

In prior Administrations, the OCA has played a vital role by tracking the Pres-
ident’s agenda for the Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs, and senior advisers. It has
worked with each department and agency to advance policy priorities. In the future,
amplifying this function would truly benefit both the President and the conser-
vative movement.

From time to time throughout an Administration, travel optics, ethics chal-
lenges, and Hatch Act7 issues involving Cabinet members, deputies, and senior
staffers can arise. The OCA is normally tasked with keeping the WHO informed
of such developments and providing support if and when necessary.
The ideal Cabinet Secretary will have exceptional organizational skills and be
a seasoned political operative or attorney. Because many Cabinet officials have
been former presidential candidates, governors, ambassadors, and Members of
Congress, the ideal candidate should also possess the ability to interact with and
persuade accomplished individuals.

OFFICE OF PUBLIC LIAISON (OPL)

The OPL is critically important in building coalitions and support for the Pres-
ident’s agenda across every aligned social, faith-based, minority, and economic
interest group. It is a critical tool for shaping public opinion and keeping myriad
supporters, as well as “frenemies” and opponents alike who are within reach,
better informed.

The OPL is a notably large office. It should have one Director who reports to the
Chief of Staff’s office, either directly or through a deputy, according to the chief’s
preference and focus. The Director must maintain relationships not only with
other WHO heads, but also with the senior staff of every Cabinet department and
agency. Since a President’s agenda is always in motion, it is important for the OPL
to facilitate listening sessions to receive the views of the various leaders and members of key interest groups.

The OPL should also have a sufficient number of deputies and special assistants
to cover the vast number of disparate interest groups that are engaged daily. The


OFFICE OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS (IGA)

The IGA connects the White House to state, county, local, and tribal govern-
ments. In other words, it is the one-stop shop for disseminating an Administration’s
agenda to all non–federal government entities.

The IGA should have a Director to whom one or two Deputy Directors report.
The Director must ensure that the White House remains connected to all non–
federal government entities. The interests and perspectives of these entities are
represented in policy discussions, organized events with the West Wing, EOP
senior staff, and IGA staff throughout the departments and agencies.
The IGA can be staffed in a variety of ways, but two arrangements are
most common:
l
l
Each deputy and that deputy’s staffers are responsible for a type of government.
A group of staffers is responsible for a specific geographical region of
the country.
— 35 —
﻿
OPL has, by far, held more meetings in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building
(EEOB) and within the West Wing itself than any other office within the WHO.
The OPL is the chief White House enforcer and gatekeeper among these var-
ious interest groups. It has operated best whenever the Chief of Staff has given it
permission to use both the proverbial “carrot” and the proverbial “stick.” To make
this work, communication with the chief’s office is vital. Additionally, the OPL has
had an outsized role in presidential scheduling and both official and political travel.
The OPL Director should come from the President’s election campaign or Cap-
itol Hill—but should not have deeply entrenched connections to a K Street entity
or any other potential stakeholder. Some prior relationships can create real or
perceived biases toward one group or another. The Director should be amiable,
gregarious, highly organized, and willing to shoulder criticism and pushback from
interest groups and other elements of the Administration.

Unlike the Director, OPL deputies and special assistants need a deep under-
standing of the capital, from K Street to Capitol Hill. They should have extensive
experience in private industry, the labor sector, the conservative movement, and
among the specific interest groups with which they will be asked to engage on
behalf of the White House.

OPL staffers work with more external and internal parties than any other WHO
staffers. In turn, they must be effective communicators and initiative-takers. They
must also be able to influence, persuade, and—most important—listen to various
stakeholders and ensure that they feel heard. All OPL staffers must understand
from the outset that their jobs might be modified or even phased out entirely as
the Administration’s priorities change.

The IGA, as suggested above, represents the interests and perspectives of non–
federal government entities, but its primary job is to make sure that these entities
understand an Administration’s agenda and ultimately support it.
The IGA must work with all other White House offices, especially the OPA and
the OPL, and manage its staff throughout the departments and agencies. IGA staff-
ers must therefore have communication skills, understand political nuance, and
be willing to engage in complex policy discussions. They should also be not just
generally responsive, but also proactive in seeking out the interests and perspec-
tives of non–federal government entities.


WHITE HOUSE POLICY COUNCILS

As the federal government has ballooned in size over the past century, it has
become increasingly difficult for the President alone to direct his agenda across
the executive branch. Three White House policy councils have come into existence
to help the President to control the bureaucracy and ensure continued alignment
between agency leadership and White House priorities. Those councils—as pre-
viewed above—are the NSC, NEC, and DPC. Each is headed by an Assistant to the
President and performs three significant functions.

Policy Coordination. The primary role of the policy councils is to
coordinate the development of Administration policy. This frequently
includes developing significant legislative priorities, coordinating policy
decisions that impact multiple departments and agencies, and at times
coordinating policy decisions within a single department or agency. This
process must ensure that all relevant offices are included; that competing
or conflicting opinions are thoroughly discussed and evaluated; and, when
there is disagreement among White House senior staff or among Cabinet
members, a well-structured question is presented to the President for an
intermediate or final decision.


Policy Advice. By virtue of working in the White House, the heads of the
three policy councils will also function as independent policy advisers to
the President. This aspect of the role will vary depending on the individual
in this position and the President’s governing philosophy. Incumbents have
ranged from “honest brokers,” who mostly coordinate and ensure that all
opinions are fairly presented to the President, to “policy deciders,” who
largely drive a given policy topic on behalf of the President.
Policy Implementation. The policy councils also manage and mediate
the implementation of previous policy decisions. Implementation of a new
statute or an executive order frequently takes years and involves many distinct and more granular policy decisions along the way. It is essential to have a centralized process for evaluating and coordinating these
decisions, especially if they involve more than one Cabinet department
or agency with differing opinions on the best approach for securing the
President’s goals.

The above functions have recently been managed by policy councils through
a tiered interagency policy process. This process helps to identify differences of
opinion and reach a decision without having to take every issue to the President. It
can be used to address a single question or monitor a recurring issue on an ongoing
basis. Typically, the process involves multiple Cabinet departments and agencies
that have a pertinent role, policy interest, or disagreement. Each policy council’s
process could involve the following committees:

Deputies Committee (DC). A DC is a meeting of presidentially appointed
executives chaired by the policy council’s Deputy Assistant to the President
and relevant Deputy Secretaries. It evaluates the options produced by the
PCC and frequently directs the PCC to add, expand, or reevaluate an option
or even to reach a compromise and resolve an issue at that level.
Principals Committee (PC). When questions are not resolved by a DC,
the Director of the Policy Council will chair a PC, which is attended by the
relevant Cabinet Secretaries and senior White House political staff. This is
the final opportunity for the President’s most senior advisers to discuss the
question, make sure that each principal’s position is carefully understood,
and see whether consensus or a compromise might be reached. If not,
the Chief of Staff’s office will schedule time for the PC to meet with the
President for a final decision.
Despite having seemingly clear and separate portfolios, the three policy coun-
cils frequently have areas of overlap, which can result in confusion, duplication,
or conflict. For example, there are the areas of immigration and border security Policy Coordinating Committee (PCC). A PCC is led by a Special
Assistant to the President from the policy council and includes political
Assistant Secretary–level experts from the relevant departments,
agencies, or offices. The purpose is to determine where consensus exists,
clearly identify where there are differing opinions, and develop options
for resolving the remaining questions. If no outstanding questions or
disagreements exist, the PCC may resolve the issue and move toward
implementation at the agency level.

(either NSC or DPC); health care, energy, and environment (either NEC or DPC);
and trade and international economic policy (either NSC or NEC). Identifying
these potentially problematic areas and assigning policy responsibilities to only
one council where possible will help to speed up the policy-coordination process.
While other chapters will cover specific policy goals for each department or
agency, incoming policy councils will need to move rapidly to lead policy processes
around cross-cutting agency topics, including countering China, enforcing immi-
gration laws, reversing regulatory policies in order to promote energy production,
combating the Left’s aggressive attacks on life and religious liberty, and confronting
“wokeism” throughout the federal government.


National Security Council. The NSC is intended to be an interdepartmen-
tal body within the White House that can set national security policy with a
whole-of-government approach. Unlike the other policy councils, the NSC was
established by statute.8 Statutory members and advisers who are currently part of
the NSC include the President and Vice President; the Secretaries of State, Defense,
and Energy; the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and the Director of National
Intelligence.9

The NSC staff, and particularly the National Security Adviser, should be
vetted for foreign and security policy experience and insight. The National Secu-
rity Adviser and NSC staff advise the President on matters of foreign policy and
national security, serve as an information conduit in times of crisis, and as liaisons
ensuring that written communications are properly shared among NSC members.
Special attention should be given to the use of detailees to staff the NSC. In
recent years, the NSC’s staff size has been rightsized from its peak of 400 in 2015
down to 100–150 professional members. The next Administration should try to
limit the number of detailees to ensure more direct presidential control.
National Economic Council. The NEC was established in 1993 by executive
order and has four key functions:

To “coordinate the economic policy-making process with respect to
domestic and international economic issues.”
To “coordinate economic policy advice to the President.”
To “ensure that policy decisions and programs are consistent with the
President’s stated goals” and “that those goals are being effectively pursued.”
To “monitor implementation of the President’s economic policy agenda.”10
The NEC Director coordinates and implements the President’s economic policy
objectives by working with Cabinet secretaries, their departments, and multiple agencies. The Director is supported by a staff of policy experts in various fields,
including infrastructure, manufacturing, research and development, agriculture,
small business, financial regulation, housing, technology and innovation, and
fiscal policy.
The NEC considers economic policy matters, and the DPC typically considers
anything related to domestic matters with the exception of economic policy mat-
ters. It also differs from the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). Whereas the
NEC is in charge of policy development, the CEA acts as the White House’s internal
research arm for economic analysis.
It is therefore critically important to find people with the right qualifica-
tions to head both the NEC and the CEA. The CEA is almost always led by a
well-known academic economist, and the NEC is regularly led by someone with
expertise in directing the President’s economic policy process. Those who have
served in the role have ranged from former CEOs of the nation’s largest invest-
ment firms to financial-services industry managers to seasoned congressional
staffers who have managed the economic policy issues for top financial and
tax-writing committees.
Domestic Policy Council. The Domestic Policy Council (DPC) consists of
advisers to the President on noneconomic domestic policy issues as well as inter-
national issues with a significant domestic component (such as immigration). It is
one of the primary policy councils serving the President along with the NSC and
NEC. The Director serves as the principal DPC adviser to the President, along with
members of the Cabinet, and the Deputy Director chairs the committee respon-
sible for coordinating domestic policy development at the Deputy Secretary level.
In this respect, both the Director and the Deputy Director have critical institu-
tional functions that affect the development of domestic policy throughout the
Administration.
The DPC also has policy experts (for example, Special Assistants to the Presi-
dent or SAPs) who are responsible for developing and coordinating, as well as for
advising the President, on specific issues. It is essential that DPC policy expertise
reflect the most prominent issues that are before the Administration: issues such
as the environment, health care, housing, and immigration. In addition, DPC SAPs
should demonstrate a working knowledge of the rulemaking process (although
they need not necessarily be experts on regulation) because a working knowledge
of the rulemaking process will facilitate the DPC’s effectiveness in coordinating
Administration policy.
The DPC also needs to work closely with other offices within the Executive
Office of the President to promote economic opportunity and private-sector inno-
vation. This includes working with the Office of Management and Budget and its
Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs as well as the Council of Economic
Advisers, Council on Environmental Quality, and Office of Science and Technology
Policy. To this end, the Director should chair a standing meeting with the princi-
pals from each of the other EOP offices to enhance coordination from within the
White House.
Several areas will be especially important as the DPC works to develop a
well-defined domestic policy agenda. One is the promotion of innovation as a
foundation for economic growth and opportunity. The President should establish
an economic opportunity working group, chaired by the DPC Director, to coordi-
nate the development of policies that promote economic opportunity. Another
important area is the promotion of health care reform to bring down costs for the
American people and the pressure that spending on health programs puts on the
federal budget. Finally, DPC should coordinate with the NSC on a policy agenda
to enhance border security.
﻿
OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT (OVP)
In modern U.S. history, the Vice President has acted as a significant adviser to
the President. Once elected, the VP helps to promote and, in many instances, put
into place and execute the President’s agenda. The President may additionally
determine the inclusion of OVP staff in White House meetings, including Policy
Coordinating Committee, Deputies Committee, and Principals Committee dis-
cussions as has been done in various recent Administrations.
Recent Presidents have decided to give Vice Presidents space in the West Wing.
The VP’s proximity to the President—as well as to the Chief of Staff and additional
senior advisers—makes his or her role a powerful one within the West Wing.
Presidents typically tap VPs to lead various Administration efforts. These efforts
have included serving on the NSC Principals Committee, heading the National
Space Council, addressing immigration and border issues, leading the response
to health care crises, and supervising workforce programs. VPs traditionally also
spearhead projects of personal interest that have been authorized by the President.
The VP is also charged with breaking tie votes in the Senate and in recent years
has served abroad as a brand ambassador for the White House and more broadly
the United States, announcing Administration priorities and coordinating with
heads of state and other top foreign government officials. The Vice President, as
President of the Senate, could be a President’s emissary to the Senate.
OFFICE OF THE FIRST LADY/FIRST GENTLEMAN
The First Lady or First Gentleman plays an interesting role in the formation,
implementation, and execution of policy in concert with the President. Active
and interested first spouses often champion a select number of signature issues,
whether they be thorny social issues or deeper policy issues. One advantage of the
first spouse’s taking on hot-button social issues is that any political backlash will
be less severe than it would be for the President.
— 40 —White House Office
The first spouse normally appoints a chief of staff who has enough assistants
to support the spouse’s activities in the East Wing of the White House. This group
works exclusively with the first spouse and senior members of the White House
along with EOP personnel to implement and execute the first spouse’s priorities,
which reflect the first spouse’s passions and interests and are often identified as
important in discussions with the President. Executed well, they can be strategi-
cally useful in accelerating the Administration’s agenda. Past East Wing initiatives
have focused on such issues as combating bullying, fighting drug abuse, promoting
literacy, and encouraging physical education for young adults and children.
The first spouse is afforded significant resources. His or her staff also works with
the President’s policy team, members of the Cabinet, and other EOP staff.

n its opening words, Article II of the U.S. Constitution makes it abundantly
clear that “[t]he executive power shall be vested in a President of the United
States of America.”1 That enormous power is not vested in departments or
agencies, in staff or administrative bodies, in nongovernmental organizations or
other equities and interests close to the government. The President must set and
enforce a plan for the executive branch. Sadly, however, a President today assumes
office to find a sprawling federal bureaucracy that all too often is carrying out its
own policy plans and preferences—or, worse yet, the policy plans and preferences
of a radical, supposedly “woke” faction of the country.
The modern conservative President’s task is to limit, control, and direct the
executive branch on behalf of the American people. This challenge is created
and exacerbated by factors like Congress’s decades-long tendency to delegate its
lawmaking power to agency bureaucracies, the pervasive notion of expert “inde-
pendence” that protects so-called expert authorities from scrutiny, the presumed
inability to hold career civil servants accountable for their performance, and the
increasing reality that many agencies are not only too big and powerful, but also
increasingly weaponized against the public and a President who is elected by the
people and empowered by the Constitution to govern.
In Federalist No. 47, James Madison warned that “[t]he accumulation of all powers,
legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many,
and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the
very definition of tyranny.”2 Regrettably, that wise and cautionary note describes
to a significant degree the modern executive branch, which—whether controlled﻿

by the bureaucracy or by the President—writes federal policy, enforces that policy,
and often adjudicates whether that policy was properly drafted and enforced. The
overall situation is constitutionally dire, unsustainably expensive, and in urgent need
of repair. Nothing less than the survival of self-governance in America is at stake.
The great challenge confronting a conservative President is the existential need
for aggressive use of the vast powers of the executive branch to return power—
including power currently held by the executive branch—to the American people.
Success in meeting that challenge will require a rare combination of boldness and
self-denial: boldness to bend or break the bureaucracy to the presidential will and
self-denial to use the bureaucratic machine to send power away from Washington
and back to America’s families, faith communities, local governments, and states.
Fortunately, a President who is willing to lead will find in the Executive Office
of the President (EOP) the levers necessary to reverse this trend and impose a
sound direction for the nation on the federal bureaucracy. The effectiveness of
those EOP levers depends on the fundamental premise that it is the President’s
agenda that should matter to the departments and agencies that operate under his
constitutional authority and that, as a general matter, it is the President’s chosen
advisers who have the best sense of the President’s aims and intentions, both with
respect to the policies he intends to enact and with respect to the interests that
must be secured to govern successfully on behalf of the American people. This
chapter focuses on key features of and recommendations for several of the EOP’s
important components.
U.S. OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET (OMB)
OMB assists the President in the execution of his policy agenda across the gov-
ernment by employing many statutory and executive procedural levers to bring
the bureaucracy in line with all budgetary, regulatory, and management decisions.
Properly understood, it is a President’s air-traffic control system with the abil-
ity and charge to ensure that all policy initiatives are flying in sync and with the
authority to let planes take off and, at times, ground planes that are flying off course.
OMB’s key roles include:
l
l
l
Developing and enforcing the President’s budget and executing the
appropriations laws that fund the government;
Managing agency and personnel performance, procurement policy,
financial management, and information technology;
Developing the President’s regulatory agenda, reviewing new regulatory
actions, reviewing federal information collections, and setting and enforcing
federal information policy; and

﻿
OMB cannot perform its role on behalf of the President effectively if it is not inti-
mately involved in all aspects of the White House policy process and lacks knowledge
of what the agencies are doing. Internally to the EOP, ensuring that the policy-for-
mulation procedures developed by the White House to serve the President include
OMB is one of any OMB Director’s major responsibilities. A common meme of those
who intend to evade OMB review is to argue that where “resources” are not being
discussed, OMB’s participation is optional. This ignores both OMB’s role in all down-
stream execution and the reality that it has the only statutory tools in the White
House that are powerful enough to override implementing agencies’ bureaucracies.
The Director must view his job as the best, most comprehensive approxima-
tion of the President’s mind as it pertains to the policy agenda while always being
ready with actual options to effect that agenda within existing legal authorities and
resources. This role cannot be performed adequately if the Director acts instead as
the ambassador of the institutional interests of OMB and the wider bureaucracy
to the White House. Once its reputation as the keeper of “commander’s intent”
is established, then and only then does OMB have the ability to shape the most
efficient way to pursue an objective.
Externally, the Director must ensure that OMB has sufficient visibility into
the deep caverns of agency decision-making. One indispensable statutory tool to
that end is to ensure that policy officials—the Program Associate Directors (PADs)
managing the vast Resource Management Offices (RMOs)—personally sign what
are known as the apportionments. In 1870, Congress passed the Anti-Deficiency
Act3 to prevent the common agency practice of spending down all appropriated
funding, creating artificial funding shortfalls that Congress would have to fill. The
law mandated that all funding be allotted or “apportioned” in installments. This
process, whereby agencies come to OMB for allotments of appropriated funding, is
essential to the effective financial stewardship of taxpayer dollars. OMB can then
direct on behalf of a President the amount, duration, and purpose of any appor-
tioned funding to ensure against waste, fraud, and abuse and ensure consistency
with the President’s agenda and applicable laws.
The vast majority of these apportionments were signed by career officials—the
Deputy Associate Directors (DADs)—until the Trump Administration placed this
responsibility in the hands of the PADs and thereby opened wide vistas of oversight
that had escaped the attention of policy officials. The Biden Administration sub-
sequently reversed this decision. No Director should be chosen who is unwilling
to restore apportionment decision-making to the PADs’ personal review, who is
not aggressive in wielding the tool on behalf of the President’s agenda, or who is
unable to defend the power against attacks from Congress.﻿

It should be noted that each of OMB’s primary functions, along with other
executive and statutory roles, is carried out with the help of many essential OMB
support offices. The two most important offices for moving OMB at the will of a
Director are the Budget Review Division (BRD) and the Office of General Counsel
(OGC). The Director should have a direct and effective relationship with the head
of the BRD (considered the top career official within OMB) and transmit most
instructions through that office because the rest of the agency is institution-
ally inclined toward its direction and responds accordingly. The BRD inevitably
will translate the directions from policy officials to the career staff, and at every
stage, it is obviously vital that the Director ensure that this translation is an
accurate one.
In addition, many key considerations involved in enacting a President’s agenda
hinge on existing legal authorities. The Director must ensure the appointment
of a General Counsel who is respected yet creative and fearless in his or her abil-
ity to challenge legal precedents that serve to protect the status quo. This is vital
within OMB not only with respect to the adequate development of policy options
for the President’s review, but also with respect to agencies that attempt to protect
their own institutional interests and foreclose certain avenues based on the mere
assertion (and not proof ) that the law disallows it or that, conversely, attempt to
disregard the clear statutory commands of Congress.
In general, the Director should empower a strong Deputy Director with author-
ity over the Deputy for Management, the PADs, and the Office of Information and
Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) to work diligently to break down barriers within OMB
and not allow turf disputes or a lack of visibility to undermine the agency’s prin-
cipal budget, management, and regulatory functions. OMB should work toward a
“One OMB” position on behalf of the President and represent that view during the
various policymaking processes.
Budget. The United States today faces an untenable fiscal situation and owes
$31 trillion on a debt that is steadily increasing. The OMB Director should present
a fiscal goal to the President early in the budget development process to address
the federal government’s fiscal irresponsibility. This goal would help to align the
months-long process of developing the actual proposals for inclusion in the budget.
Though some mistakenly regard it as a mere paper-pushing exercise, the Pres-
ident’s budget is in fact a powerful mechanism for setting and enforcing public
policy at federal agencies. The budget team includes six Resource Management
Offices that, together with the BRD and other components, help the Director of
OMB to develop and execute detailed agency spending plans that bear on every
major aspect of policy formation and execution at federal agencies. Through initial
priority-setting and ongoing supervision of agency spending, OMB’s budget team
plays a key role in executing policy across the executive branch, including at many
agencies wrongly regarded as “independent.”
— 46 —Executive Office of the President of the United States
The RMOs, each of which is led by a political appointee known as the PAD and
a career DAD, are separated into six functional units:
lNational Security.
lNatural Resources, Energy, and Science.
lHealth.
lEducation, Income Maintenance, and Labor.
lTransportation, Justice, and Homeland Security.
lTreasury, Commerce, and Housing.
— 47 —
﻿
Because the RMOs are institutionally ingrained in nearly all policymaking and
implementation across the executive branch, they play a critical role in helping the
Director to implement the President’s public policy agenda. However, because each
RMO is responsible for formulating and supervising such a wide range of policy
details, many granular but critical policy decisions are effectively left to the career
professionals who serve across Administrations.
To enhance the OMB Director’s ability to help the President drive policy at the
agencies, the existing six RMOs should be divided into smaller subject-matter areas,
allowing for more PADs, and each of these PADs should have a Deputy PAD. This
expanded pool of RMOs with additional political leadership would enable more
comprehensive direction and oversight of policy development and implementation.
Regardless of whether Congress adopts the President’s full set of budget rec-
ommendations, the President should reintroduce the concept of administrative
pay-as-you-go, or administrative PAYGO. This simple procedural requirement
imposes budget neutrality on the discretionary choices of federal agencies, of
which there are many in nearly all areas of policymaking. This simple step forces
the executive branch to control what it can control. The principle may occasionally
yield to other overarching requirements, such as a presidential regulatory budget,
but in nearly all cases, administrative PAYGO plays a unique and indispensable
role in enforcing fiscal responsibility at federal departments and agencies.
The President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal disci-
pline on the federal government. Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.
Management. The Management Office of OMB (the “M-Side” as it is often
called) is responsible for carrying out several important agency oversight functions,
many of which are statutory. The Management team includes the following offices
led by presidentially appointed Senate-confirmed individuals:
lThe Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).
lThe Office of Performance and Personnel Management (OPPM).
lThe Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM).
lThe Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO).
﻿
l
The Made in America Office (MIAO), which was added by the Biden
Administration and is not a Senate-confirmed slot.
Each of these offices has responsibilities and authorities that a President can
use to help drive policy across the government. It is vital that the Director and his
political staff, not the careerists, drive these offices in pursuit of the President’s
actual priorities and not let them set their own agenda based on the wishes of the
sprawling “good government” management community in and outside of govern-
ment. Many Directors do not properly prioritize the management portfolio, leaving
it to the Deputy for Management, but such neglect creates purposeless bureaucracy
that impedes a President’s agenda—an “M Train to Nowhere.”
OFPP. This office plays a critical role in leading the development of new policies
and regulations concerning federal contracting and procurement. Through the
Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, which is generally chaired by the OFPP
Administrator, OFPP helps the Director to set a wide range of policies for all of
those who contract with the executive branch. In the past, those governmentwide
contracting rules have played a key role in helping to implement the President’s
policy agenda. This office should be engaged early and often in OMB’s effort to drive
policy, including by obtaining transparency about entities that are awarded federal
contracts and grants and by using government contracts to push back against woke
policies in corporate America.
OPPM. Through this office, the Director helps federal agencies to establish their
performance goals and performance review processes. OPPM also works with the
U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish and manage personnel
policies and practices across the federal government. The Director should instruct
OPPM to establish annual performance goals and review processes for agencies
that reflect the President’s agenda. OPPM should also be part of the President’s
strategy to set and enforce sensible policies and practices for the federal workforce.
OFFM. This office helps the Director to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in fed-
eral programs—for example, through the Do Not Pay program. It should be part of
efforts to save precious taxpayer resources.
OFCIO. This office guides the federal government’s use and adoption of Inter-
net-based technologies to improve government operations and save taxpayer
— 48 —Executive Office of the President of the United States

﻿
money. As a function of its leadership role, it is critical in interagency discussions
on a wide range of technology issues. The office thus is an important part of the
President’s efforts to modernize, strengthen, and set technology-adoption policy
for the executive branch.
MIAO. Building on the example and work of the Trump Administration, Presi-
dent Biden established this office to centralize, carry out, and further develop the
federal government’s Buy-American and other Made-in-America commitments.
Its work ought to be continued and further strengthened.
Regulatory and Information Policy. OMB’s OIRA plays an enormous and
vital role in reining in the regulatory state and ensuring that regulations achieve
important benefits while imposing minimal burdens on Americans. The President
should maintain Executive Order (EO) 12866,4 the foundation of OIRA’s review
of regulatory actions. The Administration should likewise maintain the recent
extension of those standards to regulatory actions of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury.5 Regulatory analysis and OIRA review should also be required of the
historically “independent” agencies as the Office of Legal Counsel has found is
legally permissible.6
If the current Administration proceeds with its declared intent to modify
aspects of EO 12866 or review OMB Circular A-4,7 the related document that
provides the foundation for cost-benefit analysis, the next President should imme-
diately begin to undo those changes and develop a rigorous, data-driven approach
that will result in the least burdensome rules possible. The next President should
also revive the directive in Executive Order 138918 that significant guidance doc-
uments also must pass through OIRA review.
Because OIRA review often leads to fewer regulatory burdens, more regulatory
benefits, and better coordination of regulatory policy, funding for OIRA tends to
pay large dividends. Yet over the years, funding for OIRA has diminished. This
trend should be reversed. The budget should also include sufficient full-time equiv-
alent (FTE) employees to form regulatory advance teams that would consult with
agencies on cost-benefit analysis and good regulatory practices at the beginning
of the rulemaking process for the most important regulations. These teams would
help agencies take cost-benefit analysis into account from the beginning of their
rulemaking efforts, which in turn would result in higher-quality regulations and a
swifter eventual OIRA review. To preserve the integrity of OIRA review, the staff
who consult at the beginning of a rulemaking should not handle its eventual review.
The next President should also reinstate the many executive orders signed
by President Trump that were designed to make the regulatory process more
just, efficient, and transparent. Executive Orders 13771,9 13777,10 13891,11 13892,12
13893,13 13924 Section 6,14 13979,15 and 1398016 should be revived (with modifica-
tions as needed). Executive Order 1313217 on federalism should be strengthened
so that state regulatory and fiscal operations are not commandeered by the federal﻿

government through so-called cooperative federalism programs. Additionally, the
President should revise and sign an updated version of President Ronald Reagan’s
Executive Order 1263018 on federal takings.
The next President should strengthen implementation of the Information Qual-
ity Act,19 robustly use the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act,20 carefully
enforce the Privacy Act,21 and ensure the sound execution of OIRA’s statistical
and other information policy functions. Regulatory cooperation agreements can
also promote the further adoption of good regulatory practices, which improve
market conditions for America and her allies. OIRA should also work with other
components of OMB to revise and apply OMB’s uniform Guidance for Grants and
Agreements22 and ensure that federal contract and grant guidelines satisfy EO
12866 and other centralized standards as appropriate.
But executive reforms and actions, while vital, are not enough: Congress also
must act. The next President should work with Congress to pass significant reg-
ulatory policy and process reforms, which could go a long way toward reining in
the administrative state. Excellent examples of such legislation include the Reg-
ulatory Accountability Act,23 SMART Act,24 GOOD Act,25 Early Participation in
Regulations Act,26 Unfunded Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act,27
and REINS Act.28
Finally, the next President should work with Congress to maximize the utility
of the Congressional Review Act (CRA),29 which allows Congress to undo midnight
regulatory actions (including those disguised as “guidance”) on an accelerated
timeline. To leverage the CRA’s power to the maximum extent, Congress and
the President should enact the Midnight Rules Relief Act,30 which would help to
ensure that multiple regulatory actions could be packaged and voted on at the same
time. Immediate and robust use of the CRA would allow the President to focus
his rulemaking resources on major new regulatory reforms rather than devoting
months or years to undoing the final rulemakings of the Biden Administration.
Legislative Clearance and Coordination. OMB plays a critical role in ensur-
ing that the executive branch is aligned on legislative proposals and language,
agency testimonies, and other communications with Congress. The Director should
use these authorities to enforce policy and message consistency aggressively and
promote the effective engagement of the executive branch in legislative processes.
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL (NSC)
The National Security Council (NSC) was established by statute to support the
President in developing and implementing national security policy by coordinating
across relevant departments and agencies, integrating authorities and resources
toward common ends, and objectively assessing progress toward established
goals. Led by the National Security Advisor (NSA), the NSC staff will be success-
ful in implementing the President’s national security goals only if it is made up
— 50 —Executive Office of the President of the United States
— 51 —
﻿
of personnel with technical expertise and experience as well as an alignment to
the President’s declared national security policy priorities. The NSC must then
chart a course that articulates and achieves the President’s national security goals
and objectives. The President should empower a strong NSC that not only has the
power to convene the policy process, but also is entrusted with the full power of
the presidency to drive the bureaucracy.
In organizing (by means of Presidential Directive31) an NSC staff that is more
responsive and aligned with the President’s goals and empowered to implement
them, the NSA should immediately evaluate and eliminate directorates that are
not aligned with the President’s agenda and replace them with new directorates as
appropriate that can drive implementation of the President’s signature national
security priorities. In addition to realigning the staff organization to the President’s
priorities, the NSA should assign responsibility for implementation of specific
policy initiatives to senior NSC officials from across the NSC staff structure. These
officials should develop, direct, and execute tangible action plans in coordination
with multiple agencies to achieve measurable, time-defined milestones.
Aligning NSC staff to the President’s national security goals will provide clearer
direction, a mandate for action, and a baseline of accountability that can be used
to evaluate staff performance and the NSC’s overall progress. Accountable senior
officials, themselves either political appointees or a minimum number of career
detailees, who are selected and vetted politically and report directly to political
staff should be the main day-to-day managers for interagency coordination and
implementation of their assigned national security policy objectives. They should
provide policy analysis for consideration by the broader NSC and relevant agencies
and ensure timely responses to decisions made by the President. The accountable
senior officials should be established at the direction of the NSA and draw on per-
sonnel and expertise from beyond the NSC, including OMB, the National Economic
Council, and relevant federal agencies.
The NSC staff and principals should work in tandem with the National Eco-
nomic Council and OMB at all levels, presenting a united effort to achieve the
President’s goals and drawing on the latter’s statutory authorities to guide the
bureaucracy. To accomplish national objectives effectively, foreign policy should
fully incorporate the economic instruments of national power. National security
policy must also include the prioritized allocation of resources. When policies are
divorced from the resources required to implement them, they are stillborn—aca-
demic exercises that undermine our national security and leave departments and
agencies to their own devices.
The accountable senior officials should be empowered to identify, recruit, clear,
and hire staff who are aligned with and willing to shepherd the President’s national
security priorities. NSC staff leads, under the direction of the NSA, should have
the discretion to reduce the number of positions that need high-level clearances,﻿

and the NSC should be adequately resourced and authorized to adjudicate and
hold security clearances internally with investigators who work directly for the
NSC and whose sole task is to clear NSC officials. If certain staff are determined
not to need high-level clearances, the question becomes whether they should be
part of the NSC at all.
The NSC should take a leading role in directing the drafting and thorough review
of all formal strategies: the National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strat-
egy, the Nuclear Posture Review, the Missile Defense Strategy, etc. In particular,
the National Defense Strategy, which by tradition has evaded significant review,
should be prioritized for White House review by the NSC and OMB. Both should
also conduct reviews of operational war plans and global force planning and allo-
cations with the Secretary of Defense to align them with presidential priorities and
review all key policy and guidance intended for implementation by the heads of the
Department of Defense, the Department of State, and the Intelligence Community
before they are authorized for distribution. The NSC should rigorously review all
general and flag officer promotions to prioritize the core roles and responsibilities
of the military over social engineering and non-defense matters, including climate
change, critical race theory, manufactured extremism, and other polarizing policies
that weaken our armed forces and discourage our nation’s finest men and women
from enlisting to serve in defense of our liberty.
The NSC staff will need to consolidate the functions of both the NSC and the
Homeland Security Council (HSC), incorporate the recently established Office of
the National Cyber Director, and evaluate the required regional and functional
directorates. Given the aforementioned prerequisites, the NSC should be prop-
erly resourced with sufficient policy professionals, and the NSA should prioritize
staffing the vast majority of NSC directorates with aligned political appointees
and trusted career officials. For instance, the NSA should return all nonessen-
tial detailees to their home agencies on their first day in office so that the new
Administration can proceed efficiently without the personnel land mines left by
the previous stewards and as soon as possible should replace all essential detailees
with staff aligned to the new President’s priorities. The HSC has overseen pandemic
response, and its incorporation is important.
In the end, change requires intervention, and the NSC staff should be appro-
priately recruited, manned, and empowered to achieve the President’s national
security and foreign policy objectives and maintain robust policy analysis and
discussion while minimizing resistance from those who have an agenda or who
jealously guard their resources and autonomy at the expense of national security
and sound policy development. This resistance and inertia can be inadvertently
enabled by a small and unempowered NSC.
Additionally, the White House Chief of Staff and NSA must ensure that the NSC
is functioning in tandem with the rest of the White House staff to benefit from
— 52 —Executive Office of the President of the United States
the best strategic thinking of the President’s top advisers. History shows that an
unsupervised NSC staff can stray from its statutory role and adversely affect a Pres-
ident and his policies. Moreover, while the NSC should be fully incorporated into
the White House, it should also be allowed to do its job without the impediment
of dually hatted staff that report to other offices. For instance, the NSC needs its
own counsel to inform what legal options can be provided to the President. The
White House Counsel should be part of that policy process as the President’s top
legal adviser. These recommendations provide a clear road map for rapidly sizing
and solidifying the NSC staff to support and achieve the President’s objectives
beginning on Inauguration Day.
NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL (NEC)
— 53 —
﻿
The National Economic Council is one of the policy councils serving the Pres-
ident along with the NSC and the Domestic Policy Council (DPC). The Director
serves as principal adviser to the President on domestic and international eco-
nomic policy and communicates the President’s economic message to the media.
The Deputy Director is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the council,
which includes chairing the committee that coordinates economic policy devel-
opment at the Deputy Secretary level. In effect, the Director and Deputy Director
are the officials who are primarily responsible for the development of economic
policymaking for the Administration. Once a policy is adopted, it is the appropri-
ate agency’s responsibility to implement it. The NEC’s policy process is also used
to determine whether the President should support or oppose legislation passed
by Congress.
In addition to its leadership, the NEC has policy experts (for example, Special
Assistants to the President or SAPs) who are responsible for developing and coor-
dinating, as well as advising the President, on specific issues. It is essential that
the policy expertise of the NEC reflect the current environment’s most pressing
issues. Today, this would include (among other topics) taxes, energy and envi-
ronment, technology, infrastructure, health care, financial services, workforce,
agriculture, antitrust and competition policy, and retirement programs. NEC’s
SAPs should have a working knowledge of how the Administration can implement
policy through the rulemaking process, although it is not necessary that they be
experts on regulation themselves, particularly given OMB’s role. This will facilitate
the NEC’s effectiveness in coordinating Administration policy.
The NEC needs to work closely with other offices within the Executive Office
of the President to promote innovation by the private sector and create an envi-
ronment that will stimulate economic activity while reducing federal spending
and debt. This includes working with the DPC, NSC, OMB, Council of Economic
Advisers, Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, Office of Cabinet Affairs, White
House Counsel, Council on Environmental Quality, Office of Legislative Affairs,﻿

and Office of Science and Technology Policy. To this end, the NEC Director should
chair a standing meeting with the principals from each of the other EOP offices to
enhance coordination from within the White House.
In the past, there has been tension among the DPC, NEC, and NSC over juris-
diction. It is important to set clear jurisdictions at the start of an Administration
to prevent needless and counterproductive turf fights. In addition, the Principal
Deputy for international economic policy is jointly appointed at NEC and NSC and
could end up serving two different interests. To avoid such problems, international
economic policy should be entirely coordinated from NEC.
It will be especially important for the NEC to work seamlessly with the Council
of Economic Advisers (CEA), which provides the President and the White House
offices with the latest economic data and forecasts, as well as estimates of the eco-
nomic impact of proposed policies, and prepares the annual Economic Report of
the President. The CEA is not a policy council and therefore does not run policy
processes, which is the responsibility of the NEC, DPC, and NSC. However, the
CEA does play a key role in ensuring that any policy considered by the councils is
rigorously evaluated for its economic impacts.
The NEC works closely with the White House Office of Communications and
Office of Speechwriting to ensure that the White House’s messaging and media
engagement communicate the President’s economic policy effectively.
The NEC also plays a key role in advancing the President’s economic agenda
by advising the Office of Presidential Personnel on appointments to key economic
posts, including positions in financial regulatory agencies. The NEC helps to ensure
that each economic post is held by a person who shares the President’s policy pri-
orities and works well with the rest of the Administration’s economic team. The
financial regulators are run partly by civil servants (some of whom were politi-
cal appointees in prior liberal Administrations) who often resist a conservative
Administration’s policies. It is therefore critical that an Administration not only
appoints capable individuals to lead these agencies, but also has personnel who
can be hired into senior staff positions within the agencies.
A few areas will be especially important if the NEC is to develop a well-defined
economic policy agenda. One is the promotion of innovation as a foundation for
economic growth and opportunity. Another is the creation of an environment that
fosters economic growth through tax reform and the elimination of regulatory and
procedural barriers.
OFFICE OF THE U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE (USTR)
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative provides the President with the
internal White House resources necessary to formulate and execute a unified,
whole-of-government approach to trade policy. The President should ensure
that the USTR is empowered to serve in that leadership role, much as other
— 54 —Executive Office of the President of the United States
— 55 —
﻿
EOP components organize and drive a coordinated policy agenda on behalf of
the President.
The People’s Republic of China’s predatory trade practices have disrupted the
open-market trading system that has provided mutual benefit to all participating
countries—including China—for decades. The failure of the World Trade Organi-
zation (WTO) to discipline China for abrogation of its trading commitments has
seriously undermined its credibility and made it a largely ineffective institution.
The United States, through an empowered USTR, must act to rebalance and refocus
international trading relationships in favor of democratic nations that embrace
free, fair, and open trade principles built on market-driven economies.
Chapter 26 of this book outlines recommended trade policy priorities for the
incoming President. However, regardless of the approach, successful implemen-
tation of that trade agenda will require the President to articulate a clear policy
direction and instructions for the executive branch to operate in a coordinated
fashion under the leadership of an empowered USTR.
To address these and other challenges, protect the American worker, and secure
free and open markets for our communities and businesses, the next President
must leverage the institutional resources and strength of the USTR and neither
allow institutional interests to drive a fragmented trade policy that is developed
from the ground up nor cater to parochial interests across government and Wash-
ington’s broader industry of influence.
The USTR’s mission is vitally important in reorienting the global trading system
in a direction that is open, fair, and prosperous. In order to achieve the President’s
policy goals, a strong USTR must be empowered to set trade policy from the White
House with the authority and resources to represent the interests of the Presi-
dent’s trade agenda with adequate budget, staff, analysis, and expertise to engage
meaningfully in internal and interagency policy deliberations. The USTR should
organize and harness existing interagency trade committees to serve the Presi-
dent’s trade agenda and drive a consensus among federal stakeholders, dispose
of legacy advisory committees with members who serve special interests, direct
action to implement policy priorities, measure progress toward implementing the
President’s agenda, and hold agencies and officials accountable for delivering the
President’s agenda. The USTR’s leadership should not only coordinate and enforce
the President’s agenda across the federal community, but also set and enforce the
President’s trade agenda internally.
Trade policy and priorities should be set by the President and implemented by
the U.S. Trade Representative in cooperation with the other economic and national
security officials, not by the range of governmental and nongovernmental interests
that attempt to force their policy preferences on the USTR. A strong USTR empow-
ered with the necessary resources, authorities, and interagency cooperation will
protect U.S. interests in the global marketplace more effectively.

COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS (CEA)
Congress established the Council of Economic Advisers in 1946 to advise the
President on economic policy based on data, research, and evidence. The CEA is
one of the oldest congressionally created offices within the White House complex
and plays a broad role in bringing economic expertise to Administration policy
across a large range of policy areas. The CEA has one presidentially appointed
and Senate-confirmed chair, two presidentially appointed members who assist
and often have expertise that complements the chair, and approximately 40
staff employees.
Statutorily, the CEA is charged with being the President’s principal source of
economic advice. However, this role has diminished over time as its policy appraisal
and especially formulation and recommendation functions have been taken over or
diluted by other economic policy bodies within the White House. By law, the CEA
is required to publish an annual Economic Report of the President within 10 days
after submission of the budget. This report is not just a messaging document; it is
an opportunity to provide greater rigor in support of policy areas that the White
House is prioritizing and to build up the external credibility of those ideas.
A future conservative Administration should utilize the CEA as the senior inter-
nal White House economists much as the White House Counsel’s office functions
as the senior internal White House lawyers. This does not mean that there are no
economists in other offices. There are, just as there often are lawyers in the policy
councils and other White House offices, but the CEA’s role, like the White House
Counsel’s, is to employ its unique expertise (particularly on the technical side) to
ensure that sound analysis is contributing to and shaping the policy discussion.
In practice, this means that CEA staff do not “coordinate” the policy process in
the way that the DPC or NEC would, but they should be integral to the EOP’s policy
development processes. CEA staff should support sound policy development and
execution by actively contributing to running policy dialogues, proactively raising
issues that need to be addressed, consulting on questions that arise, and guiding
EOP and agency officials on the analytical foundations of policy. Structurally, the
White House Chief of Staff should ensure that the CEA has a seat at the policymak-
ing table on all relevant policy.
Senior economists traditionally have not gone through the Office of Presidential
Personnel process and more often than not are hired on an academic-year cycle. As
a result, senior economists hired in the summer of a presidential election year tend
to remain on staff until the next summer even if a President from the opposite party
takes power and installs a new slate of CEA political appointees for chair, members,
etc. Although these hiring practices create some continuity, the presence of senior
economists who were never fully vetted for their alignment with White House
policy objectives or who were holdovers from a recently departed Administra-
tion can breed skepticism and distrust of the CEA by other units within the White
— 56 —Executive Office of the President of the United States
House, creating the risk that the CEA’s role in the policymaking process will be
diminished. A future Administration should consider hiring that reflects the White
House calendar (mid-January) and involves the Office of Presidential Personnel.
NATIONAL SPACE COUNCIL (NSPC)
— 57 —
﻿
The National Space Council is responsible for providing advice and recommen-
dations to the President on the formulation and implementation of space policy
and strategy. It is charged with conducting a whole-of-government approach to
the nation’s space interests: civil, military, intelligence, commercial, or diplomatic.
Historically, it has been chaired by the Vice President at the President’s direction,
and its members consist of members of the Cabinet and other senior executive
branch officials as specified by the President in Executive Order 13803.32 The
NSpC’s purpose is to ensure that the President’s priorities relative to space are
carried out and, as necessary, to resolve policy conflicts among departments and
agencies that are related to space.
Space projects and programs are risky, complex, expensive, and time consum-
ing—although commercial space innovations are lowering costs and accelerating
schedules. Nevertheless, while fiscal discipline should not be ignored, long-term
policy stability is crucial to investors, innovators, industry, and agencies. Policy
stability is easier when policies and programs are aligned with long-term national
interests as opposed to those of particular advocacy groups or political factions.
The Trump Administration’s major space policies—including the U.S. Space Force,
the Artemis program to land the next Americans on the moon, and support for a
strong commercial space sector—have endured under the Biden Administration.
Major challenges remain in implementation and regulatory reform to keep up
with rapidly evolving space markets and competitors. These include the long-term
sustainability of space activities in light of increasing orbital debris; creation of
space situational awareness services for civil and commercial uses; management
of mega-constellations; licensing of new commercial remote sensing capabilities;
keeping up with licensing demands due to high launch rates; transitioning Inter-
national Space Station operations to multiple, privately owned space platforms;
and (most important) accelerating the acquisition and fielding of national security
space capabilities in response to an increasingly aggressive China.
The Vice President should have a clear understanding with the National Secu-
rity Advisor and the White House Counsel that they and their respective staffs
will work within the White House to determine the scope and leadership of policy
reviews that can overlap multiple areas of responsibility. A similar understanding
is necessary with the heads of other policy councils such as the NEC, DPC, and
National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).
As a result of the President’s direction and the Vice President’s leadership, the
NSpC under the Trump Administration was able to coordinate a wide range of
space policy reviews, legislative proposals, and regulatory reforms smoothly. The
NSpC generally led on space issues within the EOP, but other White House offices
also took on space topics.
l
l
﻿
l
As a member of the NSpC, and in coordination with other members, the
Office of Science and Technology Policy developed a national space weather
strategy, research and development (R&D) plans to mitigate the effects of
orbital debris, and protocols for planetary protection to avoid biological
contamination of celestial bodies.
The Council of Economic Advisers did research on the economic benefits of
space property rights.
OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Reform updated and
streamlined commercial launch licensing and commercial remote sensing
satellite rules.
During the Trump Administration, if a topic was purely military, such as stand-
ing up the U.S. Space Command, the NSC took the lead. If a topic cut across military,
civil, and commercial sectors, as was the case with cybersecurity in space, the NSpC
and NSC would cochair the policy review groups.
Trusted, collegial relationships across the White House complex are critical to
successful space policy development, implementation, and oversight. Nowhere
is this more important than in the relationship between the NSpC staff and OMB
staff who oversee civil and national security–related space spending. Teamwork
between the NSpC and OMB staff can communicate clear presidential priorities
to departments and agencies, facilitating smooth development of the President’s
budget request. The NSpC and OMB have many opportunities to collaborate in
promoting presidential priorities while finding offsets in lower-priority programs
and funding lines.
OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY (OSTP)
The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was created
by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act
of 1976.33 Before its creation, Presidents received their advice and counsel on such
matters through advisers and boards that had no statutory authority. The Director
of OSTP is one of the few Senate-confirmed positions within the Executive Office
of the President. Consistent with other laws, the President may delegate to the
Director of OSTP directive authority over other elements of the executive branch.
Other EOP policy officials and organizations such as the NSC and NEC are formally
only advisory with relevant agency directives issued by the President.
— 58 —Executive Office of the President of the United States
— 59 —
﻿
The OSTP’s functions, as contained in the law, are to advise the President of
scientific and technological considerations, evaluate the effectiveness of the federal
effort, and generally lead and coordinate the federal government’s R&D programs.
If science is being manipulated at the agencies to support separate political and
institutional agendas, the President should increase the prominence of the OSTP’s
Director either formally or informally. This would elevate the role of science in
policy discussions and subsequent outcomes and theoretically help to balance
out agencies like the Departments of Energy, State, and Commerce and the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency and Council on Environmental Quality. The OSTP
can also help to bring technical expertise to regulatory matters in support of OMB.
The OSTP should continue to play a lead role in coordinating federal R&D pro-
grams. Recent legislation, especially the CHIPS and Science Act,34 has expanded
federal policy and funding across the enterprise, and there is a need for more sig-
nificant leadership in this area both to ensure effectiveness and to avoid duplication
of effort. As befitting its location in the White House, the OSTP must be concerned
with advancing national interests and not merely the parochial concerns of depart-
ments, agencies, or parts of the scientific community.
During the Trump and Biden Administrations, there has been a bipartisan focus
on prioritizing R&D funding around the so-called Industries of the Future (IOTF).
Under President Trump, IOTF priorities were artificial intelligence (AI), quantum
information science (QIS), advanced communications/5G, advanced manufacturing,
and biotechnology. Under President Biden, this list has been expanded to include
advanced materials, robotics, battery technology, cybersecurity, green products and
clean technology, plant genetics and agricultural technologies, nanotechnology, and
semiconductor and microelectronics technologies. These priorities should be eval-
uated and narrowed to ensure consistency with the next Administration’s priorities.
Given a long list of priorities, coordinating efforts across agencies and mea-
suring success are extremely challenging. The OSTP and OMB are required to
work together on an annual basis to prioritize the funding requests and whatever
Congress adds on top of them, but there continues to be concern about mission
creep and funds expended on nonscientific R&D.
The President should also issue an executive order to reshape the U.S. Global
Change Research Program (USGCRP) and related climate change research pro-
grams. The USGCRP produces strategic plans and research (for example, the
National Climate Assessment) that reduce the scope of legally proper options in
presidential decision-making and in agency rulemakings and adjudications. Also,
since much environmental policymaking must run the gauntlet of judicial review,
USGCRP actions can frustrate successful litigation defense in ways that the career
bureaucracy should not be permitted to control. The process for producing assess-
ments should include diverse viewpoints. The OSTP and OMB should jointly assess
the independence of the contractors used to conduct much of this outsourced﻿

government research that serves as the basis for policymaking. The next President
should critically analyze and, if required, refuse to accept any USGCRP assessment
prepared under the Biden Administration.
The President should also restore related EOP research components to their
purely informational and advisory roles. Consistent with the Global Change
Research Act of 1990,35 USGCRP-related EOP components should be confined to
a more limited advisory role. These components should include but not necessarily
be limited to the OSTP; the NSTC’s Committee on Environment; the USGCRP’s
Interagency Groups (for example, the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group);
and the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology.
As a general matter, the new Administration should separate the scientific risk
assessment function from the risk management function, which is the exclusive
domain of elected policymakers and the public.
Finally, the next Administration will face a significant challenge in unwinding
policies and procedures that are used to advance radical gender, racial, and equity
initiatives under the banner of science. Similarly, the Biden Administration’s
climate fanaticism will need a whole-of-government unwinding. As with other
federal departments and agencies, the Biden Administration’s leveraging of the
federal government’s resources to further the woke agenda should be reversed and
scrubbed from all policy manuals, guidance documents, and agendas, and scientific
excellence and innovation should be restored as the OSTP’s top priority.
COUNCIL ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (CEQ)
The Council on Environmental Quality is the EOP component with the prin-
cipal task of administering the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)36 by
issuing regulations and interpretive documents and by overseeing the processes
of individual permitting agencies’ own NEPA regulations, including categorical
exclusions. The CEQ also coordinates environmental policy across the federal
government, and its influence has waxed and waned across Administrations.
The President should instruct the CEQ to rewrite its regulations implementing
NEPA along the lines of the historic 2020 effort and restoring its key provisions
such as banning the use of cumulative impact analysis. This effort should incor-
porate new learning and more aggressive reform options that were not included
in the 2020 reform package with the overall goal of streamlining the process to
build on the Supreme Court ruling that “CEQ’s interpretation of NEPA is entitled
to substantial deference.”37 It should frame the new regulations to limit the scope
for judicial review of agency NEPA analysis and judicial remedies, as well as to
vindicate the strong public interest in effective and timely agency action.
The Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC), of which the
CEQ is a part, has been empowered by Congress through significant new funding
and amendments to FAST-41.38 The President should build on this foundation to
— 60 —Executive Office of the President of the United States
OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY (ONDCP)
Congress created the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) through
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 198840 to serve as a coordinative auxiliary for the Pres-
ident on all matters related to drug policy. The next President’s top drug policy
priority must be to address the current fentanyl crisis and reduce the number of
overdoses and fatalities. This crisis resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000
Americans in 2021.
The next Administration must reaffirm a commitment to preventing drug use
before it starts, providing treatment that leads to long-term recovery, and reducing
the availability of illicit drugs in the United States. The drug trafficking environ-
ment is exponentially more dynamic and dangerous today than it was just five
years ago as powerful synthetic opioids (fentanyl and its analogues) are mixed
into other drugs of abuse. Drug trafficking organizations are extremely nimble and
able to adapt quickly to federal government actions and changes in user behavior.
Disrupting the flow of drugs across our borders and into our communities is of
paramount importance, both to save lives and to bolster our public health efforts.
For these reasons, the Director of ONDCP should make it a point to consult with
federal border enforcement officials.
— 61 —
﻿
further empower the FPISC by making its Executive Director an EOP appointee
with delegated presidential directive authority over executive branch permitting
agencies. For instance, the implementation of Executive Order 13807’s One Federal
Decision39 revealed many ways that the systems established by EO 13807 can be
improved. The new President should seek to issue a new executive order to create
a unified process for major infrastructure projects that includes giving project
proponents more control of any regulatory clocks.
The President should issue an executive order establishing a Senior Advisor to
coordinate the policy development and implementation of relevant energy and
environment policy by officials across the EOP (for example, the policy staff of the
NSC, NEC, DPC, CEQ, and OSTP) and abolishing the existing Office of Domestic Cli-
mate Policy. The Senior Advisor would report directly to the Chief of Staff. The role
would be similar to the role that Brian Deese and John Podesta had in the Obama
White House. This energy/environment coordinator would help to lead the fight
for sound energy and environment policies both domestically and internationally.
The President should eliminate the Interagency Working Group on the Social
Cost of Carbon (SCC), which is cochaired by the OSTP, OMB, and CEA, and by
executive order should end the use of SCC analysis.
Finally, the President should work with Congress to establish a sweeping mod-
ernization of the entire permitting system across all departments and agencies that
is aimed at reducing litigation risk and giving agencies the authority to establish
programmatic, general, and provisional permits.
The National Drug Control Program agencies represented a total of $41 billion
in fiscal year 2022. Whereas the position for overseeing budget activities is tradi-
tionally held by a career official, it is imperative that a political appointee lead the
ONDCP budget office to ensure coordination between the OMB Program Associate
Director and the ONDCP budgetary appointee.
ONDCP grant-making activities have been controversial over the years, par-
ticularly within conservative Administrations concerned that the White House
lacks the expertise to oversee such programs directly. The ONDCP administers
two grant programs: the Drug-Free Communities Support Program and the High
Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas Program. While it makes sense to transfer these
programs eventually to the Department of Justice and Department of Health and
Human Services, respectively, it is vital that the ONDCP Director ensure in the
immediate term that these grant programs are funding the President’s drug control
priorities and not woke nonprofits with leftist policy agendas. Thus, the President
must insure that the ONDCP is managed by political appointees who are commit-
ted to the Administration’s agenda and not acquiesce to management by political
or career military personnel who oversaw the prior Administration’s ONDCP.
﻿
GENDER POLICY COUNCIL (GPC)
The President should immediately revoke Executive Order 1402041 and every
policy, including subregulatory guidance documents, produced on behalf of or
related to the establishment or promotion of the Gender Policy Council and its
subsidiary issues. Abolishing the Gender Policy Council would eliminate central
promotion of abortion (“health services”); comprehensive sexuality education
(“education”); and the new woke gender ideology, which has as a principal tenet
“gender affirming care” and “sex-change” surgeries on minors. In addition to elim-
inating the council, developing new structures and positions will have the dual
effect of demonstrating that promoting life and strengthening the family is a pri-
ority while also facilitating more seamless coordination and consistency across
the U.S. government.
Specifically, the President should appoint a position/point of contact with the
rank of Special Assistant to the President or higher to coordinate and lead the Pres-
ident’s domestic priorities on issues related to life and family in cooperation with
the Domestic Policy Council. This position would be responsible for facilitating
meetings, discussions, and agreements among personnel; coordinating Adminis-
tration policy; and ensuring agency support for implementation of policies related
to the promotion of life and family in the United States.
OFFICE OF THE VICE PRESIDENT (OVP)
The Vice President is elected to the second highest office in the nation and plays
a constitutionally vital role as President-in-waiting. The Vice President is also
— 62 —Executive Office of the President of the United States
— 63 —
﻿
the President of the Senate and is charged with breaking tie votes in that body. In
recent years, the Vice President has been granted office space in the West Wing
and the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.
The OVP is another one of the levers that the President should use to execute his
agenda. This is particularly true because there is significant and unique leverage
that the Vice President’s leadership of the OVP can evoke to shape policy discus-
sions and outcomes. Every other appointed White House official serves at the
pleasure of the President, whereas the Vice President is elected, and the process
for filling vacancies in that Article II constitutional office, which includes confir-
mation of a replacement Vice President by a majority of both Houses of Congress,
is governed by the Twenty-Fifth Amendment.42
The Vice President has his or her own economic advisers, domestic policy and
national security staff, and daily intelligence briefings. The Vice President should
fill his or her office with strong and sound policy minds to effectively assist the
President in fulfilling his agenda.
The Vice President is also a statutory member of the National Security Council.43
In theory, in light of the fact that the Vice President is a member of the Smithso-
nian Institution’s Board of Regents,44 there is nothing to prevent Congress from
assigning the Vice President additional statutory duties.
All of the component councils and offices discussed in this chapter include real
policy development and implementation authority, and a robust OVP should be
fully integrated into all policy-formation procedures. Only a Vice President who
is deeply steeped in the interworking of the interagency and policy councils can
offer useful advice and prove helpful in accomplishing the President’s agenda. It
is also obvious, in view of the fact that many former Vice Presidents have gone on
to be elected President in their own right,45 that the Vice Presidency can act as a
training ground for presidential office.
In the past, the Vice President has been tasked with leading certain initiatives or
issues. For example, Mike Pence was tasked with coordinating the federal response
to COVID-19, and both Pence and Kamala Harris have chaired the National Space
Council. Vice Presidents Richard Cheney and Dan Quayle were also active on the
deregulatory front and in imposing regulatory moratoria. However, OVP offi-
cials should be fully integrated into each and every process from the start of a
new Administration and not have to wait to be invited to join various meetings or
working groups on an ad hoc basis. For example, the budget and regulatory review
processes are linchpins in the execution of policy, and the OVP should have a seat
at the table through every phase of policy development.
Past Vice Presidents have also spent significant time abroad serving as a type of
brand ambassador for the White House and, more broadly, for the United States,
announcing Administration priorities and coordinating with heads of state and
other top officials of foreign governments. The Vice President, as President of the
﻿
Senate, often serves as a presidential emissary to the Senate and thus can be espe-
cially helpful in securing passage of the President’s legislative agenda.
To the extent that he or she desires, a Vice President can have a direct role in
shaping Administration policy. A Vice President who regularly attends meetings
and disperses staff across the interagency and policy councils is a Vice President
whose voice will be heard.

﻿
From the very first Mandate for Leadership, the “personnel is policy” theme has been
the fundamental principle guiding the government’s personnel management. As the U.S.
Constitution makes clear, the President’s appointment, direction, and removal author-
ities are the central elements of his executive power.1 In implementing that power, the
people and the President deserve the most talented and responsible workforce possible.
Who the President assigns to design and implement his political policy agenda
will determine whether he can carry out the responsibility given to him by the
American people. The President must recognize that whoever holds a government
position sets its policy. To fulfill an electoral mandate, he must therefore give per-
sonnel management his highest priority, including Cabinet-level precedence.
The federal government’s immense bureaucracy spreads into hundreds of agen-
cies and thousands of units and is centered and overseen at the top by key central
personnel agencies and their governing laws and regulations. The major separate
personnel agencies in the national government today are:﻿

Title 5 of the U.S. Code charges the OPM with executing, administering, and
enforcing the rules, regulations, and laws governing the civil service.2 It grants the
OPM direct responsibility for activities like retirement, pay, health, training, federal
unionization, suitability, and classification functions not specifically granted to other
agencies by statute. The agency’s Director is charged with aiding the President, as
the President may request, in preparing such civil service rules as the President pre-
scribes and otherwise advising the President on actions that may be taken to promote
an efficient civil service and a systematic application of the merit system principles,
including recommending policies relating to the selection, promotion, transfer, per-
formance, pay, conditions of service, tenure, and separation of employees.
The MSPB is the lead adjudicator for hearing and resolving cases and contro-
versies for 2.2 million federal employees.3 It is required to conduct fair and neutral
case adjudications, regulatory reviews, and actions and studies to improve the
workforce. Its court-like adjudications investigate and hear appeals from agency
actions such as furloughs, suspensions, demotions, and terminations and are
appealable to the U.S. Court of Appeals.
The FLRA hears appeals of agency personnel cases involving federal labor griev-
ance procedures to provide judicial review with binding decisions appealable to
appeals courts.4 It interprets the rights and duties of agencies and employee labor
organizations—on management rights, OPM interpretations, recognition of labor
organizations, and unfair labor practices—under the general principle of bargain-
ing in good faith and compelling need.
The OSC serves as the investigator, mediator, publisher, and prosecutor before
the MSPB with respect to agency and employees regarding prohibited person-
nel practices, Hatch Act5 politicization, Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act6 issues, and whistleblower complaints.7
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has general respon-
sibility for reviewing charges of employee discrimination against all civil rights
breaches. However, it also administers a government employee section that investi-
gates and adjudicates federal employee complaints concerning equal employment
violations as with the private sector.8 This makes the agency an additional de facto
factor in government personnel management.
While not a personnel agency per se, the General Services Administration (GSA)
is charged with general supervision of contracting.9 Today, there are many more
contractors in government than there are civil service employees. The GSA must
therefore be a part of any personnel management discussion.

ANALYSIS AND RECOMMENDATIONS


OPM: Managing the Federal Bureaucracy. At the very pinnacle of the
modern progressive program to make government competent stands the ideal
of professionalized, career civil service. Since the turn of the 20th century, progressives have sought a system that could effectively select, train, reward,
and guard from partisan influence the neutral scientific experts they believe are
required to staff the national government and run the administrative state. Their
U.S. system was initiated by the Pendleton Act of 188310 and institutionalized by
the 1930s New Deal to set principles and practices that were meant to ensure that
expert merit rather than partisan favors or personal favoritism ruled within the
federal bureaucracy. Yet, as public frustration with the civil service has grown,
generating calls to “drain the swamp,” it has become clear that their project has
had serious unintended consequences.
The civil service was devised to replace the amateurism and presumed corrup-
tion of the old spoils system, wherein government jobs rewarded loyal partisans
who might or might not have professional backgrounds. Although the system
appeared to be sufficient for the nation’s first century, progressive intellectuals
and activists demanded a more professionalized, scientific, and politically neutral
Administration. Progressives designed a merit system to promote expertise and
shield bureaucrats from partisan political pressure, but it soon began to insulate
civil servants from accountability. The modern merit system increasingly made it
almost impossible to fire all but the most incompetent civil servants. Complying
with arcane rules regarding recruiting, rating, hiring, and firing simply replaced
the goal of cultivating competence and expertise.


In the 1970s, Georgia Democratic Governor Jimmy Carter, then a political
unknown, ran for President supporting New Deal programs and their Great Soci-
ety expansion but opposing the way they were being administered. The policies
were not actually reducing poverty, increasing prosperity, or improving the envi-
ronment, he argued, and to make them work required fundamental bureaucratic
reform. He correctly charged that almost all government employees were rated
as “successful,” all received the same pay regardless of performance, and even the
worst were impossible to fire—and he won the presidency.

President Carter fulfilled his campaign promise by hiring Syracuse University
Dean Alan Campbell, who served first as Chairman of the U.S. Civil Service Com-
mission and then as Director of the OPM and helped him devise and pass the Civil
Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA)11 to reset the basic structure of today’s bureau-
cracy. A new performance appraisal system was devised with a five rather than
three distribution of rating categories and individual goals more related to agency
missions and more related to employee promotion for all. Pay and benefits were
based directly on improved performance appraisals (including sizable bonuses) for
mid-level managers and senior executives. But time ran out on President Carter
before the act could be fully executed, so it was left to President Ronald Reagan
and his new OPM and agency leadership to implement.
Overall, the new law seemed to work for a few years under Reagan, but the Carter–
Reagan reforms were dissipated within a decade. Today, employee evaluation is back﻿

to pre-reform levels with almost all rated successful or above, frustrating any rela-
tion between pay and performance. An “outstanding” rating should be required for
Senior Executive Service (SES) chiefs to win big bonuses, but a few years ago, when
it was disclosed that the Veterans Administration executives who encouraged false
reporting of waiting lists for hospital admission were rated outstanding, the Senior
Executive Association justified it, telling Congress that only outstanding performers
would be promoted to the SES in the first place and that precise ratings were unnec-
essary.12 The Government Accountability Office (GAO), however, has reported that
pay raises, within-grade pay increases, and locality pay for regular employees and
executives have become automatic rather than based on performance—as a result
of most employees being rated at similar appraisal levels.13


OPM: Merit Hiring in a Merit System. It should not be impossible even
for a large national government to hire good people through merit selection. The
government did so for years, but it has proven difficult in recent times to select
personnel based on their knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) as the law dictates.
Yet for the past 34 years, the U.S. civil service has been unable to distinguish con-
sistently between strong and unqualified applicants for employment.
As the Carter presidency was winding down, the U.S. Department of Justice
and top lawyers at the OPM contrived with plaintiffs to end civil service IQ exam-
inations because of concern about their possible impact on minorities. The OPM
had used the Professional and Administrative Career Examination (PACE) gen-
eral intelligence exam to select college graduates for top agency employment, but
Carter Administration officials—probably without the President’s informed con-
currence—abolished the PACE through a legal consent court decree capitulating
to demands by civil rights petitioners who contended that it was discriminatory.
The judicial decree was to last only five years but still controls federal hiring and
is applied to all KSA tests even today.

General ability tests like the PACE have been used successfully to assess the use-
fulness and cost-effectiveness of broad intellectual qualities across many separate
occupations. Courts have ruled that even without evidence of overt, intentional
discrimination, such results might suggest discrimination. This doctrine of dispa-
rate impact could be ended legislatively or at least narrowed through the regulatory
process by a future Administration. In any event, the federal government has been
denied the use of a rigorous entry examination for three decades, relying instead
on self-evaluations that have forced managers to resort to subterfuge such as
preselecting friends or associates that they believe are competent to obtain qual-
ified employees.

In 2015, President Barack Obama’s OPM began to introduce an improved merit
examination called USAHire, which it had been testing quietly since 2012 in a few
agencies for a dozen job descriptions. The tests had multiple-choice questions with
only one correct answer. Some questions even required essay replies: questions that would change regularly to depress cheating. President Donald Trump’s OPM
planned to implement such changes but was delayed because of legal concerns
over possible disparate impact.
Courts have agreed to review the consent decree if the Uniform Guidelines
on Employee Selection Procedures setting the technical requirements for sound
exams are reformed. A government that is unable to select employees based on
KSA-like test qualifications cannot work, and the OPM must move forward on this
very basic personnel management obligation.

The Centrality of Performance Appraisal. In the meantime, the OPM must
manage the workforce it has. Before they can reward or discipline federal employees,
managers must first identify who their top performers are and who is performing
less than adequately. In fact, as Ludwig von Mises proved in his classic Bureaucracy,14
unlike the profit-and-loss evaluation tool used in the private sector, government
performance measurement depends totally on a functioning appraisal system. If
they cannot be identified in the first place within a functioning appraisal system, it is
impossible to reward good performance or correct poor performance. The problem
is that the collegial atmosphere of a bureaucracy in a multifaceted appraisal system
that is open to appeals makes this a very challenging ideal to implement successfully.
The GAO reported more recently that overly high and widely spread perfor-
mance ratings were again plaguing the government, with more than 99 percent of
employees rated fully successful or above by their managers, a mere 0.3 percent
rated as minimally successful, and 0.1 percent actually rated unacceptable.15 Why?
It is human nature that no one appreciates being told that he or she is less than
outstanding in every way. Informing subordinates in a closely knit bureaucracy
that they are not performing well is difficult. Rating compatriots is even consid-
ered rude and unprofessional. Moreover, managers can be and often are accused
of racial or sexual discrimination for a poor rating, and this discourages honesty.
In 2018, President Trump issued Executive Order 1383916 requiring agen-
cies to reduce the time for employees to improve performance before corrective
action could be taken; to initiate disciplinary actions against poorly performing
employees more expeditiously; to reiterate that agencies are obligated to make
employees improve; to reduce the time for employees to respond to allegations
of poor performance; to mandate that agencies remind supervisors of expiring
employee probationary periods; to prohibit agencies from entering into settlement
agreements that modify an employee’s personnel record; and to reevaluate proce-
dures for agencies to discipline supervisors who retaliate against whistleblowers.
Unfortunately, the order was overturned by the Biden Administration,17 so it will
need to be reintroduced in 2025.
The fact remains that meaningfully evaluating employees’ performance is a
critical part of a manager’s job. In the Reagan appraisal process, managers were
evaluated on how they themselves rated their subordinates. This is critical to﻿

responsibility and improved management. It is essential that political executives
build policy goals directly into employee appraisals both for mission success and
for employees to know what is expected. Indistinguishable from their coworkers
on paper, hard-working federal employees often go unrewarded for their efforts
and are often the system’s greatest critics. Federal workers who are performing
inadequately get neither the benefit of an honest appraisal nor clear guidance on
how to improve. Political executives should take an active role in supervising per-
formance appraisals of career staff, not unduly delegate this responsibility to senior
career managers, and be willing to reward and support good performers.
Merit Pay. Performance appraisal means little to daily operations if it is not tied
directly to real consequences for success as well as failure. According to a survey of
major U.S. private companies—which, unlike the federal government, also have a
profit-and-loss evaluation—90 percent use a system of merit pay for performance
based on some type of appraisal system. Despite early efforts to institute merit pay
throughout the federal government, however, compensation is still based primarily
on seniority rather than merit.


Merit pay for executives and managers was part of the Carter reforms and was
implemented early in the Reagan presidency. Beginning in the summer of 1982,
the Reagan OPM entered 18 months of negotiations with House and Senate staff
on extending merit pay to the entire workforce. Long and detailed talks between
the OPM and both Democrats and Republicans in Congress ensued, and a final
agreement was reached in 1983 that supposedly ensured the passage of legislation
creating a new Performance Management and Recognition System (PMRS) for all,
(not just management) GS-13 through GS-15 employees.

Meanwhile, the OPM issued regulations to expand the role of performance
related to pay throughout the entire workforce, but congressional allies of the
employee unions, led by Representative Steny Hoyer (D) of government employee–
rich Maryland, stoutly resisted this extension of pay-for-performance and, with
strong union support, used the congressional appropriations process to block OPM
administrative pay reforms. Bonuses for SES career employees survived, but per-
formance appraisals became so high and widely distributed that there was little
relationship between performance and remuneration.

Ever since the original merit pay system for federal managers (GM-13 through
GM-15 grade levels, just below the SES) was allowed to expire in September 1993,
little to nothing has been done either to reinstate the federal merit pay program for
managers or to distribute performance rating evaluations for the SES, much less to
extend the program to the remainder of the workforce. A reform-friendly President
and Congress might just provide the opportunity to create a more comprehensive
performance plan; in the meantime, however, political executives should use exist-
ing pay and especially fiscal awards strategically to reward good performance to
the degree allowed by law.

Making the Appeals Process Work. The nonmilitary government dismissal
rate is well below 1 percent, and no private-sector industry employee enjoys the
job security that a federal employee enjoys. Both safety and justice demand that
managers learn to act strategically to hire good and fire poor performers legally.
The initial paperwork required to separate poor or abusive performers (when they
are infrequently identified) is not overwhelming, and managers might be motivated
to act if it were not for the appeals and enforcement processes. Formal appeal in the
private sector is mostly a rather simple two-step process, but government unions
and associations have been able to convince politicians to support a multiple and
extensive appeals and enforcement process.
As noted, there are multiple administrative appeals bodies. The FLRA, OSC,
and EEOC have relatively narrow jurisdictions. Claims that an employee’s removal
or disciplinary actions violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement
between an agency and a union are handled by the FLRA, employees who claim
their removal was the result of discrimination can appeal to the EEOC, and employ-
ees who believe their firing was retribution for being a whistleblower can go to the
OSC. While the MSPB specializes in abuses of direct merit system issues, it can
and does hear and review almost any of the matters heard by the other agencies.
Cases involving race, gender, religion, age, pregnancy, disability, or national
origin can be appealed to the EEOC or the MSPB—and in some cases to both—and
to the OSC. This gives employees multiple opportunities to prove their cases, and
while the EEOC, MSPB, FLRA, and OSC may all apply essentially the same burden
of proof, the odds of success may be substantially different in each forum. In fact,
forum shopping among them for a friendlier venue is a common practice, but fre-
quent filers face no consequences for frivolous complaints. As a result, meritorious
cases are frequently delayed, denying relief and justice to truly aggrieved individuals.
The MSPB can and does handle all such matters, but it faces a backlog of an
estimated 3,000 cases of people who were potentially wrongfully terminated or
disciplined as far back as 2013. From 2017–2022 the MSPB lacked the quorum
required to decide appeals. On the other hand, as of January 2023, the EEOC had
a backlog of 42,000 cases.

While federal employees win appeals relatively infrequently—MSPB adminis-
trative judges have upheld agency decisions as much as 80 percent of the time—the
real problem is the time and paperwork involved in the elaborate process that
managers must undergo during appeals. This keeps even the best managers from
bringing cases in all but the most egregious cases of poor performance or mis-
conduct. As a result, the MSPB, EEOC, FLRA, and OSC likely see very few cases
compared to the number of occurrences, and nonperformers continue to be paid
and often are placed in nonwork positions.
Having a choice of appeals is especially unique to the government. If lower-pri-
ority issues were addressed in-house, serious adverse actions would be less subject﻿

to delay. With the proper limitation of labor union actions, the FLRA should
have limited reason for appeals. The EEOC’s federal employee section should be
transferred to the MSPB, and many of the OCS’s investigatory functions should be
returned to the OPM. The MSPB could then become the main reviewer of adverse
actions, greatly simplifying the burdensome appeal process.
Making Civil Service Benefits Economically and Administratively Ratio-
nal. In recent years, the combined wages and benefits of the executive branch
civilian workforce totaled $300 billion according to official data. But even that
amount does not properly account for billions in unfunded liability for retirement
and other government reporting distortions. Official data also report employment
as approximately 2 million, but this ignores approximately 20 million contractors
who, while not eligible for government pay and benefits, do receive them indirectly
through contracting (even if they are less generous). Official data also claim that
national government employees are paid less than private-sector employees are
paid for similar work, but several more neutral sources demonstrate that pub-
lic-sector workers make more on average than their private-sector counterparts.
All of this extravagance deserves close scrutiny.


Market-Based Pay and Benefits. According to current law, federal workers
are to be paid wages comparable to equivalent private-sector workers rather than
compared to all private-sector employees. While the official studies claim that
federal employees are underpaid relative to the private sector by 20 percent or
more, a 2016 Heritage Foundation study found that federal employees received
wages that were 22 percent higher than wages for similar private-sector workers;
if the value of employee benefits was included, the total compensation premium
for federal employees over their private-sector equivalents increased to between
30 percent and 40 percent.18 The American Enterprise Institute found a 14 percent
pay premium and a 61 percent total compensation premium.19
Base salary is only one component of a federal employee’s total compensation.
In addition to high starting wages, federal employees normally receive an annual
cost-of-living adjustment (available to all employees) and generous scheduled
raises known as step increases. Moreover, a large proportion of federal employ-
ees are stationed in the Washington, D.C., area and other large cities and are
entitled to steep locality pay enhancement to account for the high cost of living
in these areas.
A federal employee with five years’ experience receives 20 vacation days, 13 paid
sick days, and all 10 federal holidays compared to an employee at a large private
company who receives 13 days of vacation and eight paid sick days. Federal health
benefits are more comparable to those provided by Fortune 500 employers with
the government paying 72 percent of the weighted average premiums, but this is
much higher than for most private plans. Almost half of private firms do not offer
any employer contributions at all.

The obvious solution to these discrepancies is to move closer to a market model
for federal pay and benefits. One need is for a neutral agency to oversee pay hiring
decisions, especially for high-demand occupations. The OPM is independent of
agency operations, so it can assess requirements more neutrally. For many years,
with its Special Pay Rates program, the OPM evaluated claims that federal rates
in an area were too low to attract competent employees and allowed agencies to
offer higher pay when needed rather than increased rates for all. Ideally, the OPM
should establish an initial pay schedule for every occupation and region, monitor
turnover rates and applicant-to-position ratios, and adjust pay and recruitment
on that basis. Most of this requires legislation, but the OPM should be an advocate
for a true equality of benefits between the public and private sectors.
Reforming Federal Retirement Benefits. Career civil servants enjoy retire-
ment benefits that are nearly unheard of in the private sector. Federal employees
retire earlier (normally at age 55 after 30 years), enjoy richer pension annuities,
and receive automatic cost-of-living adjustments based on the areas in which they
retire. Defined-benefit federal pensions are fully indexed for inflation—a practice
that is extremely rare in the private sector. A federal employee with a preretire-
ment income of $25,000 under the older of the two federal retirement plans will
receive at least $200,000 more over a 20-year period than will private-sector work-
ers with the same preretirement salary under historic inflation levels.
During the early Reagan years, the OPM reformed many specific provisions of
the federal pension program to save billions administratively. Under OPM pres-
sure, Reagan and Congress ultimately ended the old Civil Service Retirement
System (CSRS) entirely for new employees, which (counting disbursements for
the unfunded liability) accounted for 51.3 percent of the federal government's
total payroll. The retirement system that replaced it—the Federal Employees
Retirement System (FERS)—reduced the cost of federal employee retirement dis-
bursements to 28.5 percent of payroll (including contributions to Social Security
and the employer match to the Thrift Savings Plan). More of the pension cost was
shifted to the employee, but the new system was much more equitable for the 40
percent who received few or no benefits under the old system.
By 1999, more than half of the federal workforce was covered by the new system,
and the government’s per capita share of the cost (as the employer) was less than
half the cost of the old system: 20.2 percent of FERS payroll vs. 44.3 percent of
CSRS payroll, representing one of the largest examples of government savings
anywhere. Although the government pension system has become more like private
pension systems, it still remains much more generous, and other means might be
considered in the future to move it even closer to private plans.
GSA: Landlord and Contractor Management. The General Services
Administration is best known as the federal government’s landlord—designing,
constructing, managing, and preserving government buildings and leasing and managing outside commercial real estate contracting with 376.9 million square feet 
of space. 

Obviously, as its prime function, real estate expertise is key to the GSA’s
success. However, the GSA is also the government’s purchasing agent, connecting
federal purchasers with commercial products and services in the private sector
and their personnel management functions. With contractors performing so many
functions today, the GSA therefore becomes a de facto part of governmentwide
personnel management. The GSA also manages the Presidential Transition Act
(PTA) process, which also directly involves the OPM. A recent proposal would
have incorporated the OPM and GSA (and OMB). Fortunately, this did not take
place in that form, but it would make sense for GSA and OPM leadership and staff
to hold regular meetings to work through matters of common interest such as
moderating PTA personnel restrictions and the relationships between contract
and civil service employees.
Reductions-in-Force. Reducing the number of federal employees seems an
obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service, and many prior
Administrations have attempted to do just this. Presidents Bill Clinton and
Barack Obama began their terms, as did Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, by
mandating a freeze on the hiring of new federal employees, but these efforts did
not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense
federal employees.

First, it is a challenge even to know which workers to cut. As mentioned, there
are 2 million federal employees, but since budgets have exploded, so has the
total number of personnel with nearly 10 times more federal contractors than
federal employees. Contractors are less expensive because they are not entitled
to high government pensions or benefits and are easier to fire and discipline. In
addition, millions of state government employees work under federal grants, in
effect administering federal programs; these cannot be cut directly. Cutting federal
employment can be helpful and can provide a simple story to average citizens, but
cutting functions, levels, funds, and grants is much more important than setting
simple employment size.
Simply reducing numbers can actually increase costs. OMB instructions fol-
lowing President Trump’s employment freeze told agencies to consider buyout
programs, encouraging early retirements in order to shift costs from current bud-
gets in agencies to the retirement system and minimize the number of personnel
fired. The Environmental Protection Agency immediately implemented such a
program, and OMB urged the passage of legislation to increase payout maximums
from $25,000 to $40,000 to further increase spending under the “cuts.” President
Clinton’s OMB had introduced a similar buyout that cost the Treasury $2.8 billion,
mostly for those who were going to retire anyway. Moreover, when a new employee
is hired to fill a job recently vacated in a buyout, the government for a time is paying
two people to fill one job.

What is needed at the beginning is a freeze on all top career-position hiring
to prevent “burrowing-in” by outgoing political appointees. Moreover, four fac-
tors determine the order in which employees are protected during layoffs: tenure,
veterans’ preference, seniority, and performance in that order of importance.
Despite several attempts in the House of Representatives during the Trump years
to enact legislation that would modestly increase the weight given to performance
over time-of-service, the fierce opposition by federal managers associations and
unions representing long-serving but not necessarily well-performing constituents
explains why the bills failed to advance. A determined President should insist that
performance be first and be wary of costly types of reductions-in-force.
Impenetrable Bureaucracy. The GAO has identified almost a hundred actions
that the executive branch or Congress could take to improve efficiency and effec-
tiveness across 37 areas that span a broad range of government missions and
functions. It identified 33 actions to address mission fragmentation, overlap, and
duplication in the 12 areas of defense, economic development, health, homeland
security, and information technology. It also identified 59 other opportunities for
executive agencies or Congress to reduce the cost of government operations or
enhance revenue collection across 25 areas of government.20
A logical place to begin would be to identify and eliminate functions and pro-
grams that are duplicated across Cabinet departments or spread across multiple
agencies. Congress hoped to help this effort by passing the Government Perfor-
mance and Results Act of 1993,21 which required all federal agencies to define
their missions, establish goals and objectives, and measure and report their per-
formance to Congress. Three decades of endless time-consuming reports later,
the government continues to grow but with more paper and little change either
in performance or in the number of levels between government and the people.
The Brookings Institution’s Paul Light emphasizes the importance of the
increasing number of levels between the top heads of departments and the people
at the bottom who receive the products of government decision-making. He esti-
mates that there are perhaps 50 or more levels of impenetrable bureaucracy and no
way other than imperfect performance appraisals to communicate between them.22
The Trump Administration proposed some possible consolidations, but these
were not received favorably in Congress, whose approval is necessary for most such
proposals. The best solution is to cut functions and budgets and devolve respon-
sibilities. That is a challenge primarily for Presidents, Congress, and the entire
government, but the OPM still needs to lead the way governmentwide in managing
personnel properly even in any future smaller government.

Creating a Responsible Career Management Service. The people elect a
President who is charged by Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution23 with seeing
that the laws are “faithfully executed” with his political appointees democratically
linked to that legitimizing responsibility. An autonomous bureaucracy has neither independent constitutional status nor separate moral legitimacy. Therefore, career
civil servants by themselves should not lead major policy changes and reforms.
The creation of the Senior Executive Service was the top career change intro-
duced by the 1978 Carter–Campbell Civil Service Reform Act. Its aim was to
professionalize the career service and make it more responsible to the democrat-
ically elected commander in chief and his political appointees while respecting the
rights due to career employees, very much including those in the top positions. The
new SES would allow management to be more flexible in filling and reassigning
executive positions and locations beyond narrow specialties for more efficient
mission accomplishment and would provide pay and large bonuses to motivate
career performance.

The desire to infiltrate political appointees improperly into the high career
civil service has been widespread in every Administration, whether Democrat or
Republican. Democratic Administrations, however, are typically more successful
because they require the cooperation of careerists, who generally lean heavily to
the Left. Such burrowing-in requires career job descriptions for new positions that
closely mirror the functions of a political appointee; a special hiring authority that
allows the bypassing of veterans’ preference as well as other preference categories;
and the ability to frustrate career candidates from taking the desired position.
President Reagan’s OPM began by limiting such SES burrowing-in, arguing
that the proper course was to create and fill political positions. This simultane-
ously promotes the CSRA principle of political leadership of the bureaucracy and
respects the professional autonomy of the career service. But this requires that
career SES employees should respect political rights too. Actions such as career
staff reserving excessive numbers of key policy positions as “career reserved” to
deny them to noncareer SES employees frustrate CSRA intent. Another evasion
is the general domination by career staff on SES personnel evaluation boards, the
opposite of noncareer executives dominating these critical meeting discussions
as expected in the SES. Career training also often underplays the political role in
leadership and inculcates career-first policy and value viewpoints.

Frustrated with these activities by top career executives, the Trump Administration issued Executive Order 1395724 to make career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition but
who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating
and implementing executive branch policy and programs an exception to the com-
petitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions under a new Schedule
F. It ordered the Director of OPM and agency heads to set procedures to prepare
lists of such confidential, policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating
positions and prepare procedures to create exceptions from civil service rules when
careerists hold such positions, from which they can relocate back to the regular
civil service after such service. The order was subsequently reversed by President

Executive Order 13836, encouraging agencies to renegotiate all union
collective bargaining agreements to ensure consistency with the law and
respect for management rights;26
Executive Order 13837, encouraging agencies to prevent union
representatives from using official time preparing or pursuing grievances or
from engaging in other union activity on government time;27 and
Executive Order 13839, encouraging agencies both to limit labor grievances
on removals from service or on challenging performance appraisals and to
prioritize performance over seniority when deciding who should be retained
following reductions-in-force.28

Biden25 at the demand of the civil service associations and unions. It should be
reinstated, but SES responsibility should come first.
Managing Personnel in a Union Environment. Historically, unions were
thought to be incompatible with government management. There is a natural limit
to the bargaining power of private-sector unions, but the financial bottom line of
public-sector unions is not similarly constrained. If private-sector unions push
too hard a bargain, they can so harm a company or so reduce efficiency that their
employer is forced to go out of business and eliminate union jobs altogether. There
is no such limit in government, which cannot go out of business, so demands can
be excessive without negatively affecting employee and union bottom lines.
Even Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt considered union representa-
tion in the federal government to be incompatible with democracy. Striking and
even threats of bargaining and delay were considered acts against the people and
thus improper. It was not until President John Kennedy that union representation
in the federal government was recognized—and then merely by executive order.
Labor bargaining was not set in statute until the Carter Administration was forced
by Congress to do so in order to pass the CSRA, although all bargaining was placed
under OPM review.

The CSRA was able to maintain strong management rights for the OPM and
agencies and forbade collective bargaining on pay and benefits as well as manage-
ment prerogatives. Over time, OPM, FLRA, and agencies’ personnel offices and
courts, especially in Democratic Administrations, narrowed management rights
so that labor bargaining expanded as management rights contracted. But the man-
agement rights are still in statute, have been enforced by some Administrations,
and should be enforced again by any future OPM and agency managements, which
should not be intimidated by union power.
Rather than being daunted, President Trump issued three executive orders:﻿

All were revoked by the Biden Administration29 and should be reinstated by the
next Administration, to include the immediate appointment of the FLRA General
Counsel and reactivation of the Impasses Panel.

Congress should also consider whether public-sector unions are appropriate
in the first place. The bipartisan consensus up until the middle of the 20th cen-
tury held that these unions were not compatible with constitutional government.30
After more than half a century of experience with public-sector union frustrations
of good government management, it is hard to avoid reaching the same conclusion.
Fully Staffing the Ranks of Political Appointees. The President must rely
legally on his top department and agency officials to run the government and on top
White House staff employees to coordinate operations through regular Cabinet and
other meetings and communications. Without this political leadership, the career
civil service becomes empowered to lead the executive branch without democratic
legitimacy. While many obstacles stand in his way, a President is constitutionally
and statutorily required to fill the top political positions in the executive branch
both to assist him and to provide overall legitimacy.


Most Presidents have had some difficulty obtaining congressional approval of
their appointees, but this has worsened recently. After the 2016 election, President
Trump faced special hostility from the opposition party and the media in getting
his appointees confirmed or even considered by the Senate. His early Office of
Presidential Personnel (PPO) did not generally remove political appointees from
the previous Administration but instead relied mostly on prior political appoin-
tees and career civil servants to run the government. Such a reliance on holdovers
and bureaucrats led to a lack of agency control and the absolute refusal of the
Acting Attorney General from the Obama Administration to obey a direct order
from the President.

Under the early PPO, the Trump Administration appointed fewer political
appointees in its first few months in office than had been appointed in any recent
presidency, partly because of historically high partisan congressional obstructions
but also because several officials announced that they preferred fewer political
appointees in the agencies as a way to cut federal spending. Whatever the reasoning,
this had the effect of permanently hampering the rollout of the new President’s
agenda. Thus, in those critical early years, much of the government relied on senior
careerists and holdover Obama appointees to carry out the sensitive responsibili-
ties that would otherwise belong to the new President’s appointees.
Fortunately, the later PPO, OPM, and Senate leadership began to cooperate to
build a strong team to implement the President’s personnel appointment agenda.
Any new Administration would be wise to learn that it will need a full cadre of
sound political appointees from the beginning if it expects to direct this enormous
federal bureaucracy. A close relationship between the PPO at the White House
and the OPM, coordinating with agency assistant secretaries of administration
— 82 —Central Personnel Agencies: Managing the Bureaucracy
and PPO’s chosen White House Liaisons and their staff at each agency, is essential
to the management of this large, multilevel, resistant, and bureaucratic challenge.
If “personnel is policy” is to be our general guide, it would make sense to give the
President direct supervision of the bureaucracy with the OPM Director available
in his Cabinet.
