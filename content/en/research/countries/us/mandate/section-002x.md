OTHER REFORMS

U.S. Coast Guard and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and
Explosives. Congress should examine whether to return the Treasury’s former in-house law enforcement capabilities via the return of the United States Coast Guard and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. Bringing
these agencies back from the Department of Homeland Security and the Depart-
ment of Justice, respectively, would allow Treasury, in the case of U.S. Coast Guard,
to increase border security via a vigilance with respect to economic crimes (for
example, drug smuggling and tax evasion).

U.S. Trade and Development Agency. Congress should eliminate the U.S.
Trade and Development Agency (USTDA). The USTDA is intended to help com-
panies create U.S. jobs through the export of U.S. goods and services for priority
development projects in emerging economies. The USTDA links U.S. businesses
to export opportunities by funding project planning activities, pilot projects, and
reverse-trade missions while creating sustainable infrastructure and economic
growth in partner countries.

These activities more properly belong to the private sector. The best way to
promote trade and development is to reduce tariff and non-tariff trade barriers.
Another way is to reduce the federal budget deficit, and thereby federal borrowing
from abroad, freeing more foreign dollars to be spent on U.S. exports instead of
federal treasury bonds.

Other Issues. Many Treasury Department issues cut across multiple parts of
Treasury or other governmental agencies. Several are discussed in this chapter,
but not all can be covered here in depth. Other issues of concern include China,
cybersecurity, digital assets, digital services taxes, international debt defaults, Iran,
Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds and private sector pensions, sanctions
policy, and treasury auction and debt issuance.

The current tax system is not neutral toward investment. This neutrality criterion is sometimes expressed as
ensuring that the private rate of return equals the social rate of return, that the tax system does not raise the
user cost of capital, that all factor incomes are taxed once and equally, that the tax system defines income
properly, or that the tax is a consumption tax. For the basic user cost of capital analysis with taxes, see Robert

18. One hundred dollars in corporate income less an 18 percent tax leaves $82. A 15 percent capital gains tax or
qualified dividends tax is $12.30, which leaves $69.70, for an effective marginal tax rate of 30 percent. This, of
course, abstracts away from certain timing issues.

22. The effective tax rate on foreign-derived intangible income should remain equal to the tax rate on global
intangible low-taxed income.
23. For miscellaneous itemized deductions, see Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S. Code § 67). Business deductions
that were suspended by the 2017 tax bill (other than those related to depreciation) should also be extended.
This includes the local lodging expense deduction and entertainment expense deductions. The 2017 tax bill’s
modifications to the deduction for personal casualty and theft losses should be made permanent. The Pease
limitation on itemized deductions should be permanently eliminated.
24. Bonus depreciation provisions applied to specific industries should be maintained.
25. Employer-provided childcare expenses should also count toward the limitation on benefit deductions.
26. HSAs are flexible and portable, and they help contain costs by giving health care consumers skin in the game.
27. For additional revenue to fund pro-growth tax cuts, lawmakers could gradually phase down the limitation on
benefit deductions.
28. Early versions of the 2017 tax bill envisioned reforming the corporate income tax into a destination-based
cash flow tax, a form of consumption tax. A tax system that taxes labor and capital-factor incomes equally—
and only once—results in higher output and higher incomes. Usually, in the modern public finance literature,
this is called a consumption tax. On the economic superiority of consumptions taxes, see N. Gregory Mankiw
et al., “Optimal Taxation in Theory and Practice,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, Vol. 23, No. 4 (2009), pp.

EXPORT–IMPORT BANK
THE EXPORT–IMPORT BANK SHOULD BE ABOLISHED
Veronique de Rugy

he Export–Import Bank of the United States (EXIM or the Bank) is a federal
agency that was established in 1934 to provide export subsidies through tax-
payer-backed financing to private exporting corporations, as well as to foreign
companies buying U.S. exports, with the ostensible purpose of promoting American
exports, creating jobs, supporting small businesses, improving U.S. competitive-
ness, and protecting U.S. taxpayers.
In 1986, David Stockman, who served as Director of the Office of Management
and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, wrote that:
Export subsidies are a mercantilist illusion, based on the illogical proposition
that a nation can raise its employment and GNP by giving away its goods for
less than what it costs to make them.... Export subsidies subtract from GNP
and jobs, not expand them.... Moreover, in 1981, the EXIM’s practice was to
bestow about two thirds of its subsidies on a handful of giant manufacturers,
including Boeing aircraft, General Electric, and Westinghouse.1

Since then, very little has changed. EXIM operates in effect as a protectionist
agency that picks winners and losers in the market by providing political privi-
leges to firms that are already well-financed. By doing so, it risks taxpayer funds
as it stymies economic growth. This reality is not altered by the argument that the
Bank could be a weapon to fight China—an argument that rests on a misguided understanding of what competitiveness is and how it is achieved and maintained.
