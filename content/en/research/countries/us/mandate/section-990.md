ORIGIN, HISTORY, AND CORE FUNCTIONS

In 1954, the agency began to execute such core functions as “making and
guaranteeing loans for small businesses,” “ensuring that small businesses earn
a ‘fair proportion’ of government contracts and sales of surplus property,” and
“provid[ing] business owners with management and business training.”7
In 1970, President Richard Nixon’s Executive Order 11518 enhanced the agen-
cy’s advocacy role by providing for the “increased representation of the interests
of small business concerns before departments and agencies of the United States
Government.”8 This advocacy role was strengthened with the adoption of the Small
Business Amendments of 1974,9 which established the Chief Counsel for Advocacy,
and was then reinforced and expanded in 1976 with the creation of the Office of
Advocacy, providing additional resources to ensure that small businesses had a
voice in the regulatory process.

In 1980, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)10 further strengthened the Office
of Advocacy’s role, providing accountability across federal agencies to ensure that
they considered the impact of their rulemakings on small businesses. The RFA
requires federal agencies “to consider the effects of their regulations on small
businesses and other small entities,”11 and the Office of Advocacy is charged with
ensuring that federal agencies abide by the law and is required to provide an annual
report to the President and the Senate and House Committees on Small Business.12
In addition, the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act (TFTEA) of 201613

established a new role for the Office of Advocacy: “to facilitate greater consider-
ation of small business economic issues during international trade negotiations.”14
This small office has been relatively effective over the years—and more produc-
tive during periods when a strong Chief Counsel for Advocacy has been installed
to utilize the Office of Advocacy’s authority aggressively to provide a check on
regulatory overreach. The office is one of the bright spots within the SBA that a
conservative Administration could supercharge to dismantle extreme regulatory
policies and advance limited-government reforms that promote economic freedom
and opportunity.
Currently, the SBA’s four core functions include:

Entrepreneurial development programs. SBA provides “free” or low-
cost training at more than 1,800 locations and through online platforms
and webinars.

Government contracting support programs. Through goals established
by the SBA for federal departments and agencies, the broader goal is to
ensure that small businesses win 23 percent of prime contracts.
Advocacy. This independent office within the SBA works to ensure
that federal agencies consider small businesses’ concerns and impact in
rulemakings. The office also conducts small-business research.
BUDGETARY FLUCTUATION
SBA’s budget and programs have expanded significantly under some Admin-
istrations and have been scaled back under others. President Ronald Reagan cut
the SBA’s budget by more than 30 percent, and his annual budgets regularly pro-
posed to eliminate the agency altogether.15 Under President George W. Bush, SBA
Administrator Hector Barreto said that SBA’s goal was “to do more with less,”16
but this changed because of Hurricane Katrina and a surge in disaster funding.
In 2016, President Barack Obama considered streamlining and combining SBA
programs and other business-related agencies and programs under one entity at
the U.S. Department of Commerce, but opposition within the small-business lobby
in Washington scuttled the effort.17
In general, SBA budget fluctuations have been driven by several factors such as
efforts by Administrations either to cut or to greatly expand programs, the need to
boost disaster assistance because of economic or weather-related events, business

Access to capital. SBA maintains assorted financing and lending
programs for small businesses, from microlending to debt and equity
investment capital.
loan credit subsidy costs, and miscellaneous program “enhancements” to support
small businesses through economic challenges or circumstances. As noted by the
Congressional Research Service:

Overall, the SBA’s appropriations have ranged from a high of over $761.9
billion in FY2020 to a low of $571.8 million in FY2007. Much of this volatility
is due to significant variation in supplemental appropriations for disaster
assistance to address economic damages caused by major hurricanes and for
SBA lending program enhancements to help small businesses access capital
during and immediately following recessions. For example, in FY2020, the
SBA received over $760.9 billion in supplemental appropriations to assist
small businesses adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-
19) pandemic.18
The CRS further notes that “[o]verall, since FY2000, appropriations for SBA’s
other programs, excluding supplemental appropriations, have increased at a pace
that exceeds inflation.”19
In terms of current loan volume, the SBA “reached nearly $43 billion in fund-
ing to small businesses, providing more than 62,000 traditional loans through its
7(a), 504, and Microloan lending partners and over 1,200 investments through
SBA licensed Small Business Investment Companies (SBICs) for Fiscal Year (FY)
2022.”20 The agency’s total budgetary resources for FY 2022 amount to $44.25
billion, which represents 0.4 percent of the FY 2022 U.S. federal budget.21
HISTORY OF MISMANAGEMENT
Throughout its history, various SBA programs and practices have generated
negative news headlines and scathing Government Accountability Office (GAO)
and Inspector General (IG) reports that have centered on mismanagement, lack
of competent personnel and/or systems, and waste, fraud and abuse.22 From the 8a
program23 to Hurricane Katrina24 to the more current COVID-19 (EIDL) program
and PPP lending program,25 the SBA has managed to maintain its lending role even
when repeated system failures have affected its distribution of funds.
Congress has been somewhat responsive, pressuring the SBA to clean up
fraud-related matters within its COVID-19 lending and grant programs.26 Repub-
licans in the U.S. House of Representatives have gone farther, specifying that the
SBA needs to improve transparency and accountability and deal with mission creep,
the expansion of unauthorized programs, and structural and reporting deficiencies
that have allowed mismanagement and fraud to reoccur, largely through massive
supplemental appropriations.27
The SBA is led by an Administrator (currently a member of the President’s
Cabinet) and a Deputy Administrator. Senate-confirmed appointees include
— 748 —Small Business Administration
the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, Chief Counsel for Advocacy, and
Inspector General.
Entrepreneurs and small businesses require limited-government policies that
do not impede their risk-taking and growth. A future Administration can leverage
and strengthen core SBA functions that have been fairly effective at reining in
and calling attention to costly regulations and policies that are harmful to small
businesses. This core advocacy function is aided both by statutory authority and
by a network of small-business organizations and allies that support limited-gov-
ernment policies.28
Moreover, an effective SBA Administrator and leadership team can work and
advocate across the federal government to ensure that extreme regulatory poli-
cies—or anticompetitive rules and actions that may favor big businesses over small
businesses or international competitors over American small businesses—are
dismantled or do not progress when proposed.



MISSION CREEP AND ENLARGEMENT

The SBA’s request to become a “designated voter agency” in response to
President Biden’s executive order on “Promoting Access to Voting.”30
The creation of duplicative channels and “pilot programs” for the delivery of
business training rather than working through existing counseling partners.
The programs are largely duplicative of private, state and local government,
and educational system offerings.31
A push to expand direct government lending.32


As noted, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have evidenced con-
cern about SBA mission creep and the need to make a sprawling, unaccountable
agency more focused and operationally sound. Moreover, there is unease that the
agency has moved from being open to any eligible small business searching for sup-
port to being hyperfocused on “disproportionately impacted,” politically favored,
or geographically situated small businesses and entrepreneurs.
Today, initiatives aimed at “inclusivity” are in fact creating exclusivity and
stringent selectivity in deciding what types of small businesses and entities can
use SBA programs. For example, even though the SBA under President Donald
Trump proposed a rule to remove all of the unconstitutional religious exclusions
from its regulations29 to conform with Supreme Court decisions that have made
their unconstitutionality clear, the SBA has not acted on the proposed rule and
still uses religious exclusions in determining eligibility for business loans. Several
other specific concerns include but are not limited to:

THE SBA IN A CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATION

Reforming and restructuring the SBA under a conservative Administration
would meet the needs of America’s small-business owners and entrepreneurs,
not special interests in Washington, D.C. Entrepreneurs believe the SBA is fairly
archaic in its operations and programming and must be transformed to serve
small businesses in the modern economy effectively.33 Therefore, a restructured
and reformed SBA would end the long-term deficiencies, practices, and problems
that have prolonged the decades-long cycle of waste, fraud, and mismanagement.
Moreover, the SBA Administrator and leadership can provide significant value to
all small businesses by strongly advocating for their policy needs and fostering an
agencywide culture that values all small-business owners and does not exclude
certain groups. Under a conservative Administration, success would yield:


A highly qualified SBA Administrator and leadership team that can
competently run the agency and enthusiastically advocate for the policy
issues and needs of small-business owners and entrepreneurs.
A tighter, more focused SBA that concentrates on congressionally
authorized programs.
An accountable SBA Administrator and staff who report regularly to
Congress, respond on a timely basis to requests from individual Members
of Congress, and satisfactorily implement or respond to IG and GAO
recommendations.
A full accounting of and an end to waste, fraud, and abuse in all COVID-19
relief programs, including the PPP and EIDL programs, and action that
follows the rule of law by ensuring that loan recipients who are not eligible
for loan forgiveness or who falsified loan applications either pay back the
funds or are referred to law enforcement.
An end to SBA direct lending.
An approach to small-business lending and capital programs that supports
a resilient small-business supply chain (for example, by financing
technological upgrades and capital expenditures).
Outreach to all small businesses and those that are eligible for program
support across sectors and geographic areas. Through congressionally
authorized programs and collaboration with partners and business
associations, the SBA could use the latest technology and platforms to
— 750 —Small Business Administration
implement relevant initiatives to reach small businesses. Programs would
be nonduplicative and implemented on a first-come, first-served basis.

A modern, revamped, and streamlined SBA that better utilizes current
technology and platforms for operations, for reporting, and in its programs
to reach, service, and engage small businesses.
An Office of Advocacy that is strengthened by a renewed mandate and
additional resources to protect against overregulation along with a research
agenda that includes measuring the total cost that federal regulation
imposes on small businesses.
Accountability and Managerial Practice. The SBA lacks accountability and
managerial practices to measure the effectiveness, success, and integrity of its
various programs. As a future Administration evaluates agency structure and the
particulars of how the SBA is spending appropriated funds, it should immediately
require actions and procedures to compel a culture of accountability and perfor-
mance. Specifically:
l
Review all internal government watchdog recommendations and
require that SBA management implement or address outstanding
and ongoing OIG and GAO recommendations within a specified
time frame (ideally within 90 days of a recommendation) and on an
ongoing basis.
Strengthening the Office of Advocacy. The SBA Office of Advocacy (Advo-
cacy) is “an independent office” within the SBA.36 It accounts for about one
one-thousandth of SBA spending and 0.75 percent of SBA personnel. Under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, both under its current authority and with suggested


Require performance metrics and internal procedures to safeguard
taxpayer dollars and program integrity. As noted in an October 2022
IG report, failure to adopt procedures that would reliably capture data and
information for various programs, coupled with significant challenges and
weaknesses regarding IT investments, systems development, and security
controls, presents significant risks to program integrity and increased
risk of waste, fraud, and abuse.34 Addressing these shortcomings and risks
should be a priority challenge and action item for the next Administration.
As underscored by the Inspector General in his introduction to the report,
“Pandemic response has, in many instances, magnified the challenging
systemic issues in SBA’s mission-related work.”35
reforms, the Office of Advocacy could be a powerful weapon against the adminis-
trative state’s regulatory extremism.
l
Amend the RFA so that all agencies are required to provide a copy
of any proposed rule (other than bona fide emergency rules) along
with initial regulatory flexibility analysis to the Office of Advocacy
at least 60 days before a notice of proposed rulemaking is submitted
for publication in the Federal Register. The Office of Advocacy would
submit comments to agencies within 30 days, and each agency would have
to consider these comments, make changes in the proposed rule based
on those comments, or explain in a revised regulatory flexibility analysis
why it chose not to change the proposed rule. The Office of Advocacy’s
pre-proposing comments would be published on the agencies’ and its
own websites.

RFA economic analysis should be expanded to include indirect costs
along with direct costs. In addition, the next Administration should
require other agencies to seek Advocacy’s input. Currently, other agencies
deny Advocacy the ability to enforce their duty to consider the effect of
regulations on small entities by construing their regulations as not having
significant economic impact, which would otherwise serve as a trigger for
Advocacy’s input. Congress should presumptively exempt small businesses
from new agency rules to force agencies to seek Advocacy’s input and
permit new rules to apply to small businesses only with Advocacy signoff
under specified criteria.

Increase the Office of Advocacy’s budget by at least 50 percent ($4.6
million). This would allow Advocacy to hire approximately 25 attorneys,
economists, and scientists and enhance its role in the regulatory process.
Explicitly direct federal agencies to comply with the RFA. This would
be similar to the approach adopted by President Trump in his January and
February 2017 executive orders directing agencies to relieve the cost and
burden of regulation on business.37 Advocacy should organize regional
roundtables, onsite small-business visits, and an online platform to hear
directly from small businesses and entities as it did from June 2017 through
September 2018.38 This activity produced 26 letters to federal agencies
and highlighted specific regulations that need reform and how Congress
had addressed the most burdensome rules through the Congressional
Review Act.39

COVID-19 Lending Program Accountability and Cleanup. A major
immediate priority for the next Administration should be a final accounting and
accelerated cleanup of fraudulent COVID-19 loan and grant activity. As noted by
the SBA IG, “managing COVID-19 stimulus lending is the greatest overall challenge
facing SBA, and it may likely continue to be for many years as the agency grapples
with fraud in the programs....”40 The next Administration should:


Consider bringing in private-sector support and expertise to close
out these programs. Forgiveness and fraud must be dealt with as swiftly
as possible, and law enforcement officials must pursue fraud vigorously.
Entities receiving PPP loans that did not meet eligibility for forgiveness
must be required to pay back the money.
To date, despite continued oversight attempts by Members of Congress,44
the SBA has taken no action on the Planned Parenthood loans other
than to forgive them, and in 2021, it approved new PPP loans to Planned
Parenthood affiliates.45
l
Cooperate with ongoing congressional oversight efforts and
determine whether SBA has authority to reverse the forgiveness
decisions. If it does have that authority, the SBA should reverse the
forgiveness decisions for the subject loans, reiterate its preliminary
determinations of ineligibility, investigate the matter more thoroughly, and
take all appropriate action when its investigation concludes. Regardless of
whether it reverses its forgiveness, if its investigation uncovers evidence
that Planned Parenthood affiliates or any other loan recipients knowingly
misrepresented their eligibility in their applications, the SBA should make
appropriate referrals to the Department of Justice.

For example, under the CARES Act,41 PPP loan applicants generally were
eligible only if, together with all their affiliates, they had no more than 500
employees. Numerous Planned Parenthood affiliates self-certified eligibility
for PPP loans during the initial wave of loans that were governed by the
CARES Act’s size requirement. Many Senators and Representatives asserted
that these Planned Parenthood organizations were ineligible because—
considered together with their affiliates—they exceeded the maximum
eligible size.42 The Trump Administration SBA notified several Planned
Parenthood PPP recipients of its preliminary determination of their
ineligibility and of SBA’s authority to take various actions against applicants
that falsely certified their eligibility.43

Disaster Loan Program and Direct Lending. The SBA’s disaster loan pro-
gram provides low-interest loans to personal, business, and nonprofit borrowers
following a federally declared disaster. The program suffers from problems of
coordination with Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) disas-
ter assistance. For example, disaster relief applicants have an incentive to avoid
being approved for SBA disaster loans in order to increase the amount of FEMA
assistance for which they are eligible. Moreover, the availability of disaster loans
reduces individuals’ incentives to purchase disaster-related insurance. More than
90 percent of SBA disaster loans are loans to individuals such as homeowners, not
to small businesses.

In view of the challenges the SBA has experienced in its administration of this
program, as well as the fraud and abuse in the EIDL COVID-19–related program
and the IG’s concern that the systemic problems within this lending program
undermine the SBA’s work, the next Administration should:

Work with Congress to assess the extent to which disaster loans
should be offered by another agency rather than the SBA and explore
private-sector channels for administering the loans.
Specify clearly that no new direct lending programs will be
developed at the SBA.

Eligibility of Religious Entities for SBA Loans. Current SBA regulations46
and SBA Form 197147 make certain religious entities ineligible to participate in
several SBA loan programs. The Trump Administration proposed a rule that would
remove the provisions on the ground that they violate the First Amendment.48
Subsequent Supreme Court decisions have made their unconstitutionality clearer.49
In an April 3, 2020, letter to Congress pursuant to 28 U.S. Code § 530D,50 the
Trump Administration SBA advised that two such provisions violate the Free Exer-
cise Clause of the First Amendment and that it therefore would not enforce them.
On January 19, 2021, the Trump Administration SBA proposed a rule to remove
all of the unconstitutional religious exclusions from its regulations.51 The SBA has
not acted on the proposed rule.

A similar religious exclusion once appeared in the regulation governing eligibil-
ity for SBA Business Loan Programs,52 but it was removed in a June 2022 final rule
that noted tension with the First Amendment and Supreme Court precedent.53 That
final rule announced that the SBA would nonetheless continue to make religious
eligibility determinations for business loan applicants to comply with putative
Establishment Clause requirements,54 but Supreme Court precedent and Office of
Legal Counsel memoranda refute the notion that large government-backed loan
programs raise any Establishment Clause concerns.55

The SBA uses the same “Religious Eligibility Worksheet,” SBA Form 1971, to
make eligibility determinations for all affected programs, including the Business
Loan Programs. Thus, the SBA continues to act as though the unconstitutional
regulation were still in place, and there is no Establishment Clause basis for doing
so. The next Administration should immediately:

Notify Congress under 28 U.S. Code § 530D that it will not enforce
these unconstitutional regulations.
Take down SBA Form 1971.
Finalize the Trump Administration’s proposed rule or publish its own
updated proposed rule to remove the unconstitutional regulations.

Continue the SBIR and SBTT programs as they successfully fund the
next wave of technological innovation to compete with Big Tech.
Urge Congress to expand the amount that other agencies are required
to set aside from their general R&D budgets for the SBIR program.
Ensure the enactment of stricter rules requiring that SBIR funds
must be expended on capital investments in the United States.

Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology
Transfer Programs. The SBA “coordinates and monitors the Small Business
Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) pro-
grams for all federal agencies with extramural budgets for research or research and
development (R/R&D) in excess of the expenditures established in sections 9(f )
and 9(n) of the Small Business Act.”56 The SBIR and STTR Extension Act of 2022
extended these programs from September 30, 2022, through September 30, 2025.57
SBIR requires that 3.2 percent of spending by agencies with extramural R&D
budgets of $100 million or more must be directed to small businesses. STTR allo-
cates 0.45 percent of federal research spending to small firms.58 Research has shown
that this small portion of federal R&D spending is disproportionately effective.59
The SBIR program has consistently demonstrated its ability to fund advanced
technologies through to private-market viability and invests more in America’s
heartland than venture capital invests.60

SBIR and STTR have overcome the tendency of federal contracting officers
to deal only with large firms that are familiar to them and have the expertise and
lobbying clout to navigate the federal procurement process. The next Adminis-
tration should:

Domestic Manufacturing and Small Business. Small businesses in the
manufacturing sector face shortfalls in access to capital.61 As manufacturing
employment, domestic business investment, and non–information technology
output have declined,62 expectations for market returns and the capital available
to small manufacturing enterprises have diminished. This is especially true for
capital-intensive sectors like transportation and energy that require large up-front
investments and relatively lower-margin sectors like plastics, textiles, furniture,
and agriculture. Yet these industries and others like them traditionally have been
the backbone of American manufacturing employment. They also are sources of
self-sufficiency and resilience at a time when global supply chains are increas-
ingly uncertain.

The public policy problems that are caused by declining small manufacturing
are especially acute when it comes to the production of advanced technologies.
Other agencies and programs invest immense taxpayer resources in basic science
and research. Over time, that research results in some breakthrough technologies,
but when it is time to put these breakthroughs into practice by manufacturing
goods and services, much of the necessary productive capacity is offshore.63 For
many technologies, the American economy lacks the capacity to “scale up” inno-
vations that might not be immediately profitable. Instead, those technologies are
put into practice abroad. In this way, foreign companies and foreign productive
sites buy and implement taxpayer-funded American technologies.
The SBA’s existing programs should be reformed to expand the private market
for capital in small-manufacturer expansion. The next Administration should:

Ask Congress to make available a category of Section 7(a) loans with
a larger available principal that is used to finance manufacturing
facility construction and equipment upgrading. The proposed SBA
Reauthorization and Improvement Act of 2019, for example, would
have increased the maximum loan principal to $50 million for advanced
manufacturing construction and upgrading.64 The Section 7(a) loan
program operates through private lenders and guarantees a portion of
private-sector loans made to qualifying small businesses. The maximum
principal available is $5 million, but small businesses in capital-intensive
sectors require significantly larger amounts of capital to finance up-front
capital costs.

Reform the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program
to refocus its support on small businesses rather than technology
startups only. The SBIC program operates through private venture capital
and private equity funds by providing eligible funds with guaranteed debt
financing to support investments in small businesses. However, the program largely duplicates private-sector venture capital to the extent that the sector
receiving much of its support is software and information technology, which
already receive the lion’s share of venture capital investment.65
In addition, Congress should reform the SBIC program to make its
financing more favorable to capital-intense investments and small
manufacturers. The Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection,
and Schools (HEALS) Act, introduced in 2020,66 and American Innovation
and Manufacturing Act, introduced in 2021,67 would allow SBIC to offer
longer-term financing to manufacturers and make the program more
fiscally sustainable.

Encourage Congress to create a “medium-sized business”
classification with its eligibility for programs confined to access
to capital programs from projects for which credit elsewhere
does not exist.

SBA POLICY PRIORITIES FOR 2025 AND BEYOND
Legislation. The new Administration can support SBA reform legislation pro-
posed in Congress that aligns with key measures outlined in this chapter. It also
can support legislative initiatives that would help SBA to focus on its core statutory
activities such as capital access, federal contracting opportunities, and regulatory
advocacy. For example:

The IMPROVE the SBA Act68 would strengthen accountability, transparency,
and oversight of the SBA and aligns with many of the reforms outlined in
this chapter.

Small-Business Size Standard Modernization. Many small-business pro-
grams both inside and outside the SBA use the SBA’s definition of “small business.”
Under the Small Business Act, the SBA is tasked with defining what counts as a
small business and ensuring that the definition varies from industry to industry to
reflect differences in regular size by industry. However, the SBA’s small-business
size standards reflect a one-size-fits-all approach under which all businesses within
its size standard are considered small businesses for all eligible purposes, from gov-
ernment contracting preferences to eligibility for SBA loans through private banks.
At the same time, the SBA is an outlier among competing economies in not
considering medium-sized enterprises along with small businesses, often referred
to collectively as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Medium-sized and
regional businesses are increasingly critical to maintaining competition. The next
Administration should:

The Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act70 (SBREFA) panel
process allows small businesses to provide input on agency rulemakings,
gives participating small businesses greater procedural rights, and allows for
judicial review of agency violations of the SBREFA panel process. SBREFA
panel requirements should be extended to all federal agencies.
The Fair and Open Competition Act71 would disallow the use of project labor
agreements (PLAs) in federal contracting as required in President Biden’s
Executive Order 14063,72 which puts small businesses at a competitive
disadvantage and works against the SBA’s governmentwide contracting goal
for small businesses.

The JOBS Act 4.073 would advance regulatory improvements and
modernization of various Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules
to enhance capital formation and access.

The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act69 would
require federal agencies to perform more thorough RFA economic analysis
and provide a rationale for proposed regulations. It also would waive fines
for certain first-time paperwork violations.
