The Jones Act. 

The Jones Act (Merchant Marine Act of 1920)70 requires that
ships traveling between U.S. ports must be U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed.
In practice, this is an “America last” policy that has decimated the American mari-
time industry.71 Because of Jones Act regulations, American-built ships cost three
to four times more to build than foreign-built ships cost. As a result, the entire
Jones Act fleet is down to just 92 ships, many of which are old and obsolete. In fact,
Jones Act–compliant shipping is so expensive that it is often cheaper for East Coast
ports to import oil from Vladimir Putin’s Russia than it is to send it up the coast
from Houston or New Orleans. The national security (to say nothing of energy
security) implications of reliance on Russia for oil and gas are obvious.
The Jones Act’s original national security justifications are just as dubious. The
act’s goal was to guarantee a sizable fleet of American ships that could be pressed
into war service if needed. Aircraft carriers and other post-1920 naval innovations
have made this argument obsolete. An $800 billion defense budget has plenty of
room to maintain a Navy to defend American security interests around the world.

The U.S. Navy would likely prefer not to use Jones Act ships anyway, because they
tend to be older and in poorer condition than its own ships or similar foreign-made
but domestically owned commercial ships that could also be pressed into service.
As with many other industries, U.S. shipbuilding could be the envy of the world if
it could operate in a free market, but the maritime lobby prefers a quiet, cozy exis-
tence on the dole even as it harms American consumers and national security. The
next conservative Administration should unleash American potential by unilater-
ally enacting Jones Act exemptions wherever allowed, as currently happens most
years during hurricane season, and working with Congress to repeal the Jones Act.
Trade and Inflation. The post-COVID inflation spike may be over long before
the next Administration takes office, but keeping it under control should remain
a high priority. Free traders should not oversell their case by saying that liberal-
ization would solve inflation. Inflation is predominantly a monetary phenomenon,
not a trade phenomenon, but tariff relief can help at the margin by immediately
lowering prices on tariffed goods and slightly boosting long-term growth.72 While
this would not affect the money supply, which is inflation’s key variable, even roll-
ing back the tariffs enacted since 2017 would likely have a positive effect on the
Consumer Price Index.

The easiest way to curb inflation (or to create it) is for the Federal Reserve to
work the monetary side of the equation, but the real output side has a similar effect
on prices. Lifting trade barriers is one way to boost output. It also has the added
benefit of requiring no additional spending. At the very least, this can make the
Federal Reserve’s job easier as the spending excesses of Congress and President
Biden continue unabated in the coming years.

It is important not to oversell trade’s inflation benefits as a cure-all, but at the
margin, it can help. The next Administration should keep this in mind as it tries
to cope with this politically volatile issue.

Trade and Foreign Policy. We have seen how trade liberalization would boost
the domestic economy and make American businesses more competitive, but
conservative trade policies also benefit America’s foreign policy interests. Policy-
makers should therefore:

Negotiate multilateral and bilateral trade agreements.
Reform the World Trade Organization or build a successor organization
with membership limited to liberal democracies.
Repeal the Jones Act to replace Russian energy imports with
domestic production.

Develop a multifaceted, long-term China policy that takes seriously
America’s biggest foreign policy threat and deals with it on several fronts.
National Security. The most persuasive arguments against a market-oriented
trade policy come from another national objective: national security. Protection-
ism and similar progressive policies tend to weaken American security, but trade
creates peace. The more countries trade, the less likely they are to fight one another
and the more robust their supply networks will be. Going to war with customers
is bad for business.

Without a strong economic interest in continued U.S. investment and exports,
for example, China’s behavior would likely become increasingly less predictable
and more dangerous. Anyone who thinks Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General
Secretary Xi Jinping and the government in Beijing are bad actors now—which they
are—should consider what would happen if the Chinese convinced liberal countries
like the United States to decouple from them, leaving them free to pursue whatever
policies they wish without the significant counterweight that America can provide.
That is one reason for Xi Jinping’s emphasis on centralization and self-suffi-
ciency. He does not like international pressure about his government’s human
rights violations and bad-faith trading policies, and decoupling from trading part-
ners like America is one way to avoid that pressure. A less constrained China would
be poorer but much more unstable and dangerous to its neighbors and to America
than it would be if it still had to engage regularly with the rest of the world.
Trade Promotion Authority. Trade agreements can take years to negotiate.
One way to accelerate the process is for Congress to grant the President Trade
Promotion Authority (TPA). It was first granted under the 1974 Trade Act, which contains the Sections 201 and 301 tariff delegations. TPA, then called fast-track, has aided several trade agreements, including NAFTA and the USMCA, which took
effect in 2020. TPA has lapsed before during slow periods in trade policy, most
recently in July 2021, and remains lapsed today.
The President should work with Congress to renew TPA to rationalize negoti-
ations for upcoming trade agreements with the United Kingdom, the European
Union, and others.

Both supporters and critics have questions regarding TPA’s implications for the
constitutional separation of powers, and policymakers should take those questions
seriously. As things currently stand, Congress has some oversight powers over the
President’s negotiations under TPA, but they are limited. Congress can increase
its oversight by passing new legislation superseding relevant provisions of the
1974 Trade Act. However, that is a double-edged sword. A Congress that largely
favors free trade could exercise oversight to keep the President on the straight and
narrow in trade negotiations. A progressive Congress would instead insist that the
President negotiate for as many trade-unrelated provisions as possible to benefit
labor and green constituencies while pushing progressive policies on the U.S. and
its trading partners.

On balance, a single voice at the negotiating table that is subject to congressional
oversight is the best posture for American workers and consumers. A fractious
Congress has yet to demonstrate the capacity to negotiate with other nations, but
it can help to hold the Administration accountable.
Trade Agreements with the United Kingdom, European Union, and
Others. Even with a renewed TPA, trade agreement negotiations will likely take
years. The Trump and Biden Administrations were not inclined to start the process,
so that job may well fall to the next Administration. In that sense, the delays may
end up being worth it.

If there is one lodestar to follow, it is to restrict these agreements to trade issues
only. Ever since NAFTA, trade-unrelated provisions have taken on a greater role
in trade agreements. These create sticking points and are routinely hijacked by
rent-seeking special interests and progressive ideologues who demand subsidies,
carve-outs, and economically distorting labor and environmental standards that
have nothing to do with trade. If governments are to negotiate these issues, they
should do so in separate agreements so they do not torpedo efforts to liberalize
and engage with allies. Trade agreements should lighten burdens, not create new
ones by attempting to address non-trade issues.
Policy leaders in the United States and the United Kingdom, including
experts from The Heritage Foundation and the Competitive Enterprise Insti-
tute, have prepared a model trade agreement along these lines.73 Along with TPA
renewal, this would greatly reduce negotiating costs. This template is also readily
adaptable for agreements with Europe and any other allies that are willing to﻿

liberalize their economies and build a stronger alliance with America. The draft
U.S.–U.K. agreement includes an accession chapter to allow others to join on
the same terms.

Restoring or Replacing the WTO Dispute Resolution Process. The World
Trade Organization as we know it may be mortally wounded. This deprives the U.S.
of the WTO’s dispute resolution process, under which the U.S. it won 85 percent of
the cases it brought. The WTO’s slow death began under the Obama Administra-
tion, which refused to allow appointees to the WTO’s appellate board, which as a
consequence is now nonfunctional. Both the Trump and Biden Administrations
have continued the Obama Administration’s approach.
That means that every case in the dispute resolution process will sputter to
a halt as parties file appeals that cannot be heard. If the WTO is no longer fit for
that purpose, it may be better to look in a different direction. More than 20 years
ago, a Heritage Foundation senior fellow proposed that America and other free
economies should form a Global Free Trade Alliance that is open to all countries
that adhere to a truly free market system with appropriate safeguards such as
property rights, lack of corruption, and enforcement of contracts.74 Alongside a
general agreement on low to zero tariffs, the alliance would move to reduce the
effect of nontariff barriers (such as the previously noted baby formula ingredient
and labeling barriers) by basing trade around the principle of mutual recognition.
Such an alliance could be started by a trade agreement between the United States
and, for example, the United Kingdom with an accession chapter allowing others
to join if they meet the criteria.

It would be essential for a Global Free Trade Alliance to avoid the WTO’s most
serious problem: the exemptions from its rules that are granted to developing
countries. When China joined the WTO in 2001, it was granted developing-na-
tion status, which it continues to use to dodge rules that should apply to it. Other
countries have used that status to delay needed reforms. Rule exemptions give
some countries a perverse incentive to remain poor and autocratic.
A Global Free Trade Alliance would allow the U.S. to enjoy the benefits of a rules-
based international trading system without the WTO’s shortcomings. Negotiation
costs would be lower because the countries would already be allied on many issues.
In addition, there would be no separate tiers with different rules, and this would
give developing countries an incentive to liberalize. In addition to being good for
its own sake, liberalization would give them entry into a prestigious club that tilted
toward America’s orbit and away from China’s.


Closing the Export–Import Bank. The Export–Import Bank (EXIM) is an
unusually clear example of how vulnerable trade protectionism is to being hijacked
by special interests.75 In most years, about half of EXIM’s business benefits a single
company, Boeing. Their relationship is so cozy that EXIM’s nickname around
Washington is “the Bank of Boeing.”
— 812 —Trade
lIt has a long record of deals with authoritarian governments.
lIt subsidizes direct foreign competitors of domestic businesses.

It has been hijacked by progressives to advance their climate and other
preferred policies.

Unlike most other agencies, EXIM has a charter that expires. Congress must
renew it periodically, or else the agency will permanently close. Its current charter
expires at the end of 2026. Closing this New Deal–era legacy agency would be a
conservative victory on a number of fronts. It is also a winnable battle: Congress
just needs to do nothing.

Conservatives have both foreign policy and economic reasons to oppose
EXIM. EXIM has a long history of providing financing for authoritarian govern-
ments in China, Russia, and the Middle East that often oppose U.S. foreign policy
interests, and its deals often oppose U.S. economic interests. EXIM financing
also harms domestic airlines. Many EXIM financing deals enable foreign state-
run airlines to buy Boeing jets at a discount. These foreign airlines, subsidized
by the U.S. government, then compete directly with U.S. airlines on interna-
tional routes.

More recently, the Biden Administration has expanded EXIM’s mission to
advance progressive policy goals, including limits on financing for projects that
involve fossil fuels or contribute to climate change, preferential treatment for
renewable energy projects, and quotas for projects that benefit women-owned and
minority-owned businesses. All of these could raise EXIM’s default rates, putting
taxpayer dollars at risk.

The strongest argument in EXIM’s favor is that it boosts U.S. exports by financ-
ing projects that would otherwise never receive financing. We now have evidence
that this argument is false: EXIM does not finance additional exports; instead, it
largely substitutes for other forms of export financing that would occur anyway.
EXIM’s authorization lapsed in 2014–2015 because of conservative opposition
to renewing its charter. During this lapse, EXIM maintained its existing portfo-
lio but was unable to take on new business. Boeing reported no trouble finding
alternative financing and even reported record profits during EXIM’s lapse while
working to fulfill a seven-year backlog of orders.76
EXIM boasts an extremely low default rate, but that is because of selection
bias. EXIM overwhelmingly takes on low-risk projects that private banks would
be happy to finance, although this admittedly could change somewhat with EXIM’s
Biden-era mandates to finance climate and other policy-focused projects.
EXIM is also a textbook example of regulatory capture.

Its beneficiaries have proven they can get adequate financing from
private banks.

EXIM’s charter expires at the end of 2026. The agency will close automatically
unless Congress and the President decide to extend it. Closing EXIM should be
one of the next Administration’s easiest decisions.

Adopting a Multi-Pronged China Strategy. An effective American policy
toward China needs to take a realistic view of the country, its leaders, their
strengths, and the serious challenges they face. It should be comprehensive and
flexible. A threatened CCP is dangerous, perhaps now more than at any time since
Mao Tse-Tung, as Xi Jinping continues to use strong-arm tactics to consolidate his
power and saber-rattling to challenge the international order.
At the same time, recent revelations about China’s official statistics overstating
its GDP by 30 percent track well with other problems that were already known.77
These include one of the world’s worst demographic aging curves thanks to China’s
one-child policy; a population that may already be declining; an unsustainable debt
load that is already causing problems; countless failed boondoggles, from empty
cities to its underwhelming Belt-and-Road Initiative, that are wasting significant
resources; Xi Jinping’s authoritarian turn; increasing state control of the economy;
and a zero-COVID policy that has sabotaged the economy and driven away foreign
investment.78

America has its problems, but it is in better shape than China on nearly every
measure, especially in the long run. While the facts on the ground should inoculate
the next Administration against the most strident China fearmongering circulating
in the media and in Washington, that does not mean that the government in Beijing
is no threat to American interests. The question is: What should we do about it?
A serious China policy will require American policymakers to integrate doc-
trines, institutional prerogatives, expertise, and realistic objectives. Traditional
Cabinet-level bureaucracies like those at the Departments of Defense, State, and
Commerce will need to work together to pursue a comprehensive American strat-
egy. Scores of incremental, narrowly targeted policies are necessary. They will not
make for good soundbites on cable news, and many will operate slowly and out of
sight from most news cycles even as progress is made.
An effective China policy must also allow for adaptation because the CCP will
not sit idly by. As people react to developments, America needs flexible options.
Trade isolationism is inherently inflexible because it reduces the number of con-
tact points with China.

This is a tougher political sell than loud, simplistic jeremiads, but going the extra
mile to solve these difficult coordination problems is vital to America’s interests.
Trade and engagement with China are necessary if we are to contain the threats
that China poses to its neighbors and to the U.S. The next Administration should:

End China’s developing-nation status in the WTO and other
international organizations. China is an advanced manufacturing
economy and should be treated as such, even if its political and legal
institutions remain those of a developing nation, to prevent it from
exploiting its status to gain special privileges.
Use a target, not a blanket. There should be actions against Chinese firms
that are known to have engaged in unfair trade practices such as intellectual
property theft. Rather than blanket tariffs or non-tariff barriers aimed
at entire Chinese industry sectors, firms that act in bad faith should be
targeted individually. This policy was employed to good effect early in the
Trump Administration but was abandoned in favor of a less effective blanket
tariff policy.

Rejoining this alliance should be a top priority in the next conservative
Administration’s China policy. Accession negotiations are likely to be
difficult, given that the CPATPP suspended several clauses that were
important to the United States (such as provisions relating to patents and
aspects of investor-state dispute resolution) when the U.S. pulled out of the
TPP agreement in 2017.

Diplomatic and economic pressure against Beijing will be more effective
when its largest trading partners work in concert. Beijing’s diplomats will
have a hard time employing a divide-and-conquer policy against a united
front of the sort that the TPP offers.

Refocus the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity
on trade. President Biden began the process to create IPEF in 2022,
but any agreement will likely still be under negotiation when the next
Administration takes office. IPEF is similar to the TPP, but its member
