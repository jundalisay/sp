Throughout its history, various SBA programs and practices have generated negative news headlines and scathing Government Accountability Office (GAO) and Inspector General (IG) reports that have centered on mismanagement, lack of competent personnel and/or systems, and waste, fraud and abuse.22

From the 8a program23 to Hurricane Katrina24 to the more current COVID-19 (EIDL) program and PPP lending program,25 the SBA has managed to maintain its lending role even when repeated system failures have affected its distribution of funds. Congress has been somewhat responsive, pressuring the SBA to clean up fraud-related matters within its COVID-19 lending and grant programs.26 Repub- licans in the U.S. House of Representatives have gone farther, specifying that the SBA needs to improve transparency and accountability and deal with mission creep, the expansion of unauthorized programs, and structural and reporting deficiencies that have allowed mismanagement and fraud to reoccur, largely through massive supplemental appropriations.27

The SBA is led by an Administrator (currently a member of the President’s
Cabinet) and a Deputy Administrator. Senate-confirmed appointees include the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, Chief Counsel for Advocacy, and Inspector General.

Entrepreneurs and small businesses require limited-government policies that
do not impede their risk-taking and growth. A future Administration can leverage
and strengthen core SBA functions that have been fairly effective at reining in
and calling attention to costly regulations and policies that are harmful to small
businesses. This core advocacy function is aided both by statutory authority and
by a network of small-business organizations and allies that support limited-gov-
ernment policies.28

Moreover, an effective SBA Administrator and leadership team can work and
advocate across the federal government to ensure that extreme regulatory poli-
cies—or anticompetitive rules and actions that may favor big businesses over small
businesses or international competitors over American small businesses—are
dismantled or do not progress when proposed.


### MISSION CREEP AND ENLARGEMENT

The SBA’s request to become a “designated voter agency” in response to
President Biden’s executive order on “Promoting Access to Voting.”30
The creation of duplicative channels and “pilot programs” for the delivery of
business training rather than working through existing counseling partners.
The programs are largely duplicative of private, state and local government,
and educational system offerings.31

A push to expand direct government lending.32

As noted, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have evidenced con-
cern about SBA mission creep and the need to make a sprawling, unaccountable
agency more focused and operationally sound. Moreover, there is unease that the
agency has moved from being open to any eligible small business searching for sup-
port to being hyperfocused on “disproportionately impacted,” politically favored,
or geographically situated small businesses and entrepreneurs.

Today, initiatives aimed at “inclusivity” are in fact creating exclusivity and
stringent selectivity in deciding what types of small businesses and entities can
use SBA programs. For example, even though the SBA under President Donald
Trump proposed a rule to remove all of the unconstitutional religious exclusions
from its regulations29 to conform with Supreme Court decisions that have made
their unconstitutionality clear, the SBA has not acted on the proposed rule and
still uses religious exclusions in determining eligibility for business loans. Several
other specific concerns include but are not limited to:


###  THE SBA IN A CONSERVATIVE ADMINISTRATION

Reforming and restructuring the SBA under a conservative Administration
would meet the needs of America’s small-business owners and entrepreneurs,
not special interests in Washington, D.C. Entrepreneurs believe the SBA is fairly
archaic in its operations and programming and must be transformed to serve
small businesses in the modern economy effectively.33 Therefore, a restructured
and reformed SBA would end the long-term deficiencies, practices, and problems
that have prolonged the decades-long cycle of waste, fraud, and mismanagement.
Moreover, the SBA Administrator and leadership can provide significant value to
all small businesses by strongly advocating for their policy needs and fostering an
agencywide culture that values all small-business owners and does not exclude
certain groups. Under a conservative Administration, success would yield:


A highly qualified SBA Administrator and leadership team that can
competently run the agency and enthusiastically advocate for the policy
issues and needs of small-business owners and entrepreneurs.
A tighter, more focused SBA that concentrates on congressionally
authorized programs.

An accountable SBA Administrator and staff who report regularly to
Congress, respond on a timely basis to requests from individual Members
of Congress, and satisfactorily implement or respond to IG and GAO
recommendations.

A full accounting of and an end to waste, fraud, and abuse in all COVID-19
relief programs, including the PPP and EIDL programs, and action that
follows the rule of law by ensuring that loan recipients who are not eligible
for loan forgiveness or who falsified loan applications either pay back the
funds or are referred to law enforcement.

An end to SBA direct lending.

An approach to small-business lending and capital programs that supports
a resilient small-business supply chain (for example, by financing
technological upgrades and capital expenditures).

Outreach to all small businesses and those that are eligible for program
support across sectors and geographic areas. Through congressionally
authorized programs and collaboration with partners and business
associations, the SBA could use the latest technology and platforms to implement relevant initiatives to reach small businesses. Programs would
be nonduplicative and implemented on a first-come, first-served basis.

A modern, revamped, and streamlined SBA that better utilizes current
technology and platforms for operations, for reporting, and in its programs
to reach, service, and engage small businesses.
An Office of Advocacy that is strengthened by a renewed mandate and
additional resources to protect against overregulation along with a research
agenda that includes measuring the total cost that federal regulation
imposes on small businesses.

Accountability and Managerial Practice. The SBA lacks accountability and
managerial practices to measure the effectiveness, success, and integrity of its
various programs. As a future Administration evaluates agency structure and the
particulars of how the SBA is spending appropriated funds, it should immediately
require actions and procedures to compel a culture of accountability and perfor-
mance. Specifically:

Review all internal government watchdog recommendations and
require that SBA management implement or address outstanding
and ongoing OIG and GAO recommendations within a specified
time frame (ideally within 90 days of a recommendation) and on an
ongoing basis.

Strengthening the Office of Advocacy. The SBA Office of Advocacy (Advo-
cacy) is “an independent office” within the SBA.36 It accounts for about one
one-thousandth of SBA spending and 0.75 percent of SBA personnel. Under the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, both under its current authority and with suggested


Require performance metrics and internal procedures to safeguard
taxpayer dollars and program integrity. As noted in an October 2022
IG report, failure to adopt procedures that would reliably capture data and
information for various programs, coupled with significant challenges and
weaknesses regarding IT investments, systems development, and security
controls, presents significant risks to program integrity and increased
risk of waste, fraud, and abuse.34 Addressing these shortcomings and risks
should be a priority challenge and action item for the next Administration.
As underscored by the Inspector General in his introduction to the report,
“Pandemic response has, in many instances, magnified the challenging
systemic issues in SBA’s mission-related work.”35
reforms, the Office of Advocacy could be a powerful weapon against the adminis-
trative state’s regulatory extremism.

Amend the RFA so that all agencies are required to provide a copy
of any proposed rule (other than bona fide emergency rules) along
with initial regulatory flexibility analysis to the Office of Advocacy
at least 60 days before a notice of proposed rulemaking is submitted
for publication in the Federal Register. The Office of Advocacy would
submit comments to agencies within 30 days, and each agency would have
to consider these comments, make changes in the proposed rule based
on those comments, or explain in a revised regulatory flexibility analysis
why it chose not to change the proposed rule. The Office of Advocacy’s
pre-proposing comments would be published on the agencies’ and its
own websites.

RFA economic analysis should be expanded to include indirect costs
along with direct costs. In addition, the next Administration should
require other agencies to seek Advocacy’s input. Currently, other agencies
deny Advocacy the ability to enforce their duty to consider the effect of
regulations on small entities by construing their regulations as not having
significant economic impact, which would otherwise serve as a trigger for
Advocacy’s input. Congress should presumptively exempt small businesses
from new agency rules to force agencies to seek Advocacy’s input and
permit new rules to apply to small businesses only with Advocacy signoff
under specified criteria.

Increase the Office of Advocacy’s budget by at least 50 percent ($4.6
million). This would allow Advocacy to hire approximately 25 attorneys,
economists, and scientists and enhance its role in the regulatory process.
Explicitly direct federal agencies to comply with the RFA. This would
be similar to the approach adopted by President Trump in his January and
February 2017 executive orders directing agencies to relieve the cost and
burden of regulation on business.37 Advocacy should organize regional
roundtables, onsite small-business visits, and an online platform to hear
directly from small businesses and entities as it did from June 2017 through
September 2018.38 This activity produced 26 letters to federal agencies
and highlighted specific regulations that need reform and how Congress
had addressed the most burdensome rules through the Congressional
Review Act.39
