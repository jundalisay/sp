The Economic Development Administration (EDA) is charged with investing in
local communities to encourage and enable growth and innovation in the private
sector, with particular focus on distressed or underserved areas. Over time, it has
also served as a distribution mechanism for emergency relief funds (e.g., Hurricane
Maria and COVID-19).

In the Trump Administration, the EDA served an important role for the CARES
Act. It successfully disbursed approximately $1.5 billion in funding beginning in
May 2020 and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this task revealed
EDA’s shortcomings. On a capability level, EDA lacked the technical and financial
systems and skills to disburse these funds in a compliant manner and required
external contracts for advisory support to hire the personnel needed to accom-
plish its goals.

Historically, EDA was a small bureau with an annual budget for $350 million
in Public Works grants annually. EDA’s decision-making is decentralized to its
six regional offices, which delayed the release of CARES Act funding by months.
But more broadly, EDA is an impediment to coordinated campaigns that advance



Administration priorities. Rather than implementing the new Department Organi-
zation Orders required to put conservative governance in place, it would be more
efficient to abolish EDA and reallocate its funding to other overlapping federal
grant programs.

If that proves unachievable, as has historically been the case due to political
considerations in Congress, EDA would benefit from:


Leveraging of the direct hire authorities established in the Trump
Administration for special initiatives or disaster/recovery funding. Leaving
these programs to entrenched career employees with their ties to the
regional offices will do little to advance the conservative agenda.
Continuation of disaster funding with better coordinated capabilities and
decision-making in accordance with the points above (e.g., maintaining
contract vehicles for staff augmentation as needed).

Building on the initial success of Opportunity Zones, which incentivized
over $75 billion in private sector investment in distressed communities by
the end of 2020 with little up-front cost to the taxpayer.

MINORITY BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT AGENCY

The Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) is the only federal agency
solely dedicated to the growth and competitiveness of minority-owned businesses.
The Minority Business Development Act of 2021 was signed into law as part of the
Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. This legislation made MBDA a
permanent federal agency, created a Senate-confirmed Under Secretary position,
and expanded programs and outreach. The Act:
l


Authorizes the creation of regional offices and rural business centers,
increasing the number and scope of existing grant programs supporting
MBDA business centers;

Mandates grants to minority serving institutions to cultivate future
generations of minority entrepreneurs; and


Consolidation of decision-making to the Assistant Secretary’s office to
better align funding with conservative political purposes. For example,
funding initiatives in rural communities destroyed by the Biden
Administration’s attack on domestic energy production would be well
within the scope of EDA’s mission.


Establishes a Minority Business Advisory Council to advise the Under
Secretary on supporting minority-owned businesses.
MBDA was established in 1969 by President Richard Nixon under Executive
Order 114584 as the Office of Minority Business Enterprise and the Advisory
Council for Minority Business Enterprise. Its purpose was to strengthen and
preserve minority business enterprises (MBEs) and to coordinate among
MBEs and other groups such as state and local governments and trade asso-
ciations. For over 50 years, the MBDA operated under executive order without
clear congressional authorization, but was regularly recognized and promoted
by every subsequent president, including Presidents Ronald Reagan and
Donald Trump.5

MBDA has the appearance, on its face, of perpetuating racial bias by focusing
on minority advancement rather than economic need or other criteria. This is
why the Trump Administration proposed eliminating funding for the agency in
2017. Many conservatives ask why the government is funding this activity, which
often amounts to business and management consulting services offered by private
sector entities. Eventually, the Trump Administration changed course and pro-
posed that MBDA continue to exist as a permanently authorized entity focused
on policy rather than offering services. Despite this change, many conservatives
understandably see MBDA as problematic on a philosophical level.

Nonetheless, Congress has spoken recently on this issue and is unlikely to
change its position in the near term. In 2017, MBEs represented one-third of all
U.S.-owned businesses, with almost 9 million employees, generating $1.7 trillion
for the U.S. economy.6 As such, a conservative Administration is best served by
approaching MBDA as a tool to be leveraged in the fight to deliver economic oppor-
tunity to all Americans and to produce an economy centered on equal opportunity,
free markets, innovation, and growth.

Conservative leadership at MBDA should focus the organization on:


Conducting policy analysis on the benefit of free markets, the evils
of socialism and Communism, and the destructive effect of taxes and
regulations on minority businesses;
Ensuring MBDA business centers operate efficiently with strict oversight of
funding, clear metrics for success, and consequences for poor performance;
Creating policy-level operational priorities geared toward private sector
action over government action with public–private partnerships serving as a
necessary middle ground;


Establishing MBDA as a data and research clearinghouse for minority
business enterprises and policymakers;
Coordinating amongst Cabinet agencies, state and local government, and
trade associations to best leverage resources and encourage growth and
innovation; and
Evaluating the harmful effects of unfair trade practices on minority-owned
businesses and their employees.

U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE


Support like-minded countries as candidates for leadership in the World
Intellectual Property Organization and build strong relationships with
international partners to strengthen intellectual property rights.
Re-examine patent eligibility requirements in Section 101 of the Patent Act7
and support internal and/or legislative reforms to enable U.S. leadership
in critical and emerging technologies such as quantum computing, 5G, and
artificial intelligence.

Take a balanced approach to the Patent Trial and Appeal Board and
prioritize rapid and transparent processing of applications and appeals.
Work with Administration partners and Congress to find and punish
trademark infringers and counterfeiters.
Oppose efforts to provide intellectual property waivers for cutting-edge
technologies, including for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, through
the World Trade Organization’s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual
Property Rights agreement or any other mechanism.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office carries out a core constitutional man-
date from Section 8, Article 1: “The Congress shall have Power...[t]o promote the
Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors
and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discover-
ies.” Strong intellectual property (IP) protections form the bedrock of American
business and are a key factor in making the U.S. economy the most innovative
in the world. As such, a conservative Administration must constantly work to
strengthen IP rights and combat the incorrect view that strong IP rights some-
how limit innovation.

Political leadership in a new conservative Administration should:

NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY

The National Institute of Standards and Technology is charged with promoting
U.S. innovation and competitiveness by “advancing measurement science, standards,
and technology.”8 NIST carries out cutting edge research, helps industry establish
standards and best practices, and is the nation’s foremost authority on measurements.
NIST’s atomic clock, for instance, maintains the official time of the United States.
An incoming Administration should evaluate the federal government’s civilian
research footprint and consolidate those functions while ensuring that any research
conducted with taxpayer dollars serves the national interest in a concrete way in
line with conservative principles. Beyond this, an incoming Administration should:


Privatize the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership. The
Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) establishes and
manages a network of centers focused on advising small- and medium-sized
manufacturers in order to improve processes and thereby strengthen the
U.S. industrial base. When Congress created the program, MEP centers were
intended to transition to self-sustaining private institutions after using
government funds to begin operations, but the prohibition on long-term
funding was abolished in 1998. MEP’s business advisory services would be
more properly carried out by the private sector. The next Administration
should propose legislation to zero out this $150 million program and fully
privatize existing MEP centers.

Transfer the Baldridge Performance Excellence Program. This
program’s “process” assists companies in improving management and
operations, a function more properly and effectively carried out by the
private sector. This program operates at a cost to taxpayers, despite
thousands of dollars in fees charged to each participating company or entity
and long-term plans to make the program self-sufficient. Maintenance and
operation of the program should be entirely handed over to the Baldridge
Award Foundation to be run by non-government staff via fees.
Increase value to taxpayers. NIST should reinvigorate the Technology
Transfer and ROI (return on investment) initiatives begun under the Trump
Administration. These initiatives help speed the process of commercializing
science funded by the federal government.

Reestablish U.S. dominance in international standards. NIST should
explore ways to incentivize broader U.S. participation in standards-setting
bodies and the exclusion of participants from adversaries like China. Standards
are set to facilitate trade in countries that utilize those standards: Countries
— 686 —Department of Commerce
that do not allow open access to their markets should not be setting the
standards for markets that do allow open access. The incoming Administration
should consider increased government-sponsored participation by private
companies and government employees with relevant expertise.

NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND INFORMATION SERVICE

The independent National Telecommunications and Information Service
(NTIS) is charged with ensuring that federally funded research and data are
accessible to the public. NTIS operates through user fees but is largely obsolete
due to modern usage of the internet by federal agencies and researchers. NTIS’s
functions should be moved to NIST and consolidated with the Tech Transfer and
ROI initiatives.

NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND
INFORMATION ADMINISTRATION


Support free speech and hold big tech accountable. Immediately
conduct a thorough review of federal policy regarding free speech online
and provide policy solutions to address big tech’s censorship of speech.
Utilize new tools to eliminate threats to national security. Fully
implement the Trump Administration’s Information and Communications
Technology and Services (ICTS) Executive Order authorities in a way
that ensures long-term success and the legal viability of this new national
security tool.9
Expand utilization of federal spectrum. Begin short term, temporary
leasing of government allocated spectrum to ensure optimum utilization
while preserving federal agency use rights.
Support the commercial space industry. Advocate for licensing decisions
at the Federal Communications Commission that continue to enable U.S.
dominance in the commercial space industry.


The National Telecommunications and Information Agency (NTIA) is the exec-
utive branch’s statutory lead on telecommunications and information policy. It
focuses on broadband access, spectrum utilization, and other issues that are crucial
to the high-tech economy. For decades, NTIA has suffered from organizational
malaise and will require strong and energetic leadership by political appointees
to implement conservative policies. The next Administration will face the primary
challenge of rapidly deploying 5G without compromising other priorities. Further
recommendations include:


Defend U.S. interests in international bodies. Strong representation at
the International Telecommunication Union should protect the interests
of both private and government users of spectrum. The U.S. has differing
needs from many other countries, for instance, because of U.S. government
satellites and commercial space industry. NTIA should work with the U.S.
delegation to ensure maximum adoption of the U.S. position.
Set fresh priorities in broadband grant programs. Reevaluate
broadband grant programs and, when possible, establish Administration
priorities in how each grant is structured. First and foremost, widespread
deployment of infrastructure is needed for 5G adoption in rural and exurban
areas, which will be a key factor in future economic competitiveness for
these under-served communities.
Review FirstNet. Evaluate the performance and long-term value
proposition of FirstNet in view of modern technologies that will render
it obsolete.

CONCLUSION
The above policies, strategies, and tactics will set a new Administration on
firm footing that allows the Department of Commerce to assist the President in
implementing a bold agenda that delivers economic prosperity and strong national
security to the American people. While many of the department’s functions fall
outside the remit of the federal government, its unique authorities in diverse areas
provide critical tools that can and should be brought to bear in implementing a
conservative governing philosophy that keeps Americans safe and provides oppor-
tunity for all.
