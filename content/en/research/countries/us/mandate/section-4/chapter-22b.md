Tax policy has a powerful impact on the economy. The Treasury Department
should develop and promote tax reform legislation that will promote prosperity.
To accomplish this, tax reform should improve incentives to work, save, and invest.
This, in turn, is accomplished primarily by reducing marginal tax rates,13 reducing
the cost of capital14 and broadening the tax base to eliminate tax-induced economic
distortions by eliminating special-interest tax credits, deductions, and exclusions.
Tax compliance costs will decline precipitously if the tax system is substantially
simplified.15 The Treasury Department should also promote tax competition rather
than supporting an international tax cartel.

Principles of Good Tax Policy. These are the principles governing
good tax policy.

First, the tax system should raise the revenue necessary to fund a limited
government for constitutionally appropriate activities. It should raise this
revenue such that it: (a) applies the least economically destructive forms of


The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau collects federal excise taxes
on alcohol, tobacco, firearms, and ammunition, and is responsible for enforcing
and administering laws covering the production, use, and distribution of alco-
hol products.

The Internal Revenue Service is the largest of the department’s bureaus, account-
ing for about 85 percent of Treasury’s personnel and about four-fifths of its
appropriated budget. It administers and enforces U.S. tax laws.
The Bureau of Engraving and Printing develops and produces U.S. currency notes.
The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is designed to protect
the financial system from illicit use. It also administers the beneficial ownership
reporting regime mandated by the Corporate Transparency Act.12
The Bureau of the Fiscal Service provides central payment services to federal
program agencies, operates the U.S. government’s collections and deposit systems,
provides government-wide accounting and reporting services, manages the collec-
tion of delinquent debt owed to the U.S. government, borrows the money needed to
operate the government through the sale of U.S. Treasury securities (including the
state and local government series), and accounts for and services the public debt.
The United States Mint designs and mints U.S. circulating and bullion coins.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) charters, regulates, and
supervises national banks and federal savings associations (thrifts) to ensure that
they operate in a safe and sound manner, provide fair access to financial services,
and comply with applicable laws and regulations. The OCC also supervises fed-
eral branches and agencies of foreign banks and has rulemaking authority for all
savings associations.

taxation;16 (b) has low tax rates on a broad, neutral tax base; (c) minimizes
interference with the operation of the free market and free enterprise; and
(d) minimizes the cost to taxpayers of compliance with and administration
of the tax system.


Second, the tax system should minimize its adverse impact on the family
and the core institutions of civil society.
Third, the tax system should be applied consistently—with special privileges
for none—and respect taxpayer due process and privacy rights.
The current tax system is inconsistent with these principles and needs to be
reformed to promote prosperity, reduce compliance costs, and improve fairness.
The incoming Administration should promote immediate intermediate reforms
to the existing system. It should then pursue fundamental tax reform.

Intermediate Tax Reform. The Treasury should work with Congress to sim-
plify the tax code by enacting a simple two-rate individual tax system of 15 percent
and 30 percent that eliminates most deductions, credits and exclusions. The 30
percent bracket should begin at or near the Social Security wage base to ensure
the combined income and payroll tax structure acts as a nearly flat tax on wage
income beyond the standard deduction. The corporate income tax rate should
be reduced to 18 percent. The corporate income tax is the most damaging tax in
the U.S. tax system, and its primary economic burden falls on workers because
capital is more mobile than labor.17 Capital gains and qualified dividends should
be taxed at 15 percent. Thus, the combined corporate income tax combined with
the capital gains or qualified dividends tax rate would be roughly equal to the top
individual income tax rate.18 The system should allow immediate expensing for
capital expenditures and index capital gains taxes for inflation.

In addition, intermediate tax reform should repeal all tax increases that were
passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act,19 including the book minimum tax,
the stock buyback excise tax, the coal excise tax, the reinstated Superfund tax, and
excise taxes on drug manufacturers to compel them to comply with Medicare price
controls. The next Administration should also push for legislation to fully repeal
recently passed subsidies in the tax code, including the dozens of credits and tax
breaks for green energy companies in Subtitle D of the Inflation Reduction Act.20
Universal Savings Accounts. All taxpayers should be allowed to contribute
up to $15,000 (adjusted for inflation) of post-tax earnings into Universal Savings
Accounts (USAs). The tax treatment of these accounts would be comparable to
Roth IRAs. USAs should be highly flexible to allow Americans to save and invest as
they see fit, including, for example, investments in a closely held business. Gains
from investments in USAs would be non-taxable and could be withdrawn at any time for any purpose. This would allow the vast majority of American families to
save and invest without facing a punitive double layer of taxation.
Entrepreneurship. To encourage entrepreneurship, the business loss limita-
tion should be increased to at least $500,000. Businesses should also be allowed to
fully carry forward net operating losses. Extra layers of taxes on investment and
capital should also be eliminated or reduced. The net investment income surtax
and the base erosion anti-abuse tax should be eliminated. The estate and gift tax
should be reduced to no higher than 20 percent, and the 2017 tax bill’s temporary
increase in the exemption amount from $5.5 million to $12.9 million (adjusted
for inflation) should be made permanent.21 The tax on global intangible low-taxed
income should be reduced to no higher than 12.5 percent, with the 20 percent
haircut on related foreign tax credits reduced or eliminated.22

All non-business tax deductions and exemptions that were temporarily sus-
pended by the 2017 tax bill should be permanently repealed, including the bicycle
commuting expense exclusion, non-military moving expense deductions, and the
miscellaneous itemized deductions.23 The individual state and local tax deduction,
which was temporarily capped at $10,000, should be fully repealed. Deductions
related to educational expenses should be repealed. Special business tax pref-
erences, such as a special deduction for energy-efficient commercial building
properties, should be eliminated.24

Wages vs. Benefits. The current tax code has a strong bias that incentivizes
businesses to offer employees more generous benefits and lower wages. This limits
the freedom of workers and their families to spend their compensation as they
see fit—and it can trap workers in their current jobs due to the jobs’ benefit pack-
ages. Wage income is taxed under the individual income tax and under the payroll
tax. However, most forms of non-wage benefits are wholly exempt from both of
these taxes.

To reduce this tax bias against wages (as opposed to employee benefits), the
next Administration should set a meaningful cap (no higher than $12,000 per year
per full-time equivalent employee—and preferably lower) on untaxed benefits
that employers can claim as deductions. Employee benefit expenses other than
tax-deferred retirement account contributions should count toward the limita-
tion, whether offered to specific employees or whether the costs relate to a shared
benefit like building gym facilities for employees.25 Tax-deferred retirement con-
tributions by employers should not count toward this limitation insofar as they
are fully taxable upon distribution. Only a percentage of Health Savings Accounts
(HSA) contributions (which are not taxed upon withdrawal) should count toward
the limitation.26 The limitation on benefit deductions should not be indexed to
increase with inflation.27 Employers should also be denied deductions for health
insurance and other benefits provided to employee dependents if the dependents
are aged 23 or older.

Fundamental Tax Reform. Achieving fundamental tax reform offers the
prospect of a dramatic improvement in American living standards and an equally
dramatic reduction in tax compliance costs. Lobbyists, lawyers, benefit consul-
tants, accountants, and tax preparers would see their incomes decline, however.
The federal income tax system heavily taxes capital and corporate income and
discourages work, savings, and investment.

The public finance literature is clear that a consumption tax would minimize
government’s distortion of private economic decisions and thus be the least eco-
nomically harmful way to raise federal tax revenues.28 There are several forms that
a consumption tax could take, including a national sales tax, a business transfer
tax, a Hall–Rabushka flat tax,29 or a cash flow tax.30

Supermajority to Raise Taxes. Treasury should support legislation instituting
a three-fifths vote threshold in the U.S. House and the Senate to raise income or
corporate tax rates to create a wall of protection for the new rate structure. Many
states have implemented such a supermajority vote requirement.

Tax Competition. Tax competition between states and countries is a positive
force for liberty and limited government.31 The Biden Administration, under the
direction of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, has pushed for a global minimum
corporate tax that would increase taxation and the size of government in the U.S.
and around the world. This attempt to “harmonize” global tax rates is an attempt
to create a global tax cartel to quash tax competition and to increase the tax burden
globally. The U.S. should not outsource its tax policy to international organizations.
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), in conjunction with
the European Union, has long tried to end financial privacy and impose regulations
on countries with low (or no) income taxes. In fact, on tax, environmental, corpo-
rate governance and employment issues, the OECD has become little more than
a taxpayer-funded left-wing think tank and lobbying organization.32 The United
States provides about one-fifth of OECD’s funding.33 The U.S. should end its finan-
cial support and withdraw from the OECD.

TAX ADMINISTRATION

The Internal Revenue Service is a poorly managed, utterly unresponsive and
increasingly politicized agency, and has been for at least two decades. It is time for
meaningful reform to improve the efficiency and fairness of tax administration,
better protect taxpayer rights, and achieve greater transparency and accountability.
A substantial number of the problems attributed to the IRS are actually a function
of congressional action that has made the Internal Revenue Code ridiculously
complex, imposed tremendous administrative burdens on both the public and the
IRS, and given massive non-tax missions to the IRS. But the culture, administrative
practices, and management at the IRS need to change.


Doubling the IRS? The Inflation Reduction Act contains a radical $80 billion
expansion of the IRS—enough to double the size of its workforce.34 Unless Congress
reverses this policy, the IRS will become much more intrusive and impose still
greater costs on the American people.

The Biden Administration has also sought to make the tax system’s adminis-
trative burden much worse in other ways. For example, it has proposed creating a
comprehensive financial account information reporting regime that would apply to
all business and personal accounts with more than $600. Banks would be required
to collect the taxpayer identification numbers of and file a revised Form 1099-K
for all affected payees, as well as provide additional information.35 This massive
increase in the scope and breadth of information reporting should be unequivo-
cally opposed.

Management. The IRS has approximately 81,000 employees.36 Of those, only
two are presidential appointments—the Commissioner and the Chief Counsel.37
As a practical matter, it is impossible for these two officials to overcome bureau-
cratic inertia and to implement policy changes that the IRS bureaucracy wants to
impede. That is why, notwithstanding decades of sound and fury, almost nothing
has changed at the IRS.

For the IRS to change and become more accountable, more transparent, and
better managed, there is a need to increase the number of Presidential appoint-
ments subject to Senate confirmation, and not subject to Senate confirmation, at
the IRS. At the very least, Congress should ensure that the Deputy Commissioner
for Services and Enforcement, the Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support,
the National Taxpayer Advocate, the Commissioner of the Wage and Investment
Division, the Commissioner of the Large Business and International Division,
the Commissioner of the Small Business Self-Employed Division, and the Com-
missioner of the Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division are presidential
appointees.38

Information Technology. Despite the investment of billions of dollars for at
least two decades, IRS information technology (IT) systems remain deficient.39
The IRS inadequately protects taxpayer information, its IT systems do not ade-
quately support operations or taxpayer services, and its matching and detection
algorithms are antiquated.

These problems are not primarily about resources. The IRS has spent approxi-
mately $27 billion on IT during the past decade, with $7 billion of that designated
as “development, modernization and enhancement.“40 The problem is one of man-
agement. The bureaucracy is not up to the task, and neither Congress nor a long
line of IRS commissioners has forced changes.

A Deputy Commissioner for Operations Support with strong IT management
skills should be appointed by the IRS Commissioner or the President (once the
position is made a presidential appointment). The various subordinates to the
Deputy Commissioner should be replaced. A thorough review of IT contracts
should be conducted. The Integrated Modernization Business Plan41 should be
systematically reviewed and a version of it cost-effectively implemented. An over-
sight board composed of private sector IT experts should be established and given
the authority to conduct meaningful, contemporaneous oversight.
