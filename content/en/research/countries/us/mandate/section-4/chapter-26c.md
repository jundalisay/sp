Our country has been behaving like an extraordinarily rich family that
possesses an immense farm. In order to consume 4% more than we produce—
that’s the trade deficit—we have, day by day, been both selling pieces of the
farm and increasing the mortgage on what we still own.
Warren Buffett37

Historically, one line of attack against attempts to implement fair trade policies
in the name of reducing America’s massive and chronic trade deficit has been the
claim that “trade deficits don’t matter.” The intellectual tip of this spear has often
been think tanks that generate reams of analyses in support of a purely free trade
(and open borders) American posture.38 Yet both common sense and several very
good reasons tell us that trade deficits matter a great deal.

Economic Security. The economic security argument that trade deficits matter
begins with the observation that growth in any country’s real, inflation-adjusted
gross domestic product (GDP) depends on only four factors: consumption, gov-
ernment spending, business investment, and net exports (the difference between
exports and imports). Reducing a trade deficit through implementation of the U.S.
Reciprocal Trade Act, the application of tariffs, or renegotiating a bad trade deal
like NAFTA all represent ways to increase net exports—and thereby boost the rate
of economic growth.

Suppose, for example, that under the USRTA the American President persuaded
India to reduce its very high protectionist tariffs and Japan to lower its formidable
nontariff barriers. America would surely sell more Florida oranges, Washington
apples, California wine, Wisconsin cheese, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The
resultant fall in the trade deficit would increase America’s GDP, and the real wages
of blue-collar America would rise from Seattle and Orlando to Sonoma and Mil-
waukee. But that’s not all.

Consider, too, the investment term in the GDP growth equation. When U.S.
companies offshore their production to chase cheap labor or manufacture in a
“pollution haven” country like Communist China or India with lax environmental
regulations, the result is reduced nonresidential fixed investment—and a GDP
growth rate that is lower than it would be otherwise. Moreover, if such offshored
production results in more foreign exports to the U.S.—for example, an American
consumer buys a Made in Mexico Dodge Journey or Chevrolet Trax rather than a
vehicle assembled in Detroit—the trade deficit rises along with the fall in invest-
ment, further reducing GDP growth.
National Security. The national security argument that trade deficits matter
begins with America’s national-income accounting double-entry system and this
accounting identity: Any deficit in the current account caused by imbalanced
trade must be offset by a surplus in the capital account, meaning foreign invest-
ment in the U.S.

In the short term, this balance-of-payments equilibrium may indeed “not
matter” as foreigners return our trade-deficit dollars to American shores by
seemingly benignly investing in U.S. government bonds and stocks. Of course,
this infusion of foreign capital lowers American mortgage rates and keeps the
stock market bullishly capitalized, which appears to be all to the good. Over time,
however, running large and persistent trade deficits leads to a massive transfer
of American wealth offshore into foreign hands. This wealth transfer happens as
foreigners use their export dollars to buy American real estate, companies, and
financial assets like the aforementioned stocks and government bonds.
The American investor Warren Buffett has referred to such wealth transfers
offshore as “conquest by purchase.” To Buffett, the big danger is that foreigners
will eventually own so many U.S. government bonds that Americans will wind up
working longer hours just to survive and service that foreign debt.
There is an even bigger national security danger, however, that Mr. Buffett has
missed: an alternative conquest-by-purchase scenario. Suppose, for example, that
one of the biggest holders of U.S. dollars is a rapidly militarizing strategic rival like
Communist China that is intent on world hegemony. By buying up America’s com-
panies, technologies, farmland, food producers, and key elements of the domestic
supply chain, Communist China can thereby gain more and more control of the
U.S. manufacturing and defense-industrial base.

In this scenario, might America thereby lose a broader war for America’s freedom
and prosperity, not by shots fired but by American cash registers ringing up “Made
in China” products? Might America even lose a broader hot war because it sent its
defense industrial base abroad on the wings of a persistent trade deficit? It follows
that for both economic and national security reasons, trade deficits do indeed matter.
It is therefore of critical importance that we bring America’s global trade back into
balance through free, fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade and that we do so through
the kind of policy initiatives and reforms recommended in this chapter.

PERSONNEL IS TRADE POLICY

Having a clear set of trade and industrial policies to achieve one’s economic and
national security goals, while essential, is not enough. The lessons of the Nixon,
Reagan, and Trump Administrations teach us that “personnel is policy” or, in
this case, that “bad personnel will mean bad trade policy.”39 That is why it will be
equally critical to the next President’s trade policy agenda to have key personnel
in place who not only have the skills to implement the policies, but also have the
firm commitment to do so.

During the Trump Administration, President Trump’s key policy advisers
and Cabinet officials clashed on the issues of international trade and combating
Communist China’s economic aggression. As much as President Trump did on
the trade front that was bold and innovative and as much as he achieved by chal-
lenging Communist China, too much of his trade policy was disrupted or derailed
by key personnel who did not share the President’s vision of fair, balanced, and
reciprocal trade.

In thinking about the personnel positions that are most essential to effective
implementation of trade policy, the most obvious position to get exactly right is
that of the United States Trade Representative. The USTR is at least putatively
the top official on trade policy, and it is critical that this position be filled wisely.
Historically, during Republican Administrations, the USTR has been a free
trader who rarely challenged the protectionist and mercantilist policies of Amer-
ica’s trading partners and typically would seek to expand global trade. The Trump
Administration broke this globalist Republican tradition by appointing as USTR
attorney Robert E. Lighthizer, who not only had a keen understanding of the vari-
ous legal levers a President can use to advance trade policy, but also was committed
to the President’s fair, balanced, and reciprocal trade agenda. The next Adminis-
tration should make every effort to find someone with that understanding and that
commitment to fill this position.
Less obvious—but almost as important—is the need to fill the position of Under
Secretary of Commerce for International Trade wisely. One of the most important
functions of the International Trade Administration, which is an agency in the
Department of Commerce, is to impose antidumping and countervailing duties


CONCLUSION

A Harvard professor once told me during my doctoral thesis days that “if I tell
you how it is, I’ve told you why it can’t change.” Despite the obvious exploitation
of American farmers, ranchers, manufacturers, and workers by the international
trading system and Communist Chinese aggression, powerful political forces none-
theless exist that profit from the status quo.
The stark lesson of this chapter is that America gets fleeced every day in the
global marketplace both by a predatory Communist China and by an institution-
ally unfair and nonreciprocal WTO. Addressing these two challenges would go a
long way toward restoring American greatness, both economically and militarily.
Ignoring these two challenges will simply continue the parasitic draining of the
American manufacturing and defense industrial base.

against trade cheaters who dump products below cost into American markets or
unfairly subsidize their exports. In fact, much of the cheating that does take place
in the global trading arena can be addressed through such antidumping (AD) and
countervailing duty (CVD) cases.

Within the West Wing itself, it is equally critical that the National Security
Adviser, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), and the Director
of the National Economic Council (NEC) all be aligned on trade policy. During the
Trump Administration, with the notable exception of the President’s third National
Security Adviser, Robert O’Brien, and third CEA Chairman, Tyler Goodspeed, this
regrettably was not the case.


Finally, and perhaps surprisingly, the Secretary of Defense plays a key role in
trade policy, at least when it comes to advancing Section 232 cases. Under Section
232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,40 the President has the authority, through
tariffs or other means, to reduce imports from other countries “if the President
determines that such reduction or elimination would threaten to impair the
national security.” As a practical matter, the Secretary of Commerce spearheads
any Section 232 cases, but in order to proceed with a Section 232 case, Commerce
must obtain signoff from the Secretary of Defense.

When President Trump wanted to implement steel and aluminum tariffs, he
had a willing servant in Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. However, Secretary
of Defense James Mattis resisted. Mattis simply did not understand a key tenet of
the Trump Administration: Economic security is also national security. Without
vibrant steel and aluminum industries, it will be difficult for America to provide
the Pentagon with the kind of weapons it needs to defend the homeland.
