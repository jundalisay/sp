Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The interagency
Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States should realign its priorities
to meet the United States’ current foreign policy threats, especially from China.
On October 20, 2022, the Treasury Department, which chairs CFIUS, adopted
the first-ever CFIUS Enforcement and Penalty Guidelines50 on the committee’s
national security risk mitigation requirements. However, there are no clear rules
that guide CFIUS on mitigation monitoring, nor is there a published penalty sched-
ule to standardize accountability when CFIUS pursues a civil money penalty for
violators. In addition, Treasury—as chair of the committee—runs an opaque pro-
cess that biases committee procedure toward corporate interests and away from
national security interests. Finally, the committee’s jurisdiction does not extend
over greenfield investments that Chinese state-owned enterprises have historically
pursued in the United States, which leaves America vulnerable to an instrument
of Chinese economic statecraft.

Given these issues, the next steps for CFIUS should be to develop a more
coherent—and transparent—mitigation monitoring program to complement the
enforcement guidelines, give CFIUS agencies in charge of national security con-
cerns an equal voice at the table, and petition Congress to amend the law to cover
Chinese greenfield investments.

CFIUS should publish a penalty schedule for violations of CFIUS reporting and
mitigation requirements. Publishing a penalty schedule for CFIUS violations will
reduce the discretion of the committee to waive penalties or impose mere “wrist
slap” costs on violators of the law. Additionally, a standardized penalty schedule
would likely increase the deterrence of CFIUS enforcement by reducing the per-
ception among parties to covered transactions that they can avoid enforcement
by the committee or secure special exceptions based on appeals to the commit-
tee’s discretion.

As a legal matter—and in application by CFIUS—mitigation monitoring has
developed as the Wild West. There are no clear rules that guide the entire com-
mittee on mitigation monitoring, nor is there the same level of oversight or
accountability within and among the agencies as applies when CFIUS reviews
a transaction or when it pursues a civil money penalty. Indeed, it is a credit to
transaction parties and the professionalism of the governmental officials and con-
tractors who conduct mitigation monitoring on behalf of the government that, by
and large, mitigation monitoring has worked adequately during the last several
decades. But dependency on the personality and capabilities of individuals creates
unnecessary risk both for CFIUS and for transaction parties.﻿

Congress should make the Department of Defense (DOD) a CFIUS co-chair
with the Department of Treasury. Making DOD an official CFIUS co-chair along
with Treasury will establish a balanced committee process by elevating national
security interests to an equal stature. The committee is currently imbalanced
toward the interests of corporate America because Treasury is the sole chair of
CFIUS and, in practice, runs a process that is not fully transparent and which biases
it from the national security interests represented by DOD and the Intelligence
Community (IC).

For example, Treasury representatives will consult with the Commerce Depart-
ment and the United States Trade Representative—which tend to favor permitting
covered transactions to occur with little to no mitigation requirements—and these
representatives will then obscure the results and purposes of such sidebar meet-
ings from DOD and IC representatives. This hampers DOD, IC, and sometimes
even State Department representatives from full participation in the process or
from advocating national security interests as well as they should.
Greenfield Investments. Congress should close the loophole on greenfield
investments and require CFIUS review of investments in U.S.-based greenfield
assets by Chinese-controlled entities to assess any potential harm to U.S. national
and economic security. In the 2018 Foreign Risk and Review Modernization Act
(FIRRMA),51 one important category of foreign transactions left out of the bill was
greenfield investments, particularly by Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
Greenfield investments by Chinese SOEs pose a unique threat, and they should be
met with the highest scrutiny by all levels of government.

Greenfield investments result in the control of newly built facilities in the U.S.,
and they were not addressed in FIRRMA primarily because governors and state
governments embrace them. That is understandable; they typically bring the
promise of creating American jobs. However, the goal of such Chinese SOEs is to
siphon assets, technological innovation, and influence away from U.S. businesses
in order to expand the global presence of the Chinese Communist Party. While the
Chinese government keeps its domestic markets largely insulated from foreign
influence, it regularly invests in the U.S. and other countries under the “green-
field” model. Firms fully owned by China’s Communist regime are increasingly
buying land, building factories, and taking advantage of state and local tax breaks
on American soil.

Treasury should examine creating a school of financial warfare jointly with
DOD. If the U.S. is to rely on financial weapons, tools, and strategies to prosecute
international defensive and offensive objectives, it must create a specially trained
group of experts dedicated to the study, training, testing, and preparedness of these
deterrents. Recent experience has demonstrated that the U.S. cannot depend on
the rapid development and deployment of untested, academically developed finan-
cial actions, stratagems, and weapons on an ad hoc basis.

Treasury must also seriously evaluate U.S. foreign direct investment in China.
Particular focus should be paid to investments in CCP or other state-owned enter-
prises, investments that result in technology transfers from the U.S. to China,
investments that enhance China’s military capacity, and investments that pose
risks to critical U.S. supply chains by sourcing critical components or feedstocks
in China. An enhanced reporting system is warranted, and greater legal authority
and restrictions are appropriate.
