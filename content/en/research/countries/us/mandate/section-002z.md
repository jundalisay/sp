The Bank should be abolished.

BACKGROUND

The Export–Import Bank was created in 1934 as an export credit agency (ECA) to finance trade with the Soviet Union. It was reorganized as an independent gov- ernment agency in 1945. President Franklin Roosevelt’s Executive Order 6581 gave it “the power to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports and the exchange of commodities between the United States and other Nations or the agencies and nationals thereof” to create jobs in the United States.2 EXIM has four main tools with which to pursue these goals: loan guarantees, working capital guarantees, direct loans, and export-credit insurance. Importantly, for four years starting at the end of 2015, the Bank became incapacitated. Lacking a quorum for its board of directors, it could not extend financing that exceeded $10 million per project. That put an end to about 85 percent of the Bank’s financing obligations. As the numbers below show, the Bank hasn’t yet recovered from that long interruption.


Total Bank authorizations in recent years have gone from $12.6 billion in fiscal
year (FY) 20073 to $21.5 billion in FY 20144 to $5.2 billion in FY 2022.5 A better
way to understand these numbers is to look at the amount of financial exposure
the Bank has—that is, the risk the Bank takes for which taxpayers are ultimately
responsible. During this same period, the Bank’s total exposure increased from
$57.42 billion in FY 20076 to $112.1 billion in FY 20147 and then fell to $41.3 billion
in FY 20218 and $35.4 billion in FY 2022.9

CLAIMS VS. THE FACTS

Supporters of EXIM make many claims about the benefits that our nation and
citizens derive from having an Export Credit Agency. These claims, however, are
not supported by the facts.
The Bank is an example of government-granted privilege. Traditionally,
one of EXIM’s top 10 domestic beneficiaries is Boeing, which at a 40 percent share
of total loan authorizations dwarfs the 25 percent share for all small businesses that
received EXIM’s services combined.10 On the foreign side, things are not much dif-
ferent: The subsidized financing largely benefits very large companies like Mexico’s
Pemex, Ireland’s Ryanair, and Emirates Airlines that either collect massive subsi-
dies as state-controlled entities or could easily access private financing.11 American
businesses that lack political connections are put at a competitive disadvantage by
their own government because they are forced to compete against both domestic
and foreign businesses that enjoy access to subsidized loans.12


The Bank does not maintain or create jobs. EXIM’s supporters point to the
numbers of new jobs that they claim have been created through federal spending, but the unseen effects are ignored. For example, funding for one industry or firm
might take more jobs away from other industries and firms, resulting in a net job
loss even though jobs are created for the financed firm. At best, it could be said that
the Bank redistributes employment from unsubsidized firms to subsidized firms.
However, with very rare exceptions, most exports financed by EXIM would
have taken place without government support. Many companies have said so
themselves;13 the procurement happens before the decision to get government
support; and, as noted above, most EXIM deals go to large companies with easy
access to capital. Thus, the agency is taking credit for jobs that would have existed
in any event.

The Bank does not promote exports. EXIM presidents commonly claim
that the agency’s mission is to support U.S. jobs by facilitating American exports
through its export-financing tools. However, trade economists have long known
that export credit subsidies merely redistribute exporting opportunities to subsi-
dized firms instead of increasing the net number of exports—something that also
slows economic growth.14

Even more telling is the performance of the U.S. economy and American exports
during the four years when EXIM lacked a board quorum (2015–2019) and was
barred from finalizing deals in excess of $10 million. During that time, EXIM autho-
rizations fell from $21 billion in FY 2014 to $3.6 billion in FY 2018 (adjusted for
inflation).15 However, also during that time, regular big-ticket EXIM beneficiaries
continued to benefit from their easy access to capital markets and still had the
ability to finance their export activities.

Further, U.S. exports were utterly unaffected by the reductions in the Bank’s
activities.16 U.S. unemployment fell to a level not seen in half a century, but exports
soared with financing provided by commercial lenders. The only negative eco-
nomic impact from EXIM’s lack of a board quorum was its effect on the Bank
itself. This contradicts EXIM’s claim that its activities are crucial for the success
of U.S. exporters and economic growth. Instead, it shows that economic growth
is the best booster of U.S. exports and job creation and that it does not depend on
EXIM subsidies.

Subsidy-boosted exports do not boost economic growth. EXIM’s primary
reason for existing is to increase exports, as if more exports themselves represent
more jobs and economic growth. Recent expressions of this fallacious belief can be
found in a book by former EXIM President Fred Hochberg. According to Hochberg,
“We know that trade, and exports in particular, can have a big impact on jobs.”17
While this is a common misconception about exports, it is one worth correcting.
As trade economists know, exports are a cost to the economy: They subtract from
GDP. Imports, on the other hand, add to GDP. If the U.S. could acquire all of the
imports that it currently gets without exporting anything in exchange, that would
be the best of all worlds. Unfortunately, one reason that foreigners are so eager﻿

to sell us their goods is that they want our dollars to buy our debt, invest in the
country, and buy our exports. That is why exports drop when overall imports drop.
Exports promote U.S. economic growth only if the value of the resources used to
produce them is less than the value of what we receive as imports in exchange for
those exports. By subsidizing American exports, EXIM causes too many resources
to be devoted to producing exports. As a result, the total value of our exports is
made larger than it would otherwise be to obtain any given amount of imports.
In other words, EXIM thus compels American taxpayers to subsidize foreigners’
standards of living at no appreciable benefit to the U.S.

Unfortunately, this misunderstanding and the constant glamorization of
exports and their impact on jobs and growth are used to justify government sup-
port for some exports (on average, 98 percent of exports are not backed by EXIM
financing). It also is extremely unfair. Because capital will tend to shift from unsub-
sidized companies to subsidized companies (taxpayers foot the bill if companies
backed by the Bank default), unsubsidized export companies face higher borrowing
costs, which could translate into fewer jobs in unsubsidized companies or lower
pay for their workers.

The Bank does not promote growth by leveling the playing field. EXIM’s
charter stipulates that one of its missions is to support U.S. exports with the goal
of creating jobs and promoting economic growth through the provision of export
financing via its loan-guarantee and insurance programs. In particular, EXIM is
to intervene in cases “where such support is necessary to level the competitive
playing field for U.S. exporters due to financing provided by foreign governments
to their exporters.”18

As a result, EXIM for years has been focused primarily on what other countries’
ECAs are doing and how much financing they are providing.19 A reading of any of
EXIM’s Competitiveness Reports shows that the Bank frames the “competitive-
ness” of the U.S. economy and exporters in extremely narrow terms—specifically,
as the amount of business that foreign ECAs are doing relative to EXIM.
The report for 2020 features striking evidence of this mindset. For instance,
lamenting the “nearly four-year hiatus” during which the Bank lacked a board
quorum to approve large deals, EXIM’s leadership maintains that these years
“severely hindered EXIM’s ability to support the competitiveness of U.S. export-
ers.” During that time, foreign ECAs “fundamentally evolved their philosophy and
substantively expanded their roles,” and “the United States must work hard to keep
pace.” The Bank goes on to promise that it will “re-emerge from the years of being
out of the long-term export finance business and restore its standing as one of the
world’s most competitive ECAs.”20

In other words, EXIM bureaucrats appear to believe that economic growth
and jobs result not from a favorable tax and regulatory environment, but from a
victory in hand-to-hand subsidy combat between government banks. The Bank’s

Competitiveness Reports include a table that ranks countries by ECA financing
volume. An adjacent map displays the most “competitive” ECAs around the world,
implying that the U.S., which ranked eighth in terms of volume in 2019 (the year
before the pandemic), is losing ground compared to more “hyperactive” (ranked
higher) ECAs.21 The implication is that ECA export financing improves the overall
health of the export market and thereby fuels economic and job growth—which
it does not do.

Germany was the second-highest ranked OECD country on this list in 2019.
While Germany had respectable economic growth at the time of the report,
only 0.7 percent of its exports were backed by ECA financing. These data
provide little support for the argument that Germany’s strong economic
performance has much, if anything, to do with the German ECA.
China by all accounts had a hyperactive ECA: It ranked first on the list in
2019. ECA-backed exports in China represented 2.1 percent of exports
backed by government financing. Whatever one perceives as China’s
economic successes, it is hard to argue that the main driver of China’s
exports is its ECA.

The report highlights the eighth-ranked U.S. for its unusually low level
of EXIM-backed exports. At the time of the report, the U.S. economy
was thriving, wages and employment were up, and the country still had
flourishing trade—but it was also striving when EXIM was mostly dormant.
In other words, one cannot argue that the bustling economy was the result
of EXIM support.

Even in countries touted as leaders in relying on ECA financing, ECA-backed
exports are never more than 4.7 percent of total exports. Moreover, even that is
an outlier. For 23 of the 28 countries on this list (including both China and the
U.S.), the share of exports backed by ECA financing is less than 2 percent. This
fact suggests that—contrary to the claims of EXIM’s advocates—ECA financing is
irrelevant to the overall health of the export market as well as to economic growth.
This is consistent with what economists know about the impact of subsidies on
economic growth.

Consider Italy’s hyperactive ECA. In 2019, Italy was ranked first among
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)
countries in terms of volume and was highlighted in the report as an example
for other countries to follow. Yet the Italian ECA’s hyperactivity appears to
have had little impact on that country’s economic growth or employment.

The Bank does not support small businesses. Most of the Bank’s funding
goes to large corporations such as Boeing—a recipient of 68 percent of EXIM’s
loan guarantees and 30 percent of EXIM’s overall activities.22 Over the years, 10
large domestic corporations have received roughly 65 percent of the Bank’s total
assistance (it is closer to 70 percent today). More than 99.9 percent of U.S. small
businesses receive no benefits from EXIM and are often placed at a competitive
disadvantage by the subsidies doled out to larger competitors. In fact, the Bank’s
support for small businesses has declined from $2.3 billion in FY 201923 to “more
than $2.0 billion” in FY 202024 to only $1.6 billion in FY 2021.25 This decline
occurred amid a pandemic that hit small businesses especially hard, and it con-
tinues today.


The Bank is not a good deal for taxpayers. The Bank’s accounting practices
are deficient, and the Bank miscalculates its budget savings. While it claims that
its operations will save taxpayers $14 billion over the next decade, the Congres-
sional Budget Office has found that EXIM programs will actually cost taxpayers
$2 billion.26 Numerous audits done by the Bank’s internal inspector general
also show that the Bank’s risk analyses, default assumptions, internal reporting
procedures, and financial reporting practices are not reliable enough to ensure
the safe stewardship of taxpayer funds and responsible management of EXIM’s
vast portfolio.27
