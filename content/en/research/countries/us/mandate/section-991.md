ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES AND BUDGET

Administrator and Key Staff. The position of Administrator should not be
considered a symbolic or messaging-related position as some past Administrations
have viewed it. Rather, the Administrator should have the requisite experience,
skills, and knowledge to ensure that the SBA fulfills its statutory authorities.
Because much of the SBA’s statutory authority relates to financing and reg-
ulatory policy, and in order to make the SBA a more effective agency within the
Administration, the Administrator and his or her key staff should have experience
in small-business finance and investment and/or administrative law. For example,
during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SBA was often forced to outsource key deci-
sions and administrative follow-through to the Department of the Treasury. The
SBA Administrator and leadership team must share the President’s mission and
vision and execute the Administration’s policies effectively.

Budget
The next Administration should undertake a comprehensive review of the
effectiveness of its various loan and grant programs and provide a report to
Congress within six months. The report should rank programs by cost-effective-
ness. In the interim, the roughly $1 billion overall agency budget should be held
constant until the report is considered, after which Congress should terminate ineffective programs, consolidate duplicative functions, and reallocate resources
to more effective programs (such as the Office of Advocacy) or consider reducing
the SBA budget.
Personnel Challenges

The SBA continues to expand programs and initiatives without first document-
ing the effectiveness of existing programs or whether they involve areas in which
the agency lacks staff expertise. For example, the SBA wants to expand the number
of licensed Small Business Lending Companies (SBLCs), implement a new “Mis-
sion-Based SBLC,” and remove a requirement for loan authorization within the
7(a) and 504 Loan programs and rely solely on a lender’s documents.
Various IG reports have noted that the lack of skilled employees within the
SBA has fueled fraud and mismanagement in COVID-19 lending programs, and
congressional leaders have expressed alarm about these “changes that haphazardly
overextend the SBA’s responsibilities at a time when they are devastated by fraud
and underperforming on their core mission of serving the nation’s 33 million small
businesses.”74 A conservative Administration should rein in these idealistic and
impractical efforts, get current programs under control and properly staffed with
people who can manage and perform competently, and outsource efforts where
private-sector expertise is appropriate and more efficient.

28. In varying degrees, almost every small-business advocacy organization and trade association engages
with the SBA. During periods of hyper-regulatory activity fueled by an activist Administration, the small-
business community engages more frequently with the Office of Advocacy through its roundtables and
other mechanisms in the hope of warding off costly and intrusive rulemakings. A future conservative
Administration can look to the following groups, among others, for support in advancing both SBA
and broader policy reform: American Hotel and Lodging Association; Asian American Hotel Owners
Association; Association of Builders and Contractors; Associated Equipment Distributors; Ceramic Tile
Distributors Association; Consumer Technology Association; Family Business Coalition; Foodservice
Equipment Distributors Association; Heating, Air-conditioning, and Refrigeration Distributors International;
Independent Bakers Association; Independent Community Bankers Association; Independent Electrical
Contractors’ International Association of Plastics Distributors; International Franchise Association;
Metals Service Center Institute; National Association of Electrical Distributors; National Association of
Manufacturers; National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors; National Fastener Distributors Association;
National Marine Distributors Association; National Federation of Independent Business; National Ready Mix
Concrete Association; National Small Business Association; Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council;
and U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. Additionally, the small-business community is diverse and broad,
and several key groups strongly support SBA lending but vigorously oppose tax, regulatory, and spending
policies that are intrusiveness or costly to business. Conservative think tanks and taxpayer organizations
like The Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against
Government Waste, the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, and Americans for Tax Reform (among others) also
have a stake in an improved and cost-effective SBA.﻿
