The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was authorized in 2010 by the Dodd–Frank Act.32 Since the Bureau’s inception, its status as an “inde- pendent” agency with no congressional oversight has been questioned in multiple court cases, and the agency has been assailed by critics33 as a shakedown mecha- nism to provide unaccountable funding to leftist nonprofits politically aligned with those who spearheaded its creation.

In 2015, for example, Investor’s Business Daily accused the CFPB of “diverting
potentially millions of dollars in settlement payments for alleged victims of lending
bias to a slush fund for poverty groups tied to the Democratic Party” and plan-
ning “to create a so-called Civil Penalty Fund from its own shakedown operations
targeting financial institutions” that would use “ramped-up (and trumped-up)
anti-discrimination lawsuits and investigations” to “bankroll some 60 liberal non-
profits, many of whom are radical Acorn-style pressure groups.”34
The CFPB has a fiscal year (FY) 2023 budget of $653.2 million35 and 1,635 full-
time equivalent (FTE) employees.36 From FY 2012 through FY 2020, it imposed
approximately $1.25 billion in civil money penalties;37 in FY 2022, it imposed
approximately $172.5 million in civil money penalties.38 These penalties are
imposed by the CFPB Civil Penalty Fund, described as “a victims relief fund, into
which the CFPB deposits civil penalties it collects in judicial and administrative
actions under Federal consumer financial laws.”39

The CFPB is headed by a single Director who is appointed by the President to
a five-year term.40 Its organizational structure includes five divisions: Operations;
Consumer Education and External Affairs; Legal; Supervision, Enforcement and
Fair Lending; and Research, Monitoring and Regulations.41 Each of these divisions
reports to the Office of the Director, except for the Operations Division, which
reports to the Deputy Director.
Passage of Title X of Dodd–Frank was a bid to placate concern over a series
of regulatory failures identified in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The law
imported a new superstructure of federal regulation over consumer finance and﻿

mortgage lending and servicing industries traditionally regulated by state bank-
ing regulators. Consumer protection responsibilities previously handled by the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Reserve, National Credit Union Admin-
istration, and Federal Trade Commission were transferred to and consolidated in
the CFPB, which issues rules, orders, and guidance to implement federal consumer
financial law.

The CFPB collects fines from the private sector that are put into the Civil Pen-
alty Fund.42 The fund serves two ostensible purposes: to compensate the victims
whom the CFPB perceives to be harmed and to underwrite “consumer education”
and “financial literacy” programs.43 How the Civil Penalty Fund is spent is at the
discretion of the CFPB Director. The CFPB has been unclear as to how it decides
what “consumer education” or “financial literacy programs” to fund.44 As noted,
critics have charged that money from the Civil Penalty Fund has ended up in the
pockets of leftist activist organizations.

In Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,45 the Supreme Court
of the United States held that the CFPB’s leadership by a single individual remov-
able only for inefficiency, neglect, or malfeasance violated constitutional separation
of powers requirements because “[t]he Constitution requires that such officials
remain dependent on the President, who in turn is accountable to the people.”46
The CFPB Director is thus subject to removal by the President.

The CFPB is not subject to congressional oversight, and its funding is not
determined by elected lawmakers in Congress as part of the typical congressional
appropriations process. It receives its funding from the Federal Reserve, which
is itself funded outside the appropriations process through bank assessments.
CFPB funding represents 12 percent of the total operating expenses of the Fed-
eral Reserve and is disbursed by the unelected Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System.47 This is not the case with respect to any other federal agency.
On October 19, 2022, in Community Financial Services Association of America
v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit held that the CFPB’s “perpetual insulation from Congress’s appropriations
power, including the express exemption from congressional review of its funding,
renders the Bureau ‘no longer dependent and, as a result, no longer accountable’
to Congress and, ultimately, to the people”48 and that “[b]y abandoning its ‘most
complete and effectual’ check on ‘the overgrown prerogatives of the other branches
of the government’—indeed, by enabling them in the Bureau’s case—Congress ran
afoul of the separation of powers embodied in the Appropriations Clause.”49 The
Court further remarked that the CFPB’s “capacious portfolio of authority acts ‘as
a mini legislature, prosecutor, and court, responsible for creating substantive rules
for a wide swath of industries, prosecuting violations, and levying knee-buckling
penalties against private citizens.’”50

On February 27, 2023, the Supreme Court granted the petition for a writ of
certiorari.51 The Court should issue its final decision by 2024.
The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal
agency.52 It is unconstitutional. Congress should abolish the CFPB and reverse
Dodd–Frank Section 1061, thus returning the consumer protection function of
the CFPB to banking regulators53 and the Federal Trade Commission. Provided
the Supreme Court affirms the Fifth Circuit holding in Community Financial Ser-
vices Association of America, the next conservative President should order the
immediate dissolution of the agency—pull down its prior rules, regulations and
guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.

Until this can be accomplished, however, Congress should:

Repeal Dodd–Frank Section 1071. This section, which relates to small-
business data collection, imposes requirements on financial institutions’
lending to small firms, raises costs, and limits small businesses’ access
to capital.54
Require that no CFPB funds are spent on enforcement actions that
are not based on a rulemaking that complies with the Administrative
Procedure Act.55
Require that respondents in administrative actions be allowed to
elect whether an adjudication occurs in an administrative law court
or an ordinary Article III federal court.56
Specify the nature of “deceptive, unfair, and abusive” practices to
define the scope of the CFPB mission more precisely.

﻿
l
Ensure that any civil penalty funds not used to recompense wronged
consumers go to the Department of the Treasury. The funds should not
be retained by the Bureau to be dispensed at the pleasure of the Director—
potentially to political actors. Moreover, the CFPB should not have a
financial incentive to impose penalties.
