If all immigration agencies are not merged, including USCIS and ORR, then
an appropriate third alternative would be to consolidate ICE and CBP to form
a combined Border Security and Immigration Agency (BSIA). This would inte-
grate critical interdiction, enforcement, and investigative resources, enhancing
coordination and refocusing collective efforts on the vast and complex cross-border threats impacting our nation’s health, safety, and national security. It would also simultaneously add efficiencies to our nation’s capacity to facilitate lawful
trade and travel.

The BSIA should establish clear mission requirements, responsibilities, and
mandates under existing law regarding the persistent need for and utilization of
U.S. military personnel and resources to assist BSIA with increasing whole-of-gov-
ernment efforts and long-term strategy to secure our nation’s borders effectively.
In addition, appropriate elements within the newly created BSIA should be desig-
nated as part of the U.S. National Security and Intelligence Community.
A conservative Administration should eliminate any prohibitive guidance,
direction, or mandate from DHS or the Administration that curtails or limits CBP
from publishing detailed border security and enforcement data not impacting
intelligence, interdiction, and investigative operations, methods, or sources. DHS
should issue a regulation mandating that CBP publish accurate and timely border
security data, readily available to the public, on a regular basis that avoid White
House and DHS leadership review and approval.

The White House should grant the authority for CBP and DHS executives to
utilize component aviation assets under the Office of Air and Marine (OAM). CBP
and DHS have worldwide missions with personnel and facilities that are deployed
across the globe and in every state in the U.S. With a CBP workforce alone of more
than 60,000 people (240,000-plus for DHS) encompassing more than a thousand
sea, land, and airports, it is essential that the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner,
Secretary, and Deputy Secretary can travel efficiently to facilities to maintain
appropriate situational awareness across the department’s vast mission set and
interact with the expansive workforce. Although CBP operates one of the largest
aviation components of any domestic U.S. law enforcement agency, executives are
prohibited from utilizing the agency’s aviation assets to facilitate official travel.
Executives are required to fly on commercial airlines, and this requirement sig-
nificantly limits their ability to have classified communications and takes them
offline for extended periods of time.

Border Patrol (BP) and OAM should be combined within CBP. BP has more than
20,000 personnel, and OAM has approximately 1,800. OAM’s assets are dedicated
in support of BP operations the vast majority of the time, yet redundant approv-
als, strategies, and independent hierarchal commands serve as impediments to
efficient and practical resource deployments.
CBP should restart and expand use of the horseback-mounted Border Patrol. As
part of this announcement, the Secretary should clear the records and personnel
files of those who were falsely accused by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas of whip-
ping migrants and issue a formal apology on behalf of DHS and CBP.
The Secretary should combine the Office of Trade (OT) and Trade Relations
with the Office of Field Operations (OFO). The OT is the smallest of CBP’s components, and its operational counterpart, OFO, has a workforce of more than 30,000.

OT’s function is interwoven with that of its OFO operational counterpart. Combin-
ing OT with OFO would achieve streamlined operations and increase OT’s capacity
and capability by leveraging OFO’s expansive resources.
CBP, ICE, and USCIS all have authority to issue Notices to Appear (NTA) to
removable aliens in their presence, which begins removal proceedings. In most
instances, CBP should turn illegal aliens over to ICE for detention, and ICE can
then issue any needed NTA. CBP should issue NTAs only in limited situations
for humanitarian reasons, such as medical emergencies. In addition, CBP should
eliminate use of Notices to Report (NTR) altogether.

CBP’s established national standards of Transport, Escort, Detention, and
Search (TEDS) have been widely interpreted and expanded by lower courts. This
has resulted in unrealistic and differing detention standards for CBP facilities based
on the jurisdiction within which they fall, negatively impacting operations. ICE has
suffered similarly. A single nationwide detention standard should be codified that
prevents individual states from mandating that federal government agencies adhere
to widely expansive and ever-changing sets of standards. Such standards should allow
the flexibility to use large numbers of temporary facilities such as tents.
The annual costs associated with establishing and maintaining temporary facil-
ities to address the flow of illegal migration and associated care, transportation,
and processing are prohibitive, and CBP’s budget is inadequate. CBP is forced to
forgo critical mission-essential endeavors to fund the additional associated costs.
Often, this requires the reprogramming of funding at the DHS level, which has a
negative impact on other DHS components’ operations. This predictable cost that
has to be paid from existing CBP and DHS funding levels reduces CBP’s operational
readiness and ability to accomplish its diverse and critical missions to protect the
American people. The next President should request a realistic budget that fully
pays for these costs.

Increased funding is needed for BP to hire additional support personnel, which
would relieve uniformed BP agents from administrative duties associated with
processing aliens and allow them to return to their national security mission.
Congress should increase funding for facility upgrades at strategic land Ports of
Entry (POEs), including expanding state-of-the-art technology such as Non-Intru-
sive Inspection equipment. Today, the cartels exploit the aging facilities and lack
of adequate technology to smuggle illicit drugs, contraband, and more successfully
through our nation’s POEs.


### U.S. IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT (ICE)

#### Needed Reforms

Since the formation of DHS, ICE has increasingly been tasked with auxiliary
missions that have little or nothing to do with either immigration or customs enforcement. To return ICE to its primary mission, any new Administration that
wishes to restore the rule of law to our immigration enforcement efforts should:

Direct ICE to stop ignoring criminal aliens identified through the
287(g) program.4 Ultimately, Congress should prevent ICE from ignoring
criminal aliens identified by local law enforcement agencies that are partners
in the 287(g) program. However, before congressional action, ICE should
be directed to take custody of all aliens with records for felonies, crimes of
violence, DUIs, previous removals, and any other crime that is considered a
national security or public safety threat as defined under current laws.
Eliminate T and U visas. Victimization should not be a basis for an
immigration benefit. If an alien who was a trafficking or crime victim is
actively and significantly cooperating with law enforcement as a witness,
the S visa is already available and should be used. Pending elimination of the
T and U visas, the Secretary should significantly restrict eligibility for each
visa to prevent fraud.

Issue clear guidance regarding detention and bond for aliens.
Thousands of illegal aliens are allowed to bond out of immigration detention
only to disappear into the interior of the United States where many commit
crimes and many others disappear, never to be heard from again. This
occurs primarily because of poorly worded bond regulations, contradictory
bond policy memoranda, and poor practices for managing released
aliens and the Alternatives to Detention (ATD) Program, which requires
significant reform.

Prioritize national security in the Student and Exchange Visitor
Program (SEVP). ICE should end its current cozy deference to educational
institutions and remove security risks from the program. This requires
working with the Department of State to eliminate or significantly reduce
the number of visas issued to foreign students from enemy nations.

Order ICE to stop closing out pending immigration cases and apply
the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) as written by Congress.3
The Biden Administration closed out tens of thousands of immigration
cases that had already been prepared and were slated for expedited removal
processing or hearings before the U.S. Immigration Court. This misguided
action constituted an egregious example of lawlessness that allowed
thousands of illegal aliens and other immigration violators to go free in the
United States.

Most of the foregoing can be accomplished rapidly and effectively through exec-
utive action that is both lawful and appropriate. Additionally, ICE should clarify
who is responsible for enforcing its criminal and civil authorities. It should also
remove self-imposed limitations on its nationwide jurisdiction.

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Special Agents in the 1811
series should enforce Title 8 and 18 crimes as the biggest part of their
portfolio. Alien smuggling, trafficking, and cross-border crime as defined
under Title 85 and Title 186 should be the focus of ICE operations.
The role of ICE Deportation Officers should be clarified. ICE
Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) should be identified as being
primarily responsible for enforcing civil immigration regulations, including
the civil arrest, detention, and removal of immigration violators anywhere
in the United States, without warrant where appropriate, subject only to the
civil warrant requirements of the INA where appropriate.


All ICE memoranda identifying “sensitive zones” where
ICE personnel are prohibited from operating should be
rescinded. Rely on the good judgment of officers in the field to avoid
inappropriate situations.

To maximize the efficient use of its resources, ICE should make full
use of existing Expedited Removal (ER) authorities. The agency has
limited the use of ER to eligible aliens apprehended within 100 miles of the
border. This is not a statutory requirement.

#### New Policies

U.S. national security and public safety interests would be well-served if ICE
were to be combined with CBP and USCIS, as mentioned above. Additionally, ICE/
HSI, along with CBP, should be full participants in the Intelligence Community.
The use of Blackies Warrants should be operationalized within ICE. These civil
search warrants are commonly used for worksite enforcement when agents have
probable cause that illegal aliens are employed at a business. This would stream-
line investigations.

Safeguarding Americans will require not just securing the border, but con-
tinuous vetting and investigations of many aliens who exploited President
Biden’s open border for potentially nefarious purposes, including some Afghan
evacuees sent directly to the U.S. during America’s disastrous withdrawal from
Afghanistan.

### Budget

Congress should mandate and fund additional bed space for alien
detainees. ICE should be funded for a significant increase in detention
space, raising the daily available number of beds to 100,000.
Congress should fund ICE for at least 20,000 ERO officers and 5,000
Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA) attorneys.
