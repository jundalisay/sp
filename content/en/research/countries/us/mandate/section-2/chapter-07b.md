The CIA is a foreign intelligence collection service tasked with collecting human intelligence (HUMINT), providing all-source intelligence analysis and reporting, and conducting covert action when required to do so by the President. 

The CIA has its roots in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which the United States established during World War II as a paramilitary and intelligence collection orga- nization. After World War II, President Harry Truman disbanded the OSS, and the CIA was established in law by the National Security Act of 1947.

As with every agency in government, the President's election sets a new agenda
for the country. Public servants must be mindful that they are required to help
the President implement that agenda while remaining apolitical, upholding the
Constitution and laws of the United States, and earning the public trust. The Pres-
ident requires a CIA that provides unbiased and apolitical foreign intelligence
information and, when necessary, can act capably and effectively on any covert
action findings.

Executing the Mission. The CIA’s success depends on firm direction from the
President and solid internal CIA Director–appointed leadership. Decisive senior
leaders must commit to carrying out the President’s agenda and be willing to take
calculated risks. Therefore:

The next President-Elect and incoming Presidential Personnel Office
should identify a Director nominee who can foster a mission-driven culture
by making necessary personnel and structural changes.
The President-Elect should choose a Deputy Director who, without
needing Senate confirmation, can immediately begin to implement the
President’s agenda. This includes halting all current hiring to prevent
the “burrowing in” of outgoing political personnel. Additional appointees
should be placed within the agency as needed to assist the Director in
supervising its functioning.

The Director and Deputy Director should request briefings on all CIA
activities and presence overseas, as well as any CIA-controlled access
programs and existing covert action findings, without exception.
The Director and Deputy Director should meet with all directorates and
mission centers, prioritizing those that are aligned most closely with the
President’s priorities and calibrating collection and operations based on
the President’s intelligence requirements. This includes any areas where
the CIA might be conducting its own diplomacy parallel to official State
Department policy. It must be clear that the CIA’s liaison relationships
overseas must follow and not contradict those set at the policy level by the
President through the State Department.

The other principal offices responsible for executing the CIA’s mission include
the Directorate of Operations, Directorate of Analysis, Directorate of Science and
Technology, Directorate of Support, and Directorate of Digital Innovation. If senior
leadership finds any program or operation to be inconsistent with the President’s
agenda, the Director should immediately halt that program or operation.
Reining in Bureaucracy. The CIA’s bureaucracy continues to grow. Because
mid-level managers lack accountability, there are areas in which personnel are not
responsive to any authority, including the President. The President should instruct
the Director to hire or promote new individuals to lead the various directorates
and mission centers. This new crop of mid-level leaders should carry out clear
directives from senior CIA leadership, which means more accountability and new
ways of thinking to benefit the mission.

In addition, the President should task the Director with significantly broadening
recruitment, expediting onboarding practices, and shifting resources away from
headquarters, including terminal generalist GS-15s when OPM buyouts, forced
rotations, or up-and-out personnel policies are set for particular positions. The
CIA must find creative ways to align mission requirements with hiring needs,
recruit diverse sets of individuals with unique backgrounds, and become more
open to hiring private-sector experts directly into senior positions. In addition,
the Director should break the cabal of bureaucrats in D.C. by permanently moving
various directorates, such as Support and Science and Technology, out of Virginia
and possibly open campuses outside of D.C. where analysts and other experts could
contribute virtually.

Redirecting Resources. Certain CIA employees and offices have focused on
promoting divisive ideological or cultural agendas and fostering a damaging cul-
ture of risk aversion and complacency. As soon as possible, the Director should
divert resources from any activities that promote unnecessary and distracting
social engineering. The Director should implement changes in promotion criteria
that reward individuals for creative thinking and quality of recruitments and prod-
ucts rather than numeric metrics or the achievement of benchmarks that are not
essential to the mission.

Not all careers in espionage are created equal, and the Director should incentiv-
ize and reward applicants who are willing to accept high risks over those who are
climbing the ranks simply by doing business as usual. The Director should refocus
the CIA to an OSS-like culture and mandate that all CIA employees acquire, as a
condition of securing senior (GS-14+) rank, additional or enhanced language skills,
technical or cyber expertise, or field training or serve in overseas assignments.


### COVERT ACTION

Covert action can be a valuable tool in helping further the President’s foreign
policy agenda if implemented in concert with other forms of government power.
As codified in the U.S. Code, “the term ‘covert action’ means an activity or activities
of the United States Government to influence political, economic, or military con-
ditions abroad, where it is intended that the role of the United States Government
will not be apparent or acknowledged publicly....”16

The President initiates a covert action with a written finding that explains why
“such an action is necessary to support identifiable foreign policy objectives of the
United States and is important to the national security of the United States.”17 The
statute assumes the President will use the CIA as the principal action element to
achieve the objectives of covert action findings; however, the President need not
feel constrained to utilize only the CIA: “[E]ach finding shall specify each depart-
ment, agency, or entity of the United States Government authorized to fund or
otherwise participate in any significant way in such action.”18

For example, the Department of Defense maintains certain clandestine capa-
bilities under Title 10 authorities that may resemble but far exceed in scale similar
capabilities outside of DOD. Generally, such DOD capabilities can be employed
outside a combat theater only if they are determined to be traditional military
activities. In practical terms, this means that many DOD capabilities, including
those in the space and cyber domains, can be employed only after the initiation of
armed conflict.19 Given the range of global threats the United States faces today,
the President should consider whether DOD’s complete set of capabilities should
be used to support potential covert actions.

The problem, unfortunately, is that certain elements in the State Department,
IC, and DOD trade on risk aversion or political bureaucracy to delay execution
of the President’s foreign policy goals. A future conservative President should
therefore identify individuals on the transition team who are familiar with the
implementation of covert action with a view to placing them in key NSC, CIA,
ODNI, and DOD positions. These knowledgeable teams can assist in any review
of current covert actions and, potentially, planning for new actions.

Immediately after the inauguration, the President should task the NSC’s Senior
Director for Intelligence Programs with conducting a 60-day review of any current
covert action findings, including their effectiveness; evaluating new covert actions
that might be needed to implement the President’s foreign policy goals; and report-
ing back to the President. Such an assessment should be conducted independently
of the agencies responsible for the actions under review. As part of the review, the
Senior Director for Intelligence Programs should identify which departments or
agencies, such as the CIA or DOD, are best equipped to achieve the objectives set
out in new and existing findings.

After the 60-day review, the President should demand creative thinking and a
clear strategy as to how covert action fits within the President’s broader foreign
policy strategy, to include possibly modifying or rescinding any current findings,
drafting new findings, and streamlining or eliminating needless bureaucracy, par-
ticularly at State, to facilitate more expeditious decisions on tactical covert action.
Careful thought should be given to the metrics by which the effectiveness of covert
action programs will be measured to ensure the appropriate use of government
resources and to guard against the possibility of covert action’s being used with
little scrutiny in ways that are inconsistent with overt foreign policy goals.


### ODNI AND CIA ORGANIZATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

The ODNI and CIA operate under authority provided by the Central Intelli-
gence Agency Act of 1949,20 which means they have greater latitude than the rest
of the federal government with respect to the hiring and firing of personnel. Both
organizations and other areas of the IC have struggled from a human resources
and talent management standpoint to recruit, onboard, and maintain personnel
in a timely fashion to fill the IC’s ever-changing needs. At a time when the Intelli-
gence Community needs significantly more personnel with the proper technical,
language-capable, and diverse backgrounds, including applicants from elements
of the business community, the incoming Directors of both agencies need to make
this effort a top priority.

Past DNIs’ Chiefs of Staff and additional front-office staff historically have come
from outside the IC, commonly under a misconstrued “staff-reserve” structure
that is intended to avoid a Schedule C designation within the IC. The Director
should handpick qualified, properly cleared personnel for front-office and mana-
gerial leadership positions, such as the DNI’s Chief of Staff and heads of Legislative
Affairs and Strategic Communications, to oversee those divisions with career IC
staff reporting to them.

The incoming DNI and CIA Director should also consider changes in the Senior
National Intelligence Service (SNIS)/Senior Intelligence Services (SIS). Senior
officers should be required to sign mobility agreements that allow ODNI and CIA
leadership to move them within the IC every two years if necessary. Many qualified and distinguished senior officers serve throughout the IC, but some long-serving generalist officers no longer perform at a high capacity, are management-driven,
do not serve the IC’s changing needs, and limit junior officers’ prospects for growth
and advancement. An incoming Administration should consider studying and
implementing additional requirements as a condition for promotion to GS-15/
SNIS/SIS and explore concepts such as “Up and Out” beginning at the GS-14/15
levels and above for some fields.

The IC should evaluate areas of bloat and underperforming cadre and work
with OPM on authority for voluntary separation buyouts. Allowing ODNI and CIA
leadership to shrink size and reduce duplication of effort while promoting healthy
turnover within their senior ranks would encourage new ideas and perspectives
from mid-career officers and, potentially, from employees hired from outside
their agencies. The ODNI and CIA should maximize their direct-hire and incen-
tive-building authorities to bring in talented and properly cleared individuals to
serve in positions requiring technical, language, and cyber expertise.

Finally, the human resources and talent management systems for onboarding
purposes at the ODNI, CIA, and some other elements of the IC are fundamentally
broken. For example, according to current CIA Director William Burns, it recently
took more than 600 days, on average, for a CIA applicant to receive his or her
necessary security clearance.21 Although security clearance procedures have been
somewhat improved in recent years and Burns has committed CIA to reducing that
to no more than 180 days, degradation in other areas of the process has limited the
IC’s capacity to attract qualified and needed expertise.


### PREVENTING THE ABUSE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR PARTISAN PURPOSES

The intelligence function must be protected from bottom-up and top-down
politicization if it is to play its proper role in our national security decision-mak-
ing process. Unfortunately, both types of politicization have occurred recently to
the detriment of the Intelligence Community’s reputation and credibility. More
important, the politicization of intelligence risks contributing to policy fail-
ures (as we saw with the Iraq War) or even undermining our democratic system
here at home.

In particular, the IC must restore confidence in its political neutrality to rectify
the damage done by the actions of former IC leaders and personnel regarding the
claims of Trump–Russia collusion following the 2016 election and the suppression
of the Hunter Biden laptop investigation and media revelations of its existence
during the 2020 election. But the problem is not confined to the executive branch
struggle between the IC and policymakers; it also relates to the IC’s relationship
with Congress as evinced by DNI James Clapper’s failure to answer honestly in
response to congressional questions about government surveillance programs.

The ODNI and CIA are undergoing a crisis of confidence based on several factors.
First, President Barack Obama’s CIA Director, John Brennan, gravely damaged the
CIA by minimizing the Directorate of Operations and exploiting intelligence analy-
sis as a political weapon after he left office. Brennan's role in the letter signed by 51
former intelligence officials before the 2020 election is unclear, but in dismissing
the Hunter Biden laptop as “Russian disinformation,” the CIA was discredited, and
the shocking extent of politicization among some former IC officials was revealed.


Restoring respect for the IC as an independent provider of information and
analysis while also ensuring that it is responsive to the legitimate needs of poli-
cymakers will require reinforcing essential norms and institutions. However, we
should also recognize that achieving the perfect balance that avoids the pathologies
of too much distance or too much closeness and responsiveness to policymakers
is not only difficult, but probably impossible.22 Thus, given the very nature of the
business and the political process, much will depend on the promotion of certain
norms or virtues on both sides of the principal–agent relationship. Specifically:

The President should direct the DNI and the Attorney General, by direction
of the respective Inspectors General and IC Analytic Ombudsman, to
conduct a further audit of all IC equities of past politicization and abuses
of intelligence information. For example, a recent IC ombudsman analysis
during the 2020 election cycle noted, “If our political leaders in the White
House and Congress believe we are withholding intelligence because of
organizational turf wars or political considerations, the legitimacy of the
Intelligence Community’s work is lost.”23


The President should immediately revoke the security clearances of any
former Directors, Deputy Directors, or other senior intelligence officials
who discuss their work in the press or on social media without prior
clearance from the current Director. IC agencies, including the CIA, should
minimize their public presence and vigorously investigate any and all leaks

The DNI and CIA Director should use their authority under the National
Security Act of 1947 to expedite the clearance of personnel to meet mission
needs and remove IC employees who have abused their positions of trust.
An area of particular concern is that personnel under investigation for
improprieties have been allowed to retire before internal investigations
have been completed. Directors of both agencies must instill further
confidence in their workforces, Congress, and the American people that
they can and will deal effectively with personnel that fail to live up to their
oath to the Constitution, adhere to ethical and moral standards as expected
by America’s taxpayers, and faithfully execute the law.


of information, classified or otherwise. The ODNI and CIA should fire or
refer for prosecution any employee who is suspected of leaking information,
and penalties should include the removal of pension benefits for those who
are found guilty. Additional tools are needed to prevent leaked intelligence
from being used as a weapon in policy debates by IC leaders or decision-
makers in the executive branch or Congress.

Military and civilian IC training should include stronger emphasis
on the norm of political neutrality, including a mandatory course on
professionalism and repercussions for abuse in the execution of duties in all
degree programs at the National Intelligence University.

In addition, the Department of Justice should use all of the tools at its
disposal to investigate leaks and should rescind damaging guidance by
Attorney General Merrick Garland that limits investigators’ ability to
identify records of unauthorized disclosures of classified information to
the media. Personnel have sufficient access to legitimate whistleblower
claims under protections provided by Inspectors General and Congress. The
Director and IC must prioritize hiring additional counterintelligence and
security personnel to assist in this effort.

Intelligence leaders need to model norms of neutrality and respect for the
decision-making authority of the President, appointed officials, and Congress.
This includes building trust with key decision-makers by not using their
positions and privileged access to information to influence policymaking
indirectly or directly in an inappropriate fashion (especially by engaging in
threat inflation). IC leaders should practice extreme restraint in engaging
with the public and the media. They should seek to work in the shadows
rather than in the limelight. Potential restrictions on such appearances could
supplement this norm, preventing political leaders from using IC officials to
support an Administration position as they do with military leaders.
Retired IC leaders should similarly support the neutrality norm by not
becoming public figures.


Congress should not use IC leaders as pawns in policy struggles with the
President or the other party during their appearances before committees of
the House and Senate. While Congress has a proper oversight role, it should
distinguish between information that needs to be public and information
that should be discussed in private with members of the IC. A DNI should
call “balls and strikes” to those on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill who attempt to weaponize the use of selective intelligence to feed political narratives.


Political leaders should avoid “manipulation-by-appointment,” a practice
by which intelligence leaders are selected for their policy views or political
loyalties instead of their skilled expertise.24 Presidents should also avoid
public rebukes and pressure from the intelligence profession, which can
include intimidation and bullying, to shape IC analysis. This will be easier if
IC leaders live by the norms of neutrality and thus are not seen as political
actors, for whom political responses are deemed necessary.

Intelligence leaders and professionals should never “cook the books” for
Presidents or change or shape their analysis to preserve access or status.25
