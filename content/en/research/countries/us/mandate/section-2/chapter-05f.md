DHS’s external communications function should be consolidated and reformed
so that the President’s agenda can be implemented more effectively. The Office of
Partnership and Engagement should be merged into the Office of Public Affairs.
In many Cabinet agencies, outreach to companies and partner organizations is
similarly performed by the Office of Public Affairs. This would also accomplish a
needed DHS organizational and management reform to decrease the number of
direct reports to the Secretary.

Both public and legislative affairs staff in the components should report directly
to their respective headquarters equivalent. This would help to avoid a failure by
the department to speak with one voice. It would also allow the component staff to
perform more efficiently, overseen by expert managers in their trade. This would
also allow DHS to respond to crises effectively by shifting staff as needed to the
most pressing issues and better use underutilized staff at less active components.
Only political appointees in OLA should interact directly with congressional staff
on all inquiries, including budget and appropriations matters. To prevent congres-
sional staff from answer shopping among HQ OLA, the DHS OCFO, and components,
DHS legislative affairs appropriations staff should be moved from MGMT OCFO
into OLA. Regarding components, budget/appropriations staff should move from
component budget offices into component legislative affairs offices.
Because dozens of congressional committees and subcommittees either have or
claim to have jurisdiction over some DHS function, DHS staff from the Secretary
on down spend so much time responding to congressional hearing and briefing
requests, letters, and questions for the record that they are left with little time
to do their assigned job of protecting the homeland. The next President should
reach an agreement with congressional leadership to limit committee jurisdiction
to one authorizing committee and one appropriations committee in each cham-
ber. If congressional leadership will not limit their committees’ jurisdiction over
DHS, DHS should identify one authorizing and appropriations committee in each
chamber and answer only to it.

To focus more precisely on the DHS mission, OLA staff should also identify
outdated and needless congressional reporting requirements and notify Congress
that DHS will cease reporting on such matters. For other congressional reports,
OLA should implement a sunset date so that Congress must regularly demonstrate
the need for specific data.

In both OPA and OLA, a change in mission and culture is needed. The clients
of both components are the President and the Secretary, not the media, external
organizations, or Congress. OPA and OLA should change from being compliance
correspondents for outside entities airing grievances to serving as messengers and
advocates for the President and the Secretary.


## OFFICE OF OPERATIONS COORDINATION (OPS)

OPS was originally conceived by then-Secretary Jeh Johnson as an entity tasked
with coordinating cross-DHS assets on an as-needed basis using a joint operations
approach. This role is particularly challenging because of the disparate nature of
mission sets across DHS.
OPS should absorb a very small number of tactical intelligence professionals from
I&A as the rest of I&A is shut down. Such intelligence officers would be a subordinate
element within OPS placed within the National Operations Center. The intelligence
officers would provide tactical intelligence support for upcoming or ongoing opera-
tions in addition to liaising with their agency/component counterparts. There would
be no strategic intelligence analysis done as part of OPS or its new I&A sub-element.
In addition to facilitating all-of-DHS coordination on a task-by-task basis, OPS
would be responsible for ongoing situational awareness for the Secretary and
Deputy Secretary.

In addition to long-term staffing, OPS would have cycling billets from each of
the major agencies and components to facilitate its most effective working rela-
tionships across DHS.


## OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES (CRCL) AND PRIVACY OFFICE (PRIV)

The Homeland Security Act established only an Officer of CRCL, not an office.
The only substantive function Congress then assigned to the officer was to review
and assess information alleging abuses of civil rights. Since then, Congress and
CRCL itself have significantly expanded CRCL’s scope and size well beyond its
original intent or helpful purpose. CRCL now operates and views itself as a quasi-­
DHS Office of Inspector General. This results in a considerable waste of limited
component resources, which are routinely tasked to address redundant, overly
burdensome, and uninformed demands from CRCL. It is therefore important to
recalibrate CRCL’s scope and reach.

The organizational structure of both CRCL and the Privacy Office should be
changed to ensure proper alignment with the department’s mission. The Office
of General Counsel should absorb both CRCL’s and PRIV’s necessary functions


## OFFICE OF THE IMMIGRATION DETENTION OMBUDSMAN (OIDO) AND OFFICE OF THE CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION SERVICES OMBUDSMAN (CISOMB)

OIDO. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman should be
eliminated. This requires a statutory change in Section 106 of the Consolidated
Appropriations Act of 2020.18

OIDO was designed to create another impediment to detention through an
additional layer of so-called oversight. Several agencies already perform detention
oversight. ICE conducts internal audits of facilities and investigates complaints
against ICE agents through the Office of Professional Responsibility. Similarly, CBP
accepts individual complaints regarding facilities through the Joint Intake Center and staff. Although the CRCL Officer and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Officer/Privacy Officer are statutory, their offices are not mandatory. CRCL and
PRIV Officers and employees should report to a Deputy General Counsel, who
would be a political appointee.

The CRCL Officer should focus on equal employment opportunity (EEO)
compliance and the civil liberties function and investigate matters only within
Headquarters or support components. Operational components’ civil liberties offi-
cers should investigate incidents regarding their own agencies. The CRCL Officer
should ensure that all civil liberties or civil rights complaints are sent to the Office
of Inspector General (OIG) for review. If the OIG chooses not to investigate, the
CRCL Officer should only provide supportive information on possible courses of
action for complainants.

The PRIV Officer and FOIA Officer should focus on FOIA, Privacy Compliance
Policy, and Privacy Incident Response. The Deputy General Counsel should provide
guidance to DHS leadership regarding Privacy Compliance and Privacy Incident
Response. To ensure that only U.S. persons and Lawful Permanent Residents are
provided protections as required by the Privacy Act, all DHS issuances should be
updated to reflect that DHS protects the privacy of individuals as required by the
Privacy Act (U.S. persons and lawful permanent residents);16 the Judicial Redress
Act of 2015;17 and any U.S.–European Union Data Protection and Privacy Agreement.
Because of the lack of public trust in the Office of Intelligence and Analysis,
CRCL and PRIV staff should no longer review intelligence products or provide
guidance on any intelligence products or reports.

A consistent, clear, and singular message is necessary for DHS’s mission.
Therefore, all communications and/or meetings with any federal, state, local, or
nongovernment groups should be limited to the Deputy General Counsel. In addi-
tion, given the narrower scope of work, OGC should disband the outside advisory
boards and the more than 50 working groups in which CRCL and PRIV currently
participate. Finally, CRCL and PRIV should no longer issue bulletins or periodicals.﻿

and manages complaints against agents through the OPR. In addition, CRCL, OIG,
GAO, and Congress all perform detention oversight. These multiple bodies place
unmanageable and unreasonable burdens on ICE to manage several sometimes
inconsistent audits/inspections at the same time.

If OIDO remains a DHS component, the Secretary should immediately issue a direc-
tive stripping CRCL of its immigration portfolio. OIDO is in a better position with
dedicated resources and immigration experts to perform this function than CRCL is.
Allowing both offices to conduct detention oversight is duplicative and wasteful.
The Secretary should conduct a thorough review of the effectiveness of Direc-
tive 0810.1,19 which is widely interpreted as requiring a wholesale referral of cases
to OIG. In reality, OIG investigates only a small fraction of them and often sits on
cases for longer than the five-day window specified in the directive. Meanwhile,
the other agencies wait in limbo to execute their duties.

CISOMB. The Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman
should be eliminated. The DHS bureaucracy is too large, and the Secretary has too
many direct reports. CISOMB’s policy functions can be performed (and sometimes
already are) by OIG and GAO. The specialized case work can be moved into USCIS
as a special unit, much like the IRS Taxpayer Advocate. This would require a stat-
utory change to Section 452 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002.20
If CISOMB continues as a DHS component, a policy should be issued that
prohibits CISOMB from assisting illegal aliens to obtain benefits. Currently,
approximately 15 percent–20 percent of CISOMB’s workload consists of helping
DACA applicants obtain and renew benefits, including work authorization. This
is not the role of an ombudsman. In addition, the government should be a neutral
adjudicator, not an advocate for illegal aliens.


### AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS

All agencies and departments touching immigration policy should work in sync with one another.

While there are numerous areas in which such cooperation is critical, immigration
has proven to be the most difficult. Accordingly, several objectives will be necessary
for each of the following departments.

Department of Health and Human Services: Agree to move the Office
of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) to DHS or, alternatively, implement an
aggressive and regular effort by the Secretary of HHS to ensure that ORR is
fully pursuing presidential objectives in support of DHS.

Department of Defense: Assist in aggressively building the border wall
system on America’s southern border. Additionally, explicitly acknowledge
and adjust personnel and priorities to participate actively in the defense of America’s borders, including using military personnel and hardware to prevent illegal crossings between ports of entry and channel all cross-border
traffic to legal ports of entry.

Department of Justice: Agree to move the Executive Office for
Immigration Review and the Office of Immigration Litigation to DHS
and/or, alternatively, to treat the administrative law judges (immigration
judges and Board of Immigration Appeals) as national security personnel,
decertify their union, and move to increase hiring significantly to enable the
processing of more immigration cases.

Department of State: Allow DHS to lead international engagement in
the Western Hemisphere on issues of security and migration. Additionally,
quickly and aggressively address recalcitrant countries’ failure to accept
deportees by imposing stiff sanctions until deportees are in fact accepted for
return (not just promised to be taken).
Department of Housing and Urban Development: Ensure that only
U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents utilize or occupy federally
subsidized housing.

Department of Education: Deny loan access to those who are not U.S.
citizens or lawful permanent residents, and deny loan access to students at
schools that provide in-state tuition to illegal aliens.
Department of Labor: Eliminate the two (of four) lowest wage levels for
foreign workers.

Department of the Treasury: Implement all necessary regulations both to
equalize taxes between American citizens and working visa holders and to
provide DHS with all tax information of illegal aliens as expeditiously as possible.
Intelligence Community: Cooperate in the shrinking or elimination
of the I&A role in the IC while replacing it with CBP and HSI
representation to the IC.
