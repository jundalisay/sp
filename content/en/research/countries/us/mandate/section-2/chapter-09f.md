### Asia

Asia is the most populous continent and ground zero in the battle against
Communist China’s efforts to exploit the development needs of poor countries for
geopolitical gain. America’s Indo-Pacific Strategy should guide USAID’s approaches
to disbursing foreign aid in the region.

USAID should intensify its bilateral relationships with pro–free market Japan,
Australia, South Korea, and India so that they can jointly advance private-sector
solutions to secure financing for power generation, infrastructure, digital con-
nectivity, investment and trade expansion, and other economic activities. USAID
enjoys a strong in-country presence in India, buttressed by recent coordination
on the global response to COVID-19 as India is a global leader in vaccine produc-
tion. Those ties should be expanded. So too should development cooperation with
Taiwan, which boasts effective pandemic response capacity that should be shared
with developing countries.

China’s island-hopping efforts to capture vulnerable Pacific states is a direct strategic threat to U.S. maritime supremacy and homeland security, and USAID and its allied donors should neutralize these efforts through the deployment of
targeted assistance such as helping countries combat the effects of China’s ille-
gal fishing. While China outpaces the ability of the democratic alliance to deploy
state-backed financing to developing countries, it is unable to compete with our
collective private-sector capacity to deploy trillions of dollars of capital.



Pakistan is a prime example of foreign aid policies disconnected from U.S.
national interests. The country has been the recipient of more than $12 billion in
U.S. foreign aid since 2010, yet it remains intensely anti-American and corrupt, has
backed the Taliban continuously since 2001, jump-started North Korea’s nuclear
bomb program, brutalizes its religious minorities, and is a willing client of China
while taking on unrepayable loans from the U.S. taxpayer-funded International
Monetary Fund and World Bank.



The Middle East is far more vulnerable today than it was in 2020 because the Biden Administration’s strategy for the region is adrift. Tunisia has slid into autocracy, Iraq is plummeting further into Iran’s orbit, and U.S. soldiers continue to risk their lives for unclear ends amid the ruins of Syria. Meanwhile, billions of dollars in U.S. foreign aid props up regimes allied with Iran. President Trump’s Abraham Accords signaled the end of the centrality of the Arab–Israeli conflict, which paralyzed U.S. approaches to the region, and focused instead on Iran as the principal threat to America from this region.

During the Trump Administration, USAID’s allocations reflected the new opportunities created by the Accords and sought to strengthen regional alliances against Iran through expanded regional trade and investment and to promote genuine polit- ical stability tethered to strong American leadership. USAID formally partnered with the United Arab Emirates, Israel, Morocco, Qatar, and Kuwait to catalyze regional partnerships in Africa. Under the Biden Administration, however, USAID has returned to a model that deepens the region’s dependence on aid. A new conservative President should reset USAID’s programming in the Middle East in line with our national security interests and committed to the goal of ending the need for foreign aid through development that is led by the private sector.

Specifically:

Foreign aid must advance the Abraham Accords. Increased trade and
investment between Israel and its Arab neighbors represent the most
effective path toward reducing poverty, fostering the emergence of a middle
class, and solidifying peace. USAID should therefore focus its development
assistance on countries such as Morocco and Sudan through joint
investment collaboration with the more economically advanced economies
such as the UAE and Israel.

USAID should consider cutting aid to states allied to Iran, limiting
assistance in these countries to the advancement of narrow strategic
priorities and support for basic American values, such as aid to persecuted
religious minorities. USAID continues to expend hundreds of millions of
dollars in nonhumanitarian aid to antagonistic regimes in Iraq, Lebanon,
and the Palestinian territories. 

After billions of dollars of aid and many years of effort, these countries remain hopelessly dysfunctional—a fact that exposes the failure of a foreign aid model that is disconnected to our
national security and without exit strategies to promote self-reliance. We
must admit that USAID’s investments in the education sector, for example,
serve no other purpose than to subsidize corrupt, incompetent, and
hostile regimes.

USAID should undergo operational changes to secure better development
outcomes by reducing its missions’ footprints in the Middle East given that
most personnel in the region are unable to leave their highly protected and
expensive compounds and carry out their oversight functions. It should
redirect program funding away from expensive and poorly performing
international partners to more cost-effective local entities that require a
minimal USAID field presence.

Africa. Since its inception, USAID has had a strong presence in Africa, saving
millions of lives through its pandemic and infectious disease responses, especially
for malaria and HIV-AIDS. It has led global efforts to provide lifesaving emergency
assistance to those who are fleeing conflict and suffering from devastating natural
disasters. American generosity knows no equal.

Yet the agency’s efforts to reduce poverty and hunger have failed as it spends
ever-higher amounts of aid partnering with a costly and ineffective aid indus-
trial complex that has little interest in “working itself out of a job.” Long-term,
multibillion-dollar humanitarian responses lack exit strategies, while numer-
ous development projects lead neither to measurable results nor to government
reforms. Despite the tens of billions of dollars spent, the continent remains poor,
unstable, and riven with conflict, corruption, and Islamic terrorism. This situation
has also resulted in vast illegal migration from the continent.

Failure to generate wealth has provided opportunities for China to step in and
become the continent’s leader in trade, loans, and investment. As a result, Beijing
controls most of the continent’s strategic minerals that are critical to advanced
technology. Moreover, USAID is criticized by Africans for exporting cultural values
that are anathema to their traditional norms, further abetting Chinese continen-
tal supremacy.

The Biden Administration’s radical global climate policies have cut off billions
in investment to develop clean fossil fuels, denying Africa’s billion-plus people
access to cheap energy to further their own development and finance their own
social services in health, water, education, and agriculture, while increasing its
dependence on China’s renewables industry. It has exacerbated hunger by increas-
ing the costs of fertilizers to levels that many African farmers can no longer afford.
Poverty-inducing dependence on aid grows daily.

USAID efforts in Africa require a rethink. In 2025, USAID will update its five-
year Country Development and Cooperation Strategies. This will give the next
Administration an opportunity to pursue a new development course for Africa
that promotes economic self-reliance, catalyzes private-sector solutions for job
creation through increased trade and investment, terminates legacy and nonper-
forming programs, and supports diversified energy approaches. Critically, it must
hold China accountable for its extractive investments that violate international
labor, environmental, and anticorruption norms and practices; undercut business
opportunities for U.S. companies; and sabotage Africa’s development.

USAID, in collaboration with the U.S. International Development Finance
Corporation, U.S. Department of State, U.S. Department of the Treasury,
and U.S. Department of Commerce’s Foreign Commercial Service, should
use its convening power, diplomatic heft, and risk-reducing instruments
to facilitate U.S.–African business relationships and expand Prosper Africa,
launched by the Trump Administration to “bring[] together services from
across the U.S. Government to help companies and investors do business in
U.S. and African markets.”17

The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)18 provides Africa duty-
free access to U.S. markets. The next Administration should extend AGOA
beyond its 2025 term but within a strategic framework that rewards good
governance and pro–free market economic policies. There is no point in
wasting massive sums of aid to countries whose governments fail to keep
their promises to reform.

USAID should build on, not compete with, private-sector initiatives
launched by global churches, corporate philanthropists, and diaspora
groups that have already invested billions of dollars in self-reliance–
based projects.

Japan has committed $30 billion in aid to Africa over three years to stem China’s
economic and political grip on the continent. Gulf-based sovereign funds also are
investing billions in African energy, infrastructure, mining, water, food production,
information and communications technology, and other strategic industries. Other
allied donors are promoting investment-based aid. There is no lack of funding to
support Africa’s economic rise. What is lacking is strategic direction among U.S.
government foreign aid agencies.

PEPFAR has saved countless lives over the years and constitutes America’s most
successful aid program. During the Trump Administration, PEPFAR increased the
share of funding to local entities from about 20 percent to nearly 70 percent with commensurate improvements that have had lasting impact. The next Administration should extend that localization model to all global health and humanitarian
assistance in view of how local African entities have strengthened their capacity for
direct management of U.S. programs. Correspondingly, USAID should aggressively
ramp down its partnerships with wasteful, costly, and politicized U.N. agencies,
international NGOs, and Beltway contractors. All new programs in Africa should
build on existing local initiatives that enjoy the support of the African people.
