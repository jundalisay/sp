MISSION STATEMENT

OVERVIEW

The United States Intelligence Community (IC) is a vast, intricate bureaucracy
spread throughout 18 independent and Cabinet subagencies.1 According to the
Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), the IC’s mission is “to col-
lect, analyze, and deliver foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information
to America’s leaders so they can make sound decisions to protect our country.”2
An incoming conservative President needs to use these intelligence authorities
aggressively to anticipate and thwart our adversaries, including Russia, Iran, North
Korea, and especially China, while maintaining counterterrorism tools that have
demonstrated their effectiveness. This means empowering the right personnel
to manage, build, and effectively execute actions dispersed throughout the IC to
deliver intelligence in an ever-challenging world. It also means removing redun-
dancies, mission creep, and IC infighting that could prevent these collection tools
from providing objective, apolitical, and empirically backed intelligence to the IC’s
premier customer: the President of the United States.
Today, as Abraham Lincoln famously said, “The occasion is piled high with
difficulty, and we must rise with the occasion.... [W]e must think anew, and act

To arm a future incoming conservative President with the knowledge and tools
necessary to fortify the United States Intelligence Community; to defend against
all foreign enemies and ensure the security and prosperity of our sovereign nation,
devoid of all political motivations; and to maintain constitutional civil liberties.﻿

anew.”3 The Intelligence Community maintains an incredible capacity to achieve
its mission, but both the IC and the somewhat antiquated infrastructure that sup-
ports it often place too high a priority on yesterday’s threats and methodologies
instead of trying to identify possible future threats or the methodologies that
might be needed to combat them. The IC also often spends too much time over-
correcting for past mistakes. The unintended consequences include hesitancy,
groupthink, and an overly cautious approach that allows personal incentives to
drive preset courses.

The IC must be perceived as a depoliticized protector of America’s civil rights
and security. The American people are understandably frustrated by the fact that
those who abuse power are rarely held to account for their actions. This must
change, beginning with leadership that is both committed to ensuring that these
agencies faithfully execute the laws of the land under the Constitution and resolved
to punish and remove any officials who have abused the public trust.
The IC must also start to look forward, not backward. A concerted, disciplined,
leadership-led initiative must be undertaken to refocus and shift IC prioritization,
funding, and authorities to new and emerging threats, technologies, and methodol-
ogies if the United States is to prevail against its global adversaries.4 Unfortunately,
America’s major strategic threat is a nation-state peer and possibly ahead of the
U.S. in strategic areas. An incoming President must understand that today’s intel-
ligence competition could well require analyzing technologies the U.S. does not
have or compartmentalizing certain information as was done during the Cold
War because of intelligence penetration. A future President’s ability to drive the
resources needed to defeat another nation-state giant should therefore be the
focus of near-term IC reforms.

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE (ODNI)

The ODNI was established in the aftermath of the attacks on 9/11 and intelli-
gence failures leading up to the 2003 U.S. war in Iraq. The office and its functions
stem from authorities established under executive orders promulgated by
President George W. Bush in 2004, followed by statutory authorizations in the
Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA).5
Proponents of an ODNI hoped to establish reforms similar to the Goldwater–
Nichols Department of Defense (DOD) reforms of the 1980s, which identified
recurring problems within DOD’s command-and-control architecture and led to
unified Combatant Commands with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as
the senior ranking member of the armed forces and principal military adviser to
the President. The ODNI was envisioned as a small but powerful IC coordinating
agency led by a Director of National Intelligence (DNI). As the President’s principal
intelligence adviser, the DNI would lead and provide oversight of the President’s
intelligence authorities while wielding a cudgel—budget and appointment

Prior DNIs were the head of the IC only on paper and were routinely
accustomed to yielding IC actions and decisions to the preferences of the
CIA and other agencies. My ability to begin reversing that capitulation was
accomplished solely because President Trump made it repeatedly clear to the
entire national security apparatus that he expected all intelligence matters to
go through the DNI.9

authorities—to break institutional silos that had caused past intelligence inte-
gration failures.

Originally envisioned by the 9/11 Commission as a strengthened, authoritative
position, the final congressionally negotiated product signed by President Bush
has led to ambiguous and vague authorities that are dependent on who is selected
as DNI and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director and their level of support
from the White House and National Security Council (NSC). 9/11 Commission
Executive Director Philip Zelikow warned in a 2004 hearing that creating a new
agency “lacking any existing institutional base...would require authorities at least
as strong as those we have proposed or else it would create a bureaucratic fifth
wheel that would make the present situation even worse.”6 The ODNI has become
that bureaucratic fifth wheel about which Zelikow warned.

For example, under the Bush Administration’s initial legislative proposal, the
CIA Director would have been under the “authority, direction, and control” of the
DNI and no longer the head of an autonomous agency. Additional mechanisms
envisioned full budget authority for the DNI, including within DOD’s intelligence
components, as opposed to coordinating authority. Through arduous “sau-
sage-making” and relatively quick negotiations, lawmakers produced statutorily
vague authorities that traded away the DNI’s ability to direct budgetary authority
across the entire IC, including DOD, and left the CIA a subordinate but indepen-
dent agency with duties to report to the DNI without explicit directing authority.
These statutory developments were what led President Bush’s first choice to
serve as DNI, Robert Gates, to turn down the position. In discussions with the
White House over the post, Gates noted that the “legislation weakened the lead-
ership of the community” and that “instead of a stronger person, you ended up
with a weaker person because the DNI had no troops and no additional powers
really on the budget, hiring, and firing.”7 Gates noted that success would require
the President to “make explicit publicly that the DNI is head of the Intelligence
Community, not some budgeter or coordinator,” and that “[t]he position’s only
prayer of success is for the president to say plainly...how he sees the job. Without
his explicit mandate...the endeavor is doomed to fail.”8

One of the two DNIs confirmed by the Senate during the Trump Administra-
tion, John Ratcliffe, acknowledged that Gates’s theoretical concerns became the
practical reality that he inherited:﻿

To help further the legislative intent behind IRTPA, DNI Ratcliffe advised
during the transition of incoming Biden DNI Avril Haines that the DNI should
be the only Cabinet-level intelligence official.10 While his recommendation was
adopted and has corrected the previously allowed imbalance by making the DNI
the only Cabinet official and head of the IC at the table, the ODNI’s effectiveness
and direction leave much to be desired.

A conservative President must decide how to empower an individual to oversee
and manage the Intelligence Community effectively. To be successful, the DNI
and ODNI must be able to lead the IC and implement the President’s intelligence
priorities. This includes being able to exercise both budget and personnel authority
and being able to rely on timely, useful feedback from subordinate components of
the IC, many of which are located within other Cabinet agencies.
The ODNI needs to direct, not replicate in-house, the other IC agencies’ analytic,
operational, and management functions. Considerations like mismanagement
of human resources, joint-duty assignments, and accelerated growth in senior
personnel can cause a President to dictate to his incoming DNI a desire to slash
redundant positions and expenditures while simultaneously giving the DNI the
authority to drive necessary changes throughout the IC to deal with the nation’s
most compelling threats, including those emanating from China. As John Ratcliffe
has noted, “These are essential to the DNI having the abilities and authorities to
effectively direct, coordinate, and tackle the immense national security challenges
ahead for the Intelligence Community as intended under IRTPA.”11
Otherwise, other Cabinet and subordinate IC agencies will continue to regard
the ODNI as an annoyance and not as a positive contributor to the National Intel-
ligence Program (NIP) budget. They will continue to work around or circumvent
ODNI leadership decisions with appropriators and the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) or seek to wait out an Administration or DNI to prevent a policy or
intelligence priority from reaching fruition.

Intelligence and interagency coordination has improved significantly since
9/11. Nevertheless, interagency rivalries and festering issues continue to cause
duplication of effort on intelligence analysis and technology purchases as well as
overclassification and ever-increasing compartmentalization. Additional issues
include the abuse of mandated onboarding approval and reciprocity timelines by
some agencies, recruitment and retention failures, and a lack of will to remove
underperforming or timely adjudicate the misconduct of senior managers and
other employees.

Finally, future IC leadership must address the widely promoted “woke” cul-
ture that has spread throughout the federal government with identity politics and
“social justice” advocacy replacing such traditional American values as patriotism,
colorblindness, and even workplace competence.


### EXECUTIVE ORDER 12333

Address the threats to the United States and its allies in cyberspace.
These threats range from cyberwarfare to information operations. The
amended order should clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of
the various U.S. government cyber missions, including the recently created
National Cyber Director’s Office and power centers at the NSC, while
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of U.S. citizens.
Under the DNI’s direction, the cyber mission should explicitly identify
how information in the cyber domain will be shared promptly with the
warfighters, from law enforcement agencies to the broader IC and state,

IRTPA was passed in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks against the homeland. It
was intended to improve the sharing of information among the elements of the
IC, recognizing that the nature of the threats we now face blurs the lines between
foreign and domestic intelligence in detecting and countering national security
threats against the homeland. An equally important objective in passing the most
significant intelligence reform since the National Security Act of 194712 was cre-
ation of the position of DNI, charged with assuming two of the three principal roles
that formerly belonged to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI): serving as
principal intelligence adviser to the President and leading the IC as an enterprise.
Nearly two decades later, the DNI’s record of effectiveness in improving the
sharing of information and operating the IC as an enterprise is mixed. Implemen-
tation of the DNI’s roles as leader of the IC and principal intelligence adviser to
the President has been challenging. However, despite flaws in the legislation and
intelligence agencies’ bureaucratic jockeying that undermine the DNI, it is impos-
sible to know what would emerge if Congress were to revisit the act. Seeking a
legislative solution therefore might carry with it more risks than benefits. Instead,
an incoming conservative President’s immediate focus should be on modifying
Executive Order 12333, the President’s direction for implementing IRTPA.13
Executive Order 12333 was last amended on July 30, 2008, by President George
W. Bush.14 The revisions were aligned with IRTPA with significant emphasis on
having the IC address the threats to the homeland from international terrorism
and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. There is scant mention of
cyber threats and the evolving national security challenges posed by China, Russia,
and other U.S. adversaries. By extension, the revised order fell short of stipulat-
ing how the DNI would execute his authority to organize the IC in a manner that
improves the delivery of timely intelligence to a wide array of customers.
Executive Order 12333 should be amended to take account of the changing
landscape of threats and improve the functional aspects of America’s intelligence
enterprise. To that end, a revised order should:

local, and tribal elements. The order should consider stipulating what to
do with DOD cyber agencies, most notably the NSA, in terms of strategic
(for example, the President and the DNI) vs. tactical support (for example,
support for the warfighter) in conjunction with ongoing congressionally
mandated reviews of the future dual-hatted relationship.

Enhance the DNI’s role in overseeing execution of the National
Intelligence Program budget under the President’s authority. This
should be done in a manner that is consistent with Congress’s intent as
embodied in IRTPA. Under the executive order as written today, the DNI
“shall oversee and direct the implementation of the National Intelligence
Program.” In practice, the DNI’s authority to oversee execution of the IC’s
budget remains constrained by an inability to address changing intelligence
priorities and mandate the implementation of appropriated NIP funding to
higher intelligence priorities.

The DNI should have the President’s direction to address emerging but
catastrophic threats such as those posed by bioweapons. Clarifying how
much budget authority the DNI has in conjunction (within the limits of
congressional appropriations) with OMB and IC-member Cabinet officials
to move around money and personnel is crucial, but positions will not
always be fungible. It will probably be necessary to hold IC leadership
accountable at intransigent agencies and to restructure areas through
executive orders in close conjunction with OMB, as needed.

Clarify the DNI’s role as leader of the IC as an enterprise in building the
IC’s capabilities around its open-source collection and analytic missions.
The exponential growth in open-source information, often called OSINT, is not
disputed. In the IC, the use of publicly available information, notwithstanding
the authorities within IRTPA for the DNI to manage OSINT, remains
disaggregated. The explosion of private-sector intelligence products and
expertise should signal to IC leadership that duplicative efforts are unnecessary
and that limited resources should be focused on problematic collection tasks.
The IC should avoid duplication of what is already being done well in
the private sector and focus instead on complex questions that cannot
be answered by conventional and frequently increasing numbers of
commercial tools and capabilities. If necessary, for lack of results from the
National Open Source Committee, the DNI should appoint the Principal
Deputy Director of National Intelligence (PDDNI) as chairman to prioritize
and promote accountability for the IC’s 18 agencies toward this effort.


Prioritize security clearance reform. Security clearance reform has
made significant progress under Trusted Workforce 2.0, a governmentwide
background investigation reform that was implemented beginning in 2018
with the goal of creating one system with reciprocity across organizations.
This included allowing movement from periodic reinvestigations toward
a Continuous Vetting (CV) program with automated records checks,
adjudication of flags, the “mitigat[ion of ] personnel security situations
before they become a larger problem,” or the suspension or revocation of
clearances.15 However, human resources onboarding operations in major
agencies such as the CIA, FBI, and NSA remain to be resolved.

Ensure the DNI’s authority. The DNI’s authority should be similar to an
orchestra conductor’s. An incoming conservative President will appoint
whomever he chooses as DNI, but there should be agreement between the
incoming DNI and President with advice and counsel from the Presidential
Personnel Office on selecting positions overseen by the DNI throughout
subordinate agencies, as well as concurrence by relevant Cabinet officials
and the CIA. This exists by executive order, but many Presidents, PPOs, and
Cabinet agency heads do not follow executive order guidance and necessary
norms. The importance of trust, character, and the ability to work together
to achieve a joint set of intelligence goals established by the President
cannot be overstated: It is a mission that can be accomplished only with the
conductor and his orchestra playing in sync.

Provide additional support for such economic and supply chainfocused agencies as the Department of Commerce. Information sharing
and feedback can help subagencies like the Commerce Department’s
Bureau of Industry and Security to improve their understanding of the

As executive agent for security clearances, the DNI must require results
from agencies that resist implementation, enforce the 48-hour reciprocity
guidance, and target human resources operations that fail to attract and
expediently onboard qualified personnel. Additional “carrots and sticks”
from executive order reform language, including moving the Security
Services Directorate from NCSC to ODNI with elevated status, may be
necessary. It is unacceptable for agencies to hinder opportunities for cross-
agency assignments, use public–private partnerships inefficiently because
of constraints on the transferability of security clearances, and lose future
talent because of extraordinary delays in backend operations. Proper vetting
to speed the onboarding of personnel with much-needed expertise is vital to
the IC’s future.

threat from China and thereby counter it more effectively. They can also
aid the development of export control mechanisms and potential outbound
investment screening where necessary. Brief, specific governance language
should be considered that would apply counterterrorist authority models to
the broader functions of the U.S. government insofar as they are needed to
counter 21st century nation-state threats.
The success of any DNI rests with support from the President. Any revised
Executive Order 12333 must serve to express unequivocal support for the DNI in
executing the mandates that an amended order would provide.
