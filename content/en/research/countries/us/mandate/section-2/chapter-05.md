### PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) be combined with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS); the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR); and the Department of Justice (DOJ) Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and Office of Immigration Litigation (OIL) into a stand- alone border and immigration agency at the Cabinet level (more than 100,000 employees, making it the third largest department measured by manpower).

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) be moved to the Department of Transportation.

Our primary recommendation is that the President pursue legislation to dismantle the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). After 20 years, it has not gelled into “One DHS.” 

Instead, its various components’ different missions have outweighed its decades-long attempt to function as one department, rendering
the whole disjointed rather than cohesive. Breaking up the department along its mission lines would facilitate mission focus and provide opportunities to reduce overhead and achieve more limited government. In lieu of a status quo DHS, we
recommend that:

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) be moved to the
Department of the Interior or, if combined with CISA, to the Department of
Transportation.

The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) be moved to DOJ and, in time of full-scale
war (i.e., threatening the homeland), to the Department of Defense (DOD).
Alternatively, USCG should be moved to DOD for all purposes.
The U.S. Secret Service (USSS) be divided in two, with the protective
element moved to DOJ and the financial enforcement element moved to the
Department of the Treasury.

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) be privatized.
The Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) be moved to DOD and the
Office of Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction be moved to the FBI.
All of the remaining supporting components could be dismantled because
their functions already exist in the moving components as well as the receiv-
ing departments. Cutting these costs would save the American taxpayers
significant sums.

Unless and until this dismantling recommendation is pursued and achieved,
however, DHS will statutorily continue to exist, and it needs many reforms. Accord-
ingly, we now turn to recommended changes in DHS as it exists now.


### MISSION STATEMENT

The Department of Homeland Security protects the American homeland from
and prepares for terrorism and other hazards in both the physical and cyber realms,
provides for secure and free movement of trade and travel, and enforces U.S. immi-
gration laws impartially.


### OVERVIEW

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and subsequent mailings of anthrax spores. The Homeland Security Act of 2002,1 which created the department, states that DHS’s primary mission is to prevent terrorist attacks within the U.S.; reduce the nation’s vulnerability to terrorism; minimize the damage from and assist in the recovery from any terrorist attacks; prepare and respond to natural and manmade crises and emergencies; and monitor connections between illegal drug trafficking and terrorism, coordinate efforts to sever such connections, and interdict illegal drug trafficking.

lSecure and control the border;
lThoroughly enforce immigration laws;

Correctly and efficiently adjudicate immigration benefit applications while
rejecting fraudulent claims;
Secure the cyber domain and collaborate with critical infrastructure sectors
to maintain their security;
Provide states and localities with a limited federal emergency response and
preparedness;

Unfortunately for our nation, the federal government’s newest department
became like every other federal agency: bloated, bureaucratic, and expensive. It also
lost sight of its mission priorities. DHS has also suffered from the Left’s wokeness and
weaponization against Americans whom the Left perceives as its political opponents.
To truly secure the homeland, a conservative Administration needs to return
the department to the right mission, the right size, and the right budget. This would
include reorganizing the department and shifting significant resources away from
several supporting components to the essential operational components. 

Prioritizing border security and immigration enforcement, including detention and
deportation, is critical if we are to regain control of the border, repair the historic
damage done by the Biden Administration, return to a lawful and orderly immi-
gration system, and protect the homeland from terrorism and public safety threats.
This also includes consolidating the pieces of the fragmented immigration system
into one agency to fulfill the mission more efficiently.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is a DHS com-
ponent that the Left has weaponized to censor speech and affect elections at the
expense of securing the cyber domain and critical infrastructure, which are threat-
ened daily.2 A conservative Administration should return CISA to its statutory and
important but narrow mission.

The bloated DHS bureaucracy and budget, along with the wrong priorities,
provide real opportunities for a conservative Administration to cut billions in
spending and limit government’s role in Americans’ lives. These opportunities
include privatizing TSA screening and the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) National Flood Insurance Program, reforming FEMA emergency
spending to shift the majority of preparedness and response costs to states and
localities instead of the federal government, eliminating most of DHS’s grant pro-
grams, and removing all unions in the department for national security purposes.
A successful DHS would:

Secure our coasts and economic zones;
Protect political leaders, their families, and visiting heads of state or
government; and
Oversee transportation security.


### OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY (SEC)

In the next Administration, the Office of the Secretary should take on the fol- lowing key issues and challenges to ensure the effective operation of DHS. Expansion of Dedicated Political Personnel. The Secretary of Homeland Security is a presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed political appointee, but for budgetary reasons, he or she has historically been unable to fund a dedi- cated team of political appointees. A key first step for the Secretary to improve front-office functions is to have his or her own dedicated team of political appoin- tees selected and vetted by the Office of Presidential Personnel, which is not reliant on detailees from other parts of the department, to help ensure the completion of the next President’s agenda.

An Aggressive Approach to Senate-Confirmed Leadership Positions.

While Senate confirmation is a constitutionally necessary requirement for appointing agency leadership, the next Administration may need to take a novel approach to the confirmations process to ensure an adequate and rapid transition. For example, the next Administration arguably should place its nominees for key positions into similar positions as “actings” (for example, putting in a person to serve as the Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Commissioner of CBP while that person is going through the confirmation process to direct ICE or become the Secretary). This approach would both guarantee implementation of the Day One agenda and equip the department for potential emergency situations while still honoring the confirmation requirement. The department should also look to remove lower-level but nevertheless important positions that currently require Senate confirmation from the confirmation requirement, although this effort would require legislation (and might also be mooted in the event of legisla- tion that closes portions of the department that currently have Senate-confirmed leadership).

Clearer, More Durable, and Political-Only Line of Succession. Based on previous experience, the department needs legislation to establish a more durable but politically oriented line of succession for agency decision-making purposes. The ideal sequence for line of succession is certainly debatable, except that in cir- cumstances where a career employee holds a leadership position in the department, that position should be deemed vacant for line-of-succession purposes and the next eligible political appointee in the sequence should assume acting authority. Further, individuals wielding acting Secretary authority should have explicit authority to finalize agency actions, including regulations, to ensure that the department’s homeland security mission is fulfilled.

Certification by applicants that they comply with all aspects of federal
immigration laws, including the honoring of all immigration detainers.
Certification by applicants that they are both registered with E-Verify
and using E-Verify in a transparent and nonevasive manner. For states and localities, that would include certification that all components of that government, and not just the applicant agency, are registered with and
use E-Verify.

Soft Closure of Unnecessary Offices. Pending a possible presidential deci-
sion to shrink or eliminate DHS itself, the next Administration will still have the
obligation to protect the homeland as required by law. The Secretary therefore
can and should use his or her inherent, discretionary leadership authority to “soft
close” ineffective and problematic corners of the department. While those corners
are to be determined, the Secretary could shift personnel, funding, and opera-
tional responsibility to mission-essential components of the department, including
the Office of the Secretary itself. This effort not only would make the department
more efficient, but also would support a legislative move to shrink or dismantle
the department by showing that the agency can fulfill national security–critical
functions without its current bloated bureaucracy.

Restructuring and Redistribution of Career Personnel. To strengthen
political decision-making and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used legally
and efficiently, the Secretary should make major changes in the distribution of
career personnel throughout the department. For example, personnel from parts
of the department undergoing soft closure could be redistributed to what will be
workload-intensive corners of the department, including national security–critical
and transparency functions. All personnel with law enforcement capacity should
be removed immediately from office billets and deployed to field billets to maxi-
mize law enforcement capacity.

Compliance for Grants and Other Federal Funding. The next Adminis-
tration should take steps to restore lawfulness and integrity to the department’s
massive regimen of federal grant programs, most of which are managed and dis-
tributed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The Secretary should
direct FEMA to ensure that all FEMA-issued grant funding for states, localities,
and private organizations is going to recipients who are lawful actors, can demon-
strate that they are in compliance with federal law, and can show that their mission
and actions support the broader homeland security mission. All applicants and
potential recipients of such grant funding should be required to meet certain pre-
conditions for eligibility (except for receipt of post-disaster or nonhumanitarian
funding) or should simply be considered ineligible for funding. Such preconditions
should include at least the following:



If the applicant is a state or locality, commitment by that state or locality to
total information-sharing in the context of both federal law enforcement
and immigration enforcement. This would include access to department of
motor vehicles and voter registration databases.
Non-Use of Discretionary Guest Worker Visa Authorities. To stop facili-
tating the availability of cheap foreign labor in order to support American workers
(particularly poor and middle-class American workers) and follow congressional
intent, the Secretary should explicitly cease using at least two discretionary author-
ities as part of his or her broader effort to support American workers.

The Secretary should make it clear that he or she will not use the Secretary’s
existing discretionary authority to increase the number of H-2B (seasonal
non-agricultural) visas above the statutorily set cap.
The Secretary should not issue any regulations in support of the “H-2
eligible” country list, the effect of which would prevent favoring certain
foreign nationals seeking an H-2 guest worker visa based simply on their
nationality.

Restoration of Honesty and Transparency. The Secretary should use his or
her inherent authority as leader of the department to follow up with congressional
and other partners to disclose information and provide the transparency that has
been obstructed during the Biden Administration. The Secretary should proceed
from the assumption that congressional inquiries and public information requests
were unfulfilled and then seek to fulfill them.
Replacement of the Entire Homeland Security Advisory Committee. The
Secretary should plan to quickly remove all current members of the Homeland
Security Advisory Committee and replace them as quickly as is feasible.
