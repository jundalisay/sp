FISA is important in  seeking reforms and accountability for any abuses of its authorities. When discussing
FISA and what changes may need to be made, it is important to note and recognize
that there are stark differences among the individual FISA authorities.
Section 702 of FISA, for example, allows the IC to target foreign terrorists, spies,
cyber hackers, and other bad actors (but only if they are non-U.S. persons) when
their communications pass through the United States. While this authority may
lapse if Congress does not resolve the issue by the end of 2023, Section 702 should
be understood as an essential tool in the fight against terrorism, malicious cyber
actors, and Chinese espionage.

These are two major national security priorities
for an incoming President, and it is imperative that the need to use properly main-
tained and accountable authorities to counter these challenges be recognized.
Section 702 is a vital program that often provides the lion’s share of intelligence
used in the President’s Daily Brief (PDB).27 An independent review by the Privacy
and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) found that it was not abused. Nev-
ertheless, Congress should review the PCLOB’s upcoming 2023 report to help it
determine whether any reforms or codification of recent administrative changes
in FISA processes are needed.

Other authorities in Title I and Title III, often referred to as “traditional” FISA,
have elicited valid concerns about the politicization of intelligence collection
authority in recent years. When seeking surveillance of Trump campaign adviser
Carter Page, for example, the FBI and the Department of Justice concealed vital
information from a specialized court and submitted applications that were riddled
with errors. An incoming conservative President should consider reforms designed
to prevent future partisan abuses of national security authority. A package of strong
provisions to protect against such partisanship might include:

Stiffer penalties and mandatory investigations when intelligence leaks are
aimed at domestic political targets,
Tighter controls on otherwise lawful intercepts that also collect the
communications of domestic political figures,
An express prohibition on politically motivated use of intelligence
authorities, and
Reforms to improve the accountability of the Justice Department and the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
﻿
To keep intelligence credentials from being used for partisan purposes, former
high-ranking intelligence officials who retain a clearance should remain subject to
the Hatch Act after they leave government to deter them from tying their political
stands or activism to their continuing privilege of access to classified government
information. The IC should be prohibited from monitoring so-called domestic
disinformation. Such activity can easily slip into suppression of an opposition
party’s speech, is corrosive of First Amendment protections, and raises questions
about impartiality when the IC chooses not to act.
CHINA-FOCUSED CHANGES, REFORMS, AND RESOURCES
The term “whole of government” is all too frequently overused, but in
responding to the generational threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party,
that is exactly the approach that our national security apparatus should adopt.
CIA Director William Burns has formally established a China Mission Center
focused on these efforts, but it can be successful only if it is given the necessary
personnel, cross-community collaboration, and resources. That is uncertain at
this point, and just how seriously the organization is taking the staffing of the
center is unclear.

A critical strategic question for an incoming Administration and IC lead-
ers will be: How, when, and with whom do we share our classified intelligence?
Understanding when to pass things to liaisons and for what purpose will be vital
to outmaneuvering China in the intelligence sphere. Questions for a President
will include:

What is our overarching conception of the adversarial relationship and
competition?
How does intelligence-sharing fit into that conception?

Some Members of Congress have said that intelligence relationships such as
the Five Eyes28 should be expanded to include other allies in the Asia–Pacific in, for
example, a “Nine Eyes” framework. This fails to take into account the fact that any
blanket expansion would necessarily involve protecting the sources and methods of
a larger and quite possibly more diverse group of member countries that might or
might not have congruent interests. That being said, however, a future conservative
President should consider what resources and information-sharing relationships
could be included in an ad hoc or quasi-formal intelligence expansion (for example,
with the Quad) among nations trying to counter the threat from China.
Significant technology, language skills, and financial intelligence resources
are needed to counter China’s capabilities.29 The IC was caught flat-footed by the
recent discovery of China’s successful test of a nuclear-capable hypersonic missile.
No longer can America’s information and technological dominance be assumed.
China’s gains and intense focus on emerging technologies have taken it in some
areas from being a near-peer competitor to probably being ahead of the United
States. China’s centralized government allocates endless resources (sometimes
inefficiently) to its strategic “Made in China 2025” and military apparatuses, which
combine government, military, and private-sector activities on quantum infor-
mation sciences and technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning,
biotechnologies, and advanced robotics.

The IC must do more than understand these advancements: It must rally non-
government and allied partners and inspire unified action to counter them. In
addition, to combat China’s economic espionage, authorities and loopholes in the
Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA)30 will have to be examined and addressed
in conjunction with the Attorney General.

Many issues within the broader government can be tied back to a more general
congressional understanding of the threat due to the compartmentalization of
committee jurisdictions and the responsibilities of executive agencies to brief on
the nature of the threat. Broader committee jurisdictions should receive additional
intelligence from IC agencies as necessary to inform China’s unique and more com-
prehensive threat across layers of the U.S. government bureaucracy and economy.
Former DNI John Ratcliffe increased the intelligence budget as it related to
China by 20 percent. “When people ask me why I did that,” he explained in an
interview, “I say, ‘Because no one would let me increase it by 40%.’ I had an $85
billion combined annual budget for both the national intelligence program and
military intelligence program. My perspective was, ‘Whatever we’re spending on
countering China, it isn’t enough.’”31 From an intelligence standpoint, the need
to understand Chinese motivations, capabilities, and intent will be of paramount
importance to a future conservative President. It is therefore also of paramount
importance that the “whole of government” be rowing together.


### NATIONAL COUNTERINTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY CENTER (NCSC)

The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) has taken a keen inter-
est in possibly updating the codified language underpinning much of the nation’s
counterintelligence apparatus. “Spy vs. spy” threats continue to exist, but the rise
of China and (to an extent) Russia’s machinations move beyond the governmental
sphere to technological, economic, supply chain, cyber, academic, state, and local
espionage threats at a level our country has never seen. The asymmetric threat
includes cyber, nontraditional collection, and issues involving legitimate busi-
nesses serving as collection platforms.

Barring statutory changes that could occur before 2025, a future conserva-
tive President should further empower and resource the IC by executive order or
through suggested changes in the Counterintelligence Enhancement Act (CEA)
of 2002.32 NCSC was given some authority for outreach efforts on behalf of the IC
for counterintelligence education, insider threats, and broader U.S. government
best practices, but there remain significant deltas between Title 50 and non–Title
50 entities’ protections. Primary operational elements should remain at the FBI
and CIA, with the Bureau and NCSC collaborating on nongovernmental outreach.
While there is no need to create a separate agency, a future President and DNI
should amplify NCSC’s authorities and roles with respect to counterintelligence
strategy, policy, outreach, and governance, including supporting necessary Joint
Duty Assignments (JDA) for FBI and CIA personnel. At the same time, the FBI
requires significant additional resources and legal authorities to fulfill its statu-
tory role as the lead operational counterintelligence agency in dealing with the
ever-growing threats posed by our adversaries. The CEA should be updated to
include foreign espionage efforts aimed at universities.

Corporate America, technology companies, research institutions, and academia
must be willing, educated partners in this generational fight to protect our national
security interests, economic interests, national sovereignty, and intellectual prop-
erty as well as the broader rules-based order—all while avoiding the tendency
to cave to the left-wing activists and investors who ignore the China threat and
increasingly dominate the corporate world. Reinstitution of the National Security
Higher Education Advisory Board and the National Security Business Alliance
Council should be prioritized with leadership from the NCSC, the FBI, or a com-
bination of both entities.

When the CCP steals at least $400 billion–$600 billion in intellectual prop-
erty each year, it is time to devote some strategic thinking to exactly how and to
what degree counterintelligence efforts can help to protect America’s commercial
endeavors. If Chinese strategic technology gains are happening almost entirely in
transnational commercial space, for example, and the private sector is also gath-
ering and analyzing some critical intelligence, these essential data points should
assist in national-level counterintelligence efforts.

The NCSC was created in the aftermath of 9/11 as the Terrorist Threat Integra-
tion Center (TTIC), which later became the National Counterterrorism Center
(NCTC) pursuant to President George W. Bush’s Executive Order 13354.33 The
NCTC was an organization of approximately three dozen detainees from across
the U.S. government with a mandate to integrate counterterrorism intelligence
and missions, including terrorist screening. Eventually:
In November 2014 the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) established
NCSC by combining [the Office of the National Counterintelligence
Executive] with the Center for Security Evaluation, the Special Security
Center and the National Insider Threat Task Force, to effectively integrate
and align counterintelligence and security mission areas under a single
organizational construct. The Director of NCSC serves in support of the DNI’s
role as Security Executive Agent (SecEA) to develop, implement, oversee and
integrate personnel security initiatives throughout the U.S. Government.34
