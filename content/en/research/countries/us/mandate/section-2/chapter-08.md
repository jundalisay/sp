### MISSION STATEMENT

The mission of United States Agency for Global Media (USAGM) is to inform,
engage, and connect people around the world in support of freedom and democ-
racy.1 However, this mission statement does not reflect the current work of the
agency. The mission is noble, but the execution is lacking. To fulfill its mission,
USAGM should also aim to present the truth about America and American policy—
not parrot America’s adversaries’ propaganda and talking points.2


### OVERVIEW

Originally formed as the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) in 1994, the BBG
changed its name in 2018 to the United States Agency for Global Media. The USAGM is
a sub-Cabinet agency of the U.S. government with a budget of just under $1 billion. The
agency oversees two government broadcasting networks: the Voice of America (VOA)
and the Office of Cuba Broadcasting (OCB). USAGM also oversees 100 percent of the
grant funding for several “independent” grantee organizations, including the Middle
East Broadcasting Network (MBN), Radio Free Asia (RFA), Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty (RFE/RL), and the newly formed Open Technology Fund (OTF).3

The Voice of America provides news and information in 48 languages to
a weekly audience of more than 326 million people worldwide. For more than 80 years, VOA journalists have supplied news and information about
the U.S., audience-specific regions of interest and concern, and the world at
large. VOA radio and television signals are broadcast to approximately 3,500
affiliates, and satellite transmissions reach countries where free speech is
banned or where civil society is under threat.4

VOA uses digital, web, and mobile media as well, which, while sometimes
useful in propagating valuable information globally, has created specific
violations of the agency’s prohibition against broadcasting to the domestic
U.S. audience—particularly with regard to flagrantly political content, as
has been the practice with recent and current VOA content directors and
managers.5 The network once had a generally well-received brand value,
but it has deteriorated under decades of poor leadership and a loss of its
once-prized unbiased reporting. There are bright spots within VOA, but
mismanagement and declining production values have diluted its once-
great reputation as a singular voice in American news broadcasting abroad.


The Office of Cuba Broadcasting oversees Radio and Television Martí, a
multimedia hub of news, information, and analysis that provides the people
of Cuba with programs through satellite television, radio, and digital media.
These programs present news and information about Cuba’s oppressive
government from the outside world that would otherwise be heavily
restricted.6 The OCB remains a critical avenue of truth to the Cuban people
but has been threatened with crippling budget and operational constraints,
including empathetic attitudes toward Communist Cuban leadership
coupled with organizational hostility toward the OCB by certain elements
of USAGM leadership. During the Biden Administration, the OCB has been
threatened with closure, while also suffering chilling reductions in force.7
The Middle East Broadcasting Network is an Arabic-language news
organization with a weekly audience of 27.4 million people in 22 countries
in the Middle East and North Africa. The MBN consists of two television
networks, radio, websites, and social media platforms. Together, they deliver
news and analysis on the region, American policies, and Americana. The
MBN has correspondents throughout the Middle East and North Africa.8
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is a private, nonprofit, multimedia
broadcasting corporation that serves as a surrogate media source in 27
languages and 23 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Russia,
and Ukraine.


Founded in the early days of the Cold War (Radio Free Europe in 1949
and Radio Liberty in 1953) and merged in 1976, Radio Free Europe and
Radio Liberty were intended to execute edgy and daring information
operations and unrestricted news reporting deep behind the Iron Curtain.
Unfortunately, like other broadcast organizations under USAGM, RFE/RL
has surrendered much of its rich history to an approach that favors political
trends as opposed to operations that support and represent America abroad.
While there are some bright spots within RFE/RL, much of the network has
redundant programming with certain VOA language services, often with
competing, counterproductive, or dissimilar messaging.
The recent addition of RFE/RL’s Hungarian-language service, Szabad
Európa, falls outside the intended scope of RFE/RL’s charter by targeting a
democratically elected, pro-American European and NATO ally.
Not least, RFE/RL has been plagued by several serious espionage-related
security risks within its ranks.9

Several reports from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) were released
showing waste and self-dealing, including security vulnerabilities and RFA lead-
ership awarding insiders millions of dollars of grant funding.11 For example, as
the OIG stated in one report, the then-president of RFA “established the Free-
dom2Connect Foundation (Foundation)” and thereafter “awarded two contracts,
totaling $1.2 million” to the foundation she herself founded.12

Furthermore:
[The] OIG found that RFA did not comply with Federal procurement
requirements for grantees. OIG identified instances in which RFA and
its agents did not comply with OMB [Office of Management and Budget]
conflict-of-interest procurement requirements for grantees. Specifically,
OIG found that RFA entered into 14 contracts, totaling $4.0 million
(51 percent of the amount of OTF FYs 2012 and 2013 project-related
contracts), with organizations that had some affiliation with either RFA
officials or members of OTF Advisory Council.13

Radio Free Asia is a private, nonprofit multimedia news corporation that
brings news and uncensored content to people in six Asian countries that
restrict free speech, freedom of the press, and access to reliable information.
RFA also provides educational and cultural programming, as well as forums
for audiences to engage in open dialogue and freely express opinions. RFA
utilizes on-the-ground reporters and networks of in-country sources, citizen
journalists, and eyewitnesses who provide leads, tips, images, and video.10
This same leadership proceeded to wastefully form the Open Technology
Fund as its own independent grantee with the help of USAGM senior
management prior to the tenure of Trump-appointed leadership.

The Open Technology Fund’s goal is to provide funding to support
the research, development, and implementation of Internet freedom
technologies that circumvent censorship. OTF was formed under dubious
circumstances by using consolidation rules to usurp the mission and
funding of USAGM’s pre-existing Office of Internet Freedom (OIF), which
funded far more diverse technologies with much greater transparency. OTF,
however, operates with far less transparency and strictly restricts funding to
“open source” technology. OTF does not support any technology with even
partially “closed source” code, notwithstanding that such closed-source
code would provide more protection against hacking.

Although OTF touts large user numbers, this could not be substantiated
upon requests for information, and it was discovered by former senior
USAGM leadership that OTF makes extremely small, insubstantial
donations to much larger messaging applications and technology to bolster
its unsubstantiated claims.14 Despite its vibrant self-lobbying and publicity
efforts, OTF remains a wasteful and redundant boondoggle. Its grantee
status was suspended by Trump-appointed USAGM leadership for a number
of reasons, including noncompliance with its grant terms and for actions
that resulted in several fraud and waste investigations.15

The OIF, which predates OTF, was historically under USAGM’s Office of
Chief Strategy Officer and for years had been performing the same tasks as
OTF within USAGM headquarters for the benefit of all USAGM broadcast
networks. With much greater transparency, OIF succeeded with fewer staff
while simultaneously fielding more diverse and robust technologies. Absent
a meaningful organizational impact analysis to justify the wastefulness of
the decision-making process, OTF usurped the entire OIF budget and was
set up as a new grantee organization.

Exacerbating matters, OIF was shut down in order to provide massive
grants to the opaque activities of OTF and its founding leadership, who went
on a free-spending boondoggle for high-end Washington, D.C., office space,
furnishings, and top salaries for its leadership team. Numerous career staff
whistleblowers came forward to sound the alarm about OTF to Trump-
appointed leadership, citing concerns about the OIG reports, wasteful
spending, and other substantive performance matters.16 Nonetheless, the
— 238 —Media Agencies: U.S. Agency for Global Media
Biden Administration reinstated OTF to full operational status and ceased
all investigations immediately after assuming office.

Late in the Trump Administration, following the long-delayed Senate confirma-
tion of Michael Pack as USAGM Chief Executive Officer (CEO),17 agency leadership
rapidly initiated long-overdue and necessary reforms,18 including security reforms
repeatedly requested by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Office
of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) that had been ignored by USAGM
leadership.19 Unfortunately, as was the case with the OTF, the Biden Administration
immediately reinstated personnel who had been fired for gross security violations,
placing the agency back into its previously failed posture—one that poses a danger
to national security.
