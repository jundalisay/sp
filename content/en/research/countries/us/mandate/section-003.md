FAILING TO MEET THE CHINA CHALLENGE

These days, to get whatever expansion of government one wants or to jus-
tify a new government activity, one has only to declare that more government
intervention is needed to help fight China. President Trump used this argument
to secure reauthorization of EXIM in 2019. Today, President Biden argues that the Bank could be a powerful weapon in the government’s geoeconomic arsenal against China.

The rationale is that this will prevent China from dominating the global market
with its subsidies and will boost American jobs and manufacturing. The prob-
lem is that cynics who support such policies make no effort to adopt a serious
strategic plan to achieve this goal. For instance, how can EXIM help us to fight
China while state-owned Chinese companies like China Air have been some of the
companies most subsidized by EXIM?28 Furthermore, it has now been four years
since Congress instructed EXIM to focus on China, but there has been no funda-
mental change in the way EXIM operates or the companies to which it extends
taxpayer-backed financing: Deals related to the aircraft industry still dominate
the Bank’s portfolio.

In addition, there is no evidence that EXIM has altered its intense focus on
competing with other governments’ ECAs. If the Bank were serious about com-
peting against China, it would be targeting the low-income markets where China

Top [Chinese] officials are discussing ways to move away from costly
subsidies that have so far borne little fruit and encouraged both graft and
American sanctions, people familiar with the matter said. While some
continue to push for incentives of as much as 1 trillion yuan ($US145 billion),
other policymakers have lost their taste for an investment-led approach that’s
not yielded the results anticipated, the people said.33
This development is not surprising to those who understand basic economics.
The goal of using EXIM as a weapon against China was a bad idea in the first place.
Even if it were a good idea, for it to succeed would have required that EXIM stop
serving the clients it has been serving for decades. That has not happened, and it
will not happen.

CONCLUSION

The Export–Import Bank should be abolished because it wastes taxpayer money,
adversely affects American businesses, and does not promote economic growth has been making its most important investments. Instead, its obsession with other
ECAs has caused EXIM to direct the vast majority of its funding to large foreign
companies in higher-income nations. Data available on the OECD website show
that the level of ECA financing in high-income countries in 2019 was more than
double the amount in low-income countries.29 The same was true for previous years.
In other words, EXIM and the ECAs of the OECD are competing in markets where
commercial lending is abundant—a trend that continues today.

The failure to deliver on its congressionally imposed obligation—however mis-
guided that obligation may be—is also noticeable in the fact that EXIM’s China
and Transformation Exports Program (CTEP) extended only $141.3 million in
financing in FY 2022—a fraction of the $27 billion it is supposed to deliver by the
end of 2026.30 The Bank’s efforts have also included a misplaced focus on emerging
technologies such as quantum computing and artificial intelligence, which do not
need EXIM financing because their foreign sales attract commercial financing
without government support. The lack of demand for EXIM products could also
be reflected in the Bank’s authorization of $5.2 billion in loan guarantees and sup-
port in FY 2022,31 down from its FY 2012 peak of “over $35.7 billion” during the
Obama Administration.32

This lack of activity also extends to the semiconductor industry, which has been
picked as a focal point for a governmentwide industrial policy effort to counter
China’s ambition to dominate that industry. Ironically, at the same time that some
want to become more like China to fight China, China’s leaders are realizing that
their heavy-handed semiconductor subsidies are weakening the Chinese economy.
According to Bloomberg News:

effectively. Furthermore, any attempts to reorient the agency and make it a weapon
with which to fight against China are going to fail. Economic fights and national
security fights are not won with subsidies.

THE CASE FOR THE EXPORT–IMPORT BANK
Jennifer Hazelton

In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a bill extending the charter of the
Export–Import Bank (EXIM) by an additional six years. In a signing statement
attached to the bill, the President declared that “[t]his sends an important signal
to both our exporting community and foreign suppliers that American exporters
will continue to be able to compete vigorously for business throughout the world.”34
As a candidate for President, Ronald Reagan was opposed to EXIM, but as Pres-
ident, he learned the challenges America’s businesses face when competing for
opportunities overseas, and his position on EXIM evolved. As President Reagan
once famously remarked, “Why would I want our businesses competing with two
hands tied behind their backs?” On January 30, 1984, the President said, “Exports
create and sustain jobs for millions of American workers and contribute to the
growth and strength of the United States economy. The Export–Import Bank con-
tributes in a significant way to our nation’s export sales.”
President Reagan was exactly right. EXIM provides a mechanism that American
companies can use to vie for projects that would otherwise be out of reach, notably
deals that the banking industry won’t finance because of the risk associated with
the host country or because the host nation itself requires a sovereign guarantee
in order to submit a bid. EXIM is the only American vehicle that can provide that
sovereign guarantee.

Since Reagan’s presidency, the global economic order has shifted dramatically,
and a rising China has completely disrupted the export credit sector.

In Reagan’s era, export credit financing was a means for nations to compete
for and win projects overseas in order to create more jobs at home. It was a
benign tool for economic expansion. China, however, has morphed export
credit financing into a weapon of national security.
Where most nations have just one export credit agency (ECA), China
has three, all targeted for specific stages of economic and industrial
development. The amount of money China has put behind these three
instruments is staggering.
It is estimated that in 2018, China provided more than $500 billion in export
credit, approaching in that one year the total amount of financing EXIM has
provided in its 90-year history.

China’s export credit activity is greater than that of the ECAs of the
entire G7 combined. Today, China is the world’s largest official creditor,
maintaining a portfolio more than twice the size of the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund combined.
China’s highly aggressive Belt and Road Initiative, which has prompted
international criticism for ensnaring the developing world in “debt-trap
diplomacy,” has created a sphere of economic and strategic influence that
includes about 150 countries, rivaling the relationships of the United States
and her allies.

Unlike America and the G7 economies, China does not subscribe to the rules-
based order that has governed export credit financing for nearly a century. As in
so many other things, China plays by its own rules and is opaque in how it operates,
weaponizing its export credit financing deals by offering developing nations terms
that are often “too good to be true.” Once the project is underway, the Chinese have
been known to change the terms, making a project unaffordable for the purchasing
country. These tactics have yielded China important strategic plunder like mines
and critical minerals, satellites, and even ports like those in Hambantota, Sri Lanka,
and Mombasa, Kenya.

Export credit is a strategic weapon in China’s whole-of-government approach
to enhance its global power, economic might, and national security. The only
country that has the economic heft to counter China’s aggressions in export credit
financing is the United States. Not only do American companies risk losing out to
Chinese competitors for international opportunities if EXIM is not there to offer
support, but a United States without a functioning export credit agency also leaves
an unchecked China with a wide-open field to claim jurisdiction over swaths of
ocean and shipping lanes, expand its economic influence, and create major changes
in the global balance of power.

In response to Chinese aggression in export credit, the ECAs of other coun-
tries have reacted defensively to change their policies and programs to avoid
losing access to large chunks of global markets. Many countries, including strong
U.S. allies like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and Italy, have changed the
mission of their ECAs from one of leveling the playing field for their exporters
to hunting proactively for transactions for their businesses and advancing their
national strategic interests over the long term. In addition, foreign buyers, par-
ticularly those looking to build large international projects, have been indicating
that the availability of government-backed financing is a core component of their
evaluation of bids and identification of sourcing. Allied nations have taken steps
like lowering their content requirements in order to lure more deals, often at
U.S. expense.

Meanwhile, U.S. content requirements have remained constant, and the United
States continues to abide by traditional Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) rules. For example:

The United Kingdom offered Boeing financing backed by Britain’s ECA if
Boeing would put Rolls Royce engines on its jets instead of GE engines.
Italy’s ECA offered General Electric export credit financing in exchange for
moving the production of some of its turbine components from the United
States to Italy.

China’s tactics, as well as those of some of America’s allies, have been success-
ful in drawing manufacturing and the jobs associated with that production away
from U.S. soil. EXIM’s 2018 Competitiveness Report accurately documents how
extensively foreign ECAs have expanded programs aimed at embedding their small
and medium-sized exporters into the global supply chain to the detriment of U.S.
exporters, particularly small businesses.35 To ignore these changes and leave the
United States without its own export financing weapon is to resign the United
States to a reduced role in world geopolitical affairs and accept fewer jobs and
lower standards of living for many Americans.

Critics of EXIM employ a host of defamatory slurs like “crony capitalism” and
“Bank of Boeing.” The “Bank of Boeing” moniker is particularly misleading, as it
was born in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis when the airline industry was par-
ticularly hard hit and private-sector financing was not available for many airlines
looking to purchase Boeing aircraft. EXIM’s portfolio tends to be cyclical with
different industries relying on export credit financing at different points in time,
depending on economic conditions.

The truth is that EXIM provides financing only when the private sector will not
or cannot (a concept known as additionality). In addition:

When EXIM does provide financing, usually in the form of a loan or loan
guarantee, the borrower pays interest rates that are driven by the market.
EXIM does not undercut the private sector. It does not solicit any
applications for financing, and all applications are judged on the merits of
the transactions.

All transactions must have “reasonable assurance of repayment,” which
is why EXIM has an exceptionally low default rate, historically hovering
around 0.5 percent—a default rate that is the envy of private banking.

When EXIM enters a deal, the American taxpayer is always protected
first. If a deal goes into default, the U.S. taxpayer is paid back before any
other lender.
Borrowers are loathe to default on the United States of America.

This ability to manage risk successfully is why EXIM actually makes a profit
for American taxpayers, described in government parlance as “negative subsidy,”
sending more than $9 billion to the U.S. Treasury for debt reduction since 1992.
The bank has also supported hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, most of them in
manufacturing, during the past decade.

Export credit financing has become a critical lever for macroeconomic growth
for many countries, allies and competitors of the U.S. alike. Other nations are using
ECAs strategically to influence decisions and procure economic opportunities,
hindering the participation of U.S. firms and costing American jobs, particularly
in manufacturing.

China’s aggressive actions in export finance bleed beyond economic advance-
ment and are clearly an effort to expand both its national security and its global
power. The United States would be foolish to abandon this field of play, surren-
dering it to China and other nations, and to relinquish EXIM as a powerful tool in
America’s asymmetrical warfare toolbox.
