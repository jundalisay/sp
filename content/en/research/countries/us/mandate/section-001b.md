In recent years, Presidents typically have appointed two Deputy Chiefs of Staff:
a Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations and a Deputy Chief of
Staff for Policy. There also have been other types of deputy chiefs whose roles have
included, for example, overseeing strategy, planning, and implementation. Chiefs
of Staff have then occasionally appointed a principal Deputy Chief to be in charge
of guiding decision-making, organizational structure, and information flow.
Not all Chiefs of Staff have tapped a principal deputy. A major reason is that
doing so adds another layer of command complexity. When principal deputies
have been installed, their roles have varied based on the needs of particular chiefs.
Most principal deputies have functioned as doorkeepers, sorting through action
items, taking on those that can be handled at their own level, and passing up others
that truly require the attention of the Chief of Staff or the President. Principal
deputies also have assumed control of the scheduling functions, normally under
the operations deputy, and have worked directly with the policy councils at the
direction of the Chief of Staff. The OPL and Office of Political Affairs (OPA) also
have reported to a principal deputy.

Deputy Chief of Staff for Management and Operations. The Deputy Chief
of Staff for Management and Operations oversees the President’s schedule and
all logistical aspects of his movement within and outside of the White House (for
example, both air travel on Air Force One and Marine One and ground transpor-
tation). This deputy also interfaces directly with the Secret Service as well as the
military offices tasked with keeping the President and his family safe.
In the past, this deputy has also worked with the NSC, the Secretary of Defense,
the Secretary of State, and the Intelligence Community and on advancing all foreign
trips. If their roles are separated from that of the policy deputy, this deputy should
have a strong grasp of international affairs and robust foreign policy credentials.

PRINCIPAL DEPUTY CHIEFS OF STAFF

This deputy further manages all facets of the working White House: technology,
grounds management, support staff, personnel administration, and communica-
tions. This individual therefore needs to be meticulous and ideally should possess
a great deal of command-and-control experience.

Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. In some Administrations, the functions of
the IGA, OPA, and OPL and other advisers within the WHO have fallen under the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. For conservatives, this arrangement could help
to connect the WHO’s outreach to political and external groups and be a strong
conduit for state and local elected officials, state party organizations, and both
grasstop and grassroots groups.

This deputy chief works directly with the Chief of Staff, Cabinet officers, and
all three policy councils to support the development and implementation of the
President’s agenda. This deputy chief should therefore have impressive policy cre-
dentials in the realms of economic, domestic, and social affairs.

SENIOR ADVISERS

Presidents have surrounded themselves with senior advisers whose experi-
ence and interests are not necessarily neatly defined. In recent Administrations,
senior advisers have been appointed to offer broad guidance on political matters
and communications issues; others have acted as “czars” for specific projects or
policy areas.

The most powerful senior advisers frequently have had a long personal relation-
ship with the President and often have spent a significant amount of time with him
within and outside of the White House. They have been asked not only to provide
guidance on a variety of policy issues, but also to offer instruction on communi-
cating with the American people and the media.
In a number of Administrations, new offices—or “councils”—have been created
to support senior advisers. For the most part, their functions have been duplicative
or overlapping, as a result of which these offices have tended to be short-lived. Even
so, senior advisers should be provided the staff and resources that their portfo-
lios require. To ensure that senior advisers are effective, their portfolios must be
clearly delineated and clearly communicated across the White House. This too is
a responsibility of the Chief of Staff.

OFFICE OF WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL

The Office of White House Counsel provides legal guidance to the President and
elements of the EOP on a host of issues, including presidential powers and privi-
leges, ethics compliance, review of clemency applications, and judicial nominations.
The selection of White House Counsel is one of the most important decisions an
incoming President will make. The office is not designed to create or advance pol-
icies on its own initiative—nor should it do so. Rather, it is dedicated to guiding the President and his reports on how (within the bounds of the law) to pursue and
realize the President’s agenda.

While the White House Counsel does not serve as the President’s personal attor-
ney in nonofficial matters, it is almost impossible to delineate exactly where an
issue is strictly personal and has no bearing on the President’s official function. The
White House Counsel needs to be deeply committed both to the President’s agenda
and to affording the President proactive counsel and zealous representation. That
individual directly advises the President as he performs the duties of the office,
and this requires a relationship that is built on trust, confidentiality, and candor.
The Office of White House Counsel is also responsible for ensuring that each
component of the White House adheres to all applicable legal and ethical guide-
lines, which often requires ongoing training and monitoring to ensure compliance.
This means ensuring that White House staff regularly consult with office attor-
neys on required financial disclosures, received gifts, potential conflicts of interest,
and other ethical concerns. The Office of White House Counsel is the first line of
defense for the EOP. Its staff must take seriously the duty to protect the powers
and privileges of the President from encroachments by Congress, the judiciary,
and the administrative components of departments and agencies.


In addition to the White House Counsel, the office includes deputies, assistants,
associates, and legal support staff. The assistant and associate attorneys are often
specialists in particular areas of the law and offer guidance to the EOP on issues
related to national security, criminal law, environmental law, and a host of admin-
istrative and regulatory matters. Attorneys working in the Office of White House
Counsel serve as legal advisers to the White House policy operation by reviewing
executive orders, agency regulations, and other policy-related functions. Here
again, subordinates should be deeply committed to the President’s agenda and
see their role as helping to accomplish the agenda through problem solving and
advocacy. They should not erect roadblocks out of an abundance of caution; rather,
they should offer practical legal advice on how to promote the President’s agenda
within the bounds of the law.


The White House Counsel’s office cannot serve as a finishing school to credential
the next set of white-shoe law firm attorneys or federal judges in waiting who cabin
their opinions for fear their elite credentials could be tarnished through a policy
disagreement. Rather, it should function more as an activist yet ethical plaintiffs’
firm that advocates for its client—the Administration’s agenda—within the limits
imposed by the Constitution and the duties of the legal profession.

The Office of White House Counsel also serves as the primary gateway for
communication between the White House and the Department of Justice (DOJ).
Traditionally, both the White House Counsel and the Attorney General have issued
a memo requiring all contact between the two institutions to occur only between
the Office of White House Counsel and the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General. The next Administration should reexamine this policy and determine whether it might be more efficient or more appropriate for communication to occur
through additional channels. The White House Counsel also works closely with
the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel to seek opinions on, for example, matters of policy
development and the constitutionality of presidential power and privileges and
with OLA and the DOJ Office of Legal Policy on presidential judicial nominees.

When a new President takes office, he will need to decide expeditiously how to
handle any major ongoing litigation or other pending legal matters that might present a challenge to his agenda. To offer guidance, the White House Counsel must get
up to speed as quickly as possible on all significant ongoing legal challenges across
the executive branch that might affect the new Administration’s policy agenda and
must be prepared at the outset of the Administration to present recommenda-
tions to the President, including recommendations for reconsidering or reversing
positions of the previous Administration in any significant litigation. This review
will usually require consulting with the new political leadership at the Justice
Department, including during the transition period.


No day is predictable at the White House. Therefore, to handle the pace and
volatility of affairs, the Office of White House Counsel must offer measured legal
guidance in a timely manner. This often means forgoing law review–style memos
about esoteric legal concepts and instead quickly providing high-level yet incisive
guidance. Due to evolving world events, domestic affairs, and political pressures, the
office often faces legal questions for which there may not be a wealth of precedent.
Attorneys in the Office of White House Counsel must therefore work collaboratively
within the White House and the Department of Justice, relying on each other as a
team, to ensure that proper legal guidance is delivered to the President.
The President should choose a White House Counsel who is well-versed in
the Constitution, administrative and regulatory law, and the inner workings of
Congress and the political process. Instead of choosing a specialist, the President
should hire a counsel with extensive experience with a wide range of complex legal
subjects. Moreover, while a candidate with elite credentials might seem ideal, the
best one will be above all loyal to the President and the Constitution.
