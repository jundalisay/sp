### OFFICE OF POLITICAL AFFAIRS (OPA)


The OPA is the primary office within the executive branch for managing the
President’s political interests. Although its specific functions vary from Admin-
istration to Administration, the OPA typically serves as the liaison between the
President and associated political entities: national committees, federal and state
campaigns, and interest groups. Within legal guidelines, the OPA engages in out-
reach, conducts casework, and—if the President is up for reelection—assists with
his campaign. The OPA may also monitor congressional campaigns, arrange pres-
idential visits with other political campaigns, and recommend campaign staff to
the Office of Presidential Personnel for service in the executive branch.

The OPA further serves as a line of communication between the White House
and the President’s political party. This includes both relaying the President’s
ambitions to political interests and listening to the needs of political interests. This
relationship allows for the exchange of information between the White House and
political actors across the country. The OPA should have one director of political
affairs who reports either to the Chief of Staff or to a Deputy Chief of Staff. The
OPA should also include various deputy directors, each of whom is responsible for
a certain geographical region of the country.

Because nearly all White House activities are in some way inherently political,
the OPA needs to be aware of all presidential actions and activities—including
travel, policy decisions, speeches, nominations, and responses to matters of
national security—and consider how they might affect the President’s image. The
OPA must therefore have a designated staffer who communicates not only with
other White House offices, but also with the Cabinet and executive branch agencies.



### OFFICE OF CABINET AFFAIRS (OCA)

The OCA’s role has changed to some degree over the course of various Adminis-
trations, but its overriding function remains the same: to ensure the coordination
of policy and communication between the White House and the Cabinet. Most
important, the OCA coordinates all Cabinet meetings with the President. It should
also organize and administer regular meetings of the Deputy Secretaries because
they also typically serve vital roles in the departments and agencies and, further,
often become acting secretaries when Cabinet members resign.

There should be one Cabinet Secretary who reports to the Chief of Staff’s office,
either directly or through a deputy chief, according to the chief’s preference and
focus. The Cabinet Secretary maintains a direct relationship with all members of
the Cabinet.

The OCA further consists of deputies and special assistants who work with each
department’s principal, Deputy Secretary, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries,
and other senior staff. The OCA also connects the departments to WHO offices.
The OCA coordinates with the Chief of Staff’s office and the Office of Communi-
cations to promote the President’s agenda through the Cabinet departments and
agencies. The Cabinet’s communications staffers are obviously another critical
component of this operation.

In prior Administrations, the OCA has played a vital role by tracking the Pres-
ident’s agenda for the Chief of Staff, Deputy Chiefs, and senior advisers. It has
worked with each department and agency to advance policy priorities. In the future,
amplifying this function would truly benefit both the President and the conser-
vative movement.

From time to time throughout an Administration, travel optics, ethics chal-
lenges, and Hatch Act7 issues involving Cabinet members, deputies, and senior
staffers can arise. The OCA is normally tasked with keeping the WHO informed
of such developments and providing support if and when necessary.
The ideal Cabinet Secretary will have exceptional organizational skills and be
a seasoned political operative or attorney. Because many Cabinet officials have
been former presidential candidates, governors, ambassadors, and Members of
Congress, the ideal candidate should also possess the ability to interact with and
persuade accomplished individuals.


### OFFICE OF PUBLIC LIAISON (OPL)

The OPL is critically important in building coalitions and support for the Pres-
ident’s agenda across every aligned social, faith-based, minority, and economic
interest group. It is a critical tool for shaping public opinion and keeping myriad
supporters, as well as “frenemies” and opponents alike who are within reach,
better informed.

The OPL is a notably large office. It should have one Director who reports to the
Chief of Staff’s office, either directly or through a deputy, according to the chief’s
preference and focus. The Director must maintain relationships not only with
other WHO heads, but also with the senior staff of every Cabinet department and
agency. Since a President’s agenda is always in motion, it is important for the OPL
to facilitate listening sessions to receive the views of the various leaders and members of key interest groups.

The OPL should also have a sufficient number of deputies and special assistants
to cover the vast number of disparate interest groups that are engaged daily. The


### OFFICE OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS (IGA)

The IGA connects the White House to state, county, local, and tribal govern-
ments. In other words, it is the one-stop shop for disseminating an Administration’s
agenda to all non–federal government entities.

The IGA should have a Director to whom one or two Deputy Directors report.
The Director must ensure that the White House remains connected to all non–
federal government entities. The interests and perspectives of these entities are
represented in policy discussions, organized events with the West Wing, EOP
senior staff, and IGA staff throughout the departments and agencies.
The IGA can be staffed in a variety of ways, but two arrangements are
most common:

Each deputy and that deputy’s staffers are responsible for a type of government.
A group of staffers is responsible for a specific geographical region of
the country.

OPL has, by far, held more meetings in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building
(EEOB) and within the West Wing itself than any other office within the WHO.
The OPL is the chief White House enforcer and gatekeeper among these var-
ious interest groups. It has operated best whenever the Chief of Staff has given it
permission to use both the proverbial “carrot” and the proverbial “stick.” To make
this work, communication with the chief’s office is vital. Additionally, the OPL has
had an outsized role in presidential scheduling and both official and political travel.
The OPL Director should come from the President’s election campaign or Cap-
itol Hill—but should not have deeply entrenched connections to a K Street entity
or any other potential stakeholder. Some prior relationships can create real or
perceived biases toward one group or another. The Director should be amiable,
gregarious, highly organized, and willing to shoulder criticism and pushback from
interest groups and other elements of the Administration.

Unlike the Director, OPL deputies and special assistants need a deep under-
standing of the capital, from K Street to Capitol Hill. They should have extensive
experience in private industry, the labor sector, the conservative movement, and
among the specific interest groups with which they will be asked to engage on
behalf of the White House.

OPL staffers work with more external and internal parties than any other WHO
staffers. In turn, they must be effective communicators and initiative-takers. They
must also be able to influence, persuade, and—most important—listen to various
stakeholders and ensure that they feel heard. All OPL staffers must understand
from the outset that their jobs might be modified or even phased out entirely as
the Administration’s priorities change.

The IGA, as suggested above, represents the interests and perspectives of non–
federal government entities, but its primary job is to make sure that these entities
understand an Administration’s agenda and ultimately support it.
The IGA must work with all other White House offices, especially the OPA and
the OPL, and manage its staff throughout the departments and agencies. IGA staff-
ers must therefore have communication skills, understand political nuance, and
be willing to engage in complex policy discussions. They should also be not just
generally responsive, but also proactive in seeking out the interests and perspec-
tives of non–federal government entities.
