The National Space Council is responsible for providing advice and recommen- dations to the President on the formulation and implementation of space policy and strategy. It is charged with conducting a whole-of-government approach to the nation’s space interests: civil, military, intelligence, commercial, or diplomatic. Historically, it has been chaired by the Vice President at the President’s direction, and its members consist of members of the Cabinet and other senior executive branch officials as specified by the President in Executive Order 13803.32 The NSpC’s purpose is to ensure that the President’s priorities relative to space are carried out and, as necessary, to resolve policy conflicts among departments and agencies that are related to space.

Space projects and programs are risky, complex, expensive, and time consum- ing—although commercial space innovations are lowering costs and accelerating schedules. Nevertheless, while fiscal discipline should not be ignored, long-term policy stability is crucial to investors, innovators, industry, and agencies. Policy stability is easier when policies and programs are aligned with long-term national interests as opposed to those of particular advocacy groups or political factions. The Trump Administration’s major space policies—including the U.S. Space Force, the Artemis program to land the next Americans on the moon, and support for a strong commercial space sector—have endured under the Biden Administration.

Major challenges remain in implementation and regulatory reform to keep up with rapidly evolving space markets and competitors. These include the long-term sustainability of space activities in light of increasing orbital debris; creation of space situational awareness services for civil and commercial uses; management of mega-constellations; licensing of new commercial remote sensing capabilities; keeping up with licensing demands due to high launch rates; transitioning Inter- national Space Station operations to multiple, privately owned space platforms; and (most important) accelerating the acquisition and fielding of national security space capabilities in response to an increasingly aggressive China.

The Vice President should have a clear understanding with the National Secu- rity Advisor and the White House Counsel that they and their respective staffs will work within the White House to determine the scope and leadership of policy reviews that can overlap multiple areas of responsibility. A similar understanding is necessary with the heads of other policy councils such as the NEC, DPC, and National Science and Technology Council (NSTC).

As a result of the President’s direction and the Vice President’s leadership, the NSpC under the Trump Administration was able to coordinate a wide range of space policy reviews, legislative proposals, and regulatory reforms smoothly. The NSpC generally led on space issues within the EOP, but other White House offices also took on space topics.

As a member of the NSpC, and in coordination with other members, the Office of Science and Technology Policy developed a national space weather strategy, research and development (R&D) plans to mitigate the effects of orbital debris, and protocols for planetary protection to avoid biological contamination of celestial bodies. The Council of Economic Advisers did research on the economic benefits of space property rights.

OMB’s Office of Information and Regulatory Reform updated and
streamlined commercial launch licensing and commercial remote sensing
satellite rules.

During the Trump Administration, if a topic was purely military, such as stand-
ing up the U.S. Space Command, the NSC took the lead. If a topic cut across military,
civil, and commercial sectors, as was the case with cybersecurity in space, the NSpC
and NSC would cochair the policy review groups.

Trusted, collegial relationships across the White House complex are critical to
successful space policy development, implementation, and oversight. Nowhere
is this more important than in the relationship between the NSpC staff and OMB
staff who oversee civil and national security–related space spending. Teamwork
between the NSpC and OMB staff can communicate clear presidential priorities
to departments and agencies, facilitating smooth development of the President’s
budget request. The NSpC and OMB have many opportunities to collaborate in
promoting presidential priorities while finding offsets in lower-priority programs
and funding lines.


### OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY (OSTP)

The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was created
by the National Science and Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act
of 1976.33 Before its creation, Presidents received their advice and counsel on such
matters through advisers and boards that had no statutory authority. The Director
of OSTP is one of the few Senate-confirmed positions within the Executive Office
of the President. Consistent with other laws, the President may delegate to the
Director of OSTP directive authority over other elements of the executive branch.
Other EOP policy officials and organizations such as the NSC and NEC are formally
only advisory with relevant agency directives issued by the President.


The OSTP’s functions, as contained in the law, are to advise the President of
scientific and technological considerations, evaluate the effectiveness of the federal
effort, and generally lead and coordinate the federal government’s R&D programs.
If science is being manipulated at the agencies to support separate political and
institutional agendas, the President should increase the prominence of the OSTP’s
Director either formally or informally. This would elevate the role of science in
policy discussions and subsequent outcomes and theoretically help to balance
out agencies like the Departments of Energy, State, and Commerce and the Envi-
ronmental Protection Agency and Council on Environmental Quality.


### The OSTP

can also help to bring technical expertise to regulatory matters in support of OMB.
The OSTP should continue to play a lead role in coordinating federal R&D pro-
grams. Recent legislation, especially the CHIPS and Science Act,34 has expanded
federal policy and funding across the enterprise, and there is a need for more sig-
nificant leadership in this area both to ensure effectiveness and to avoid duplication
of effort. As befitting its location in the White House, the OSTP must be concerned
with advancing national interests and not merely the parochial concerns of depart-
ments, agencies, or parts of the scientific community.

During the Trump and Biden Administrations, there has been a bipartisan focus
on prioritizing R&D funding around the so-called Industries of the Future (IOTF).
Under President Trump, IOTF priorities were artificial intelligence (AI), quantum
information science (QIS), advanced communications/5G, advanced manufacturing,
and biotechnology. Under President Biden, this list has been expanded to include
advanced materials, robotics, battery technology, cybersecurity, green products and
clean technology, plant genetics and agricultural technologies, nanotechnology, and
semiconductor and microelectronics technologies. These priorities should be eval-
uated and narrowed to ensure consistency with the next Administration’s priorities.
Given a long list of priorities, coordinating efforts across agencies and mea-
suring success are extremely challenging. The OSTP and OMB are required to
work together on an annual basis to prioritize the funding requests and whatever
Congress adds on top of them, but there continues to be concern about mission
creep and funds expended on nonscientific R&D.

The President should also issue an executive order to reshape the U.S. Global
Change Research Program (USGCRP) and related climate change research pro-
grams. The USGCRP produces strategic plans and research (for example, the
National Climate Assessment) that reduce the scope of legally proper options in
presidential decision-making and in agency rulemakings and adjudications. 

Also,
since much environmental policymaking must run the gauntlet of judicial review,
USGCRP actions can frustrate successful litigation defense in ways that the career
bureaucracy should not be permitted to control. The process for producing assess-
ments should include diverse viewpoints. The OSTP and OMB should jointly assess
the independence of the contractors used to conduct much of this outsourced government research that serves as the basis for policymaking. The next President should critically analyze and, if required, refuse to accept any USGCRP assessment
prepared under the Biden Administration.

The President should also restore related EOP research components to their
purely informational and advisory roles. Consistent with the Global Change
Research Act of 1990,35 USGCRP-related EOP components should be confined to
a more limited advisory role. These components should include but not necessarily
be limited to the OSTP; the NSTC’s Committee on Environment; the USGCRP’s
Interagency Groups (for example, the Carbon Cycle Interagency Working Group);
and the Federal Coordinating Council for Science, Engineering, and Technology.
As a general matter, the new Administration should separate the scientific risk
assessment function from the risk management function, which is the exclusive
domain of elected policymakers and the public.

Finally, the next Administration will face a significant challenge in unwinding
policies and procedures that are used to advance radical gender, racial, and equity
initiatives under the banner of science. Similarly, the Biden Administration’s
climate fanaticism will need a whole-of-government unwinding. As with other
federal departments and agencies, the Biden Administration’s leveraging of the
federal government’s resources to further the woke agenda should be reversed and
scrubbed from all policy manuals, guidance documents, and agendas, and scientific
excellence and innovation should be restored as the OSTP’s top priority.
