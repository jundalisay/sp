The VP helps to promote and execute the President’s agenda. 

Recent Presidents have decided to give Vice Presidents space in the West Wing.

The VP’s proximity to the President—as well as to the Chief of Staff and additional senior advisers—makes his or her role a powerful one within the West Wing.

VPs have served on the NSC Principals Committee, heading the National Space Council, addressing immigration and border issues, leading the response to health care crises, and supervising workforce programs. 

VPs traditionally also spearhead projects of personal interest that have been authorized by the President. The VP is also charged with breaking tie votes in the Senate and in recent years has served abroad as a brand ambassador for the White House and more broadly the United States, announcing Administration priorities and coordinating with heads of state and other top foreign government officials. The Vice President, as President of the Senate, could be a President’s emissary to the Senate.

### OFFICE OF THE FIRST LADY/FIRST GENTLEMAN

The First Lady or First Gentleman plays an interesting role in the formation,
implementation, and execution of policy in concert with the President. Active
and interested first spouses often champion a select number of signature issues,
whether they be thorny social issues or deeper policy issues. One advantage of the
first spouse’s taking on hot-button social issues is that any political backlash will
be less severe than it would be for the President.

The first spouse normally appoints a chief of staff who has enough assistants
to support the spouse’s activities in the East Wing of the White House. This group
works exclusively with the first spouse and senior members of the White House
along with EOP personnel to implement and execute the first spouse’s priorities,
which reflect the first spouse’s passions and interests and are often identified as
important in discussions with the President. Executed well, they can be strategi-
cally useful in accelerating the Administration’s agenda. Past East Wing initiatives
have focused on such issues as combating bullying, fighting drug abuse, promoting
literacy, and encouraging physical education for young adults and children.
The first spouse is afforded significant resources. His or her staff also works with
the President’s policy team, members of the Cabinet, and other EOP staff.
