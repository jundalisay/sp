The US today owes $31 trillion.

The OMB Director should present a fiscal goal to the President early in the budget development process to address the federal government’s fiscal irresponsibility. 

This goal would help to align the months-long process of developing the actual proposals for inclusion in the budget. Though some mistakenly regard it as a mere paper-pushing exercise, the President’s budget is in fact a powerful mechanism for setting and enforcing public policy at federal agencies.

The budget team includes six Resource Management Offices that, together with the BRD and other components, help the Director of OMB to develop and execute detailed agency spending plans that bear on every major aspect of policy formation and execution at federal agencies.

Through initial priority-setting and ongoing supervision of agency spending, OMB’s budget team plays a key role in executing policy across the executive branch, including at many agencies wrongly regarded as “independent.”

The RMOs, each of which is led by a political appointee known as the PAD and a career DAD, are separated into six functional units:

lNational Security.
lNatural Resources, Energy, and Science.
lHealth.
lEducation, Income Maintenance, and Labor.
lTransportation, Justice, and Homeland Security.
lTreasury, Commerce, and Housing.

Because the RMOs are institutionally ingrained in nearly all policymaking and
implementation across the executive branch, they play a critical role in helping the
Director to implement the President’s public policy agenda. However, because each
RMO is responsible for formulating and supervising such a wide range of policy
details, many granular but critical policy decisions are effectively left to the career
professionals who serve across Administrations.

To enhance the OMB Director’s ability to help the President drive policy at the
agencies, the existing six RMOs should be divided into smaller subject-matter areas,
allowing for more PADs, and each of these PADs should have a Deputy PAD. This
expanded pool of RMOs with additional political leadership would enable more
comprehensive direction and oversight of policy development and implementation.
Regardless of whether Congress adopts the President’s full set of budget rec-
ommendations, the President should reintroduce the concept of administrative
pay-as-you-go, or administrative PAYGO. This simple procedural requirement
imposes budget neutrality on the discretionary choices of federal agencies, of
which there are many in nearly all areas of policymaking. This simple step forces
the executive branch to control what it can control. The principle may occasionally
yield to other overarching requirements, such as a presidential regulatory budget,
but in nearly all cases, administrative PAYGO plays a unique and indispensable
role in enforcing fiscal responsibility at federal departments and agencies.
The President should use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal disci-
pline on the federal government. Anything short of that would constitute abject failure.
Management. The Management Office of OMB (the “M-Side” as it is often
called) is responsible for carrying out several important agency oversight functions,
many of which are statutory. The Management team includes the following offices
led by presidentially appointed Senate-confirmed individuals:

lThe Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP).
lThe Office of Performance and Personnel Management (OPPM).
lThe Office of Federal Financial Management (OFFM).
lThe Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer (OFCIO).


The Made in America Office (MIAO), which was added by the Biden
Administration and is not a Senate-confirmed slot.
Each of these offices has responsibilities and authorities that a President can
use to help drive policy across the government. It is vital that the Director and his
political staff, not the careerists, drive these offices in pursuit of the President’s
actual priorities and not let them set their own agenda based on the wishes of the
sprawling “good government” management community in and outside of govern-
ment. Many Directors do not properly prioritize the management portfolio, leaving
it to the Deputy for Management, but such neglect creates purposeless bureaucracy
that impedes a President’s agenda—an “M Train to Nowhere.”

OFPP. This office plays a critical role in leading the development of new policies
and regulations concerning federal contracting and procurement. Through the
Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, which is generally chaired by the OFPP
Administrator, OFPP helps the Director to set a wide range of policies for all of
those who contract with the executive branch. In the past, those governmentwide
contracting rules have played a key role in helping to implement the President’s
policy agenda. This office should be engaged early and often in OMB’s effort to drive
policy, including by obtaining transparency about entities that are awarded federal
contracts and grants and by using government contracts to push back against woke
policies in corporate America.

OPPM. Through this office, the Director helps federal agencies to establish their
performance goals and performance review processes. OPPM also works with the
U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to establish and manage personnel
policies and practices across the federal government. The Director should instruct
OPPM to establish annual performance goals and review processes for agencies
that reflect the President’s agenda. OPPM should also be part of the President’s
strategy to set and enforce sensible policies and practices for the federal workforce.
OFFM. This office helps the Director to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in fed-
eral programs—for example, through the Do Not Pay program. It should be part of
efforts to save precious taxpayer resources.
OFCIO. This office guides the federal government’s use and adoption of Internet-based technologies to improve government operations and save taxpayer money. As a function of its leadership role, it is critical in interagency discussions
on a wide range of technology issues. The office thus is an important part of the
President’s efforts to modernize, strengthen, and set technology-adoption policy
for the executive branch.

MIAO. Building on the example and work of the Trump Administration, Presi-
dent Biden established this office to centralize, carry out, and further develop the
federal government’s Buy-American and other Made-in-America commitments.
Its work ought to be continued and further strengthened.


### Regulatory and Information Policy. 

OMB’s OIRA plays an enormous and
vital role in reining in the regulatory state and ensuring that regulations achieve
important benefits while imposing minimal burdens on Americans. The President
should maintain Executive Order (EO) 12866,4 the foundation of OIRA’s review
of regulatory actions. The Administration should likewise maintain the recent
extension of those standards to regulatory actions of the U.S. Department of the
Treasury.5 Regulatory analysis and OIRA review should also be required of the
historically “independent” agencies as the Office of Legal Counsel has found is
legally permissible.6

If the current Administration proceeds with its declared intent to modify
aspects of EO 12866 or review OMB Circular A-4,7 the related document that
provides the foundation for cost-benefit analysis, the next President should imme-
diately begin to undo those changes and develop a rigorous, data-driven approach
that will result in the least burdensome rules possible. The next President should
also revive the directive in Executive Order 138918 that significant guidance doc-
uments also must pass through OIRA review.

Because OIRA review often leads to fewer regulatory burdens, more regulatory
benefits, and better coordination of regulatory policy, funding for OIRA tends to
pay large dividends. Yet over the years, funding for OIRA has diminished. This
trend should be reversed. The budget should also include sufficient full-time equiv-
alent (FTE) employees to form regulatory advance teams that would consult with
agencies on cost-benefit analysis and good regulatory practices at the beginning
of the rulemaking process for the most important regulations. These teams would
help agencies take cost-benefit analysis into account from the beginning of their
rulemaking efforts, which in turn would result in higher-quality regulations and a
swifter eventual OIRA review. To preserve the integrity of OIRA review, the staff
who consult at the beginning of a rulemaking should not handle its eventual review.
The next President should also reinstate the many executive orders signed
by President Trump that were designed to make the regulatory process more
just, efficient, and transparent. Executive Orders 13771,9 13777,10 13891,11 13892,12
13893,13 13924 Section 6,14 13979,15 and 1398016 should be revived (with modifica-
tions as needed). Executive Order 1313217 on federalism should be strengthened
so that state regulatory and fiscal operations are not commandeered by the federal government through so-called cooperative federalism programs. Additionally, the
President should revise and sign an updated version of President Ronald Reagan’s
Executive Order 1263018 on federal takings.

The next President should strengthen implementation of the Information Qual-
ity Act,19 robustly use the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act,20 carefully
enforce the Privacy Act,21 and ensure the sound execution of OIRA’s statistical
and other information policy functions. Regulatory cooperation agreements can
also promote the further adoption of good regulatory practices, which improve
market conditions for America and her allies. OIRA should also work with other
components of OMB to revise and apply OMB’s uniform Guidance for Grants and
Agreements22 and ensure that federal contract and grant guidelines satisfy EO
12866 and other centralized standards as appropriate.
But executive reforms and actions, while vital, are not enough: Congress also
must act. The next President should work with Congress to pass significant reg-
ulatory policy and process reforms, which could go a long way toward reining in
the administrative state. Excellent examples of such legislation include the Reg-
ulatory Accountability Act,23 SMART Act,24 GOOD Act,25 Early Participation in
Regulations Act,26 Unfunded Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act,27
and REINS Act.28

Finally, the next President should work with Congress to maximize the utility
of the Congressional Review Act (CRA),29 which allows Congress to undo midnight
regulatory actions (including those disguised as “guidance”) on an accelerated
timeline. To leverage the CRA’s power to the maximum extent, Congress and
the President should enact the Midnight Rules Relief Act,30 which would help to
ensure that multiple regulatory actions could be packaged and voted on at the same
time. Immediate and robust use of the CRA would allow the President to focus
his rulemaking resources on major new regulatory reforms rather than devoting
months or years to undoing the final rulemakings of the Biden Administration.

Legislative Clearance and Coordination. OMB plays a critical role in ensuring that the executive branch is aligned on legislative proposals and language, agency testimonies, and other communications with Congress. The Director should
use these authorities to enforce policy and message consistency aggressively and
promote the effective engagement of the executive branch in legislative processes.
