According to current law, federal workers are to be paid wages comparable to equivalent private-sector workers rather than compared to all private-sector employees. While the official studies claim that federal employees are underpaid relative to the private sector by 20 percent or more, a 2016 Heritage Foundation study found that federal employees received wages that were 22 percent higher than wages for similar private-sector workers; if the value of employee benefits was included, the total compensation premium for federal employees over their private-sector equivalents increased to between 30 percent and 40 percent.18 

The American Enterprise Institute found a 14 percent pay premium and a 61 percent total compensation premium.19 Base salary is only one component of a federal employee’s total compensation. In addition to high starting wages, federal employees normally receive an annual cost-of-living adjustment (available to all employees) and generous scheduled raises known as step increases. Moreover, a large proportion of federal employ- ees are stationed in the Washington, D.C., area and other large cities and are entitled to steep locality pay enhancement to account for the high cost of living in these areas.

A federal employee with five years’ experience receives 20 vacation days, 13 paid
sick days, and all 10 federal holidays compared to an employee at a large private
company who receives 13 days of vacation and eight paid sick days. Federal health
benefits are more comparable to those provided by Fortune 500 employers with
the government paying 72 percent of the weighted average premiums, but this is
much higher than for most private plans. Almost half of private firms do not offer
any employer contributions at all.

The obvious solution to these discrepancies is to move closer to a market model
for federal pay and benefits. One need is for a neutral agency to oversee pay hiring
decisions, especially for high-demand occupations. The OPM is independent of
agency operations, so it can assess requirements more neutrally. For many years,
with its Special Pay Rates program, the OPM evaluated claims that federal rates
in an area were too low to attract competent employees and allowed agencies to
offer higher pay when needed rather than increased rates for all. Ideally, the OPM
should establish an initial pay schedule for every occupation and region, monitor
turnover rates and applicant-to-position ratios, and adjust pay and recruitment
on that basis. Most of this requires legislation, but the OPM should be an advocate
for a true equality of benefits between the public and private sectors.

Reforming Federal Retirement Benefits. Career civil servants enjoy retire-
ment benefits that are nearly unheard of in the private sector. Federal employees
retire earlier (normally at age 55 after 30 years), enjoy richer pension annuities,
and receive automatic cost-of-living adjustments based on the areas in which they
retire. Defined-benefit federal pensions are fully indexed for inflation—a practice
that is extremely rare in the private sector. A federal employee with a preretire-
ment income of $25,000 under the older of the two federal retirement plans will
receive at least $200,000 more over a 20-year period than will private-sector work-
ers with the same preretirement salary under historic inflation levels.
During the early Reagan years, the OPM reformed many specific provisions of
the federal pension program to save billions administratively. 

Under OPM pressure, Reagan and Congress ultimately ended the old Civil Service Retirement
System (CSRS) entirely for new employees, which (counting disbursements for
the unfunded liability) accounted for 51.3 percent of the federal government's
total payroll. The retirement system that replaced it—the Federal Employees
Retirement System (FERS)—reduced the cost of federal employee retirement dis-
bursements to 28.5 percent of payroll (including contributions to Social Security
and the employer match to the Thrift Savings Plan). More of the pension cost was
shifted to the employee, but the new system was much more equitable for the 40
percent who received few or no benefits under the old system.

By 1999, more than half of the federal workforce was covered by the new system,
and the government’s per capita share of the cost (as the employer) was less than
half the cost of the old system: 20.2 percent of FERS payroll vs. 44.3 percent of
CSRS payroll, representing one of the largest examples of government savings
anywhere. Although the government pension system has become more like private
pension systems, it still remains much more generous, and other means might be
considered in the future to move it even closer to private plans.
GSA: Landlord and Contractor Management. The General Services
Administration is best known as the federal government’s landlord—designing,
constructing, managing, and preserving government buildings and leasing and managing outside commercial real estate contracting with 376.9 million square feet 
of space. 

Obviously, as its prime function, real estate expertise is key to the GSA’s
success. However, the GSA is also the government’s purchasing agent, connecting
federal purchasers with commercial products and services in the private sector
and their personnel management functions. With contractors performing so many
functions today, the GSA therefore becomes a de facto part of governmentwide
personnel management. The GSA also manages the Presidential Transition Act
(PTA) process, which also directly involves the OPM. A recent proposal would
have incorporated the OPM and GSA (and OMB). Fortunately, this did not take
place in that form, but it would make sense for GSA and OPM leadership and staff
to hold regular meetings to work through matters of common interest such as
moderating PTA personnel restrictions and the relationships between contract
and civil service employees.

Reductions-in-Force. Reducing the number of federal employees seems an
obvious way to reduce the overall expense of the civil service, and many prior
Administrations have attempted to do just this. Presidents Bill Clinton and
Barack Obama began their terms, as did Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, by
mandating a freeze on the hiring of new federal employees, but these efforts did
not lead to permanent and substantive reductions in the number of nondefense
federal employees.

First, it is a challenge even to know which workers to cut. As mentioned, there
are 2 million federal employees, but since budgets have exploded, so has the
total number of personnel with nearly 10 times more federal contractors than
federal employees. Contractors are less expensive because they are not entitled
to high government pensions or benefits and are easier to fire and discipline. In
addition, millions of state government employees work under federal grants, in
effect administering federal programs; these cannot be cut directly. Cutting federal
employment can be helpful and can provide a simple story to average citizens, but
cutting functions, levels, funds, and grants is much more important than setting
simple employment size.

Simply reducing numbers can actually increase costs. OMB instructions fol-
lowing President Trump’s employment freeze told agencies to consider buyout
programs, encouraging early retirements in order to shift costs from current bud-
gets in agencies to the retirement system and minimize the number of personnel
fired. The Environmental Protection Agency immediately implemented such a
program, and OMB urged the passage of legislation to increase payout maximums
from $25,000 to $40,000 to further increase spending under the “cuts.” President
Clinton’s OMB had introduced a similar buyout that cost the Treasury $2.8 billion,
mostly for those who were going to retire anyway. Moreover, when a new employee
is hired to fill a job recently vacated in a buyout, the government for a time is paying
two people to fill one job.

What is needed at the beginning is a freeze on all top career-position hiring
to prevent “burrowing-in” by outgoing political appointees. Moreover, four fac-
tors determine the order in which employees are protected during layoffs: tenure,
veterans’ preference, seniority, and performance in that order of importance.
Despite several attempts in the House of Representatives during the Trump years
to enact legislation that would modestly increase the weight given to performance
over time-of-service, the fierce opposition by federal managers associations and
unions representing long-serving but not necessarily well-performing constituents
explains why the bills failed to advance. A determined President should insist that
performance be first and be wary of costly types of reductions-in-force.
Impenetrable Bureaucracy. The GAO has identified almost a hundred actions
that the executive branch or Congress could take to improve efficiency and effec-
tiveness across 37 areas that span a broad range of government missions and
functions. It identified 33 actions to address mission fragmentation, overlap, and
duplication in the 12 areas of defense, economic development, health, homeland
security, and information technology. It also identified 59 other opportunities for
executive agencies or Congress to reduce the cost of government operations or
enhance revenue collection across 25 areas of government.20


A logical place to begin would be to identify and eliminate functions and pro-
grams that are duplicated across Cabinet departments or spread across multiple
agencies. Congress hoped to help this effort by passing the Government Perfor-
mance and Results Act of 1993,21 which required all federal agencies to define
their missions, establish goals and objectives, and measure and report their per-
formance to Congress. Three decades of endless time-consuming reports later,
the government continues to grow but with more paper and little change either
in performance or in the number of levels between government and the people.
The Brookings Institution’s Paul Light emphasizes the importance of the
increasing number of levels between the top heads of departments and the people
at the bottom who receive the products of government decision-making. He esti-
mates that there are perhaps 50 or more levels of impenetrable bureaucracy and no
way other than imperfect performance appraisals to communicate between them.22
The Trump Administration proposed some possible consolidations, but these
were not received favorably in Congress, whose approval is necessary for most such
proposals. The best solution is to cut functions and budgets and devolve respon-
sibilities. That is a challenge primarily for Presidents, Congress, and the entire
government, but the OPM still needs to lead the way governmentwide in managing
personnel properly even in any future smaller government.

Creating a Responsible Career Management Service. The people elect a
President who is charged by Article 2, Section 3 of the Constitution23 with seeing
that the laws are “faithfully executed” with his political appointees democratically
linked to that legitimizing responsibility. An autonomous bureaucracy has neither independent constitutional status nor separate moral legitimacy. Therefore, career civil servants by themselves should not lead major policy changes and reforms.
The creation of the Senior Executive Service was the top career change intro-
duced by the 1978 Carter–Campbell Civil Service Reform Act. Its aim was to
professionalize the career service and make it more responsible to the democrat-
ically elected commander in chief and his political appointees while respecting the
rights due to career employees, very much including those in the top positions. The
new SES would allow management to be more flexible in filling and reassigning
executive positions and locations beyond narrow specialties for more efficient
mission accomplishment and would provide pay and large bonuses to motivate
career performance.

The desire to infiltrate political appointees improperly into the high career
civil service has been widespread in every Administration, whether Democrat or
Republican. Democratic Administrations, however, are typically more successful
because they require the cooperation of careerists, who generally lean heavily to
the Left. Such burrowing-in requires career job descriptions for new positions that
closely mirror the functions of a political appointee; a special hiring authority that
allows the bypassing of veterans’ preference as well as other preference categories;
and the ability to frustrate career candidates from taking the desired position.
President Reagan’s OPM began by limiting such SES burrowing-in, arguing
that the proper course was to create and fill political positions. This simultane-
ously promotes the CSRA principle of political leadership of the bureaucracy and
respects the professional autonomy of the career service. But this requires that
career SES employees should respect political rights too. Actions such as career
staff reserving excessive numbers of key policy positions as “career reserved” to
deny them to noncareer SES employees frustrate CSRA intent. Another evasion
is the general domination by career staff on SES personnel evaluation boards, the
opposite of noncareer executives dominating these critical meeting discussions
as expected in the SES. Career training also often underplays the political role in
leadership and inculcates career-first policy and value viewpoints.

Frustrated with these activities by top career executives, the Trump Administration issued Executive Order 1395724 to make career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a presidential transition but
who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating
and implementing executive branch policy and programs an exception to the com-
petitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions under a new Schedule
F. It ordered the Director of OPM and agency heads to set procedures to prepare
lists of such confidential, policy-determining, policymaking, or policy-advocating
positions and prepare procedures to create exceptions from civil service rules when
careerists hold such positions, from which they can relocate back to the regular
civil service after such service. The order was subsequently reversed by President

Executive Order 13836, encouraging agencies to renegotiate all union
collective bargaining agreements to ensure consistency with the law and
respect for management rights;26
Executive Order 13837, encouraging agencies to prevent union
representatives from using official time preparing or pursuing grievances or
from engaging in other union activity on government time;27 and
Executive Order 13839, encouraging agencies both to limit labor grievances
on removals from service or on challenging performance appraisals and to
prioritize performance over seniority when deciding who should be retained
following reductions-in-force.28

Biden25 at the demand of the civil service associations and unions. It should be
reinstated, but SES responsibility should come first.
Managing Personnel in a Union Environment. Historically, unions were
thought to be incompatible with government management. There is a natural limit
to the bargaining power of private-sector unions, but the financial bottom line of
public-sector unions is not similarly constrained. If private-sector unions push
too hard a bargain, they can so harm a company or so reduce efficiency that their
employer is forced to go out of business and eliminate union jobs altogether. There
is no such limit in government, which cannot go out of business, so demands can
be excessive without negatively affecting employee and union bottom lines.
Even Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt considered union representa-
tion in the federal government to be incompatible with democracy. Striking and
even threats of bargaining and delay were considered acts against the people and
thus improper. It was not until President John Kennedy that union representation
in the federal government was recognized—and then merely by executive order.
Labor bargaining was not set in statute until the Carter Administration was forced
by Congress to do so in order to pass the CSRA, although all bargaining was placed
under OPM review.

The CSRA was able to maintain strong management rights for the OPM and
agencies and forbade collective bargaining on pay and benefits as well as manage-
ment prerogatives. Over time, OPM, FLRA, and agencies’ personnel offices and
courts, especially in Democratic Administrations, narrowed management rights
so that labor bargaining expanded as management rights contracted. But the man-
agement rights are still in statute, have been enforced by some Administrations,
and should be enforced again by any future OPM and agency managements, which
should not be intimidated by union power.
Rather than being daunted, President Trump issued three executive orders:﻿

All were revoked by the Biden Administration29 and should be reinstated by the
next Administration, to include the immediate appointment of the FLRA General
Counsel and reactivation of the Impasses Panel.

Congress should also consider whether public-sector unions are appropriate
in the first place. The bipartisan consensus up until the middle of the 20th cen-
tury held that these unions were not compatible with constitutional government.30
After more than half a century of experience with public-sector union frustrations
of good government management, it is hard to avoid reaching the same conclusion.


### Fully Staffing the Ranks of Political Appointees

The President must rely legally on his top department and agency officials to run the government and on top White House staff employees to coordinate operations through regular Cabinet and other meetings and communications. Without this political leadership, the career civil service becomes empowered to lead the executive branch without democratic legitimacy. While many obstacles stand in his way, a President is constitutionally and statutorily required to fill the top political positions in the executive branch both to assist him and to provide overall legitimacy.

Most Presidents have had some difficulty obtaining congressional approval of
their appointees, but this has worsened recently. After the 2016 election, President
Trump faced special hostility from the opposition party and the media in getting
his appointees confirmed or even considered by the Senate. His early Office of
Presidential Personnel (PPO) did not generally remove political appointees from
the previous Administration but instead relied mostly on prior political appoin-
tees and career civil servants to run the government. Such a reliance on holdovers
and bureaucrats led to a lack of agency control and the absolute refusal of the
Acting Attorney General from the Obama Administration to obey a direct order
from the President.

Under the early PPO, the Trump Administration appointed fewer political
appointees in its first few months in office than had been appointed in any recent
presidency, partly because of historically high partisan congressional obstructions
but also because several officials announced that they preferred fewer political
appointees in the agencies as a way to cut federal spending. Whatever the reasoning,
this had the effect of permanently hampering the rollout of the new President’s
agenda. Thus, in those critical early years, much of the government relied on senior
careerists and holdover Obama appointees to carry out the sensitive responsibili-
ties that would otherwise belong to the new President’s appointees.


Fortunately, the later PPO, OPM, and Senate leadership began to cooperate to
build a strong team to implement the President’s personnel appointment agenda.
Any new Administration would be wise to learn that it will need a full cadre of
sound political appointees from the beginning if it expects to direct this enormous
federal bureaucracy. A close relationship between the PPO at the White House
and the OPM, coordinating with agency assistant secretaries of administration and PPO’s chosen White House Liaisons and their staff at each agency, is essential to the management of this large, multilevel, resistant, and bureaucratic challenge.
If “personnel is policy” is to be our general guide, it would make sense to give the
President direct supervision of the bureaucracy with the OPM Director available
in his Cabinet.


## A Reformed Bureucracy

Today, the federal government’s bureaucracy cannot even meet its own civil
service ideals. The merit criteria of ability, knowledge, and skills are no longer the
basis for recruitment, selection, or advancement, while pay and benefits for com-
parable work are substantially above those in the private sector. Retention is not
based primarily on performance, and for the most part, inadequate performance
is not appraised, corrected, or punished.

The authors have made many suggestions here that, if implemented, could bring that bureaucracy more under control and enable it to work more efficiently and responsibly, which is especially required for the half of civilian government that administers its undeniable responsibilities for defense and foreign affairs. While a better administered central bureaucracy is crucial for both those and domestic responsibilities, the problem of properly running the government goes beyond simple bureaucratic administration. The specific deficiencies of the fed- eral bureaucracy—size, levels of organization, inefficiency, expense, and lack of responsiveness to political leadership—are rooted in the progressive ideology that unelected experts can and should be trusted to promote the general welfare in just about every area of social life.

The Constitution, however, reserved a few enumerated powers to the federal
government while leaving the great majority of domestic activities to state, local,
and private governance. As James Madison explained: “The powers reserved to
the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of
affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal
order, improvement and prosperity of the state.”31 Modern progressive politics
has simply given the national government more to do than the complex separa-
tion-of-powers Constitution allows.

That progressive system has broken down in our time, and the only real solution
is for the national government to do less: to decentralize and privatize as much as
possible and then ensure that the remaining bureaucracy is managed effectively
along the lines of the enduring principles set out in detail here.
