VETERANS BENEFITS ADMINISTRATION (VBA)

Needed Reforms

The most evident and ongoing concern is the complexity of benefits, which
can lead to confusion for the veteran and, if not mitigated early in the veteran’s
interactions, long-term distrust of and animosity toward the VA. Wholesale ben-
efits reform is unnecessary and politically a “third rail,” but effective managerial approaches and technology tools that currently exist in the private sector could
be employed to improve existing VBA activities.

This problem is most pronounced in the disability claims process, which needs
more and better management attention focused on streamlining the procedures
involved in processing claims and administering benefits. The VA must improve
timeliness of claim adjudication and benefits delivery: Veterans want the VBA
to provide timely responses to requests for benefits support, render empathetic
customer service and understandable explanations of those benefits, and deliver
those benefits without frustrating delays (weeks, not months).


Develop a new pilot “Express 30” commitment for a veteran’s first fully
developed disability compensation claim and organize the VBA to complete
the first claim in 30 days.
Hire more private companies to perform disability medical examinations.
Delays in completing the examinations could be eliminated with more
external capacity.

Increase automation. Hiring additional staff to process claims is costly,
is inflexible, and has yielded mixed results. Attempting to change laws
and regulations simply to adjudicate claims would be a herculean effort
given their complexity. The best way to provide benefits faster and more
accurately is by using technology to perform most of the work. Technology
currently exists in the private sector, but the VBA lacks the expertise
to use it. This would be more of an organizational challenge than a
technology hurdle.

Reduce improper payment and fraud. About $500 million is improperly
paid out each year. Better tools, training, and management could reduce this
substantially, but rule changes at the departmental level would be needed.
Budget

The VA’s Schedule for Rating Disabilities (VASRD) has assigned disability
ratings to a growing number of health conditions over time; some are tenuously
related or wholly unrelated to military service. The further growth in presumptive
service-connected medical conditions pursued by Congress and Veteran Service
Organizations, begun with Agent Orange and most recently for Burn Pits/Airborne


Identify performance targets for benefits, report publicly on actual
performance each quarter, and use these metrics to drive consistent
improvement.
Toxins, has led to historic increases in mandatory VBA spending in recent years.
The VA has a time-phased plan to reassess the VASRD and its ratings for com-
pensation, but this internal process can be slow and laborious, requires Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) approvals, and can become politically charged
both in Congress and with VSOs.


The next Administration should explore how VASRD reviews could be
accelerated with clearance from OMB to target significant cost savings from
revising disability rating awards for future claimants while preserving them
fully or partially for existing claimants.
The VBA’s Information Technology top-line budget should be reexamined
and reassessed in light of the need for expanded automation across
the enterprise.
Traditionally, VHA captures the large majority of VA IT funding. The VBA
needs to make the case for a larger IT budget with clear requirements to
support that request.


Pursue reforms of the Human Capital Management process and operations
within the VBA to build a more blended workforce with more contractors to
process claims. This would free federal employees to perform other duties
and be involved solely with the final decision to award benefits.
Improve the VBA acquisition workforce. The VBA needs more world-class
contractor support. Currently, few of the top companies have contracts with
the VBA, and the VBA needs to conduct more outreach to the private sector
through senior leader engagement and industry conferences.
To identify more effective and efficient ways to complete claims, establish a
knowledge exchange program with top-tier private-sector companies that
do similar work. The VBA is fundamentally a financial services organization.
A significant amount of its work has a private-sector analogue that could be
leveraged to improve service to veterans.

For most of its existence, the VBA has been a risk-averse, insular, paper-based
organization, implementing technology only over the past decade. This
insularity has led to a predominantly “build it ourselves” approach, partly
because VBA staff has limited experience or insight into current private-
sector tools and methods and partly because the VBA struggles to compete

with the VHA for IT funding. Senior executive leadership needs more
innovators and trail blazers—qualities that have sometimes been lacking
in the VBA’s senior ranks. Recruiting a more relevantly knowledgeable and
technologically savvy team, along with robust political control of the VA, could
bring about better solutions to the VBA’s workflow challenges.
HUMAN RESOURCES AND ADMINISTRATION (HRA)
Needed Reforms


Rescind all delegations of authority promulgated by the VA under the prior
Administration.
Transfer all career SES out of PA/PAS-designated positions on the first day
and ensure political control of the VA.
Take a close and analytically critical look at where hybrid and remote work
is a net positive as a functional necessity and where in-person collaboration
and presence will help to instill a strong work ethic and a more cohesive
environment for productivity from the Office of the Secretary across the
headquarters enterprise.
﻿

The COVID-19 pandemic spurred a significant shift to hybrid and telework
options for large segments of the staff in the Washington headquarters, in its sat-
ellites, and at some VBA Regional Offices. The “remote work” expectation has
been amplified and formalized within the Biden Administration team at VA to
the extent that the current Secretary, Deputy Secretary, and their staffs are not “in
office” as a matter of a routine presence while VA staff in Washington, D.C., have
limited in-person meetings, relying more frequently on video conference calls. The
short-term and long-term effects of this policy on the department are unknown,
but generally, the policy may be undermining the cohesiveness and competencies
of some staff functions and diluting general organizational accountability and
responsiveness.
Budget

Expedite the acquisition of a new Human Resources Information
Technology (HRIT) system. The current system is not user-friendly; has
minimal fusion, middle-ware capacity; and is not conducive to data driven
personnel decisions. Personnel data needs to be organized and managed
to its full potential. The HRIT system, associated databases, and other
“shadow” personnel systems have no shortage of data; the problem comes
with effective management of the data.


Broaden pay and benefits in critical VA skill sets (beyond medical care
occupations) to be more competitive with private-sector industry. IT,
acquisition, cyber, and economists are some examples of skill sets that
are difficult for the VA to recruit, largely because of the limitations of
federal pay scales.
Continue to maximize the use of new VA hiring and pay authorities provided
by Congress in the RAISE Act6 and PACT Act7 as well as existing authorities in
student loan forgiveness and the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.
Personnel


Foster a culture that is mission (veteran) driven, alert, engaged, and
habitually responsive to the veteran, and structure an environment that
promotes a flexible and agile workplace.
Increase employee satisfaction/experience to improve recruitment and
retention of VA personnel. Go beyond the traditional focus on the extrinsic
(monetary pay and bonuses) and seek creative ways to instill teamwork,
loyalty, and pride.
Train leaders and managers to promote an energized and productive
workplace culture and reward those who do it well. Ensure that senior
leaders (SES) set the proper example.
Focus more attention on hiring veterans and military spouses. The
percentage of veterans employed at VA has been declining.
Support the White House Office of Presidential Personnel (PPO) in
identifying a fully vetted roster of candidates to assume all key positions at
VA well ahead of formal nominations. The VA is the second-largest federal
agency, yet it is authorized a woefully small number of PA/PAS positions
when compared to other agencies of lesser size. Congress and the Office of
Personnel Management should be engaged on ways to provide authorities
for a higher number of non-career PA positions. The White House PPO can
be inclined to discount the VA’s importance, but given the political attention
that VA can generate for Congress and the media, PPO should understand
the importance of finding talented political appointees to serve at VA.
Increase the number and utilization of Limited Term Appointment Senior
Executive Service positions for up to three years to work on special projects
to ensure talent refreshment, talent acquisition, and flexibility.

Manage the relationship with organized labor effectively and proactively.
1.
Ensure that any agenda that includes labor/civil service reform in the VA
has a clear direction from the Secretarial level, support from the General
Counsel, alignment with the Assistant Secretary for Human Resources
and Administration, and a unified and strong political will to carry it out.
Without those elements, labor reforms are very difficult to accomplish.
2. Ensure that each senior leader in the process gets buy-in from reform-
minded career employees willing to accept and support change. Those
mid-level and senior-level managers exist, but they will need to be
identified early and shown trust and confidence.
3. Ensure that the White House communicates the labor reform agenda
swiftly. Trump Administration executive orders on civil service reform
(official time, government-furnished office space) were issued too late,
and departments and agencies were not prepared to execute them.
5. Ensure that the White House is prepared to support a concerted
and deliberate effort on implementation to avoid perceptions of a
disconnected strategy and disaggregated effort.
6. Remain mindful of which labor contracts end, when they end, and what
the agency’s goals for renegotiation are. If not done effectively, contract
end dates will be missed or lack notification. It is therefore essential to
have a clear strategy with respect to what leadership wants from a new
contract: Do not make the perfect the enemy of the good in contract
negotiations.
l
Work with Congress to sunset the Office of Accountability and
Whistleblower Protection (OAWP). OAWP was well intentioned when
formed, but it is redundant with the activities of supervisors as well as
equal employment opportunity, Office of the Inspector General, Office of
Special Counsel, and other policies, programs, and procedures for holding
employees accountable. This redundancy results in lengthy investigations,
gaps in coverage, and an overall ineffective method of employee and
supervisor accountability.


4. Anticipate the inevitable opportunities for legal challenges from
organized labor, and be prepared for them to happen and be dragged
out—which makes early, decisive timing all the more important.
Consider decoupling HRA and the Office of Security and Preparedness
(OSP). When Congress directed that the OAWP be established, it did not
include authorities for a new Assistant Secretary position; consequently, the
OSP was combined with HRA to free a PAS position. The functions of HRA
and OSP are dissimilar and thus create an organization that is difficult to
staff with the talent needed to execute both missions effectively.
