A new conservative Administration can and should implement the following reforms that focus on both people24 and process.25 Implementation of these reforms simply requires courageous political leadership across all of HUD’s key
appointed positions. 


HUD political leadership should immediately assign all delegated powers
to politically appointed PDAS, DAS, and other office leadership positions;
change any current career leadership positions into political and non-career
appointment positions; and use Senior Executive Service (SES) transfers to
install motivated and aligned leadership.

The President should issue an executive order making the HUD Secretary
a member of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which will
gain broader oversight authorities to address foreign threats, particularly
from China with oversight of foreign ownership of real estate in both rental
and ownership markets of single-family and multifamily housing,26 with
trillions worth of real estate secured across HUD’s portfolio.

The Secretary should initiate a HUD task force consisting of politically appointed personnel to identify and reverse all actions taken by the Biden Administration to advance progressive ideology.27

The Office of the Secretary or the leadership in the Office of General
Counsel should conduct a thorough review of all subregulatory guidance
that has been instituted outside of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).
Additionally, departmental leadership should:

1.
Immediately end the Biden Administration’s Property Appraisal and
Valuation Equity (PAVE) policies and reverse any Biden Administration
actions that threaten to undermine the integrity of real estate appraisals.28
2. Repeal climate change initiatives and spending in the department’s
budget request.29
— 508 —Department of Housing and Urban Development
3. Repeal the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) regulation
reinstituted under the Biden Administration30 and any other uses of
special-purpose credit authorities to further equity.31
4. Eliminate the new Housing Supply Fund.32

The Office of the Secretary should execute regulatory and subregulatory
guidance actions, across HUD programs and applicable to all relevant
stakeholders, that would restrict program eligibility when admission
would threaten the protection of the life and health of individuals and
fail to encourage upward mobility and economic advancement through
household self-sufficiency. Where admissible in regulatory action, HUD
should implement reforms reducing the implicit anti-marriage bias in
housing assistance programs,34 strengthen work and work-readiness
requirements,35 implement maximum term limits for residents in PBRA
and TBRA programs,36 and end Housing First37 policies so that the
department prioritizes mental health and substance abuse issues before
jumping to permanent interventions in homelessness.38 Notwithstanding
administrative reforms, Congress should enact legislation that protects
life and eliminates provisions in federal housing and welfare benefits
policies that discourage work, marriage, and meaningful paths to upward
economic mobility.

The AS or PDAS for the Office of Policy Development and Research should
suspend all external research and evaluation grants in the Office of Policy
Development and Research and end or realign to another office any
functions that are not involved in the collection and use of data and survey
administration functions and do not facilitate the execution of regulatory
impact analysis studies.

The Office of the Secretary should recommence proposed regulation put
forward under the Trump Administration that would prohibit noncitizens,
including all mixed-status families, from living in all federally assisted
housing.33 HUD’s statutory obligations include providing housing for
American citizens who are in need. HUD reforms must also ensure
alignment with reforms implemented by other federal agencies where
immigration status impacts public programs, certainly to include any
reforms in the Public Charge regulatory framework administered by the U.S.
Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Local welfare organizations, not
the federal government, should step up to provide welfare for the housing of
noncitizens.

FHA leadership should increase the mortgage insurance premium (MIP) for
all products above 20-year terms and maintain MIP for all products below
20-year terms and all refinances. FHA should encourage wealth-building
homeownership opportunities, which can be accomplished best through
shorter-duration mortgages.39 Ideally, Congress would contemplate a
fundamental revision of FHA’s statutory restriction of single-family housing
mortgage insurance to first-time homebuyers.40 This would include (with
support from HUD leadership):
1.
Moving the Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECM) program once
again to its own special risk insurance fund.
2. Revising loan limit determinations.
3. Providing statutory flexibility for shorter-term products that amortize
principal earlier and faster.
Statutorily restricting eligibility for first-time homebuyers and abandoning
the affirmative obligation authorities erected for the single-family housing
programs across federal agencies and government-sponsored enterprises.41

The HUD Secretary should move the HUD Real Estate Assessment Center
(REAC) from PIH to the Office of Housing, which already implements
property standards in its multifamily housing lending programs through
the multifamily accelerated processing (MAP) lending guidelines. Giving
HUD the authority to streamline the enforcement of compliance with
housing standards across the federal government and flexibility for physical
inspections through private accreditation should also be considered.
HUD should maintain its requested budget authority for modernization
initiatives that are applicable to the Office of the Chief Information Officer
and program offices across the department.


## LONGER-TERM POLICY REFORM CONSIDERATIONS42

Congress has charged HUD principally with mandates for construction of the
nation’s affordable housing stock in addition to setting and enforcing standards
for decent housing and fair housing enforcement. Regardless of intent, HUD’s
efforts have yielded mixed results at best. Even today, more than a half-century
after Congress put enforcement of so-called fair housing in the hands of the HUD
bureaucracy, implementation of this policy is muddled by the repeated applica-
tion of affirmative race-based policies. Also, the production mandate for HUD’s housing portfolio has waned for decades with the department effectively working to maintain the public housing portfolio from the late 1990s when the Faircloth
Amendment capped HUD’s public housing portfolio.43

Longer-term reforms of HUD rental assistance programs should encourage
choice and competition for renters, encourage participation by landlords where
appropriate,44 and encourage all non-elderly, able-bodied adults to move toward
self-sufficiency. This can be pursued through regulations and legislative reforms
that seek to strengthen work requirements, limit the period during which house-
holds are eligible for housing benefits, and add flexibility to rent payment terms
to facilitate the movement of households toward self-sufficiency.

Obviously, using government vouchers or other such programs to expand hous-
ing choice options is not without its downsides. The turn toward mobility vouchers
constitutes an abandonment of America’s public housing stock, and efforts to
increase competition in the public housing market must not come at the expense
of local autonomy and the ability of cities, towns, neighborhoods, and commu-
nities to choose for themselves the sort of housing they want to allow. Freedom
of association and self-government at the most local level possible must remain
primary considerations in any conservative effort to increase competition in the
public housing market.

Congress should also consider those areas in which federal policy negatively
interacts with private markets, including when federal policy crowds out pri-
vate-sector development and exacerbates affordability challenges that persist
across the nation. It is essential that legislation provides states and localities max-
imal flexibility to pursue locally designed policies and minimize the likelihood of
federal preemption of local land use and zoning decisions.

In the same manner, Congress should prioritize any and all legislative support
for the single-family home. Homeownership forms the backbone of the American
Dream. The purchase of a home is the largest investment most Americans will
make in their lifetimes, and homeownership remains the most accessible way to
build generational wealth for millions of Americans. For these reasons, American
homeowners and citizens know best what is in the interest of their neighborhoods
and communities. Localities rather than the federal government must have the
final say in zoning laws and regulations, and a conservative Administration should
oppose any efforts to weaken single-family zoning. Along the same lines, Congress
can propose tax credits for the renovation or repair of housing stock in rural areas
so that more Americans are able to access the American Dream of homeownership.


Additionally, enhanced statutory authorities for local autonomy should extend
to the prioritizing of federal rental assistance subsidies that emphasize choice and
mobility in housing voucher subsidies over static, site-based subsidies and provide
authority for maximal flexibility to direct PHA land sales that involve the existing
stock of public housing units. Congress must consider the future of the public﻿

housing model. At best, any new public investments will provide maintenance
funds to bring substandard housing units and properties up to livability standards
but will still fail to address larger aims of upward mobility and dynamism for local
housing markets where land can be sold by PHAs and put to greater economic
use, thereby benefiting entire local economies through greater private investment,
productivity and employment opportunities, and increased tax revenue.

Any long-term view of HUD’s future must include maintaining the strong
financial operations and reliable reporting that are needed to run a $50 billion-
per-year agency. Before the Trump Administration, HUD effectively did not have
a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) for eight years, and HUD’s financial infrastructure
inevitably deteriorated. The department’s auditors were unable to conclude that
HUD’s internal operations were producing accurate financial reporting. The audi-
tors had identified multiple material weaknesses and significant deficiencies in
the department’s internal financial controls. Overall, the deterioration of HUD’s
financial infrastructure led to a lack of accountability with respect to the use of
taxpayer funds as well as to pervasive difficulties with operations and program
implementation.

However, by hiring a new CFO from the private sector with a proven track record
of visionary leadership, HUD was able to implement an agencywide governance
structure that improved its financial processes and internal controls and harnessed
the power of innovative new technologies to bring a modernized business mindset
to the agency’s financial infrastructure. By the end of the Trump Administration,
for the first time in nearly a decade, HUD was able to address all of its previously
identified material weaknesses, and the auditors were able to issue their first clean
audit report on HUD’s financial statements and internal controls.

Finally, and more fundamentally, Congress could consider a wholesale overhaul
of HUD that contemplates devolving many HUD functions to states and localities
with any remaining federal functions consolidated to other federal agencies (for
example, by transferring loan guarantee programs to SBA; moving Indian housing
programs to the Department of the Interior; moving rental assistance, mortgage
insurance programs, and GNMA to a redesignated Housing and Home Finance
Agency). Generally, this reform path could consolidate some programs, elimi-
nate others that have failed to produce meaningful long-run results, and narrow
the scope of many programs so that they are closer to what they were when they
were created.
