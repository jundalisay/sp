Cap and phase down the H-2A visa program. Congress should
immediately cap this program at its current levels and establish a
schedule for its gradual and predictable phasedown over the subsequent
10 to 20 years, producing the necessary incentives for the industry to
invest in raising productivity, including through capital investment in
agricultural equipment, and increasing employment for Americans in the
agricultural sector.

Encourage the establishment of an industry consortium and match
funding. Congress should also encourage the establishment of an industry
consortium of agricultural equipment producers and other automation and
robotics firms interested in entering the sector and match funding invested
by the industry, with intellectual property developed within the consortium
freely available to all participants.

A labor agenda focused on the strength of American families must put American
workers first. As the family necessarily puts the interests of its members first, so
too the United States must put the interests of American workers first.
Immigration. The H-2A visa, meant to allow temporary agricultural work-
ers into the United States, also suffers frequent employer abuse. The low cost of
H-2A workers undercuts American workers in agricultural employment. The H-2A
program is not subject to any statutory numerical cap and has been expanding in
recent years, surpassing 200,000 visa issuances for the first time in 2019.

Alternative View. Some conservatives believe that temporary worker programs
help to fill jobs that Americans will not fill, prevent illegal immigration by giving
farmers and others who hire low-skilled labor access to workers, and keep down
the prices of food and other products and services produced by the temporary
workers. Some credibly argue that, absent the H-2A program, many farmers would
have to drastically increase wages, raising the price of food for all Americans, and
that even such wage increases may not be sufficient to attract enough temporary
American workers to complete the necessary farm tasks to get food products to
market since those jobs are, by their nature, seasonal. Those who share this view
argue that any plan to phase out the program should weigh the program’s current
costs (relatively low) and the program’s current benefits (makes American farming
more profitable and sustainable while keeping down food costs).
﻿
l
Phase out the H-2B visa program. The H-2B visa, for nonagricultural
seasonal workers, suffers from many of the same harms and abuses as H-2A,
albeit of lesser scope because of its cap and distribution across many sectors.
Congress should immediately cap this program at its current levels and
establish a schedule for its gradual and predictable phasedown over no more
than 10 years.

Alternative View. As with the H-2A program, some conservatives see the H-2B
program as a valuable program that provides low-cost temporary workers in jobs
that American companies, by and large, cannot find enough American workers to
fill (e.g., tourist season childcare providers at ski resorts, swimming instructors at
summer camps, housekeepers and groundskeepers at amusement parks, and extra
summer cooks at restaurants that serve national park patrons).These seasonal
jobs are less desirable to Americans who predominantly prefer year-round work.
Labor shortages after the pandemic support this belief. Absent the H-2B program,
many of these seasonal businesses would be forced to cut their hours or even close
altogether. Any plan to phase out the program should weigh the program's current
costs (relatively low) and the program’s current benefits (makes seasonal business
more feasible).

Hire American Requirements. When government purchases goods or ser-
vices, if at all possible, not only should the company be an American company
and the products be manufactured in America, but the companies should also be
encouraged to hire American workers. Likewise, private employers should be free
to prefer our own countrymen.

Congress should mandate that all new federal contracts require at
least 70 percent of the contractor’s employees to be U.S. citizens, with
the percentage increasing to at least 95 percent over a 10-year period.


Congress must amend the law so that employers can again have the
freedom to make hiring Americans a priority. Despite the significant
advantages that preferring citizens over (work-authorized) aliens in hiring
would provide to American workers, businesses, and the country at large,
such a practice has been illegal since 1986.25 This makes no sense.
Alternative View Some conservatives believe that the government has a duty to
limit its spending in order to limit how much it takes from American families. This
means that when the government spends money, it must find the most econom-
ical and effective way to do so. Excessive government spending will be borne by
American workers and families through reduced incomes and purchasing power.
There may be good reasons to require a certain percentage of American workers on
federal contracts, but those decisions should be based on economy and efficiency
as opposed to arbitrary quotas.

Visa Fraud. American businesses that commit visa fraud and hire illegal immi-
grants should not be the beneficiaries of federal spending. But a 2020 report by
the Department of Labor’s Office of Inspector General (OIG) examined the depart-
ment’s process for excluding employers who commit visa fraud and abuse from
federal contracts and found much to be desired.
To protect the American workforce from unscrupulous immigration
lawyers, employers, and labor brokers, the department must
follow the recommendations of the OIG and institute more robust
investigations for suspected visa fraud and speedier debarments for
those found guilty.


### INTERNATIONAL LABOR POLICY

Leveling the International Playing Field for Workers. As recent decades
of intense import competition and offshoring have made clear, American workers
suffer when the U.S. opens its markets to foreign nations’ minimal labor standards
and exploitative conditions. While federal law already prohibits the importation of
goods produced with forced labor, the prohibitions are toothless without effective
means of enforcement and cover only the most basic of workers’ rights. The Trump
Administration and its United States Trade Representative (USTR) took unprece-
dented steps to redress the issue for workers. The U.S.–Mexico–Canada Agreement
(USMCA) contained the strongest and most far-reaching labor provisions of any
free trade agreement (FTA), with protections and commitments to reduce labor
abuses and raise wages. It also established new modes of enforcement.
For future FTAs, the USTR should replicate the labor provisions of USMCA,
especially the provisions to:


Eliminate all forms of forced or compulsory labor.
Protect workers’ rights to organize and participate voluntarily in a
union without employer interference or discrimination.
Create a rapid-response mechanism to provide for an independent
panel investigation of denial of labor rights at covered facilities.
Shift the burden of proof by presuming that an alleged violation
affects trade and investment, unless otherwise demonstrated.
﻿
For future authorizations of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), the President
should urge Congress to:
lCreate mechanisms for supply-chain transparency.
lInstitute a general prohibition on forced labor conditions.
Investigate Foreign Labor Violations That Undermine American Work-
ers. The United States’ embrace of globalization has exposed American workers to
unfair competition from nations with cheap, abundant, and often exploited labor.
American workers have, as a consequence, seen their earning power erode. While
negotiating stronger trade agreements with robust labor provisions should be the
primary tool with which to regulate international labor competition, the federal
government can also take steps to identify the worst labor abuses and rule breakers.
DOL’s Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) plays a critical role in monitor-
ing and enforcing the labor provisions of U.S. trade agreements and trade preference
programs as well as investigating child labor and human trafficking violations.

The next Administration should focus ILAB investigations on
foreign labor violations that do the most to damage American
workers’ earning power, specifically regimes that engage in child and
forced labor, fail to protect workers’ organizing rights, and permit
hazardous or otherwise exploitative working conditions.
Alternative/Additional View. Conservatives share a belief in protecting and pro-
moting American workers and their families and orienting international policies with
Americans’ interests first. Some conservatives believe that the best way to put Amer-
ica first is by making America more attractive. In addition to restrictions imposed
on other countries, removing existing barriers to American manufacturing, employ-
ment, and commerce can help American workers, entrepreneurs, and families.


### ORGANIZATIONAL AGENDA

Budget

Reduce the agencies’ budgets to the low end of the historical
average. The Trump Administration’s FY 2020 request, $10.9 billion,
would provide a workable target for spending reductions for DOL,
for example.
Spending reductions should occur primarily in the Employment and
Training Administration (ETA).
Focus health and safety inspections on egregious offenders, as other
inspections are often abused and usurp state and local government
prerogatives.

Personnel

Appoint new EEOC and NLRB general counsels on Day One. The Biden
Administration broke significant precedent by firing the EEOC and NLRB
general counsels despite their term appointments. The next Administration
should do the same and expand on the Biden Administration’s new
precedent by refusing to acknowledge terms in other offices, where
applicable, and installing acting or full new officers immediately.
Implement a hiring freeze for career officials. A hiring freeze imposes
financial discipline on agencies’ personnel costs and reduces agency bloat.
Office of Compliance Initiatives

DOL should fully staff the Office of Compliance Initiatives (OCI),
which was reopened by the Trump Administration after the Obama
Administration closed its predecessor down. OCI educates employers
and workers on their rights, responsibilities, and available recourse under
the many statutes, rules, and regulations administered by DOL. Most
businesses want to follow the law and OCI exists to make knowing the rules
easier, which leads to increased compliance.


Maximize hiring of political appointees. At its best, the Trump
Administration Department of Labor worked with up to 150 political
appointees. That is still a tiny percentage of the department. The number of
political appointees should be maximized in order to improve the political
accountability of the department.
Improve Visa-Related Labor-Market Monitoring
DOL’s Office of Foreign Labor Certification plays an important role in the
approval of H-visa applications, but it is currently housed in the Employment and
Training Administration, which is DOL’s primary grant-making division.

OFLC should be moved out of ETA and made directly accountable to
the Secretary with a politically accountable Director.

CONCLUSION

The good of the American family is at the heart of conservative labor policy
recommendations. The longstanding tradition of a strong work ethic in American
culture must be encouraged and strengthened by policies that promote family-sus-
taining jobs. By eliminating the policies promoted by the DEI agenda, promoting
pro-life policies that support family life, expanding available apprenticeship
programs including by encouraging the role of religious organizations in appren-
ticeships, making family-sustaining jobs accessible, simplifying employment
requirements, and allowing employers to prefer American citizens when making
hiring decisions, among the other policy recommendations discussed above, we
can begin to secure a future in which the American worker, and by extension the
American family, can thrive and prosper.
