This proposal urges the new Administration to end the abuse of FSA’s loan for-
giveness programs, to manage the federal student loan portfolio in a professional
way, and to work with Congress for a long-term overhaul of the program for the
benefit of students and taxpayers.

The new Administration must end the prior Administration’s abuse
of the agency’s payment pause and HEA loan forgiveness programs,
including borrower defense to repayment, closed school discharge,
and Public Service Loan Forgiveness.

The new Administration should also take immediate steps to
commence the rulemaking process to rescind or substantially modify
the prior Administration’s HEA regulations.
The federal government does not have the proper incentives to
make sound lending decisions, so the new Administration should
consider returning to a system in which private lenders, backed
by government guarantees, would compete to offer student loans,
including subsidized and unsubsidized, loans. This would allow for market prices and signals to influence educational borrowing, introducing
consumer-driven accountability into higher education. Pell grants should
retain their current voucher-like structure.

If Congress is unwilling to reform federal student aid, then the next Adminis-
tration should consider the following reforms:
lSwitch to fair-value accounting from FCRA accounting, and
lConsolidate all federal loan programs into one new program that

1.
Utilizes income-driven repayment,
2. Includes no interest rate subsidies or loan forgiveness,
3. Includes annual and aggregate limits on borrowing, and
4.
Requires “skin in the game” from colleges to help hold them
accountable for loan repayment.
l
As detailed in Section III, the next Administration should work
with Congress to spin off federal student aid into a new government
corporation with professional governance and management.


### NEW POLICY PRIORITIES FOR 2025 AND BEYOND

New Legislation That Should Be Prioritized

For nearly 250 years, Congress has incorporated public and private institutions,
including banks, the District of Columbia’s city government, and other organiza-
tions that federal officials deem to be conducting operations in the public interest.
Such charters offer a certain status to organizations, often viewed as a “seal of
approval” according to one Congressional Research Service report, which can help
these organizations in their fundraising and other advocacy efforts.
When the nation’s largest teacher association, the National Education Associ-
ation (NEA), cites its federal charter, it lends the NEA a level of significance and
suggests an effectiveness that is not supported by evidence. In fact, the NEA and
the nation’s other large teacher union, the American Federation of Teachers (AFT),

The Biden Administration has mercilessly pillaged the student loan portfolio
for crass political purposes without regard to the needs of current taxpayers or
future students. This must never happen again.
use litigation and other efforts to block school choice and advocate for additional
taxpayer spending in education. They also lobbied to keep schools closed during
the pandemic. All of these positions run contrary to robust research evidence
showing positive outcomes for students from education choice policies; there is
no conclusive evidence that more taxpayer spending on schools improves student
outcomes; and evidence finds that keeping schools closed to in-person learning
resulted in negative emotional and academic outcomes for students. Furthermore,
the union promotes radical racial and gender ideologies in schools that parents
oppose according to nationally representative surveys.

Congress should rescind the National Education Association’s
congressional charter and remove the false impression that
federal taxpayers support the political activities of this special
interest group.
﻿
This move would not be unprecedented, as Congress has rescinded the federal
charters of other organizations over the past century. The NEA is a demonstrably
radical special interest group that overwhelmingly supports left-of-center policies
and policymakers.
l
Members should conduct hearings to determine how much federal
taxpayer money the NEA has used for radical causes favoring a single
political party.

Parental Rights in Education and Safeguarding Students

Federal officials should protect educators and students in
jurisdictions under federal control from racial discrimination by
reinforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and prohibiting compelled
speech. Specifically, no teacher or student in Washington, D.C., public
schools, Bureau of Indian Education schools, or Department of Defense
schools should be compelled to believe, profess, or adhere to any idea, but
especially ideas that violate state and federal civil rights laws.
By its very design, critical race theory has an “applied” dimension, as its found-
ers state in their essays that define the theory. Those who subscribe to the theory
believe that racism (in this case, treating individuals differently based on race) is
appropriate—necessary, even—making the theory more than merely an analyti-
cal tool to describe race in public and private life. The theory disrupts America’s
Founding ideals of freedom and opportunity. So, when critical race theory is used
as part of school activities such as mandatory affinity groups, teacher training
programs in which educators are required to confess their privilege, or school assignments in which students must defend the false idea that America is systemically racist, the theory is actively disrupting the values that hold communities
together such as equality under the law and colorblindness.


As such, lawmakers should design legislation that prevents the theory
from spreading discrimination.

For K–12 systems under their jurisdiction, federal lawmakers should
adopt proposals that say no individual should receive punishment or
benefits based on the color of their skin.
Furthermore, school officials should not require students or teachers
to believe that individuals are guilty or responsible for the actions of
others based on race or ethnicity.

Again, specifically for K–12 systems under federal authority,
Congress and the next Administration should support existing state
and federal civil rights laws and add to such laws a prohibition on
compelled speech.

Advancing Legal Protections for Parental Rights in Education
While the U.S. Supreme Court and other federal courts have consistently rec-
ognized that parents have the right and duty to direct the care and upbringing of
their children, they have not always treated parental rights as co-equal to other
fundamental rights—like free speech or the free exercise of religion. As a result,
some courts treat parental rights as a “second-tier” right and do not properly safe-
guard these rights against government infringement. The courts vary greatly over
which species of constitutional review (rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and
strict scrutiny) to apply to parental rights cases.

This uncertainty has emboldened federal agencies to promote rules and poli-
cies that infringe parental rights. For example, under the Biden Administration’s
proposed Title IX regulations, schools could be required to assist a child with a
social or medical gender transition without parental consent or to withhold infor-
mation from parents about a child’s social transition (e.g., changing their names or


Educators should not be forced to discuss contemporary political issues but
neither should they refrain from discussing certain subjects in an attempt to pro-
tect students from ideas with which they disagree. Proposals such as this should
result in robust classroom discussions, not censorship. At the state level, states
should require schools to post classroom materials online to provide maximum
transparency to parents.

pronouns). The federal government could demand that schools include curriculum
or lessons regarding critical race or gender theory in a way that violates parental
rights, especially if it requires minors to disclose information about their religious
beliefs, or beliefs about race or gender in violation of the Protection of Pupil Rights
Amendment (20 USC Sec. 1232h).

To remedy the lack of clear and robust protection for parental rights, the next
Administration should:

Further ensure that any regulations that could impact parental
rights contain similar protections and require federal agencies to
demonstrate that their action meets strict scrutiny before a final rule
is promulgated.


Work to pass a federal Parents’ Bill of Rights that restores parental
rights to a “top-tier” right. Such legislation would give families a fair
hearing in court when the federal government enforces any policy against
parents in a way that undermines their right and responsibility to raise,
educate, and care for their children. The law would require the government
to satisfy “strict scrutiny”—the highest standard of judicial review—when
the government infringes parental rights.

At the same time, Congress should also consider equipping parents with a
private right of action. Two federal laws provide certain privacy protections for
students attending educational institutions or programs funded by the department.
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) protects the privacy of
student education records and allows parents and students over the age of 18 to
inspect and review the student’s education records maintained by the school and
to request corrections to those records. FERPA also authorizes a number of excep-
tions to this records privacy protection that allow schools to disclose the student’s
education records without the consent or knowledge of the parent or student. The
Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment (PPRA) requires schools to obtain paren-
tal consent before asking questions, including surveys, about political affiliations
or beliefs; mental or psychological issues; sexual behaviors or attitudes; critical
appraisals of family members; illegal or self-incriminating behavior; religious prac-
tices or beliefs; privileged relationships, as with doctors and clergy; and family
income, unless for program eligibility.

The difficulty for parents is that FERPA and PPRA do not authorize a private
right of action. If a school refuses to comply with either statute, the only remedy is
for the parent or student (if over the age of 18) to file an administrative complaint
with the U.S. Department of Education, which must then work with the school
to obtain compliance before taking any action to suspend or terminate federal financial assistance. Investigations can take months if not years. The department has never suspended or terminated the funding for an educational institution or
agency for violating FERPA or PPRA. In essence, Congress has granted parents
and students important statutory rights without an effective remedy to assert
those rights.

The next Administration should work with Congress to amend
FERPA and PPRA to provide parents and students over the age of 18
years with a private right of action to seek injunctive and declaratory
relief, together with attorneys’ fees and costs if a prevailing party,
against educational institutions and agencies that violate rights
enshrined in these statutes. This will empower parents and students,
level the playing field between families and education bureaucracies, and
encourage institutional compliance with these statutory requirements.
