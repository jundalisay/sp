Non-Union Worker Voice and Representation. 

American workers lack a meaningful voice in today’s workplace. Between 50 percent and 60 percent of workers have less influence than they want on critical workplaces issues beyond pay and benefits. Even managers are twice as likely to say their employees have too little influence rather than too much.

But America’s one-size-fits-all approach undermines worker representation. Federal labor law offers no alternatives to labor unions whose politicking and adversarial approach appeals to few, whereas most workers report that they prefer a more cooperative model run jointly with management that focuses solely on workplace issues. The next Administration should make new options available to workers and push Congress to pass labor reforms that create non-union “employee involvement organizations” as well as a mechanism for worker representation on corporate boards.

Congress should reintroduce and pass the Teamwork for Employees and Managers (TEAM) Act of 2022.18 The TEAM Act:

1. Reforms the National Labor Relations Act’s (NLRA) Section 8(a)(2) prohibition on formal worker–management cooperative organizations like works councils.

2. Creates an “Employee Involvement Organization” (EIO) to facilitate voluntary cooperation on critical issues like working conditions,
benefits, and productivity. 

3. Amends labor law to allow EIOs at large, publicly traded corporations to elect a non-voting, supervisory member of their company’s board
of directors. 

### Alternative View.

While some conservatives lament that workers lack sufficient voice in today’s workplace, others interpret the rise in independent and flexible work opportunities, significant expansion in family-friendly policies like paid family leave, and the decline in private sector unionization as indicators of workers’ increasing competency and control. Another way to help expand workers’ freedom and voices in traditional workplaces is by allowing them to choose who represents them in negotiations with their employer. The Worker’s Choice Act19 would accom- plish this by ending exclusive representation so that unions in right-to-work states are no longer forced to represent workers who do not want to join them.

Union Transparency. 

Private-sector unions must file detailed financial information with DOL—on matters including union spending, income, loans, assets, membership information, and employee salary—but unions composed entirely of state or local employees are exempt from this filing requirement. These disclosure requirements help workers and the public understand how union leaders are raising and spending union dues; they also can serve as a vital source of infor- mation that helps workers decide if the unions they are asked to join are good stewards of the funds they collect. DOL, under both George W. Bush and Donald Trump, tried rulemakings (known as the Intermediate Bodies Rule) that would require some government unions to file the same information that is required of private-sector unions.

Under President Trump, OLMS required unions to disclose involvement in
trusts that they either own a majority stake in or control. In the past, union trust
spending has been hidden, and it appears that trust assets have occasionally
been corruptly spent for the benefit of private interests in union leadership—
such as $30,000 spent on a private party, $37,500 spent on a Montblanc pen,
condominiums for those in power, golf outings, and a Ferrari.20 But the Biden
DOL eliminated a transparency rule requiring the filing of the T-1 Trust
Annual Report.

More generally, OLMS, which is charged with enforcing the law of union dis-
closure, has historically been underfunded when compared to other DOL agencies.
This relative lack of funding has made ensuring disclosure more difficult.


Enact transparency rules. 

The substance of the Intermediate Bodies Rule
should pass into law, either through rulemaking or through legislation. The
T-1 Trust Annual Report annual filing requirement should be restored.
Increase funding levels. Congress should expand the funding of the Office
of Labor-Management Standards.

Duty of Fair Representation. Unions have a duty of fair representation to
their members, yet they too often abuse that duty to use their members’ resources
on left-wing culture-war issues that are unrelated, and in fact often harmful, to
union members’ own interests.

The NLRB should take enforcement or amicus action advancing the
position that political conflicts of interest by union leadership can
support claims for breach of the duty of fair representation in a
manner analogous to financial conflicts of interest and analogous to
breaches of the fiduciary duty of loyalty in other areas of law.
Interpreting “Protected Concerted Activity.” In an effort to prevent
employers from retaliating against workers who express a desire to unionize, cer-
tain activities are deemed “protected concerted activity” (under §7 of the NLRA).

The NLRB has issued extreme interpretations of these activities, such as deter-
mining that a business’s requiring its employees to be courteous to customers and
one another is an unlawful infringement on the free speech rights implicit in the
protected concerted activity protections in the NLRA.

Reverse unreasonable interpretations of “protected concerted
activity.” The NLRB should return to the 2019 Alstate Maintenance
interpretation of what does and does not constitute protected concerted
activity, including listing eight instances of lawful actions by employers.

Increase the use of 10( j) injunctive relief. The NLRB should increase
its use of 10( j) and should articulate guidelines for situations in which it
intends to seek injunctive relief; the board should delegate authority to
pursue such injunctions to the general counsel and the general counsel
should establish a policy of considering them expeditiously in all retaliation
cases identified by regional offices.

Dues-Funded Worker Centers. Under current law, both labor unions and
unionized employers must file financial disclosures with DOL on an annual basis
to ward off potential fraud and corruption of the sort that has been seen recently
within the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of
America (UAW). However, worker centers, which have grown in number and influ-
ence enormously over the past decade, are not required to file these disclosures.

Investigate worker centers and require financial disclosures. DOL
should investigate worker centers that look and act like unions and bring


Injunctive Relief and Worker Organizing Activities. 

Within the confines
of the more reasonable definition of protected concerted activity described above,
the NLRB should increase its pursuit of reinstatement injunctions. Firing work-
ers engaged in concerted activity has an immediate chilling effect on organizing,
but remedies under the NLRA typically come only much later and amount only
to backpay. In NLRA section 10( j), Congress empowered the NLRB to obtain
temporary injunctions that immediately reinstate workers to their jobs in these
circumstances. This provides a more meaningful remedy to the worker and creates
a significant deterrent to unfair labor practices, because prompt reinstatement will
tend to reinforce the legitimacy of the organizing effort. The NLRB overwhelmingly
prevails when pursuing an injunction, succeeding 100 percent of the time in 2020
and 91 percent of the time in 2021.

Office of Labor-Management Standards Initiative. Currently, the Office of
Labor-Management Standards (OLMS) may investigate potential employer mal-
feasance with regard to union funds in the absence of any complaint by a worker
or union but may not do the same with regard to potential union malfeasance. If
OLMS has evidence that a union may be violating the law based on information
available to the agency (such as annual financial disclosure reports, information
developed during an audit of a union’s books and records, or information obtained
from other government agencies) it should be permitted to open an investigation.
It should have the same enforcement tools available for both employers and unions.


Revise investigation standards. The Office of Labor-Management
Standards should revise its investigation standards to authorize
investigations without receiving a formal complaint.

Persuader Rule. During the Obama Administration, DOL created significant
regulatory burdens for employers with respect to the advice that employers receive
about union activity. As a general matter, employers who hire lawyers or other con-
sultants to advise employees about union issues must file disclosure forms with the
department, as must the lawyers and consultants themselves. Prior to the Obama
Administration, advice provided solely to the employer required no disclosure.
The Obama Administration attempted to eliminate this “advice exemption” with
a directive known as the “persuader rule,” which was successfully challenged in
court. In 2018, the Trump Administration formally rescinded the persuader rule.

DOL should rescind the persuader rule once again should the Biden
Administration revive it.

Unionizing the Workplace: Card Check vs. Secret Ballot. Under the
NLRA, instead of having a secret ballot election about the decision to unionize
a workplace, a union may instead collect signed pro-union cards from a majority
of the employees it wishes to represent and then ask the employer and National
Labor Relations Board for voluntary union recognition. That request gives the
employer the option to hold a secret-ballot election or to recognize the union with-
out any such election. This “card check” procedure is likely to induce employees
to provide their signed cards in ways that do not accurately reflect their true pref-
erences—ranging from a desire not to offend the signature requestor to a wish to
avoid intimidation and coercion to signing based on false information provided
by union organizers. In short, the card check procedure sidesteps many aspects of
democratic decision-making that free and fair elections conducted by secret ballot
are supposed to accomplish. Notably, the general counsel of the National Labor
Relations Board has recently proposed an esoteric legal theory that card-check decision-making is required under the law, basing this theory on an old NLRB
case, Joy Silk, even though the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected mandatory
card-check recognition.

Discard “card check.” Congress should discard “card check” as the basis of
union recognition and mandate the secret ballot exclusively.
