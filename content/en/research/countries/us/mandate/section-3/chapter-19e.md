## Federal Railroad Policy

The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) is making decisions based on political considerations that are at variance with its safety mission. Instead of basing regulatory decisions on the costs and benefits of the available alterna- tives, FRA is promoting actions that favor the status quo and inhibit the use of technology to improve railroad safety. FRA should be making decisions based on objective evidence of the most cost-effective way to accomplish the agency’s safety goals.

FRA’s singular focus on job preservation is contrary to FRA’s mission, and it has a deleterious effect on the morale of FRA’s professional staff, as shown by the annual employee surveys conducted by the Office of Personnel Management. FRA needs to communicate clearly to its career employees a new commitment to making decisions that are consistent with the agency’s safety mission. FRA’s procedures call for decisions on waivers to be made by its Safety Board. Appeals can be taken to the Administrator. However, FRA has deviated from these procedures as the Administrator has injected himself into Safety Board decisions. FRA needs to review its actions with respect to specific proceedings where the agency’s direction cannot be justified. For example:

FRA’s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on crew size is not
based on safety considerations; it is designed to reduce flexibility by
making it impossible for railroads to operate with crews of fewer than
two in circumstances where there is no operational need for the second
crew member.

Although FRA could adopt a modern inspection program that takes
advantage of technological ways to inspect track, it is refusing to amend
50-year-old track inspection requirements, leaving customers with
higher costs.

FRA is refusing to take final action on a rulemaking proceeding that would
modernize brake inspection requirements by taking advantage of the ability to track brake inspections on rolling stock electronically instead of by using paper air brake slips, which would enable extending the interval between
brake inspections for trains and eliminating restrictions on the ability to
place/remove blocks of cars in trains.

FRA will be proposing certification requirements for dispatchers and signal
employees despite the failure of the Railroad Safety Advisory Committee
(RSAC) to identify any safety benefit.

FRA is planning to propose emergency escape breathing apparatus
requirements for train crews even though FRA staff long ago concluded
that the costs of these requirements would far outweigh their very
minimal benefits.


## MARITIME POLICY

The Maritime Administration (MARAD) was established by President Harry
Truman in 1950 and was transferred to DOT in 1981. A principal function is “main-
tain[ing] the overall health of the U.S. Merchant Marine,”15 which is important
both to national defense and to foreign and domestic commerce. MARAD is also
in charge of the United States Merchant Marine Academy and operates ships and
funding for the six state maritime academies.

MARAD would be better served by being transferred from DOT to the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (DHS). MARAD is the only DOT modal administration
that does not regulate the industry that it represents: The maritime industry is
regulated by the U.S. Coast Guard (ships and personnel) and by the Federal Mari-
time Commission (cargo rates and competitive practices).

Furthermore, MARAD has responsibilities both in peacetime commerce and
operationally in wartime/crisis sealift through its responsibility to manage the
National Defense Reserve Fleet and 45-ship Ready Reserve Force for the U.S. Navy.
These missions are unique to MARAD within DOT. As a result, MARAD’s missions

It is vital that the integrity of FRA’s research program be preserved. In 2022,
FRA switched the management of the Transportation Technology Center (TTC)
in Pueblo, Colorado, from a subsidiary of the Association of American Railroads
(AAR) to Ensco, Inc. FRA seems determined to direct research to TTC, even when
there are better choices with respect to the research in question, in an effort to
support TTC financially and justify its decision to change management at TTC.


This change in approach threatens the collaborative approach to research between
FRA and the railroads that has existed for decades. FRA should make its decisions
on where to spend its research dollars solely on the merits of improving the safety
and efficiency of the railroad industry.

and purpose, and therefore its funding priorities, are not well understood and his-
torically have been minimalized in planning and budgeting.

MARAD, including its subordinate Service Academy (the U.S. Merchant Marine
Academy) should be transferred to the Department of Defense (if the Coast Guard
is located there because DHS has been eliminated) or to the Department of Home-
land Security. In this way, the two agencies charged with oversight and regulation
of the Maritime sector—MARAD and the United States Coast Guard—would be
aligned under the same department where operational efficiencies could be real-
ized more easily.

Serious consideration should be given to repealing or substantially reforming
the Jones Act,16 which would require legislation. The economic costs of the Jones
Act, which is notionally in place to promote a robust Merchant Marine, vastly
exceed its effect on the supply of domestic ships. For instance, no liquified natural
gas (LNG) can be shipped from Alaska to the lower 48 states because there are no
U.S.-flagged ships that carry LNG. If there are genuine concerns about U.S. fleet
capacity in the absence of the Jones Act, it would be possible to do so through an
expansion of the Defense Reserve Fleet.

Another DHS agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is a
frequent user of MARAD Ready Reserve Force shipping during disaster assistance
missions. Transferring MARAD to DHS would make coordination and requisition
of those vessels a smoother and more rapid process. DHS has responsibility for
reviewing and approving Jones Act waivers. This process first requires a market
survey of available shipping tonnage that is completed by MARAD. The processing
of Jones Act waiver requests would be streamlined if both agencies were in the
same department.

Finally, DHS as a department is experienced in administering and budgeting for
the operation of an existing federal service academy, the U.S. Coast Guard Academy,
which is similar to the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy in size. There would be
increased efficiencies and better alignment of the missions of these two institutions
if they were under one single department that has equity in the industries served
by these academies.


### CONCLUSION

Americans need more abundant and affordable transportation. They need more
affordable and safer cars as well as physical aspects of transportation such as roads,
bridges, airports, ports, and rail lines. The Department of Transportation should
be evaluating which aspects of transportation are contributing to the economic
competitiveness of the United States and the well-being of Americans—and that
therefore should continue to be funded.

All too often, DOT’s mission is described as reducing the number of trips, using
less fuel, and raising the costs of travel to Americans through increased use of renewables. These goals are not compatible with what should be DOT’s purpose: 

to make travel easier and less expensive. That is what the American people want,
and that is what DOT should provide.
