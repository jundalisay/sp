### Brand-name manufacturers impede the entrance of generic products into the marketplace. 

The FDA should prohibit pharmaceutical companies from purposely sitting on their legally available right to be the first to sell generic versions of their drugs. Additionally, Congress should create legal remedies for generic companies to obtain samples of brand-name products for their generic development efforts and should prohibit meritless “citizen petitions” submitted by manufacturers to delay approval of a generic competitor.10 Approval Process for Laboratory-Developed or Modified Medical Tests. Learning from the failed early COVID-19 testing experience, Congress and the FDA should focus on reforming laws and regulations governing medical tests, especially with respect to laboratory-developed tests.

Commercial tests are developed with the intention of being widely marketed,
distributed, and used, while laboratory-developed tests are created with the
intention of being used solely within one laboratory. A test developed by a lab in
accordance with the protocols developed by another lab (non-commercial sharing)
currently constitutes a “new” laboratory-developed test because the lab in which
it will be used is different from the initial developing lab. To encourage interlab-
oratory collaboration and discourage duplicative test creation (and associated
regulatory and logistical burdens), the FDA should introduce mechanisms through
which laboratory-developed tests can easily be shared with other laboratories with-
out the current regulatory burdens.11

The “laboratory-developed tests” category currently encompasses a range of
possible tests, many of which would be characterized more appropriately as “lab-
oratory-modified tests” because they are not truly novel tests but rather modified
versions of existing tests. To avoid stifling innovation and access to medical care,
the applicable statutes and regulations should be revised to facilitate greater access
to such modified tests.12

Finally, the FDA has long held that it has regulatory authority over such tests,
while others have argued that they should be considered clinical services regulated
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The FDA currently
has regulatory authority over in vitro diagnostics, and under the Clinical Lab-
oratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA),13 the CMS ensures that labs meet
analytical validity standards for test methods. Congress, the FDA, and the CMS
need to clarify and disentangle overlapping authorities over tests to eliminate
regulatory confusion.14

Drug Shortages. The very thin profit margins and the regulatory burdens
associated with generic drug manufacturing discourage inventory and capacity
investments by manufacturers and contribute to drug shortages. HHS and the FDA
should encourage more dependable generic drug manufacturing.
The FDA should expand its current pass/fail approach to drug facility inspec-
tions into a graded system that recognizes manufacturers that exceed minimum
standards by investing in improving production reliability. The FDA should also
add facility codes to drug packaging and construct a searchable database that
cross-references product codes and facility codes. That would enable wholesalers
and pharmacy benefit managers to identify and preference drugs manufactured at
more reliable facilities, thus encouraging generic drug manufacturers to compete
on reliability as well as on price.

For its part, HHS should exempt multi-source generic drugs from requirements
to pay rebates to Medicaid and other federally funded health programs, as those
provisions penalize new investments in expanding manufacturing capacity when
supply is unable to meet demand.15 Additionally, FDA and NIH should promote
efficacy trials of new applications for generic drugs, which might include NIH fund-
ing such trials or conducting its own.


### Abortion Pills

Abortion pills pose the single greatest threat to unborn children in a post-Roe world. The rate of chemical abortion in the U.S. has increased by more than 150 percent in the past decade; more than half of annual abortions
in the U.S. are chemical rather than surgical.

The abortion pill regimen is typically a two-part process. The first pill, mifepris-
tone, causes the death of the unborn child by cutting off the hormone progesterone,
which is required to sustain a pregnancy. The second pill, misoprostol, causes con-
tractions to induce a delivery of the dead child and uterine contents, usually into a
toilet at home. The abortion-pill regimen is currently approved for up to 70 days
(10 weeks) into pregnancy and before Biden was subject to a heightened safety
restriction called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) that requires
an in-person visit with a physician who can check for dangerous contraindications
such as ectopic pregnancies and can advise the mother seeking an abortion of the
risks of chemical abortion, including hemorrhaging, and what to do in such cir-
cumstances. Chemical abortion has been found to have a complication rate four
times higher than that of surgical abortion.

Since its approval more than 20 years ago, mifepristone has been associated with
26 deaths of pregnant mothers, over a thousand hospitalizations, and thousands
more adverse events, but that number does not account for all complications. Of
course, this does not count the hundreds of thousands to millions of babies whose
lives have been unjustly taken through chemical abortion. FDA should therefore:

Reverse its approval of chemical abortion drugs because the
politicized approval process was illegal from the start. The FDA
failed to abide by its legal obligations to protect the health, safety, and
welfare of girls and women. It never studied the safety of the drugs
under the labeled conditions of use, ignored the potential impacts of the
hormone-blocking regimen on the developing bodies of adolescent girls,
disregarded the substantial evidence that chemical abortion drugs cause
more complications than surgical abortions, and eliminated necessary
safeguards for pregnant girls and women who undergo this dangerous drug
regimen. Furthermore, at no point in the past two decades has the FDA ever
acknowledged or addressed federal laws that prohibit the distribution of
abortion drugs by postal mail; to the contrary, the FDA has permitted and
actively encouraged such activity.

Now that the Supreme Court has acknowledged that the Constitution
contains no right to an abortion, the FDA is ethically and legally obliged to
revisit and withdraw its initial approval, which was premised on pregnancy
being an “illness” and abortion being “therapeutically” effective at treating
this “illness.” The FDA is statutorily charged with guaranteeing the
safety and efficacy of drugs and therefore should withdraw this drug that
is proven to be dangerous to women and by definition fatally unsafe for
unborn children.

As an interim step, the FDA should immediately restore the REMS by removing
the in-person dispensing requirement to eliminate dangerous tele-abortion and
abortion-by-mail distribution.

Mail-Order Abortions. Allowing mail-order abortions is a gift to the abortion
industry that allows it to expand far beyond brick-and-mortar clinics and into pro-life states that are trying to protect women, girls, and unborn children from
abortion. The FDA should therefore:

Address weaknesses in the current FAERS (FDA Adverse Events Reporting System).

The Administration and policymakers should ensure that health care workers, particularly those in hospitals and emergency rooms, report abortion pill complications. Women who experience complications from abortion pills typically go to an emergency room, not to the abortion pill prescriber, so putting the onus of reporting on the prescriber who typically has no idea that a complication has occurred means that the FAERS is seriously undercounting adverse events. Submitting an adverse event to the database should be a quick and efficient process for busy health care practitioners. Currently, providers report that the process is difficult and convoluted. Implement a policy of transparency about inspections of the abortion pill’s sponsors, Danco and GenBioPro, as well as facilities that manufacture the pills. The FDA should respond to congressional requests and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests about inspections, compliance, and post-marketing safety in a timely manner. Stop promoting or approving mail-order abortions in violation of long-standing federal laws that prohibit the mailing and interstate carriage of abortion drugs.16

Vaccine Importation. Thousands of Americans of faith and conscience wish
to receive various childhood vaccinations for themselves and their families but are
not allowed to receive vaccines that are derived through or tested on aborted fetal
cells. For example, the chickenpox, Hepatitis, and MMR vaccines in the U.S. are all
linked to abortion in this way. There are ethically derived alternatives abroad that
have been used safely there for decades, but the FDA makes it exceedingly difficult
for Americans to import them.

In January 2021, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and the FDA jointly
announced that HHS was required by the Religious Freedom Restoration Act

Reinstate earlier safety protocols for Mifeprex that were mostly
eliminated in 2016 and apply these protocols to any generic version
of mifepristone. A bare-minimum policy of limiting abortion pills to the
pre-2016 policy of 49 days gestation, returning to the pre-2021 in-person
dispensing requirement, and returning to requiring prescribers to report all
serious adverse events, not just deaths, to the drug sponsor would increase
women’s health and safety.﻿

(RFRA)17 to allow bulk importation by doctors of certain Japanese-made vaccines
to accommodate religious needs of patients, but the Biden FDA unlawfully revoked
this waiver. The FDA should restore the waiver to comply with RFRA and for the
obvious public health benefits of increased childhood vaccination by families seek-
ing ethically derived alternatives.

To avoid future moral coercion of the sort experienced with the COVID-19 vac- cines, the FDA and NIH should require the development of drugs and biologics that are free from moral taint and switch to cell lines that are not derived from aborted fetal cell lines or aborted baby body parts.

Conflicts of Interest. A 2018 report in Science found that more than two-thirds of FDA reviewers later ended up at the same companies whose products they had been reviewing while they were working for the government.18 This revolving door is one mechanism by which pharmaceutical companies capture the agencies that regulate them. The FDA should impose a lengthy cooling off period for reviewers, preventing them from working for companies they regulated.

In 1997, the FDA relaxed regulations to permit broadcast drug advertisements, after which Big Pharma began routine direct-to-consumer advertising, making the United States and New Zealand the only countries where such practices are legal. Following the 1997 changes, pharma became the largest advertiser for all major media organizations. This buys considerable influence in the newsroom—whether media companies acknowledge this or not—and distorts independent reporting on public health issues. The FDA or Congress should regulate where and how paid advertising is used by pharmaceutical companies more stringently, especially on media outlets.
