### Mission/Overview

FERC permits, sites, and authorizes the construction and operation of inter-
state natural gas pipelines.121 It also regulates the rates for the shipping of natural
gas122 (but not the price of the natural gas commodity, which is market based).
FERC is charged with ensuring that natural gas pipelines are approved if they are
required by the “public convenience and necessity.”123 Pipeline permitting is sub-
ject to environmental reviews under NEPA, and the rate for the pipeline and the
shipping of the commodity is set by FERC under a just and reasonable standard.
Once FERC approves a project, the holder of the certificate has the sovereign’s
power of eminent domain.


### Needed Reforms

Natural gas pipelines are vital for the economy, manufacturing, heating, and
electric generation. Opposition from “Keep it in the ground” environmentalists
has made it harder to gain approvals for natural gas pipelines. Under Democrat
leadership, FERC has proposed official policies to consider upstream and down-
stream GHG emissions from the use of the natural gas that would be shipped in
the pipeline to be part of FERC’s public-interest determination when deciding
whether to approve a pipeline. There is conflicting direction from the D.C. Circuit
on the GHG issue, which also could be seen as a “major questions” issue under the
U.S. Supreme Court’s West Virginia v. EPA decision.124


### New Policies

FERC should:

Recommit itself to the NGA’s purpose of providing the American people with access to affordable and reliable natural gas. Limit its NGA decision-making on natural gas pipeline certificates to the question of whether there is a need for the natural gas. Limit its NEPA analysis to the impacts of the actual pipeline itself, not indirect upstream and downstream effects.

In addition, Congress, the states, and FERC should consider how better to pro- tect and compensate property owners whose property is taken for the benefit of the public. FERC also needs to be mindful that natural gas pipelines and projects are important for domestic access to natural gas, including local natural gas utilities, natural gas–fired electric generation, and manufacturing, as well as for exports of liquefied natural gas.


### FERC: LNG EXPORT FACILITIES


####  Mission/Overview

FERC permits, sites, and authorizes the construction and operation of LNG export facilities.125 It does not authorize the export of natural gas; DOE exercises that authority. LNG export facilities are important for delivering natural gas to markets around the world and have become an important policy tool in limiting the ability of Russia and Middle Eastern countries to use energy as a tool in for- eign affairs.


#### Needed Reforms

LNG exports are opposed by climate activists. In addition, some domestic man-
ufacturers argue that LNG exports decrease available U.S. supplies of natural gas
and increase the domestic price, thereby harming the competitive advantages of
U.S. manufacturers in world markets.

Currently, most LNG export facilities are along the Gulf of Mexico in Texas and
Louisiana.126 Attempts to build facilities on the west coast (Jordan Cove LNG127)
and the east coast have not moved forward for a variety of reasons; delays and
costs of litigation can cause developers to cancel projects. An Alaska facility was
approved by FERC in 2020, and the Biden Administration has indicated its sup-
port.128 An east coast facility in Pennsylvania (or nearby) would unlock Marcellus
shale natural gas for export.

FERC is considering policy statements that would consider GHG emissions as
part of its NEPA review and its NGA determination as to whether approval of an
LNG export facility is consistent with the public interest.

New Policies

Since Congress through the NGA has already determined that LNG exports to
countries with free trade agreements are in the public interest,129 and because LNG
exports help to ensure America’s ability to support our friends and allies around
the world while also supporting domestic natural gas production, FERC:

Should not use environmental issues like climate change as a reason
to stop LNG projects.

Should ensure that the natural gas pipelines that are needed deliver
more of the product to market, both for domestic use and export, and
are reviewed, developed and constructed in a timely manner.


#### NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION

Mission/Overview

The Energy Reorganization Act of 1974130 created the Nuclear Regulatory Com-
mission (NRC). Before then, the commercial nuclear industry was regulated by
the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), which was established by the 1954 Atomic
Energy Act.131 Importantly, the AEC was responsible for encouraging and regulat-
ing commercial nuclear power. Broad criticism of this dual function was a major
factor in the establishment of the NRC, which held regulatory authority while the
newly established Department of Energy held the advocacy function. Today, the
NRC is responsible for a broad range of regulatory activities, including reactor
safety, oversight of nuclear materials, and protection against radiation as well as
permitting new reactors, certifying new reactor designs, and regulating nuclear
waste management activities.

Needed Reforms

In 1989, the NRC established alternative licensing processes that were meant to
provide a more predictable and efficient regulatory pathway for new Light Water
Reactors (LWRs) by combining construction and operating nuclear power plant
licenses, allowing for Early Site Permits, and establishing a framework for pre-
approval of reactor designs. More recently, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and
Modernization Act directed the NRC to establish a technology-neutral licensing
process for new, advanced reactor technologies.132 Despite these efforts, the NRC remains a significant cost and regulatory barrier to new nuclear power. Especially frustrating is that these costs to a large extent are due to the agencies being overly
prescriptive rather than outcomes-focused and fall on well-known and understood
LWR reactor technologies.

New Policies

While refocusing its regulatory efforts on new reactor technologies, the NRC
should also continue to ensure the security of radiological sources and mitigate
cybersecurity risks across the industry. Applications for Combined Operating
Licenses (COLs) and design certifications that rely on light-water technology
should generally be completed within two years. Early Site Permits should gener-
ally be issued within one year for construction on or adjacent to an existing reactor
site. Additionally, the NRC should:

Set clear radiation exposure and protection standards by eliminating
ALARA (“as low as reasonably achievable”) as a regulatory principle
and setting clear standards according to radiological risk and dose
rather than arbitrary objectives.

Work with Congress to reform its funding approach so that licensee
fees are generally required for activities that are specific to a
regulated entity, with other agency costs being provided through
normal appropriations.


### Budget

In FY 2022, the NRC was required to recover approximately 85 percent of its
$887.7 million budget through licensee fees.133 The Nuclear Energy Innovation
and Modernization Act requires the NRC to recover nearly all of its costs through
fees. These reforms would likely not cost additional money but could rebalance
the fee-versus-appropriations calculation.

Expedite the review and approval of license extensions of existing
reactors, which will require the NRC to streamline and focus its
NEPA review process.
