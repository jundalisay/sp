The 30 by 30 Plan.66 President Biden’s Executive Order 14008 (30 by 30
plan)67 requires that the federal government, which already owns one-third of
the country: (1) remove vast amounts of private property from productive use;
and (2) end congressionally mandated uses of all federal land. The end result
will be “total federal control of an additional 440 million acres of land or oceans
in the U.S. by 2030.”68

Revoke National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service rules
regarding predator control and bear baiting, which are matters for state
regulation. Such revocation is permitted under the 2017 Congressional
Review Act.62

Although the new President should vacate that order, DOI under a conservative
President must take immediate action on the 30 by 30 plan by vacating a secre-
tarial order issued by the Biden DOI69 that eliminated the Trump Administration’s
requirement for the approval of state and local governments before federal acquisi-
tion of private property with monies from the Land and Water Conservation Fund.70
National Monument Designations. 

As has every Democratic President before
him beginning with Jimmy Carter, Joe Biden has abused his authority under the
Antiquities Act of 1906. Like the outrageous, unilateral withdrawals from public use
of multiple use federal land under the Carter, Clinton, and Obama Administrations,
Biden’s first national monument was one in Colorado—adopted over the objections
of scores of local groups and at least one American Indian tribe.71 In the days before
the 2024 election, Biden will likely designate more western monuments.
Although President Trump courageously ordered a review of national mon-
ument designations, the result of that review was insufficient in that only two
national monuments in one state (Utah) were adjusted.72 Monuments in Maine
and Oregon, for example, should have been adjusted downward given the finding
of Secretary Ryan Zinke’s review that they were improperly designated. The new
Administration’s review will permit a fresh look at past monument decrees and
new ones by President Biden.

Furthermore, the new Administration must vigorously defend the downward
adjustments it makes to permit a ruling on a President’s authority to reduce the
size of national monuments by the U.S. Supreme Court.
Finally, the new Administration must seek repeal of the Antiquities Act of 1906,
which permitted emergency action by a President long before the statutory author-
ity existed for the protection of special federal lands, such as those with wild and
scenic rivers, endangered specials, or other unique places. Moreover, in recent
years, Congress has designated as national monuments those areas deserving of
such congressional action.

Oregon and California Lands Act. One national monument worthy of downward adjustment is in Oregon, where its designation and subsequent expansion
interfere with the federal obligation to residents to harvest timber on its BLM
lands. A federal district court ruled in 2019 that land subject to the Oregon and
California (O&C) Grant Lands Act of 193773 was set aside by Congress to be har-
vested for the benefit of the people of Oregon. Specifically, those federal lands are
to be “managed...for permanent forest production” and its timber “sold, cut, and
removed in conformity with the princip[le] of sustained yield.”74

As the district court concluded,75 beginning in 1990, the federal government
erected a trifecta of illegal barriers to the accomplishment of the congressional
mandate, beginning with a response to the listing of the northern spotted owl,76
continuing a decade later with the designation of the Cascade–Siskiyou National
Monument,77 and concluding in 2017 with an expansion of that monument.78 In order to fulfill the yet-unaltered congressional mandate contained in federal law, to provide for jobs and well-paying employment opportunities in rural Oregon,
and to ameliorate the effects of wildfires, the new Administration must immedi-
ately fulfill its responsibilities and manage the O&C lands for “permanent forest
production” to ensure that the timber is “sold, cut, and removed.”79
NEPA Reforms. Congress never intended for the National Environmental
Policy Act to grow into the tree-killing, project-dooming, decade-spanning mon-
strosity that it has become. Instead, in 1970, Congress intended a short, succinct,
timely presentation of information regarding major federal action that signifi-
cantly affects the quality of the human environment so that decisionmakers can
make informed decisions to benefit the American people.

The Trump Administration adopted common-sense NEPA reform that must
be restored immediately. Meanwhile, DOI should reinstate the secretarial orders
adopted by the Trump Administration, such as placing time and page limits on
NEPA documents and setting forth—on page one—the costs of the document itself.
Meanwhile, the new Administration should call upon Congress to reform NEPA
to meet its original goal. Consideration should be given, for example, to eliminat-
ing judicial review of the adequacy of NEPA documents or the rectitude of NEPA
decisions. This would allow Congress to engage in effective oversight of federal
agencies when prudent.

Settlement Transparency. Interior Secretary David Bernhardt required DOI
to prominently display and provide open access to any and all litigation settlements
into which DOI or its agencies entered, and any attorneys’ fees paid for ending
the litigation.80 Biden’s DOI, aware that the settlements into which it planned to
enter and the attorneys’ fees it was likely to pay would cause controversy, ended
this policy.81 A new Administration should reinstate it.

The Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act was intended
to bring endangered and threatened species back from the brink of extinction
and, when appropriate, to restore real habitat critical to the survival of the spe-
cies. The act’s success rate, however, is dismal. Its greatest deficiency, according
to one renowned expert, is “conflict of interest.”82 Specifically, the work of the
Fish and Wildlife Service is the product of “species cartels” afflicted with group-
think, confirmation bias, and a common desire to preserve the prestige, power,
and appropriations of the agency that pays or employs them. For example, in one
highly influential sage-grouse monograph, 41 percent of the authors were federal
workers. The editor, a federal bureaucrat, had authored one-third of the paper.83
Meaningful reform of the Endangered Species Act requires that Congress
take action to restore its original purpose and end its use to seize private prop-
erty, prevent economic development, and interfere with the rights of states over
their wildlife populations. In the meantime, a new Administration should take the
following immediate action:

Delist the grizzly bear in the Greater Yellowstone and Northern
Continental Divide Ecosystems and defend to the Supreme Court of the
United States the agency’s fact-based decision to do so.84
Delist the gray wolf in the lower 48 states in light of its full recovery
under the ESA.85
Cede to western states jurisdiction over the greater sage-grouse,
recognizing the on-the-ground expertise of states and preventing use
of the sage-grouse to interfere with public access to public land and
economic activity.

Direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to end its abuse of Section 10( j) of the
ESA by re-introducing so-called “experiment species” populations into
areas that no longer qualify as habitat and lie outside the historic ranges
of those species, which brings with it the full weight of the ESA in areas
previously without federal government oversight.86
Direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to design and implement an impartial
conservation triage program by prioritizing the allocation of limited
resources to maximize conservation returns, relative to the conservation
goals, under a constrained budget.87

Direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to make all data used in ESA decisions
available to the public, with limited or no exceptions, to fulfill the public’s
right to know and to prevent the agency’s previous opaque decision-making.
Abolish the Biological Resources Division of the U.S. Geological Survey
and obtain necessary scientific research about species of concern from
universities via competitive requests for proposals.
Direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to: (1) design and implement an
Endangered Species Act program that ensures independent decision-
making by ending reliance on so-called species specialists who have
obvious self-interest, ideological bias, and land-use agendas; and (2) ensure
conformity with the Information Quality Act.88

Office of Surface Mining. The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and
Enforcement (OSM) was created by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act of 1977 (SMCRA)89 to administer programs for controlling the impacts of surface
coal mining operations. Although the coal industry is contracting, coal constitutes 20 percent of the nation’s electricity and is a mainstay of many regional economies.
The following actions should ensure OSM’s ability to perform its mission while com-
plying with SMCRA and without interfering with the production of high-quality
American coal:

Reduce the number of field coal-reclamation inspectors to recognize the
industry is smaller.
Reissue Trump’s Schedule F executive order to permit discharge of
nonperforming employees.91

Permit coal company employees to benefit from the OSM Training
Program, which is currently restricted to state and federal employees.
Revise the Applicant Violator System, the nationwide database for the
federal and state programs, to permit federal and state regulators to
consider extenuating circumstances.

Maintain the current “Ten-Day Notice” rule, which requires OSM to work
with state regulators in determining if a SMCRA violation has taken place in
recognition of the fact that a coal mining state with primacy has the lead in
implementing state and federal law.

Preserve Directive INE-26, which relates to approximate original contour,
a critical factor in permitting efficient and environmentally sound surface
mining, especially in Appalachia.92

Western Water Issues. The American West, from the Great Plains to the Cas-
cades Range, is arid, as recognized by John Wesley Powell during his famous trip
across a large part of its length. Pursuant to an Executive Order signed by President
Trump, and consistent with its authority along with other federal agencies, DOI’s
Bureau of Reclamation must take the following actions:
l
Develop additional storage capacity across the arid west, including by:
1.
Updating dam water control manuals for existing facilities during
routine operations; and

Relocate the OSM Reclamation and Enforcement headquarters to
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to recognize that the agency is field-driven and
should be headquartered in the coal field.90

2. Engaging in real-time monitoring of operations.

Reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies by consolidating federal water
working groups.
Implement actions identified in the Federal Action Plan for Improving Fore-
casts of Water Availability,93 especially by adopting improvements related to:
1.
Forecast Informed Reservoir Operations; and

2. Arial Snow Observation Systems.

Clarify the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act94 to ensure
consistent application with other federal infrastructure loan programs
under the Federal Credit Reform Act. This should be done to foster
opportunities for locally led investment in water infrastructure.

and Delivery of Water in the West.95
