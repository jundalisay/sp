ASPR vs. FEMA. When the President declares a national emergency (per the
Stafford Act) related to a public health emergency declared by the HHS Secretary,
FEMA is activated and controls instead of HHS/ASPR. While this arrangement
has some benefits because of FEMA’s unique logistical capabilities, the arrange-
ment should be reviewed—especially considering the COVID-19 pandemic—for
improvements in efficiency according to expertise and available resources, reduced
confusion for ASPR and among HHS agencies, and avoidance of duplicated efforts
among agencies and personnel.

in the Office of Science and Medicine to drive investigative review of literature for a
variety of issues including the effect of abortion on prematurity and breast cancer;
lack of evidence for so-called gender-affirming care; and physical and emotional
damage following cross-sex treatments, especially on children. The OASH should
withdraw all recommendations of and support for cross-sex medical interventions
and “gender-affirming care.”

Title X. The Title X family planning program should be reframed with a focus on better education around fertility awareness and holistic family planning and a
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs that understands the program
and is able to work within its legislative framework (ideally, an MD). In addition,
the Office of Population Affairs should eliminate religious discrimination in grant
selections and guarantee the right of conscience and religious freedom of health
care workers and participants in the Title X program.

In 2021, HHS reversed a Trump Administration regulation that required grant-
ees to maintain strict physical and financial separation between Title X activity and
abortion-related activity.76 Under the Biden Administration’s regulation,77 Title X
activity can be conducted alongside abortion activity without strict physical and
financial separation. The regulation also requires grantees to refer for abortions
despite sincere moral or religious objections. This effectively bans otherwise qual-
ified pro-life grantees from participating in the program.

HHS should rescind the Biden Administration’s regulation and reinstate the
Trump Administration regulation for the program. It should also do this quickly
(the Biden Administration completed its regulatory process and issued a final rule
in less than nine months) and expand the potential grantee population beyond
abortion providers like Planned Parenthood.

Congress should complement these efforts by passing legislation such as the
Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act,78 which would prohibit family planning
grants from going to entities that perform abortions or provide funding to other
entities that perform abortions. This would help to protect the integrity of the
Title X program even under an abortion-friendly Administration.
Strategic National Stockpile. The President should invoke the Defense Pro-
duction Act,79 which is a form of temporary takeover of private enterprises, only
in the gravest circumstances. The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) should be
reformed to consider the potential supply chain disruptions of pandemics or global
conflicts. Also, during the COVID pandemic, many states received ventilators from
the SNS and hoarded them in places where a rush of COVID patients needing ven-
tilators never materialized. The SNS should clarify its mission as supplier of last
resort to the federal government, state governments, or first responders and key
medical staff and should not portray itself as serving the public as a whole.

OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL (OGC)

The Office of General Counsel is essential to ensuring that HHS is operating
within the bounds of its numerous governing statutes. However, legal caution can
outweigh practical necessity and often slows processes and decisions when time is
of the essence. Such problems were evident both before and during the COVID-19
pandemic. Internal processes should be reformed to streamline necessary legal
determinations during crises, and general processes should be reviewed for effi-
ciency. OGC should also:

Rescind its PREP Act liability memo. OGC issued a PREP Act liability
memo that suspended application of civil rights and other laws in the
context of the administration of covered countermeasures during the
pandemic. It should be rescinded as contrary to law.
Rescind efforts to curtail OCR authority over conscience and
religious freedom. All OGC memos and Federal Register notices of
organization or delegations of authority moving any OCR conscience
and religious freedom enforcement to OGC, including RFRA, should
be rescinded, and independent authority over these matters should be
restored to OCR.

Encourage DOJ to repeal OLC memos allowing abortion funding
despite Hyde and memos allowing federal enclave immunity to
perform abortions despite the Assimilative Crimes Act.80
Rescind legal analysis that authorized HHS to impose a moratorium
on rental evictions during COVID.
Rescind the OGC legal analysis saying that the injunction in Bowen
v. American Hospital Association81 prevents any proposed HHS
regulations or enforcement actions concerning the denial of care
— 492 —Department of Health and Human Services
to newborn infants with disabilities by covered health care entities
without or against parental consent.

Rescind the legal analysis supporting the Biden Administration’s
decision to dismiss the University of Vermont Medical Center
case dealing with the forced participation of a nurse in abortion in
violation of law.
Rescind the legal analysis restoring $200 million in Medicaid funds
to California after having been found to be in violation of the Weldon
Amendment by OCR.

OFFICE OF GLOBAL AFFAIRS (OGA)

The Director of the Office of Global Affairs should have the title of Assistant
Secretary so that he or she can adequately represent HHS and the Secretary and
serve as the lead on global health diplomacy for the government. The designation
“Director” is not understood to indicate the leadership role that this position holds
in the international arena. In addition:

OGA should have a clear and consistent voice for the Administration’s
pro-life and pro-family priorities in all international engagements.
OGA should hold oversight authority for implementation of the
Mexico City policy throughout all divisions.
Every effort should be made to locate all OGA staff in the same
building for better oversight and communication.
Health attachés in various global locations should be trained in the
Administration’s policies with clear expectations communicated
and with accountability, including replacement, when their
conduct and advocacy are contrary to Administration policies and
programmatic priorities.

OFFICE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS (OCR)

Conscience Enforcement. Existing statutes that protect rights of conscience
(such as the Church, Coats–Snowe, and Weldon amendments) do not explicitly

All divisions that work on international health efforts should be
responsive to requests and direction from the Assistant Secretary
with coordination for all health diplomacy emanating from OGA.
provide a private right of action that would allow victims to seek legal redress in
court. At the same time, when it continues to fund governmental and private enti-
ties that violate these laws, HHS is spending taxpayer funds unlawfully. Under
liberal Administrations, OCR has amassed a poor record of devoting resources to
conscience and religious freedom enforcement and is often complicit in approving
or looking the other way at the Administration’s own attacks on religious liberty.
Congress should pass the Conscience Protection Act so that victims can pursue
redress through courts without having to depend exclusively on OCR. 

In addition:

OCR should return to Trump Administration policies that initiated
robust enforcement of these conscience laws. It should restore and fully
fund the Office of the Deputy Director for the Conscience and Religious
Freedom Division (CRFD) and ensure that it has the necessary delegations
from the Secretary to enforce these laws. The Secretary should give
adequate delegations to OCR to pursue enforcement of conscience laws,
including RFRA, and require all HHS components that provide funding or
grants to cooperate with OCR CRFD investigations.

The Secretary, the Deputy Secretary, and principals in other HHS divisions
should endorse the remedial measures recommended by OCR CRFD and
limit territorial objections and slow-down attempts by other divisional
officials including OGC. HHS should withdraw funding from any violating
entities that refuse to correct their behavior, and OCR CRFD should work
with ASFR to ensure that all grant announcements and instruments inform
grantees and applicants of their obligations to comply with federal health
care conscience laws specifically as a condition of obtaining or maintaining
their funding.

A draft OCR RFRA and religious freedom rule from the Trump
Administration should be issued and finalized. These regulations would
provide a clear process for OCR’s enforcement in coordination with other
HHS divisions and existing HHS grants regulations.

HHS should reestablish waivers for state and child welfare agencies
for religious exemptions, especially for faith-based adoption and
foster care agencies. It should also rescind subjective case-by-case eval-
uations for religious and faith-based organizations that request religious
exemptions. These case-by-case determinations are currently coordinated
with ACF and OCR. The recommended waivers should be granted to all
states and agencies that request them, and OCR memos finding that RFRA
would be violated if the waivers are not granted should be restored.

HHS should restore OCR authority to review requests for and
render opinions on the application of RFRA to requests for religious
accommodation of people, families, and doctors who cannot in good
conscience take or administer vaccines, including those made or
tested with aborted fetal cell lines.

HHS should restore Section 1557, Section 504, and other OCR
regulations and fix guidance documents. In 2020, the Trump
Administration’s OCR published regulations under Section 1557 of the
Affordable Care Act that restored the agency’s enforcement of that law
to the limits of its statutory text, deferred to the ACA’s widespread use of
a binary biological conception of sex discrimination, and specified that
the regulation must comply with the religious exemption and abortion
neutrality clauses in Title IX from which it is derived as well as the Religious
Freedom Restoration Act and other laws. Courts blocked core provisions of
that rule from going into effect.

OCR should return its enforcement of sex discrimination
to the statutory framework of Section 1557 and Title IX.

Specifically, it should:
1. Remove all guidance issued under the Biden Administration
concerning sexual orientation and gender identity under Section 1557,
particularly the May 2021 announcement of enforcement82 and March
2022 statement threatening states that protect minors from genital
mutilation.83
2. Issue a general statement of policy specifying that it will not enforce any
prohibition on sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination in
the Section 1557 regulation and that it will prioritize compliance with
the First Amendment, RFRA, and federal conscience laws in any case
implicating those claims. DOJ should commit to defending these actions
aggressively against inevitable court challenges, including under cases
such as Heckler v. Chaney.84


In 2022, the Biden Administration proposed to reinstate a rule
contradicting the scope of the statute and imposing nondiscrimination on
the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. It is expected that this
rule will be finalized in 2023 even though several courts have issued rulings
against the interpretation on which it is based.
3. Issue a proposed rule to restore the Trump regulations under Section
1557, explicitly interpreting the law not to include sexual orientation
and gender identity discrimination based on the textual approach to
male and female biology taken by Congress in the ACA, the need to
recognize biological distinctions as part of the sound practice of health
care, and the need to ensure protections of medical judgment and
conscience. DOJ should agree to defend this rule to the Supreme Court
if necessary.

4. Issue a general statement of policy announcing that it plans to enforce
Section 1557 discrimination bans by refocusing on serious cases of
race, sex, and disability discrimination. In particular, OCR should
highlight its 2019 investigation and voluntary resolution agreement
with Michigan State University based on the sexual abuse of gymnasts
by Larry Nassar. OCR should also coordinate with the Department of
Education on a public education and civil rights enforcement campaign
to ensure that female college athletes who become pregnant are no
longer pressured to obtain abortions; pursue race discrimination claims
against entities that adopt or impose racially discriminatory policies
such as those based on critical race theory; and announce its intention
to enforce disability rights laws to protect children born prematurely,
children with disabilities, and children born alive after abortions.

5. Issue and finalize the Trump-era draft disability rights regulations
concerning crisis standards of care and use of Quality of Life
Adjusted Years (QALYs), and reissue and finalize a disability
regulation (withdrawn by the Biden Administration) that prohibited
discriminatory application of assisted suicide and denial of life-saving
treatments for disabled newborns.

OCR should withdraw its pharmacy abortion mandate guidance. OCR
should withdraw its “Obligations Under Federal Civil Rights Laws to Ensure
Access to Comprehensive Reproductive Health Care Services” guidance
for retail pharmacies,85 which purports to address nondiscrimination
obligations of pharmacies under federal civil rights laws and in fact orders
them to stock and dispense first-trimester abortion drugs. The guidance
invents this so-called requirement and fails to acknowledge that pharmacies
and pharmacists have the right not to participate in abortions, including
pill-induced abortions, if doing so would violate their sincere moral or
religious objections. Moreover, no federal civil rights laws preempt state
pro-life statutes.

OCR should withdraw its Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA)86 guidance on abortion. OCR should
withdraw its June 2022 guidance87 that purports to address patient privacy
concerns following the Dobbs decision but is actually a politicized statement
in favor of abortion and against Dobbs. HIPAA covers patients in the womb,
but this guidance treats them as nonpersons contrary to law. The guidance
is unnecessary and contributes to ideologically motivated fearmongering
about abortion after Dobbs.
