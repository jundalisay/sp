Given the dire adverse national impact of Biden’s war on fossil fuels, no other
initiative is as important for the DOI under a conservative President than the
restoration of the department’s historic role managing the nation’s vast store-
house of hydrocarbons, much of which is yet to be discovered. The U.S. depends
on reliable and cheap energy resources to ensure the economic well-being of its
citizens, the vitality of its economy, and its geopolitical standing in an uncertain
and dangerous world. Not only are valuable natural resources owned generally
by the American people involved, so too are those owned separately by American
Indian tribes and individual American Indians, both of which have been injured
by Biden’s illegal actions.

The federal government owns 61 percent of the onshore and offshore min-
eral estate of the U.S., but only 22 percent of the nation’s oil and 12 percent of U.S.
natural gas comes from those federal lands and waters—and even that amount is

ADMINISTRATION PRIORITIES

Rollbacks. A new Administration must immediately roll back Biden’s orders,
reinstate the Trump-era Energy Dominance Agenda, rescind Secretarial Order
(SO) 3398, and review all regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies, and declining. Additionally, 42 percent of coal production takes place on federal lands in 11 states.12 DOI manages a subsurface mineral estate of 700 million acres onshore
and 1.76 billion acres offshore, for a total of 2.46 billion acres.

The total land area of the U.S. is 2.263 billion acres. Private and state lands,
at 1.563 billion acres, make up only 39 percent of the total onshore and offshore
subsurface area of the United States. Oil, natural gas, coal, and other minerals on
federal lands and waters are managed by the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau
of Ocean Energy Management, and Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and
Enforcement; these agencies’ responsibilities frequently overlap with resource
management by the U.S. Forest Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, state
governments, and private property owners.

Biden is “aligning the management of...public lands and waters...to support
robust climate action,” as envisioned in Executive Orders 14008 and 13990.13 One of
his first actions was to ban federal coal, oil, and natural gas leasing on federal lands
and waters to fulfill his campaign promise of “no federal oil,” followed by actions
from Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to rescind the Trump Administration’s
Energy Dominance Agenda. To this end, DOI unilaterally overhauled resource
management plans, lease sales, fees, rents, royalty rates, bonding requirements,
and permitting processes to prevent new production of coal, oil, and natural gas
on federal lands and waters; to dramatically increase production of solar and wind
energy; and to accomplish its “30 by 30,” “America the Beautiful” agenda to remove
federal lands from “multiple”—that is, productive—use.

DOI is abusing National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA)14 processes, the
Antiquities Act,15 and bureaucratic procedures to advance a radical climate agenda,
ostensibly to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for which DOI has no statutory
responsibility or authority.16 The Federal Land Policy and Management Act
(FLPMA), Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OSCLA), General Mining Law,17
and other congressional acts clearly set forth multiple-use principles and processes
that include production of coal, oil, natural gas, and other minerals, as legitimate
activities consistent with the welfare of all Americans and of environmental
stewardship.

Biden’s DOI is hoarding supplies of energy and keeping them from Americans
whose lives could be improved with cheaper and more abundant energy while
making the economy stronger and providing job opportunities for Americans.
DOI is a bad manager of the public trust and has operated lawlessly in defiance of
congressional statute and federal court orders.
similar agency actions made in compliance with that order.18 Meanwhile, the
new Administration must immediately reinstate the following Trump DOI sec-
retarial orders:

lSO 3348: Concerning the Federal Coal Moratorium;19
lSO 3349: American Energy Independence;20
lSO 3350: America-First Offshore Energy Strategy;21
lSO 3351: Strengthening the Department of the Interior’s Energy Portfolio;22
lSO 3352: National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska;23

SO 3354: Supporting and Improving the Federal Onshore Oil and Gas
Leasing Program and Federal Solid Mineral Leasing Program;24
SO 3355: Streamlining National Environmental Policy Reviews and
Implementation of Executive Order 13807, “Establishing Discipline and
Accountability in the Environmental Review and Permitting Process for
Infrastructure Projects”;25

SO 3358: Executive Committee for Expedited Permitting;26
SO 3360: Rescinding Authorities Inconsistent with Secretary’s Order 3349,
“American Energy Independence;”27
SO 3380: Public Notice of the Costs Associated with Developing Department
of the Interior Publications and Similar Documents;28
SO 3385: Enforcement Priorities;29 and
SO 3389: Coordinating and Clarifying National Historic Preservation Act
Section 106 Reviews.30

Actions. At the same time, the new Administration must:

Reinstate quarterly onshore lease sales in all producing states according to
the model of BLM’s IM 2018–034, with the slight adjustment of including
expanded public notice and comment.31 The new Administration should
work with Congress on legislation, such as the Lease Now Act32 and

ONSHORE Act,33 to increase state participation and federal accountability
for energy production on the federal estate.

Develop immediately and finalize a new five-year plan, while working with
Congress to reform the OCSLA by eliminating five-year plans in favor of
rolling or quarterly lease sales.
Review all resource management plans finalized in the previous four years
and, when necessary, select studied alternatives to restore the multi-use
concept enshrined in FLPMA and to eliminate management decisions that
advance the 30 by 30 agenda.

Set rents, royalty rates, and bonding requirements to no higher than what is
required under the Inflation Reduction Act.36
Comply with the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act
(ANILCA) and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 to establish a competitive
leasing and development program in the Coastal Plain, an area of Alaska
that was set aside by Congress specifically for future oil and gas exploration
and development. It is often referred to as the “Section 1002 Area” after
the section of ANILCA that excludes the area from Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge’s wilderness designation.37
Conclude the programmatic review of the coal leasing program, and work
with the congressional delegations and governors of Wyoming and Montana
to restart the program immediately.38

Abandon withdrawals of lands from leasing in the Thompson Divide of the
White River National Forest, Colorado; the 10-mile buffer around Chaco
Cultural Historic National Park in New Mexico (restoring the compromise
forged in the Arizona Wilderness Act39); and the Boundary Waters area
in northern Minnesota if those withdrawals have not been completed.40
Meanwhile, revisit associated leases and permits for energy and mineral
production in these areas in consultation with state elected officials.
Require regional offices to complete right-of-way and drilling permits
within the average time it takes states in the region to complete them.

Conduct offshore oil and natural gas lease sales to the maximum extent
permitted under the 2023–2028 lease program,34 with the possibility to
move forward under a previously studied but unselected plan alternative.35
Rulemaking. The following policy reversals require rulemaking:

Rescind the Biden rules and reinstate the Trump rules regarding:
1.
BLM waste prevention;
2. The Endangered Species Act rules defining Critical Habitat and Critical
Habitat Exclusions;41
3. The Migratory Bird Treaty Act;42 and
4. CEQ reforms to NEPA.43

l
Reinstate President Trump’s plan for opening most of the National
Petroleum Reserve of Alaska to leasing and development.
Personnel Changes. The new Administration should be able to draw on the
enormous expertise of state agency personnel throughout the country who are
capable and knowledgeable about land management and prove it daily. States are
better resource managers than the federal government because they must live with
the results. President Trump’s Schedule F proposal44 regarding accountability in
hiring must be reinstituted to bring success to these reforms. Consistent with the
theme of bringing successful state resource management examples to the forefront
of federal policy, DOI should also look for opportunities to broaden state–federal
and tribal–federal cooperative agreements.
