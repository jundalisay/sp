Ordered liberty is at risk when our citizens lack physical safety, when career
criminals do not fear the law, when foreign cartels move narcotics and illegal
aliens into our nation at will, and when political leaders call citizens “domestic
terrorists” for exercising their constitutional rights. The Department of Justice—in
partnership with state and local partners—must recommit in both word and deed
to protecting public safety.

The overwhelming majority of crimes in the United States are properly handled
at the state and local levels,19 but the DOJ can provide critical technical support for
local law enforcement and play a critical agenda-setting role. With respect to the
Department’s core responsibilities—enforcing our immigration laws, combating
domestic and international criminal enterprises, protecting federal civil rights,
and combating foreign espionage—the federal government has primary authority
and, accordingly, accountability.

The evidence shows that the Biden Administration’s Department of Justice has
failed to protect law-abiding citizens and has ignored its most basic obligations. It
has become at once utterly unserious and dangerously politicized. Prosecution and
charging decisions are infused with racial and partisan political double standards.20
Immigration laws are ignored.21 The FBI harasses protesting parents (branded
“domestic terrorists” by some partisans) while working diligently to shut down
politically disfavored speech on the pretext of its being “misinformation” or “disin-
formation.”22 A department that prosecutes FACE Act cases while ignoring dozens
of violent attacks on pregnancy care centers and/or the coordinated violation of
laws that prohibit attempts to intimidate Supreme Court Justices by parading out-
side of their homes23 has clearly lost its way. A department that has twice engaged
in covert domestic election interference and propaganda operations—the Russian
collusion hoax in 2016 and the Hunter Biden laptop suppression in 2020—is a
threat to the Republic.24

Restoring the department’s focus on public safety and a culture of respect
for the rule of law is a gargantuan task that will involve at minimum four
overriding actions:
lRestoring the FBI’s integrity.
lRenewing the DOJ’s focus on violent crime.
lDismantling domestic and international criminal enterprises.
l
Pursuing a national security agenda aimed at external state and non-state
actors, not U.S. citizens exercising their constitutional rights.



RESTORING THE FBI’S INTEGRITY

The FBI was founded in 1908 to “tackle national crime and security issues” when
“there was hardly any systematic way of enforcing the law across this now broad
landscape of America.”25 It best serves the American people when it dedicates its
resources and energies to attacking violent crime,26 criminal organizations,27 child
predators,28 cyber-crime, and other uniquely federal interests.29
Revelations regarding the FBI’s role in the Russia hoax of 2016, Big Tech collu-
sion, and suppression of Hunter Biden’s laptop in 2020 strongly suggest that the
FBI is completely out of control. To protect the Constitution, fight crime effectively,
and protect the nation from foreign adversaries, the next conservative Adminis-
tration should begin to restore the FBI’s domestic reputation and integrity and
enhance its effectiveness in meeting actual foreign threats. To do so, the next con-
servative Administration should:
l
Align the FBI’s placement within the department and the federal
government with its law enforcement and national security
purposes. DOJ veterans often opine that the FBI views itself as an
independent agency—accountable to no one and on par with the Attorney
General in terms of stature—but the fact remains that “[t]he Federal
Bureau of Investigation is located in the Department of Justice.”31 It is
not independent from the department ( just as Immigration and Customs
Enforcement is not independent from the Department of Homeland
Security) and does not deserve to be treated as if it were.
The next conservative Administration should direct the Attorney General
to remove the FBI from the Deputy Attorney General’s direct supervision
within the department’s organizational chart and instead place it under
the general supervision of the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal
Division and the supervision of the Assistant Attorney General for the
National Security Division, as applicable.32 This can be accomplished


Conduct an immediate, comprehensive review of all major active FBI
investigations and activities and terminate any that are unlawful
or contrary to the national interest.30 This is an enormous task, but it
is necessary to re-earn the American people’s trust in the FBI and its work.
To conduct this review, the department should detail attorney appointees
with criminal, national security, or homeland security backgrounds to
catalogue any questionable activities and elevate them to appropriate DOJ
leadership consistent with the new chain of command (discussed below).
The department should also consider issuing a public report of the findings
from this review as appropriate.

through a simple internal departmental reorganization and does not need to
be approved by Congress.

Such a structure would allow the FBI to play an important role in advising
the department’s leadership on emerging threats and updating notable
investigations through daily briefings conducted with the Criminal Division
and National Security Division leadership, but it would also place the FBI
under a politically accountable leader with fewer things to manage than the
Deputy Attorney General or the Attorney General have. All notifications and
approvals that currently run to the Deputy Attorney General or the Attorney
General should be evaluated and redirected in the first instance, where
appropriate, to the relevant Assistant Attorney General.
Such a move would better align the FBI with the mission of the divisions
with which it most often interacts and emphasize the need for the areas on
which it should focus. In general, however, under no circumstances should
the FBI ever be able to go around the Attorney General or the department’s
leadership on any matter within its area of responsibility.



Prohibit the FBI from engaging, in general, in activities related
to combating the spread of so-called misinformation and
disinformation by Americans who are not tied to any plausible
criminal activity. The FBI, along with the rest of the government, needs
a hard reset on the appropriate scope of its legitimate activities. It must
not look to or rely on the past decade as precedent or legitimization for
continued action in certain spaces. This is especially true with respect to
activities that the FBI and the U.S. government writ large claim are efforts to
combat “misinformation,” “disinformation,” or “malinformation.”
The United States government and, by extension, the FBI have absolutely
no business policing speech, whether in the public square, in print, or
online. The First Amendment prohibits it. The United States is the world’s
last best hope for self-government,33 and its survival relies on the ability
of our people to have healthy debate free from government intervention
and censorship. The government, through its officials, is certainly able to
speak and provide information to the public. That is a healthy component
of an informed society. But government must never manipulate the scales
and censor information that is potentially harmful to it or its political
leadership. This is the way of totalitarian dictatorships, not of free
constitutional republics.


The DOJ needs a hard firewall between its legitimate activities (monitoring
online activity for potential threats in its mission space, looking at social
media profiles for evidence of intent or other criminal activity, etc.) and
those in which it must not engage (asking or demanding public forums or
publishers to remove material based on the content and/or viewpoints
expressed or itself censoring speech).

Emphasize, fund, and reward field offices while shrinking
headquarters staff. While the FBI has essential headquarters functions
that must be fulfilled and should likely be fulfilled by a team in Washington,
D.C., the next conservative Administration should make a priority of
deploying, funding, and rewarding the work of the field offices to the
greatest extent possible. The Department of Justice must value badges over
bureaucracy, must rethink its internal reporting structures, and should aim
to realign the FBI’s resources accordingly.

Submit a legislative proposal to Congress to eliminate the 10-year
term for the Director. After J. Edgar Hoover’s decades-long term as FBI
Director came to an end following his death in 1972, and in light of oversight
conducted by Congress into alleged Intelligence Community and FBI
abuses in the 1970s, Congress limited the Director’s tenure to one “ten-
year term.”36 The realities of the FBI’s abuses and overreach in recent years
demonstrate that further reform is still necessary.


Streamline the non–law enforcement functions within the FBI, such
as its Office of General Counsel, and obtain those services from other
offices within the department. The next conservative Administration
should eliminate any offices within the FBI that it has the power to
eliminate without any action from Congress.34 For example, few Americans
know that the FBI maintains a core of approximately 300 attorneys within
its Office of General Counsel, an office that has been involved in some of the
FBI’s most damaging recent scandals.35 These attorneys are not necessary
to the functioning of the FBI in their current capacity. Legal advice should
come from attorneys at the DOJ, whether those attorneys are within the
Criminal Division, the National Security Division, the Justice Management
Division, or the Office of Legal Counsel. Moving legal review outside the FBI
would serve as a crucial check on an agency that has recently pushed past
legal boundary after legal boundary. Similarly, the FBI does not need its own
Office of Congressional Affairs separate and apart from the DOJ Office of
Legislative Affairs, nor does it need its own Office of Public Affairs.
The Director of the FBI must remain politically accountable to the
President in the same manner as the head of any other federal department
or agency. To ensure prompt political accountability and to rein in perceived
or actual abuses, the next conservative Administration should seek a
legislative change to align the FBI Director’s position with those of the
heads of all other major departments and agencies.
