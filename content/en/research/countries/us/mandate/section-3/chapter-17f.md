DOJ grants are an underutilized asset in most conservative Administrations. When used properly, they can be highly effective in implementing the President’s priorities. The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) is comprised of six components and is responsible for most DOJ grants to local law enforcement, juvenile justice, and victims of crime as well as for criminal justice research and statistics. The opportunity to support a President’s agenda may be greater through OJP grant funding than it is through any of the federal government’s other grant-making components.﻿

Consistent with appropriations from Congress, the OJP dispenses approxi- mately $7 billion in various grants. Block grants are given to a state to be awarded pursuant to federal regulations. Some funds to support law enforcement and victims of crime are awarded pursuant to block grants. But most OJP funds are awarded through discretionary grants—specific programs written into the budget by Congress.

Although Congress dictates the way in which many grant awards are to be made, federal staff enjoy a tremendous amount of discretion in adding “conditions” and “priority points.” Grants operate with a carrot and a stick. To receive grant funding, a recipient must agree to certain conditions, which in many instances include the President’s priorities. For instance, under an anti–human trafficking grant during the Obama Administration (approximately $110 million in 2020), an awardee had to show a partnership with an LGBTQ organization and always have an interpreter on site. These conditions worked to change culture and overlayed President Obama’s priorities: support for the LGBTQ community and for more of the funding to go to areas with large immigrant populations.

During the Trump Administration, a condition added to grants stated that an awardee had to comply with all federal law (stock language), including federal law regarding the exchange of information between federal and local authorities about an individual’s immigration status. This condition prevented law enforcement in “sanctuary cities” from receiving grant awards. While the Trump Administra- tion suffered a series of setbacks from several hostile courts, it obtained from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals a decision upholding the department’s authority to impose these conditions.92

To ensure that taxpayer-funded grants are prioritized and distributed properly,
the next conservative Administration should:

Conduct an immediate, comprehensive review of all federal grant
disbursals to ensure not only that the programs are being properly
administered by the department, but also that the grant funding is
being received and used properly by recipients.

Order an overhaul of the DOJ grant application process, to include
more rigorous vetting of state, local, and private grant applicants and
inclusion of more pre-application criteria to ensure baseline fitness
and eligibility for federal grant dollars. This long-overdue enhancement
of the grant application and issuance process will ensure that hard-earned
taxpayer dollars are going only to lawful actors who support federal law
enforcement and demonstrate the ability and willingness to engage in
lawful activities.

Ensuring Proper Enforcement and Administration of Our Immigration
Laws. Although its role has changed over the years, most notably following the
passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002,93 the Department of Justice plays
a crucial role in the enforcement and adjudication of our immigration laws.94 Its
leadership and energy, however, have not always reflected the importance placed
by Congress on the execution of that crucial mission. With a few notable exceptions,
successful fulfillment of the department’s responsibilities with respect to immi-
gration was largely neglected until the Trump Administration. The Department
of Homeland Security may be the largest federal department with immigration
responsibilities, but successful fulfillment of the responsibilities prescribed by
the immigration laws is not possible without bold and dedicated action by the
Department of Justice.

The DOJ and its leadership must intentionally prioritize fulfillment of the
department’s immigration-related responsibilities in the next conservative Admin-
istration. This will be no small task, as these responsibilities play out across nearly
every DOJ office and component. If they hope to fulfill their responsibilities as
assigned by Congress and deliver results for the American people, the department
and the Attorney General should:

Pursue appropriate steps to assist the Department of Homeland
Security in obtaining information about criminal aliens in
jurisdictions across the United States, particularly those inside
“sanctuary” jurisdictions.

Examine and consider the appropriateness of withdrawing or
overturning every immigration decision rendered by Attorney
General Garland (and any successor Attorney General during
President Biden’s term). The Attorney General should pick up where the
Attorneys General under President Trump left off and exercise his or her
authority to adjudicate cases and provide guidance in appropriate cases to

Issue guidance to all U.S. Attorneys emphasizing the importance
of prosecuting immigration offenses,95 and immigration-related
offenses. The brunt of these offenses is born by districts along the
southwestern border with Mexico, but the simple fact remains that
immigration and immigration-related offenses are present in every
district across the country. Successfully pursuing the priorities outlined
in this chapter will require creative use of the various immigration and
immigration-related authorities in close partnership with the Department
of Homeland Security, the Department of State, and other appropriate
federal entities depending on the situation.
correct erroneous decisions, provide clarity, and align Executive Office for
Immigration Review (EOIR) decisions with the law.

Commit sufficient resources to the adjudication of cases in the
immigration court system in different environments (for example, in
the context of the Migrant Protection Protocols).
Pursue proactive litigation to advance the federal government’s
interests in areas where erroneous precedent curtails authorities
provided by Congress (for example, by pursuing the overturning of
the Flores Settlement Agreement).

At a minimum, pursue through rulemaking—and in partnership
with the Department of Homeland Security where appropriate—the
promulgation of every rule related to immigration that was issued
during the Trump Administration. Such rulemakings include guidance
on continuances in immigration court cases, eligibility for asylum, and
other related matters. However, the DOJ should not stop there: It should
continually evaluate its authorities and operational reality within the
immigration court system and promulgate regulations accordingly.

Pursue aggressive enforcement of the immigration laws within the
Immigrant and Employee Rights Section of the Civil Rights Division
to ensure that no American citizen is discriminated against in the
employment context in favor of a temporary or foreign worker.96
Ensure the deployment and use of appointees throughout the
department who are committed to successful achievement of the
department’s immigration-related missions. This includes personnel in or overseeing not only the EOIR, but also the Office of the Attorney General,
Office of the Deputy Attorney General, Office of the Associate Attorney
General, Office of the Solicitor General, and nearly every other component/
office throughout the department.

Pursue a more vigorous anti-fraud program within the EOIR. In
perhaps no other area of law are there more attorneys who commit acts
of fraud against their clients—advancing completely meritless arguments
in exchange for exorbitant fees—than there are in the area of immigration.
Fraud and unethical behavior are rampant in the immigration system and
must be addressed—not only to ensure that the federal government is
operating in a proper manner, but also for the sake of the aliens involved in the process as well as the integrity/credibility of the members of the private immigration bar who do not engage in such conduct.
