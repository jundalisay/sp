<!-- Adam Smith recognized that connections were a bedrock of society because they stimulate specialization, innovation, and capital investment. 

In the following decades, America’s growth was made possible by transportation—first ports and transatlantic shipping, then roads, canals, and eventually railroads pushing westward to create the nation we call home. 

Access to transportation is part of what made our country great. -->

The US Department of Transportation (DOT), with a requested fiscal year (FY) 2023 budget of $142 billion, was originally intended simply to provide a policy framework for transportation safety, rulemaking, and regulation. 

However, it has evolved:
- “to deliver the world’s leading transportation system”
- to select individual projects and allocate taxpayer funds in the actual planning, developing, and building of transportation assets

Such a role is held better by transportation asset owners: 
- states
- municipalities
- the private sector

In addition to providing a safety and regulatory framework through its 11 subcomponents, known as modes, the department has become a de facto grantmaking and lending organization. 

The DOT:
- provides approximately $50 billion in discretionary and formula grants, known as obligations, annually in areas ranging from transit systems to road construction to universities
- has lent or subsidized more than $60 billion since the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) program
  - This is now managed by the Build America Bureau, was created in 1998.

This evolved role as a major funding and financing source is far from the department’s original policy framework. 

It also removes incentives for state and local officials to ensure that investments are worthwhile, because federal money removes the need to get public buy-in to build and maintain infrastructure projects as funding becomes “someone else’s money.”

<!-- Despite the department’s tremendous resources, congressional mandates and
funding priorities have made it difficult for  -->

The DOT has not focused on the pressing transportation challenges that most directly affect average Americans, such as:
- the high cost of automobiles
- unpredictable and expensive commercial shipping by rail, air, and sea
- infrastructure spending that does not match the types of transportation that most Americans prefer. 

Transforming the department to address the varied needs of all Americans more effectively remains a central challenge.

The 11 major components of the DOT are:
- 9 modal administrations
- the Office of the Secretary
- the Office of the Inspector General

These all have their own sets of personnel including:
- administrators
- deputy administrators
- chiefs of staff
- general counsels

This makes the DOT particularly difficult to manage.

Most grants flow through the modes, such as:
- the Federal Highway Administration
- Federal Transit Administration
- Federal Aviation Administration.

The Office of the Secretary contains its own grantmaking operation that funds research and some special grants, as well as a major lending operation, the Build America Bureau, that functions as an infrastructure bank. 

The Office of the Secretary has department-wide offices for such functions as Budget and Financial Management, the General Counsel, Policy, the Office of Research and Technology, Government Affairs, Administration, the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization, Public Affairs, Drug and Alcohol Policy and Compliance, and Civil Rights. 

The modal administrations include the:
- Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)
- Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)
- Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)
- National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
- Federal Transit Administration (FTA)
- Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation (GLS)
- Maritime Administration (MARAD)
- Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)
- Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA)

The DOT’s fundamental problem is that instead of being able to focus on providing Americans with affordable and abundant transportation, it has become saddled with congressional requirements that reduce the department to a de facto grant-making organization. 

Yet there is little need for much of this grantmaking because if funding must be federal, it would be more efficient for Congress to send transportation grants to each of the 50 states and allow each state to purchase the transportation services that it thinks are best. 

This would enable states to prioritize different types of transportation according to the needs of their citizens. 

States that rely more on automotive transportation could use their funding to meet those needs.

<!-- Meanwhile, many Americans continue to confront serious challenges with
their day-to-day transportation, including costs that have increased dramatically in recent years. DOT in its current form is insufficiently equipped to address
those problems.  -->

DOT’s discretionary grant-making processes should be abolished, and funding should be focused on formulaic distributions to the states, which know best their transportation needs and are incentivized to think of the long-term maintenance costs. At a bare minimum, the number of grants should be consolidated.


New technology enables private companies to charge for transportation in
many areas, which could transform how innovation is financed. It is vital to
consider the role of user fees and other pricing innovations with regard to
transportation infrastructure. Airport landing fees for aircraft, toll charges
on roads and bridges, and per-gallon taxes on gasoline and diesel fuel are
all examples of user charges that affect the decisions of transportation
system users. These changes could shift our nation’s transportation away
from being a top–down system that is misaligned with the needs of so
many Americans. Increasing private-sector financing could revolutionize
travel and increase everyday mobility to its greatest potential in a way that
Americans prefer. Doing so would keep transportation decisions out of the
hands of bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., who are far removed from local
problems and preferences.

DOT would also reduce unnecessary burdens by returning to the Trump Admin-
istration’s “rule on rules” approach to regulations, implemented in late 2019 as RIN
2105-AE84.4 This rule strengthened the Administration’s effort to remove outdated
regulations, find cost-saving reforms, and clarify that guidance documents are
in fact guidance rather than mandatory impositions. The Biden Administration
unwisely moved away from this reform, and the next Administration should revive
it without delay.



### BUILD AMERICA BUREAU

The Build America Bureau (BAB) resides within the Office of the Secretary and
describes itself as “responsible for driving transportation infrastructure develop-
ment projects in the United States.”5 This lofty-sounding goal in practice means
that the Bureau serves as the point of contact for distributing funds for transpor-
tation projects in the form of subsidized 30-year loans. For higher-quality projects
and in certain circumstances, these government loans may disintermediate the
private sector from providing similar financing, albeit at higher costs.
At certain times in the economic cycle, and for many lower-quality projects with
more dubious economic return, similar loans from the private sector are simply
not available. Should the BAB continue to exist and potentially disintermediate
the private financing sector, it must maintain underwriting discipline and continue
best practices of requiring rigorous financial modeling and cushion for repayment
of loans in a variety of economic scenarios. In addition:

The BAB should ensure that these loans do not become grants in another
form by maintaining the requirement that all project borrowers be rated
at least investment grade by the major ratings agencies and that project
sponsors remain liable to ensure that all financing is repaid, even in periods
of financial stress and economic downturns.
Project sponsors should be required to show that projects have positive
economic value to taxpayers, and sponsors should guarantee that all federal
financing will be repaid through properly structured loan terms, including a
minimum equity commitment from all project sponsors.

All projects should also be required to show repayment ability in various
interest rate environments, and the BAB should ensure that long-term loans
are structured appropriately with regard to the fixing of interest rates and
hedging of interest rate risk on the part of the borrowers to avoid financial
stress or default driven solely by rising interest rates.


Policymakers should maintain awareness and promote transparency
regarding the continued existence of this loan program and whether private
financiers are being disintermediated by the subsidized BAB lending that
the private sector simply cannot match.

A cost-benefit analysis of the federal government’s potential replacement
and disintermediation of the private financing sector regarding
infrastructure loans, which is not currently performed, should be conducted
on a regular basis.


### PUBLIC–PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS

Provide access to some of the world’s best talent with vast experience in
delivering infrastructure,
Create incentives for innovation and creativity,
Shift unique project risks to companies that are familiar with
those risks, and


Much infrastructure could be funded through public–private partnerships (P3s),
a procurement method that uses private financing to construct infrastructure. In
exchange for providing the financing, the private partner typically retains the right
to operate the asset under requirements specified by the government in a contract
called a concession agreement. In addition, the private partner is given the right
either to collect fees from the users of the asset or to receive a periodic payment
from the government conditioned on the asset’s availability: If a highway is not
open to traffic when it should be, for example, the government’s payment to the
private concessionaire is reduced.

The best practice for a government that is interested in using a P3 to deliver
a project is for the government first to perform a value-for-money study, which
compares the costs and benefits of procuring the asset under a typical procurement
against the costs and benefits of utilizing a P3. Since private equity is involved, the
financing costs for P3s are higher, but they also are frequently more than offset by
the private sector’s ability to generate efficiencies and cost savings in the design,
construction, maintenance, and operation of the asset. If the value-for-money
study finds that the efficiencies of a P3 and the value of risk shifted to the private
sector exceed the additional financing costs, then utilizing a P3 is good public policy
because Americans have better infrastructure at a lower cost.
As well as providing better transportation facilities for Americans, P3s offer a
number of benefits to governments. Specifically, they:

Allow designers, contractors, and maintenance teams to work together
through the delivery of the process to focus on lifecycle costs as opposed to
just initial design and construction costs.
It should be noted that project funding and P3s are not synonymous. Policy-
makers and government leaders frequently mistake the financing that P3s provide
for funding. A P3 allows the government to obtain equity from the private sector,
but that equity has to be paid back with interest. Like a loan, a P3 can be used to
accelerate revenues and provide needed capital to help pay the upfront costs of a
project, but also like a loan, the private P3 investors must be paid back for investors
to realize a financial return.

Some mistakenly think that using a P3 would allow a road or bridge to be deliv-
ered without increases in tolls or taxes. It is important to remember that all funding
for governmental infrastructure comes from either taxes or user fees. P3 financing
can be used to make those funding sources more efficient, but it cannot replace the
need for taxes or user fees to provide the funding for the project.
In addition, a poorly managed P3 procurement process (the process govern-
ment uses to identify the best private P3 partner) can result in excessive consultant
costs and years-long delays in delivery. While P3s can offer efficiencies in delivering
the project, the P3 procurement process itself can be significantly longer and more
expensive than traditional procurement processes.

Finally, and possibly most important, a P3 gives a private party the ability to
collect fees or payments over decades (a period well beyond the length of the
careers of the political appointees who sign contracts with private parties). Thus,
P3s create an opportunity for current governmental leaders to obtain a higher
upfront payment from the private party in exchange for greater user fees paid by
future generations who will use the asset. In other words, a governmental CEO
(governor, mayor, head of an authority) can use a P3 to impose unnecessarily high
costs on users decades in the future in exchange for upfront cash. It is important
that contracts be transparent in order to minimize this possibility.
A P3’s greatest public value is realized when the procurement model is used for
a project that is unusually risky or a type of project with which the government
has limited experience such as a tunnel or light rail line. P3s are an excellent tool
for transferring risk from the public sector to the private sector and can create
considerable value for the taxpaying public. However, a high degree of expertise
is required to ensure that the risk transfer warrants the higher financing and pro-
curement costs that P3s impose.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

As private companies develop a future of new, emerging technologies, one role
for DOT is driving clarity in the government’s role and setting standards for safety,

security, and privacy without hampering innovation. DOT can oversee the testing
and deployment of a wide variety of new technologies, allowing communities and
individuals to choose what best fits their needs. It is the role of the private sector,
not the government, to pick winners and losers in technology development. If a
technology underperforms, the private sector should be liable, not the government.
The department should ensure a tech-neutral approach to addressing any
emerging transportation technology while keeping safety as the number one
priority. As part of this, it should work to facilitate the safe and full integration
of automated vehicles into the national transportation system. Over time, these
advanced technologies can save lives, transform personal mobility, and provide
additional transportation opportunities—including for people with disabili-
ties, aging populations, and communities where car ownership is expensive or
impractical.

NHTSA’s and FMCSA’s current regulations were written before the advent of
automated vehicles and driving systems. Both operating administrations have
issued Advance Notices of Proposed Rulemakings (ANPRMs) that begin the pro-
cess of updating their regulations to reflect this new technology. However, these
regulations have stalled under the Biden Administration, which has chosen to
use the department’s tools to get people to take transit and drive electric vehicles
instead of helping people to choose the transportation options that suit them best.


NHTSA should work to remove regulatory barriers by focusing on updating
vehicle standards as well as publishing performance-based rules for the
operations of automated vehicles (AVs).
FMCSA should work to clarify the regulations to align with DOT’s AV 3.0
guidance, which would allow the drivers to be safely removed from the
operations of a commercial motor vehicle.

From a nonregulatory point of view, DOT has pivoted from a successful focus
on the voluntary sharing of data to improve safety outcomes to adoption of a more
compulsory and antagonistic approach to mandating data collection and publica-
tion through a Standing General Order related to automated vehicles. This needs
to be reversed.

Many of these new and innovative technologies rely on wireless communica-
tions that depend on the availability and purchase of radio frequency spectrum,
a trend that is consistent with what we see in connectivity in our everyday lives.
There is a role for DOT in ensuring that in the fight over spectrum, transportation
gets its fair share.

For technologies to work in transportation, and in particular to work for
transportation safety, they have to meet the unique needs of a transportation 
environment. They need to account for rapidly moving and out-of-line-of-sight
vehicles as well as pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users. They should
account for the potential for radio interference, and they should address security.
This is why in 1999, in response to a request from Congress, the Federal Com-
munications Commission allocated the 5.9 GHz band of spectrum to traffic safety
and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In 2020, the FCC took away 45 MHz
of the 75 MHz it had added, leaving only 30 MHz for transportation safety and
ITS. DOT needs to represent the transportation community and make the case
for needed spectrum to the public and Congress.
