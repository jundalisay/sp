### AGENCY OVERVIEW

DOI’s purview encompasses more than 500 million acres of federal lands, including national parks and national wildlife refuges; 700 million acres of sub- surface minerals; 1.7 billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS); 23 percent of the nation’s energy; water in 17 western states; and trust responsibilities for 566 Indian tribes and Alaska Natives. DOI’s 2024 budget request totals $18.9 billion, an increase of $2 billion, or 12 percent, more than the 2023 enacted level. The budget also provides an estimated $12.6 billion in permanent funding in 2024. In 2024, DOI will generate receipts of $19.6 billion.

A “Home Department” had been considered in 1789 and urged by Presidents
over the decades until DOI’s creation in 1849. The variety of its early responsibil-
ities—the Indian Bureau, the General Land Office, the Bureau of Pensions, and
the Patent Office, among others—earned it various nicknames, including “Great
Miscellany,” “hydra-headed monster,” and “Mother of Departments.”1 Its mission
became more focused on natural resources with the rise of the conservation move-
ment in the early 20th century; however, it kept its historic (since the days of the
Founding Fathers) role as overseer of vast working landscapes involving grazing, logging, mining, oil, and gas and, with the Bureau of Reclamation in 1902, as the
nation’s dam builder. Today, DOI has 70,000 employees in approximately 2,400
locations with offices across the United States, Puerto Rico, and U.S. Territories
and Freely Associated States.

The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) oversees, manages, and protects
the nation’s natural resources and cultural heritage; provides scientific
and other information about those resources; and honors the nation’s trust
responsibilities or special commitments to American Indians, Alaska Natives, and
affiliated island communities.

Historically, DOI operated in a bipartisan manner consistent with the laws
enacted by Congress pursuant to its powers under the Property Clause.2 Thus,
DOI fulfilled its statutory responsibilities in a manner that ensured the ability of
western states, counties, and communities to be sustained by both economic and
recreational activities on neighboring federal lands, especially given that in some
rural western counties, federal lands constituted 50, 60, 70, 80—even 90 percent
of the county’s landmass.3

That ended with the Administration of President Jimmy Carter, who, beholden
to environmental groups that supported his election, adopted DOI policies consis-
tent with their demands, much to the horror of western governors, most of whom
were Democrats. President Ronald Reagan campaigned against this “War on the
West,” declared himself a “Sagebrush Rebel,” and, on taking office,4 quelled the
rebellion by reversing Carter Administration policies. President George H. W.
Bush distanced himself from Reagan’s western policies, committed to a “kinder
and gentler America,” and proclaimed his desire to be “the environmental Pres-
ident,” which resulted in changes at the his Administration’s DOI—again, much
to the dismay of westerners.5 President Bill Clinton resumed Carter’s “War on
the West,” epitomized by his DOI’s deploying of wolves into the states bordering
Yellowstone National Park; the decreed death of a world-class mine in Montana;
and the designation of a vast national monument in Utah over the objections of
Utah leaders—but with the support of the Hollywood elite.6

Although Texas Governor George W. Bush and former Wyoming Representative
Dick Cheney (R–WY) campaigned in 2000 against Clinton’s worst outrages, includ-
ing the Utah monument, there was no significant ratcheting back of DOI policies
that were either objected to by westerners or contrary to the express provisions of
federal statutes. President Barack Obama’s DOI resumed the anti-economic fed-
eral lands policies activated by Carter and amplified by Clinton; however, Obama’s
DOI’s antipathy to oil and gas activity on federal lands as mandated by Congress
could not have come at a worse time.

After the demonstrated success of fracking on Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) acreage in Wyoming in 1993, the fracking revolution soon swept the nation,7
yielding massive discoveries on state and private land from coast to coast, but not,
thanks to Obama, on western federal lands.8 President Donald Trump, on the other
hand, immediately ordered his DOI to comply with federal law, conduct congressio-
nally mandated lease sales, and seek to achieve energy dominance or independence.
Thanks in part to the success of oil and gas operations on federal land in the West,
the United States achieved energy security for the first time since 1957 in 2019.9


### BUDGET STRUCTURE

At $18.9 billion, DOI’s 2024 proposed budget is small relative to many other
federal agencies. On the other side of the ledger, the DOI forecasts it will generate
more than $19.6 billion in “offsetting receipts” from oil and gas royalties, timber
and grazing fees, park user fees, and land sales, among other sources. Most of the
proposed allocations are divided among nine bureaus.
Bureau of Indian Affairs. Fulfills Indian trust responsibilities on behalf of
566 Indian tribes; supports natural resource education, law enforcement, and
social service programs delivered by tribes; operates 182 elementary and secondary
schools and dormitories and 29 tribally controlled community colleges, universi-
ties, and post-secondary schools.

Bureau of Land Management. Manages and conserves resources for 245
million acres of public land and 700 million acres of subsurface federal mineral
estate, including energy and mineral development, forest management, timber
and biomass production, and wild horse and burro management.

Biden’s DOI abandoned all pretense of complying with federal law regarding federally owned oil and gas resources. Not
since the Administration of President Harry S. Truman—prior to creation of the
OCS oil and gas program—have fewer federal leases been issued.10

At DOI, not since the Reagan Administration was the radical environmen-
tal agenda (first implemented by Carter, resumed by Clinton, and revitalized
by Obama) rolled back as substantially as it was by President Trump. Trump’s
DOI change affected not only oil and gas leasing, as noted above, but all statutory
responsibilities of its various agencies, bureaus, and offices. Thus, whether the
statutory mandate was to promote economic activity, to ensure and expand rec-
reational opportunities, or to protect valuable natural resources, including, for
example, parks, wilderness areas, national monuments, and wild and scenic areas,
efforts were expended, barriers were removed, and career employees were aided
in the accomplishment of those missions.

Unfortunately, Biden’s DOI is at war with the department’s mission, not only
when it comes to DOI’s obligation to develop the vast oil and gas and coal resources
for which it is responsible, but also as to its statutory mandate, for example, to
manage much of federal land overseen by the BLM pursuant to “multiple use” and
“sustained yield” principles.11 Instead, Biden’s DOI believes most BLM land should
be placed off-limits to all economic and most recreational uses. Worse yet, Biden’s
DOI not only refuses to adhere to the statutes enacted by Congress as to how the
lands under its jurisdiction are managed, but it also insists on implementing a vast
regulatory regime (for which Congress has not granted authority) and overturning,
by unilateral regulatory action, congressional acts that set forth the productive
economic uses permitted on DOI-managed federal land.﻿

Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Manages access to renewable and
conventional energy resources of the Outer Continental Shelf, including more than
6,400 fluid mineral leases on approximately 35 million OCS acres; issues leases
for 24 percent of domestic crude oil and 8 percent of domestic natural gas supply;
oversees lease and grant issuance for offshore renewable energy projects.
Bureau of Reclamation. Manages, develops, and protects water and related
resources, including 476 dams and 337 reservoirs; delivers water to one in every
five western farmers and more than 31 million people; is America’s second-largest
producer of hydroelectric power.


### Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement.

Regulates offshore oil
and gas facilities on 1.7 billion acres of the Outer Continental Shelf; oversees oil
spill response; supports research on technology for oil spill response.
National Park Service. Maintains and manages 401 natural, cultural, and
recreational sites, 26,000 historic structures, and more than 44 million acres of
wilderness; provides outdoor recreation; provides technical assistance and support
to state and local programs.

Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement. Regulates coal
mining and site reclamation; provides grants to states and tribes for mining over-
sight; mitigates the effects of past mining.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Manages the 150-million-acre National Wild-
life Refuge System; manages 70 fish hatcheries and other related facilities for
endangered species recovery; protects migratory birds and some marine mammals.
U.S. Geological Survey. Conducts scientific research in ecosystems, climate,
and land-use change, mineral assessments, environmental health, and water
resources; produces information about natural hazards (earthquakes, volcanoes,
and landslides); leads climate change research for the department.
