To ensure that the American people have access to abundant, affordable, and
reliable energy, DESAS’s energy role should be focused on:

Working with the energy industry and networks to ensure energy
infrastructure security through science and coordination with the
private sector.

Assessing international energy issues that constitute threats to U.S.
national security.

Promoting U.S. energy resources as a means to assist our allies, diminish our
strategic adversaries, and ensure the existence of markets that will support
domestic energy production.

Pursuing early and advanced science, including materials science, that is
related to energy and national security.
Developing the leadership necessary for the disposal of commercial and
government spent nuclear fuel.


### National Energy Security

Protecting American infrastructure from cyber and physical threats, both natural and human, is vital to national security, the
economy, and the well-being of the American people. Protecting and advanc-
ing these national security interests is a proper role for the federal government.
DESAS should:

Focus on studying threats to the electric grid, natural gas, and oil
infrastructure; sharing such information with the energy industry;
promoting the reliability and security of energy resources and
infrastructure; and developing strategies and technologies to combat
threats by working with the National Labs. The following offices would
report to the DESAS Undersecretary of Energy Security:

1. Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response
(CESER), elevated to an Assistant Secretary. CESER would work with
the existing or reconstituted versions (as described in more detail
below) of the Office of Electricity (OE); Office of Nuclear Energy (NE);
Office of Fossil Energy (FE), currently the Office of Fossil Energy
and Carbon Management (FECM); Office of Energy Efficiency and
Renewable Energy (EERE); and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)
to identify and address threats to energy infrastructure.7 Instead of
trying to decarbonize the American economy and allocating taxpayer
dollars for commercialization of energy technologies, these offices
would focus on energy security by identifying threats to energy supplies
and infrastructure, developing strategies to address those threats, and
funding fundamental science and technology where appropriate.
2. Office of Electricity (Assistant Secretary).
3. Office of Nuclear Energy (Assistant Secretary).
4.
Office of Fossil Energy (Assistant Secretary, with Carbon Management
deleted from its title and purpose.
5. Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (Assistant Secretary).
6.


### Strategic Petroleum Reserve (stand-alone or part of CESER).

Eliminate special-interest funding programs. Many DOE energy funding programs are not targeted on fundamental science and technology;
instead, they focus more on commercialization and act as subsidies to the private sector for government-favored resources. The DOE Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED); Office of State and Community Energy
Programs; ARPA-E; Office of Grid Deployment (OGD); and DOE Loan
Program should be eliminated or reformed. If they continue to exist, FECM,
NE, OE, and EERE should focus on fundamental science and technology
issues, particularly in relation to cyber and physical threats to energy
security, rather than subsidizing and commercializing energy resources.


Focus the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP) on ensuring that government buildings and operations have reliable and cost-effective energy. FEMP should stop using taxpayer dollars to force the purchase of more expensive and less reliable energy resources in the name
of combating climate change.

Ensure that information provided by the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), a data and statistical organization, is data-neutral.
Focus FERC on its statutory obligation to ensure access to reliable
energy at just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory rates. FERC is a
five-member commission created under the DOE Organization Act that
regulates the wholesale sales and transmission of electricity, promotes
electric reliability through standards, permits natural gas pipelines and
LNG export facilities, sets natural gas pipeline shipping rates, and sets oil
pipeline shipping rates. It is an economic regulator and should not make
itself a climate regulator.

Streamline the nuclear regulatory requirements and licensing
process. Such changes would help to lower costs and accelerate the
development and deployment of civilian nuclear, such as advanced
nuclear reactors (including small modular nuclear reactors). The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission (NRC) is commission tasked with the licensing
of civilian nuclear reactors and power plants and regulating other uses of
nuclear materials, such as nuclear medicine. Although it is not a DOE agency,
its jurisdiction over nuclear reactor, fuel, safety, and trade issues often
relates to or impinges on DOE’s jurisdiction.


Eliminate political and climate-change interference in DOE
approvals of liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. In addition, Congress
should reform the Natural Gas Act8 to expand required approvals from
merely nations with free trade agreements to all of our allies, such as
NATO countries.

Focus on energy and science issues, not politicized social programs.
The next Administration should stop using energy policy to advance
politicized social agendas. Programs that sound innocuous, such as “energy
justice,”9 Justice40,10 and DEI,11 can be transformed to promote politicized
agendas. DOE should focus on providing all Americans with access to
abundant, affordable, reliable, and secure energy, and DOE should manage
its employees so that everyone is treated fairly based on his or her talent,
skills, and hard work.


#### New Policies: International Energy Security

To help the President and policymakers understand and apply U.S. energy inter-
ests in international affairs more effectively, various DOE programs offices need
to be reformed.

Promote American energy interests. The next Administration should make
U.S. energy dominance a key component of its foreign policy while ensuring
that domestic and international goals are aligned. American energy dominance
will allow the United States to secure energy for its citizens, markets for its
energy exports, and access to new energy natural resources and will provide
tools for U.S. policymakers to assist our allies and deter our adversaries. DESAS
should analyze U.S. international energy security interests and develop a
National Energy Security Strategy (NESS). This strategy would take account
of the energy landscape across the globe to inform the President in his foreign
policy and defense roles, but it should not be a tool for U.S. industrial policy,
although it might highlight how current domestic industrial and climate
policies threaten U.S. energy and national security.

Strengthen the role of the new Department of Energy Security and
Advanced Science. There are frequent turf battles on energy issues between
the Department of State and DOE. Although the State Department clearly has
the policymaking authority under the DOE Organization Act, it tends to ignore
the expertise and perspectives that DOE provides. The existing Assistant
Secretary for International Affairs should provide the principal support for
the DOE Secretary and Deputy Secretary on National Security Council (NSC)
activities and should interface with colleagues at the Departments of Defense,
State, Treasury, and Commerce, as well as the Intelligence Community (IC).

### New Policies: Advanced Science

To ensure that America continues to lead the world in fundamental science, the
National Labs should be refocused, and national science policy should be reviewed
and coordinated.

Refocus the National Labs on fundamental and advanced science.
DOE currently oversees 17 National Laboratories. The three National Labs
run by DOE’s NNSA should continue to focus on national security issues.
The remaining 14 science and energy labs should focus on basic research
projects; demonstration and deployment of technology should be left to
the private sector. This goal can be achieved by realigning the labs to limit
duplication and mission creep and to maximize potential.

Conduct a whole-of-government assessment and consolidation of
science. Before the start of a new Administration, there should be a review of
all the federal science agencies.12 This should include a review of the ill-advised
attempt to expand the National Science Foundation’s mission from supporting
university research to supporting an all-encompassing technology transition.
Specific to DOE, there should be a review to measure, prioritize, and consolidate
DOE programs based on a range of beneficial factors, including degree of
relationship to national security; furtherance of energy security (cyber but also
international aspects); and importance to scientific discovery/advancement.

### New Policies: Remediation of Nuclear Weapons Development Programs and Civilian Nuclear Waste

Continue DOE’s remediation of radioactive waste created by the
nuclear weapons projects from the Manhattan Project and Cold
War. Strong leadership focused on accelerating the cleanup, coupled with
technical and administrative innovation, will be needed to reduce the
federal government’s third largest liability.

Develop a new approach that increases the level of private-sector
responsibility for the disposal of nuclear waste. Disposing of civilian
nuclear waste is an important national issue that requires strong scientific
study. According to an independent audit conducted by the public
accounting firm of KPMG, the Nuclear Waste Fund holds $46 billion in
payments by utilities and their ratepayers, plus interest, for a permanent
waste disposal site for spent nuclear fuel and other nuclear waste.14 The

Cleaning up the radioactive waste produced in support of the Manhattan Project
and the Cold War at America’s nuclear development sites is a massive and com-
plicated process led by DOE’s Office of Environmental Management. Projected
liabilities and costs to be borne by America’s taxpayers, according to DOE’s FY
2023 budget request, total $887,205 billion.13 In addition, the federal government is
required by law to dispose of nuclear waste produced by the private sector, includ-
ing spent fuel rods from nuclear power plants. The new DESAS should:
licensing process for Yucca Mountain as a permanent repository for spent
nuclear fuel is on hold. Without storage sites, spent nuclear fuel remains
temporarily stored at nuclear plants. In addition to permanent storage, low-
level nuclear waste facilities are needed.



### New Policies: NNSA

The U.S. nuclear arsenal needs to be updated and reinvigorated if we are to be
able to deal effectively with threats from China, Russia, and other adversaries. As a
semi-autonomous agency, the NNSA has the primary responsibility for researching
and designing new nuclear warheads and for ensuring that the existing nuclear
arsenal is still potent. These efforts require significant funding and scientific know-
how. In addition, NNSA develops and designs nuclear propulsion reactors for the
U.S. Navy. NNSA also plays a role in preventing nuclear proliferation. With strong
leadership by the Secretary of DESAS, the next Administration should:

Fund the design, development, and deployment of new nuclear
warheads, including the production of plutonium pits in quantity.15
Expand the U.S. Navy and develop new nuclear naval reactors to
ensure that the Navy has the nuclear propulsion it needs to secure
America’s strategic interests.
End ineffective and counterproductive nonproliferation activities
like those involving Iran and the United Nations.

Budget

DOE’s total FY 2023 budget request (which does not include IIJA, IRA, and CHIPS
and Science Act funding) was for $48,183,451,000.16 Many DOE activities are required
by various authorization and appropriations bills. To implement many of the policies
contained in these proposals, several laws will need to be amended, including the
Department of Energy Organization Act, IIJA, IRA, and possibly portions of the
CHIPS (Creating Healthy Incentives to Produce Semiconductors) and Science Act.17
Ending taxpayer subsidies will promote an “all of the above” energy policy, lead to
more energy resources, reduce costs, and save taxpayers billions of dollars.
