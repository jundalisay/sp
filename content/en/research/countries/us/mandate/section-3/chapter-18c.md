Remove ESG considerations from ERISA. Environmental, Social,
Governance (ESG) investing is a relatively recent strategy promoted by
large asset managers that focuses not only on a company’s bottom line, but
also on the company’s compliance with liberal political views on climate
change, racial quotas, abortion, and other issues. The ESG movement has
focused especially on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. For example, ESG
proponents advocate for divestment from oil and gas companies or the
exercise of investor influence to reduce oil and gas production.
ESG considerations unrelated to investor risks and returns necessarily
sacrifice trust law’s traditional sole focus on investment returns for
collateral interests. And while individual investors may prefer to invest
in “green” companies, “woke” companies, or companies with greater board
diversity, and may even be willing to sacrifice some financial gains to do so, the question relevant to DOL is whether, and under what conditions,
fiduciaries should be permitted to follow this path as well.
While Americans are free to invest their own savings however they wish,
in ERISA, Congress imposed strict duties on employer-sponsored worker
retirement plans as a prophylactic protection of workers’ retirement
security in general. Recognizing the unique status of employer-managed
retirement savings, in ERISA, Congress required that fiduciaries
exclusively seek the best interests of plan beneficiaries. Because ESG
investing necessarily puts other considerations before the interests of the
beneficiary, ESG investing by plan managers is an inappropriate strategy
under ERISA.


DOL should return to the Trump Administration’s approach of
permitting only the consideration of pecuniary factors in ERISA.
However, this approach should not preclude the consideration of legitimate
non-ESG factors, such as corporate governance, supply chain investment in
America, or family-supporting jobs.

DOL should consider taking enforcement and/or regulatory action to
subject investment in China to greater scrutiny under ERISA. Many
large retirement and pension plans remain invested in China despite its
lack of compliance with U.S. accounting standards and state control over all
aspects of private capital.

Alternative View. Some conservatives believe that ERISA plan investments
should be made solely on a pecuniary basis and the consideration of any non-pe-
cuniary factor, ESG or otherwise, should be prohibited. Additionally, other
conservatives believe that even though ESG investing is often not a sound finan-
cial strategy, it is not wrong for retirement plans to offer ESG investment options
so long as individuals explicitly acknowledge and choose to pursue investment
options that do not exclusively maximize pecuniary gains.

Thrift Savings Plan. The Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) is the retirement savings
benefit plan for most federal employees and many former employees. The TSP is
managed by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). At over
$800 billion in assets under management, the TSP is one of the largest retirement
plans in the world.


DOL should prohibit investing in ERISA plans on the basis of any
factors that are unrelated to investor risks and returns.

DOL should reverse efforts to politicize the TSP by removing “mutual
fund” windows that encourage ESG, and should clarify the fiduciary
duties of the TSP. Recent efforts by congressional Democrats and the
Biden Administration to politicize the TSP by offering selective “mutual
fund” windows that encourage ESG should be reversed by DOL, and the
fiduciary duties of the TSP should be clarified by the department to preclude
ESG investments absent individual stock selection by the participant.
The TSP is managed under contract by private-sector fund managers. Its
current managers are BlackRock and State Street Global Advisers. Both of
these managers have demonstrated a public commitment to use the funds
they manage to advance ESG.


The federal government should follow the lead of multiple state
governments in removing their pension funds from fund managers
such as BlackRock and State Street Global Advisers, and contract
with a competitive, private-sector manager that will comply with its
fiduciary duties.

DOL should also consider bringing enforcement actions against
BlackRock and State Street Global Advisers for their violations of
fiduciary duty while managing the TSP.

Congress should enact legislation authorizing the FRTIB to exercise
its independent business judgment in exercising the proxy votes for
its holdings of the TSP and provide clear proxy voting guidelines for
the FRTIB to follow. The current proxy adviser market is dominated by
two firms, Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis, which use
heavily weighted ESG criteria in directing the proxy votes of pension plans.
If feasible, the new legislation should also offer a streamlined process for
other proxy advisers to compete for the TSP’s business.

As the principal retirement savings plan of America’s servicemen and
women, part of the FRTIB’s fiduciary duties in managing the TSP is a duty
not to invest in governments that are enemies of the United States. Yet the
FRTIB has repeatedly approved the investment of TSP funds in Chinese
military companies and state-owned enterprises. Under the Trump
Administration, DOL ordered the FRTIB to cease investments in China.
However, under the Biden Administration, the TSP has made available a
wide range of investments in China.


DOL should exercise its oversight of the FRTIB to prohibit
investments in China.
Congress should enact legislation prohibiting investment of the
TSP in China.

PENSION REFORMS.

Public Pension Plan Disclosure. Residents of states that responsibly manage
their public pension plans (pension plans for State and local government employ-
ees) should not be responsible for bailing out states that do not do so. Money is
ultimately fungible, so federal aid to States can effectively be used to free up other
State funds for pension contributions. Although the federal government does not
impose funding rules on public pension plans, these plans should be required to
disclose the fair market value of plan assets and liabilities (using the Treasury
yield curve as the discount rate) on an annual basis. In the aggregate, these plans
were underfunded on a market basis by $6.501 trillion as of Fiscal Year (FY) 2021,
even though the plans reported underfunding of only $1.076 trillion using overly
optimistic assumptions.

l
Multiemployer Plans. At the request of multiemployer union pension plans,
the government has given such plans much more lenient rules and discretion over
funding than it has given to single-employer plans. Multiemployer plans have been
severely mismanaged, and the plans have abused the discretion and deference given
them by federal law and enforcement agencies to make promises that they cannot
keep. As a result, these plans are generally severely underfunded, with $757 billion
in aggregate underfunding, and a funding level of just 42 percent. The Biden Admin-
istration has provided a massive taxpayer bailout to some of these plans, but without
any needed reforms. Even worse, it gave out funds in excess of what the law allows.
l
Congress should reform multiemployer pensions to give participants
in these plans the same protections as those in single-employer plans.
Liabilities should be measured similarly to single-employer plans. Workers
should be able to earn benefits at any employer in the plan, but liabilities
should be divided amongst employers, instead of the current illusory
joint and several liability under which no one is ultimately responsible
for making up underfunding. Troubled plans should be prohibited from

making new pension promises. More timely and detailed reporting
should be imposed.
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Cor-
poration (PBGC) insures benefits for private sector pension plans, with separate
single-employer and multiemployer insurance programs.
l
The PBGC’s annual report must be submitted on time, and with
timely data that uses fair-market value principles to calculate the
PBGC’s finances. The PBGC has been submitting portions of statutorily
required annual reports many months late and using out-of-date data. And
PBGC's data on plans is almost five years old. These problematic practices
make it difficult for Congress to become aware of serious problems in the
insurance programs, which received a bailout of over $85 billion in the 2021
American Rescue Plan Act.
﻿
The PBGC should use existing statutory authority to protect workers,
retirees, employers, and taxpayers by closely monitoring and taking
appropriate remedial action with regard to badly run and underfunded
multiemployer union pension plans, including termination where
appropriate. The PBGC's refusal to use such authority helped cause its
multiemployer program deficit to go from less than $500 million in 2008 to
over $65 billion in 2017.
l
Congress should increase the variable rate premium on underfunding
and eliminate the per-participant cap in order to appropriately
take into account risk and limit the degree to which well-funded
pension plans must subsidize underfunded plans. Reforms should
proportionately reduce the fixed per-participant premium to ease the
burden on well-funded plans and also increase premiums on multiemployer
plans to match single-employer plans.
Improving Access to Employee Stock Ownership Plans. Employee Stock
Ownership Plans (ESOPs) are ERISA-covered employee retirement savings
plans that allow employees to receive compensation in the form of equity in their
employer business. These arrangements enable employees to formally partici-
pate as investors in how their employers’ businesses are run. And they also align
employer–employee incentives by giving employees a greater financial stake in the
success of their employers. With over half of small businesses owned by business
owners over the age of 55, ESOPs also create advantageous succession oppor-
tunities that support the continuity of local businesses and regional economic

development. Finally, ESOPs can enable greater investment returns for employees.
However, ESOPs have to date lacked clear rules under ERISA that recognize their
unique structure and benefits, and this opacity can serve as a barrier to employers
considering adopting ESOPs.
l
Provide clear regulations for ESOP valuation and fiduciary conduct.
DOL should make it easier for employers to offer ESOPs by providing clear
regulations for ESOP valuation and fiduciary conduct that encourages the
participation of employee beneficiaries in corporate governance, while
recognizing the importance of financial diversification for retirement security.
Alternative View. Conservatives believe that it is important for American fami-
lies to have control over their savings and to be able to hold diversified assets. While
ESOPs can be a beneficial part of a worker’s and family’s savings, some conserva-
tives believe that the government should not favor one form of investment over
another or make it harder for families to have a diversified investment portfolio.
