Mission/Overview

The Office of Environmental Management’s mission is to “complete the
safe cleanup of [the] environmental legacy resulting from decades of nuclear
— 394 —Department of Energy and Related Commissions
weapons development and government-sponsored nuclear energy research.”85 Its
cleanup program is the world’s largest, and EM reports that 92 (of 107) sites have
been completed.86
According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, “DOE is responsible
for the largest share of the federal government’s environmental liability—about 85
percent in fiscal year 2020.”87 Since 2011, EM has spent a cumulative total of $63.2
billion, and its liability has grown by $243 billion.88 It is currently projected that
cleanup will take another 70 years (FY 2022 to FY 2091).89 Projected “Low Range”
and “High Range” lifecycle costs total slightly less than $652.4 billion and slightly
more than $887.2 billion, respectively.90
Needed Reforms

New Policies

The next Administration should:

Accelerate the cleanup. This means that a comprehensive cost projection
and schedule reflecting the entire scope of the job should be developed and
appropriate reforms should be instituted. To save taxpayers a potential
$500 billion over the long run and reduce current risk, a 10-year program
to complete all sites by 2035 (except Hanford with a target date of 2060)
should be considered. Such a commitment will require increased funding
for EM during those accelerated periods. To the extent that funding from
the IIJA and IRA cannot be repealed, requests to divert those funds to EM’s
cleanup obligations should be considered.
Fully implement High-Level Waste determination. Fully adopting
the High-Level Waste (HLW) determination across the DOE complex,
particularly at Hanford, would allow LLW to be grouted rather than vitrified.

Some states (and contractors), see EM as a jobs program and have little interest
in accelerating the cleanup. EM needs to move to an expeditious program with
targets for cleanup of sites. The Hanford site in Washington State is a particular
challenge. The Tri-Party Agreement (TPA) among DOE, the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency, and Washington State’s Department of Ecology has hampered
attempts to accelerate and innovate the cleanup. A central challenge at Hanford
is the classification of radioactive waste. High-Level Waste (HLW) and Low-Level
Waste (LLW) classifications drive the remediation and disposal process. Under
President Trump, significant changes in waste classification from HLW to LLW
enabled significant progress on remediation. Implementation needs to continue
across the complex, particularly at Hanford.

Increase the use of commercial waste disposal. Using commercial
disposal would reduce capital costs (~ $2 billion) for new disposal sites to
accelerate cleanup and reduce local post-cleanup environmental liability at
multiple sites.

Revisit the Hanford cleanup’s regulatory framework. Hanford poses
significant political and legal challenges with the State of Washington, and
DOE will have to work with Congress to make progress in accelerating
cleanup at that site. DOE and EPA need to work more closely to coordinate
their responses to claims made under the TPA and work more aggressively
for changes, including congressional action if necessary, to achieve workable
cleanup goals.

Establish more direct leadership and accountability to the Deputy
Secretary consistent with Government Accountability Office
recommendations.91

Change Environmental Management’s culture to promote innovation
and completion.

Budget

Environmental Management received slightly less than $7.6 billion in FY 2021,
and its budget request for FY 2023 is approximately $8.06 billion.92 The additional
funding necessary to accelerate closure of the program will need to be considered
as part of a broader government-wide discussion about yearly appropriations.


## OFFICE OF CIVILIAN RADIOACTIVE WASTE MANAGEMENT (OCRWM) 

(CURRENTLY OFFICE OF SPENT FUEL AND WASTE DISPOSITION)

Mission/Overview

The Nuclear Waste Policy Act (NWPA) of 1982 conferred the responsibility
for commercial nuclear waste disposal on the federal government,93 and in 2002,
Congress designated a single repository located at Yucca Mountain in Nevada as
the national repository site. The act also established the Office of Civilian Radio-
active Waste Management (OCRWM).94 The Obama Administration shut down
OCRWM in 2010. The Office of Spent Fuel and Waste Disposition, which is headed
by a non-confirmed Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Office of Nuclear Energy, is
currently responsible for the management of nuclear waste, and interim disposal
is taking place on various sites. Providing a plan for the proper disposal of civilian
nuclear waste is essential to the promotion of nuclear power in the United States.
— 396 —Department of Energy and Related Commissions

Needed Reforms

Work with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as it reviews DOE’s
permit application for Yucca Mountain. According to both the scientific
community and global experience, deep geologic storage is critical to any
plan for the proper disposal of more than 75 years of defense waste and
80,000 tons of commercial spent nuclear fuel.95 Yucca Mountain remains a
viable option for waste management, and DOE should recommit to working
with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as it reviews DOE’s permit
application for a repository. Finishing the review does not mean that Yucca
Mountain will be completed and operational; it merely presents all the
information for the State of Nevada, Congress, the nuclear industry, and the
Administration to use as the basis for informed decisions.

Reform the licensing process. The reactor licensing process is inadequate.
Fixing nuclear waste management will require wholesale reform that
realigns responsibilities, resets incentives, and introduces market forces
without creating chaos within the current nuclear industry that has been
built around the current system.

New Policies

Restart Yucca Mountain licensing. DOE should restart the Yucca
Mountain licensing process. Any continuation of interim storage facilities
should be made part of an integrated waste management system that
includes geologic storage. Further, building on the consent-based siting
process already underway, DOE should find a second repository site.
Fix the policy and cost drivers that are preventing nuclear storage.
The federal government continues to hold $46 billion97 in the Nuclear
Waste Fund (NWF),98 funded by utilities and their ratepayers for permanent
disposal of nuclear waste. However, no such storage exists, and spent
nuclear fuel remains on site at most nuclear plants. Meanwhile, Congress
uses those funds to finance unrelated spending. Moreover, DOE’s

Produce concrete outcomes from consent-based siting. Beginning in
the Obama Administration and resurrected during the Biden Administration,
consent-based siting for a civilian waste nuclear repository has been a way
to delay any politically painful decisions about siting a permanent civilian
nuclear waste facility. In 2022, DOE announced $16 million to support local
communities in consent-based siting.96 The next Administration should
use the consent-based-siting process to identify and build temporary or
permanent sites for a civilian waste nuclear repository (or repositories).
violation of its contractual obligation to take the waste has resulted in the
payment of “approximately $10.1 billion in settlements and judgments to
contract holders.”99


Develop new NWF funding and accounting mechanisms that allow
licensed nuclear operators to guarantee resources for future nuclear
waste disposal while also maintaining control of those resources.
Reconstitute OCRWM. OCRWM, as already established by statute, should
be tasked with developing the next steps on Yucca Mountain and nuclear
waste management. These steps should include initiating market reforms,
including significant amendments to the NWPA, to allow additional
industry responsibility for managing waste, market pricing and competition
for waste services, and the opportunity for Nevadans to have more
partnership involvement with any nuclear facility at Yucca Mountain.
Reestablish, consistent with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act,
the position of Director of the Office of Civilian Radioactive
Waste Management.

Budget

Within the Office of Nuclear Energy budget, approximately $100 million is set
aside for fuel cycle and waste management activities.100 These funds should be
transferred to the newly established OCRWM, which should also be responsible
for managing the Nuclear Waste Fund and given access to the fund as necessary
to carry out its responsibilities.


## NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION (NNSA)

Mission/Overview

NNSA’s primary mission is to provide and maintain a modern, safe, and effective
nuclear deterrent for the United States. This includes the design and production of
nuclear warheads, their integration with delivery systems, and their safe storage
and decommissioning. NNSA’s responsibilities also include developing nuclear
reactors for the U.S. Navy and “work[ing] to prevent nuclear weapon proliferation
and reduce the threat of nuclear and radiological terrorism around the world.”101
NNSA was established by the NNSA Act, which also defines its authority.102

Needed Reforms

The United States, through the NNSA, needs to make the design, development,
and deployment of new nuclear warheads a top priority. Existing warheads were designed and built during the Cold War, and the U.S. lacks sufficient plutonium production capabilities.103 Because this process will take time, NNSA and the
NNSA Labs need to ensure that existing nuclear warheads are viable and provide
an appropriate strategic deterrent.

New Policies

The expansion of Chinese nuclear forces, the continued nuclear threat
from Russia, and active nuclear programs in North Korea, Iran, and elsewhere
require NNSA’s recommitment to the nuclear mission. A conservative Administration should:


Continue to develop new warheads for each branch of the triad (land,
sea, and air defenses). If possible, reverse the Biden Administration’s
decision to retire the B83 bomb (in order to maintain two aircraft-delivered
warheads) and its decision to cancel the submarine-launched cruise
missile (SLCM).104 Also undertake an evaluation of the need for nuclear
antisubmarine and air defense weapons in light of emerging threats.
Maintain two production sites for plutonium pits (a key element of
warhead production) at Los Alamos and Savannah River.105

Reject ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and
indicate a willingness to conduct nuclear tests in response to
adversary nuclear developments if necessary. This will require
that NNSA be directed to move to immediate test readiness to give the
Administration maximum flexibility in responding to adversary actions.
Review all new Navy, Department of Homeland Security, and
U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration
construction programs. The review should be conducted by the Director
of Naval Reactors (DNR) with an eye to the possible inclusion of advanced
affordable nuclear reactor technology and extension of DNR authority over
these agencies’ nuclear construction programs.

Review the non–national security portfolios at the Los Alamos,
Lawrence Livermore, and Sandia labs and identify divestments to
focus on nuclear deterrence. Los Alamos, Lawrence Livermore, and
Sandia provide unique capabilities for nuclear deterrence, and each
lab maintains extensive non–national security research programs and
commercial activities.

Review the operations of the Nuclear Weapons Council (NWC). The
statutorily established NWC is required to report to the President and
Congress but needs to refocus its efforts on providing comprehensive
oversight of DOE and DOD nuclear weapons policy and requirements.

Budget

Concurrent modernization of the nuclear triad and its warheads will be a major
challenge to the DOD and DOE budgets over the coming decade. DOE non-nuclear
programs should be the first source of additional resources for NNSA activities.
Divestment of non-nuclear activities from NNSA laboratories can address some
overhead and operational costs. NNSA received $19.7 billion in 2021, and its FY
2023 budget request was $21.4 billion.106 The next Administration should ensure
that funding is targeted to the accelerated development of new warheads.

Personnel

NNSA has tended to act as though it is not part of DOE and has resisted oversight
by the Secretary of Energy. The NNSA Act grants some autonomy to the NNSA, but
it also makes it clear that NNSA is under the authority of the Secretary. NNSA’s
leaders need to understand that ultimately, they report to the Secretary.
