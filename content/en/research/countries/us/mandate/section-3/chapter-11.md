### MISSION

Federal education policy should be limited and, ultimately, the federal Depart-
ment of Education should be eliminated. When power is exercised, it should
empower students and families, not government. In our pluralistic society, fami-
lies and students should be free to choose from a diverse set of school options and
learning environments that best fit their needs. Our postsecondary institutions
should also reflect such diversity, with room for not only “traditional” liberal arts
colleges and research universities but also faith-based institutions, career schools,
military academies, and lifelong learning programs.

Elementary and secondary education policy should follow the path outlined
by Milton Friedman in 1955, wherein education is publicly funded but education
decisions are made by families. Ultimately, every parent should have the option
to direct his or her child’s share of education funding through an education sav-
ings account (ESA), funded overwhelmingly by state and local taxpayers, which
would empower parents to choose a set of education options that meet their child's
unique needs.

States are eager to lead in K–12 education. For decades, they have acted inde-
pendently of the federal government to pioneer a variety of constructive reforms
and school choice programs. For example, in 2011, Arizona first piloted ESAs, which
provide families roughly 90 percent of what the state would have spent on that
child in public school to be used instead on education options such as private school
tuition, online courses, and tutoring. In 2022, Arizona expanded the program to
be available to all families.﻿

The future of education freedom and reform in the states is bright and will
shine brighter when regulations and red tape from Washington are eliminated.
Federal money is inevitably accompanied by rules and regulations that keep the
influx of funds from having much, if any, impact on student outcomes. It raises the
cost of education without raising student achievement. To the extent that federal
taxpayer dollars are used to fund education programs, those funds should be block-
granted to states without strings, eliminating the need for many federal and state
bureaucrats. Eventually, policymaking and funding should take place at the state
and local level, closest to the affected families.

Although student loans and grants should ultimately be restored to the private
sector (or, at the very least, the federal government should revisit its role as a guarantor,
rather than direct lender) federal postsecondary education investments should bolster
economic growth, and recipient institutions should nourish academic freedom and
embrace intellectual diversity. That has not, however, been the track record of federal
higher education policy or of the many institutions of higher education that are hostile
to free expression, open academic inquiry, and American exceptionalism. Federal post-
secondary policy should be more than massive, inefficient, and open-ended subsidies
to “traditional” colleges and universities. It should be rebalanced to focus far more on
bolstering the workforce skills of Americans who have no interest in pursuing a four-
year academic degree. It should reflect a fuller picture of learning after high school,
placing apprenticeship programs of all types and career and technical education on an
even playing field with degrees from colleges and universities. Rather than continuing
to buttress a higher education establishment captured by woke “diversicrats” and a
de facto monopoly enforced by the federal accreditation cartel, federal postsecondary
education policy should prepare students for jobs in the dynamic economy, nurture
institutional diversity, and expose schools to greater market forces.1


### OVERVIEW

For most of our history, the federal government played a minor role in education.
Then, over a 14-month period beginning in 1964, Congress planted the seeds for
what would become the U.S. Department of Education (ED or the department).
In July of that year, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, after Congress reached a consensus that the mistreatment of black
Americans was no longer tolerable and merited a federal response. In the case
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA)2 and the Higher
Education Act of 1965 (HEA),3 Congress sought to improve educational outcomes
for disadvantaged students by providing additional compensatory funding for
low-income children and lower-income college students.

Spending on ESEA and the HEA—part of Johnson’s “War on Poverty”—grew
exponentially in the years that followed. By Fiscal Year 2022, ESEA programs
received $27.7 billion in appropriations, in addition to $190 billion that came through the pandemic’s Elementary and Secondary Schools Emergency Relief
(ESSER) Funds,4 which relied on ESEA formulas. The same year, the department
spent more than $2 billion just to administer Title IV of the HEA, which authorizes
federal student loans and Pell grants. It provided $22.5 billion in Pell grants, and
it oversaw outlays of close to $100 billion in direct student loans.

Since 1965, Congress has continued to layer on dozens of new laws and programs as federal “solutions” to myriad education problems. In 1973, it passed the
Rehabilitation Act,5 and, in 1975, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA)6 to address educational neglect of students with disabilities. In 2002, it cre-
ated the Institute for Education Sciences to consolidate education data collection
and fund research. Congress has also enacted a series of Carl D. Perkins Career and
Technical Education Acts, including Perkins V in 2018.7

Congress could have, and once did, distribute management of federal education
programs outside of a single department. But for those interested in expanding
federal funding and influence in education, this unconsolidated approach was less
than ideal, because a single, captive agency would allow them to promote their
agenda more effectively across Administrations. Eventually, the National Educa-
tion Association made a deal and backed the right presidential candidate— Jimmy
Carter—who successfully lobbied for and delivered the Cabinet-level agency.

When it was established in 1979—becoming operational in 1980—the agency
was supposed to act as a “corralling” mechanism. Carter signed the Department
of Education Organization Act8 into law in 1979, believing in part that it would
reduce administrative costs and improve efficiency by housing most of the federal
education programs that had proliferated in the wake of Johnson’s War on Poverty
under one roof.

It has had the opposite effect. Instead, special interest groups like the National
Education Association (NEA), American Federation of Teachers (AFT), and the
higher education lobby have leveraged the agency to continuously expand federal
expenditures—a desirable funding stream from their vantage point because federal
budgets are not constrained like state and local budgets that must be balanced each
year. By FY 2022, the department’s discretionary and mandatory appropriation
topped $80 billion, not including student loan outlays. Each of its programs has
attendant federal strings and red tape.

One recent example is the Biden Administration’s requirement that state educa-
tion agencies and school districts submit “equity” plans as a condition of receiving
COVID recovery ESSER funds in the American Rescue Plan (ARP).9 This exercise
led to the hiring of numerous new government employees as the rules were pro-
mulgated, plans were created after collecting public feedback, and those plans
were eventually deemed satisfactory.

The next Administration will need a plan to redistribute the various congres-
sionally approved federal education programs across the government, eliminate
those that are ineffective or duplicative, and then eliminate the unproductive red
tape and rules by entrusting states and districts with flexible, formula-driven block
grants. This chapter details that plan.
As the next Administration executes its work, it should be guided by a few core
principles, including:


Advancing education freedom. Empowering families to choose among
a diverse set of education options is key to reform and improved outcomes,
and it can be achieved without establishing a new federal program. For
example, portability of existing federal education spending to fund families
directly or allowing federal tax credits to encourage voluntary contributions
to K–12 education savings accounts managed by charitable nonprofits, could
significantly advance education choice.

Providing education choice for “federal” children. Congress has a
special responsibility to children who are connected to military families,
who live in the District of Columbia, or who are members of sovereign tribes.
Responsibility for serving these students should be housed in agencies that
are already serving these families.

Restoring state and local control over education funding. As
Washington begins to downsize its intervention in education, existing
funding should be sent to states as grants over which they have full control,
enabling states to put federal funding toward any lawful education purpose
under state law.

Treating taxpayers like investors in federal student aid. Taxpayers
should expect their investments in higher education to generate economic
productivity. When the federal government lends money to individuals for a
postsecondary education, taxpayers should expect those borrowers to repay.
Protecting the federal student loan portfolio from predatory
politicians. The new Administration must end the practice of acting like
the federal student loan portfolio is a campaign fund to curry political
support and votes. The new Administration must end abuses in the loan
forgiveness programs. Borrowers should be expected to repay their loans.
Safeguarding civil rights. Enforcement of civil rights should be based on
a proper understanding of those laws, rejecting gender ideology and critical
race theory.


Stopping executive overreach. Congress should set policy—not
Presidents through pen-and-phone executive orders, and not agencies
through regulations and guidance. National emergency declarations should
expire absent express congressional authorization within 60 days after the
date of the declaration.

Bolstered by an ever-growing cabal of special interests that thrive off federal
largesse, the infrastructure that supports America’s costly federal intervention
in education from early childhood through graduate school has entrenched itself.
But, unlike the public sector bureaucracies, public employee unions, and the higher
education lobby, families and students do not need a Department of Education
to learn, grow, and improve their lives. It is critical that the next Administration
tackle this entrenched infrastructure.
