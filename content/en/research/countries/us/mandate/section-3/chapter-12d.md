### Mission/Overview

DOE is authorized by law to increase the conversion efficiency of all forms of fossil energy, reduce costs, improve environmental performance, and increase the energy security of the United States.33 In recent years, the Office of Fossil Energy (FE) has been transformed from its statutory role of improving fossil energy pro- duction to one that is focused primarily on reducing the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel extraction, transport, and combustion. This change is reflected in the office’s new name, the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM), effective as of July 2021, and FECM’s mission: “to minimize the environmental impacts of fossil fuels while working towards net-zero emissions.”34


### Needed Reforms

Eliminate carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) programs. Despite the recent expansion of the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) to $87 per ton, most carbon capture technology remains economically unviable, although private-sector innovations are on the horizon. CCUS programs should be left to the private sector to develop.35 If the office continues any CCUS research, that research should be focused more on innovative utilization.

Pursue the processing of critical minerals. Development of domestic
critical material sources is important for national security, as the vast majority of critical materials are mined or processed (or both) in Russia and China.36 The processing of critical materials from fossil fuel waste products
(primarily coal) has shown some potential and, in view of our vast domestic
reserves of coal and abundant waste from coal mining and combustion,
should be pursued.


### New Policies

Rename FECM (if it cannot be eliminated) under its original
designation as the Office of Fossil Energy and with its original
mission: increasing energy security and supply through fossil fuels.
Focus on energy security and supply. Absent elimination of FECM,
Congress should direct FECM appropriations toward increasing energy
security and supply. Congress has already directed these goals (including
the reduction of costs).37

Ensure that LNG export approvals are reviewed and processed in a
timely manner. In particular:

1. Ensure that LNG export applications are reviewed and approved
expeditiously.
2. Maintain the categorical exclusion from the National Environmental
Policy Act (NEPA)38 for LNG exports that was established by the Trump
Administration39 or (if it is revoked by the Biden Administration)
reinstate it.
3. Work with Congress to expand automatic approvals to include allies such
as NATO as well as nations that have free trade agreements with the U.S.
l
Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). The Biden Administration moved
responsibility for the SPR to CESER. Regardless of where the responsibility
lies, the new DESAS should ensure that the SPR is maintained for national
strategic purposes and not misused for political gain.

Eliminate FECM. The next Administration should work with Congress to
eliminate all of DOE’s applied energy programs, including those in FECM
(with the possible exception of those that are related to basic science for
new energy technology). Taxpayer dollars should not be used to subsidize
preferred businesses and energy resources, thereby distorting the market
and undermining energy reliability.


### Budget

The FY 2023 budget request for FECM was approximately $893.2 million.40
FECM’s requested appropriation can be compared to the more than $4.0 billion
requested for the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.41 The disparity
in funding demonstrates how DOE’s research activities and substantial portions
of its organizational structure are now focused entirely on the reduction of CO2
emissions rather than energy access or energy security.


## OFFICE OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RENEWABLE ENERGY (EERE)

### Mission/Overview

The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy traces its roots to the
Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975,42 but most of its programs today
are rooted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005.43 Under the Biden Administration,
EERE’s mission is “to accelerate the research, development, demonstration, and
deployment of technologies and solutions to equitably transition America to net-
zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions economy-wide by no later than 2050” and
“ensure [that] the clean energy economy benefits all Americans.”44 The office is
made up of three “pillars”: energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable
transportation.

Needed Reforms

End the focus on climate change and green subsidies. Under the Biden
Administration, EERE is a conduit for taxpayer dollars to fund progressive
policies, including decarbonization of the economy and renewable
resources. EERE has focused on reducing carbon dioxide emissions to
the exclusion of other statutorily defined requirements such as energy
security and cost. For example, EERE’s five programmatic priorities
during the Biden Administration are all focused on decarbonization of the
electricity sector, the industrial sector, transportation, buildings, and the
agricultural sector.45

Eliminate energy efficiency standards for appliances. Pursuant to
the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 as amended, the agency
is required to set and periodically tighten energy and/or water efficiency
standards for nearly all kinds of commercial and household appliances,
including air conditioners, furnaces, water heaters, stoves, clothes washers
and dryers, refrigerators, dishwashers, light bulbs, and showerheads.
Current law and regulations reduce consumer choice, drive up costs for
consumer appliances, and emphasize energy efficiency to the exclusion of
other important factors such as cycle time and reparability.


### New Policies

Reduce EERE funding. If EERE cannot be eliminated, then the
Administration should engage with Congress and the House and Senate
Appropriations Committees on EERE’s budget. EERE’s budget was
around $1.5 billion a year when the advances were made that led to
dramatic cost decreases in wind, solar, and battery technology. In recent
years, Congress has appropriated many billions of dollars in excess of
EERE’s normal budget (DOE requested more than $4.0 billion for FY
2023).46 It should rescind these excess monies so that DOE is not required
to spend them. If funding cannot be reduced, then it should be reallocated
to more fundamental research and less toward commercialization
and deployment.

Focus on fundamental science and research. If EERE cannot be
eliminated, then the Administration should focus on broader and
more fundamental energy research, consistent with law. The Biden
Administration is too focused on deploying technologies instead of
relying on the private sector. Moreover, under the Biden Administration,
EERE is too focused on decarbonization and not at all on the
cost of energy.

Eliminate energy efficiency standards for appliances. The next
Administration should work with Congress to modify or repeal the law
mandating energy efficiency standards. Before (or in lieu of ) repealing the
law, there are steps the agency can take to refocus on the consumer by giving
full force to the provisions already in the law that serve to limit regulatory
overreach and protect against excessively stringent standards. For example,
the Trump DOE prioritized the relatively few appliance regulations that
were likely to save consumers the most energy and refrained from those
whose modest benefits are unlikely to justify the costs. It also took steps
to ensure that any new standards do not compromise product quality or
eliminate any features. These and other consumer protections are in the
statute but have often been ignored.


Eliminate EERE. The next Administration should work with Congress to
eliminate all of DOE’s applied energy programs, including those in EERE
(with the possible exception of those that are related to basic science for
new energy technology). Taxpayer dollars should not be used to subsidize
preferred businesses and energy resources, thereby distorting the market
and undermining energy reliability.

Budget

EERE was funded at slightly more than $2.8 billion in FY 2021, and DOE
requested slightly more than $4.0 billion for FY 2023.47 Congress needs to rescind
the appropriated monies that EERE has not spent and begin fresh with new
appropriations.


## GRID DEPLOYMENT OFFICE (GDO)


### Mission/Overview

The Grid Deployment Office was established to implement parts of the Infra-
structure Investment and Jobs Act. Pursuant to the IIJA, GDO administers funds
appropriated by Congress to support transmission expansion and low/zero carbon
resources. In addition, GDO is developing studies of the electric grid to address
congestion, enhance reliability and resilience, and promote “clean” energy.48

Needed Reforms

End grid planning and focus instead on reliability. FERC and NERC
have the primary responsibility for addressing reliability, states have the
primary authority to site and permit transmission lines, and regional
transmission organizations assist in planning regional transmission needs
for parts of the country, but Congress granted some grid planning and siting
authority to FERC and DOE through the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and
IIJA, as well as grid funding through the Inflation Reduction Act. 

Instead
of focusing on grid expansion for the benefit of renewable resources or
supporting low/carbon generation, GDO should be incorporated into the
reformed Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response,
which would work to enhance the grid’s reliability and resilience. To the
extent that they remain in effect, the funding programs that GDO oversees
and administers should emphasize grid reliability, not renewables expansion.
Consider whether to defund the civil nuclear tax credit program and
hydroelectric power efficiency and production incentives established
in the IIJA and administered through GDO. If subsidies for renewable
resources are not repealed, it may be necessary to continue subsidies for
nuclear and hydro to ensure grid reliability.

New Policies

Eliminate GDO and assign necessary activities to the reformed
CESER. It appears that GDO’s current purpose is to promote the
integration of low/zero carbon resources onto the grid by supporting
subsidies for such resources and building new transmission facilities at
— 380 —Department of Energy and Related Commissions
a cost that poses a barrier to renewable generation expansion. However,
some of the grants that it administers under the IIJA appear to be properly
focused on enhancing the reliability and security of the electric grid. They
should be reassigned to the reformed and expanded CESER.

End DOE/GDO’s role in grid planning for the benefit of renewable
developers. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and IIJA, DOE is to
perform grid congestion studies and has authority to identify National
Interest Electric Transmission Corridors (NIETC). Under the Biden
Administration, GDO is working on a National Transmission Planning
Study and is administering $2.5 billion to support “nationally significant
transmission lines, increase resilience by connecting regions of the country,
and improve access to cheaper clean energy sources.”49

Defund most GDO programs. GDO oversees nearly $20 billion in new
appropriations created by the IIJA, including a grid modernization grant
program, the transmission facilitation program, and the civil nuclear
credit program, among others. Congress should rescind any money not
already spent.

Budget

Congress appropriated $10 million for GDO in FY 2021, and DOE has requested
$90.2 million for FY 2023.50
