### OVERVIEW

HHS consists of 11 operating divisions that have varying degrees of practical
independence from the Secretary of Health and Human Services and 15 staff
divisions that are directly under the Office of the Secretary. This chapter’s rec-
ommendations are limited to those divisions that most need reform and address,
wherever possible, five cross-cutting goals.

If the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) were a separate coun-
try, its approximately $1.6 trillion budget would rank as the world’s fifth-largest
national budget. For good or ill, HHS activities personally impact the lives of more
Americans than do those of any other federal agency. Under President Trump, HHS
was dedicated to serving “all Americans from conception to natural death, including
those individuals and families who face...economic and social well-being challenges.”1
Under President Biden, the mission has shifted to “promoting equity in everything
we do” for the sake of “populations sharing a particular characteristic” including race,
sexuality, gender identification, ethnicity, and a host of other categories.2
As a result of HHS’s having lost its way, U.S. life expectancy, instead of return-
ing to normal after the COVID-19 pandemic, continued to drop precipitously to
levels not seen since 1996 with white populations alone losing 7 percent of their
expected life span in just one year.3 Nothing less than America’s long-term survival
is at stake. Accordingly, HHS must return to serving the health and well-being of
all Americans at all stages of life instead of using social engineering that leaves us
sicker, poorer, and more divided.﻿

Goal #1: Protecting Life, Conscience, and Bodily Integrity. The Secretary
should pursue a robust agenda to protect the fundamental right to life, protect con-
science rights, and uphold bodily integrity rooted in biological realities, not ideology.
From the moment of conception, every human being possesses inherent dignity
and worth, and our humanity does not depend on our age, stage of development,
race, or abilities. The Secretary must ensure that all HHS programs and activities
are rooted in a deep respect for innocent human life from day one until natural
death: Abortion and euthanasia are not health care.

A robust respect for the sacred rights of conscience, both at HHS and among gov-
ernments and institutions funded by it, increases choices for patients and program
beneficiaries and furthers pluralism and tolerance. The Secretary must protect
Americans’ civil rights by ensuring that HHS programs and activities follow the
letter and spirit of religious freedom and conscience-protection laws.
Radical actors inside and outside government are promoting harmful identity
politics that replaces biological sex with subjective notions of “gender identity” and
bases a person’s worth on his or her race, sex, or other identities. This destructive
dogma, under the guise of “equity,” threatens American’s fundamental liberties as
well as the health and well-being of children and adults alike. The next Secretary
must ensure that HHS programs protect children’s minds and bodies and that
HHS programs respect parents’ basic right to direct the upbringing, education,
and care of their children.

Goal #2: Empowering Patient Choices and Provider Autonomy. Basic eco-
nomics holds that costs tend to decrease and quality and options tend to increase
when there is robust and free competition in the provision of goods and services.
Health care is no exception. Health care reform should be patient-centered and
market-based and should empower individuals to control their health care–related
dollars and decisions.

Of course, providers who deliver health care also need the freedom to address
the unique needs of their patients. States should be the primary regulators of the
medical profession, and the federal government should not restrict providers’ abil-
ity to discharge their responsibilities or limit their ability to innovate through
government pricing controls or irrational Medicare and Medicaid reimburse-
ment schemes.

Finally, America’s broken insurance system, run largely through confusing pro-
vider networks and third-party payers (employers), induces overconsumption of
health care, limits consumer shopping, and hides true costs from patients.
The federal government should focus reform on reducing burdens of regulatory
compliance, unleashing innovation in health care delivery, ceasing interference in
the daily lives of patients and providers, allowing alternative insurance coverage
options, and returning control of health care dollars to patients making decisions
with their providers about their health care treatments and services.

Goal #3: Promoting Stable and Flourishing Married Families.

Families comprised of a married mother, father, and their children are the foundation of
a well-ordered nation and healthy society. Unfortunately, family policies and
programs under President Biden’s HHS are fraught with agenda items focusing
on “LGBTQ+ equity,” subsidizing single-motherhood, disincentivizing work, and
penalizing marriage. These policies should be repealed and replaced by policies
that support the formation of stable, married, nuclear families.
Working fathers are essential to the well-being and development of their
children, but the United States is experiencing a crisis of fatherlessness that is
ruining our children’s futures. In the overwhelming number of cases, fathers
insulate children from physical and sexual abuse, financial difficulty or poverty,
incarceration, teen pregnancy, poor educational outcomes, high school failure,
and a host of behavioral and psychological problems. By contrast, homes with
non-related “boyfriends” present are among the most dangerous place for a child
to be. HHS should prioritize married father engagement in its messaging, health,
and welfare policies.

In the context of current and emerging reproductive technologies, HHS policies
should never place the desires of adults over the right of children to be raised by
the biological fathers and mothers who conceive them. In cases involving biolog-
ical parents who are found by a court to be unfit because of abuse or neglect, the
process of adoption should be speedy, certain, and supported generously by HHS.
Goal #4: Preparing for the Next Health Emergency. The COVID-19 pan-
demic demonstrated how catastrophic a micromanaging, misinformed, centralized,
and politicized federal government can be. Basic human rights, medical choice, and
the doctor–patient relationship were trampled without scientific justification and
for extended periods of time. Excess deaths, not due to COVID-19, skyrocketed
because of forced lockdowns, isolation, vaccine-related mass firings, and colossal
disruptions of the economy and daily rhythms of life.

The federal government’s public health apparatus has lost the public’s trust.
Before the next national public health emergency, this apparatus must be funda-
mentally restructured to ensure a transparent, scientifically grounded, and more
nimble, efficient, transparent, and targeted response that respects the unique
needs and input of patient populations and providers.

Every one of the overreaching policies during the pandemic—from lockdowns
and school closures to mask and vaccine mandates or passports—received its
supposed legal justification from the state of emergency declared (and renewed)
by the HHS Secretary. Tellingly, however, the threshold for what constitutes a
public health emergency—how many cases, hospitalizations, deaths, etc.—was
never defined. For the sake of democratic accountability, we must know with clarity
what will trigger the next emergency declaration and, just as important, what will
trigger its end.

Unaccountable bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci should never again have such
broad, unchecked power to issue health “guidelines” that will certainly be the basis
for federal and state mandates. Never again should public health bureaucrats be
allowed to hide information, ignore information, or mislead the public concerning
the efficacy or dangers associated with any recommended health interventions
because they believe it may lead to hesitancy on the part of the public. The only
way to restore public trust in HHS as an institution capable of acting responsibly
during a health emergency is through the best of disinfectants—light.
Goal #5: Instituting Greater Transparency, Accountability, and Oversight. The next Administration should guard against the regulatory capture of our public health agencies by pharmaceutical companies, insurers, hospital conglomerates, and related economic interests that these agencies are meant to regulate. 

We must erect robust firewalls to mitigate these obvious financial conflicts of interest.
All National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
and Food and Drug Administration regulators should be entirely free from pri-
vate biopharmaceutical funding. In this realm, “public–private partnerships” is a
euphemism for agency capture, a thin veneer for corporatism. Funding for agencies
and individual government researchers must come directly from the government
with robust congressional oversight.

We must shut and lock the revolving door between government and Big Pharma.
Regulators should have a long “cooling off period” on their contracts (15 years
would not be too long) that prevents them from working for companies they have
regulated. Similarly, pharmaceutical company executives should be restricted from
moving from industry into positions within regulatory agencies.
Finally, HHS should adopt metrics across the agency that can objectively deter-
mine the extent to which the agency’s policies and programs achieve desired health
and welfare outcomes (not agency outputs). What is not measured is not achieved.
