AUTHORS’ NOTE: The authors are grateful for the collaborative work of the individuals listed as contributors to
this chapter for the 2025 Presidential Transition Project. The authors alone assume responsibility for the content of
this chapter, and no views expressed herein should be attributed to any other individual.

Today, the federal government’s bureaucracy cannot even meet its own civil
service ideals. The merit criteria of ability, knowledge, and skills are no longer the
basis for recruitment, selection, or advancement, while pay and benefits for com-
parable work are substantially above those in the private sector. Retention is not
based primarily on performance, and for the most part, inadequate performance
is not appraised, corrected, or punished.

The authors have made many suggestions here that, if implemented, could
bring that bureaucracy more under control and enable it to work more efficiently
and responsibly, which is especially required for the half of civilian government
that administers its undeniable responsibilities for defense and foreign affairs.
While a better administered central bureaucracy is crucial for both those and
domestic responsibilities, the problem of properly running the government goes
beyond simple bureaucratic administration. The specific deficiencies of the fed-
eral bureaucracy—size, levels of organization, inefficiency, expense, and lack of
responsiveness to political leadership—are rooted in the progressive ideology that
unelected experts can and should be trusted to promote the general welfare in just
about every area of social life.

The Constitution, however, reserved a few enumerated powers to the federal
government while leaving the great majority of domestic activities to state, local,
and private governance. As James Madison explained: “The powers reserved to
the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of
affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal
order, improvement and prosperity of the state.”31 Modern progressive politics
has simply given the national government more to do than the complex separa-
tion-of-powers Constitution allows.

That progressive system has broken down in our time, and the only real solution
is for the national government to do less: to decentralize and privatize as much as
possible and then ensure that the remaining bureaucracy is managed effectively
along the lines of the enduring principles set out in detail here.
