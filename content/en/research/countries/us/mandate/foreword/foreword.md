44 years ago, the US and conservatism were in dire straits. Both had been betrayed by the Washington establishment and were uncertain whom to trust.

Both were internally splintered and strategically adrift. 

Worse still, we were besieged by existential adversaries, foreign and domestic. 

The late 1970s were by any measure a historic low point for America and the political coalition dedicated to preserving its unique legacy of human flourishing and freedom. 

Today, America and the conservative movement are enduring an era of division and danger akin to the late 1970s. 

Now, as then, our political class has been discredited by wholesale dishonesty and corruption. Look at America under the ruling and cultural elite today: Inflation is ravaging family budgets, drug overdose deaths
continue to escalate, and children suffer the toxic normalization of transgender-
ism with drag queens and pornography invading their school libraries. 

Overseas, a totalitarian Communist dictatorship in Beijing is engaged in a strategic, cultural, and economic Cold War against America’s interests, values, and people—all while globalist elites in Washington awaken only slowly to that growing threat. 

Moreover, low-income communities are drowning in addiction and government dependence. Contemporary elites have even repurposed the worst ingredients of 1970s “radical chic” to build the totalitarian cult known today as “The Great Awokening.” 

Now, as then, the Republican Party seems to have little understanding about what to do. Most alarming of all, the very moral foundations of our society are in peril. Yet students of history will note that, notwithstanding all those challenges, the late 1970s proved to be the moment when the political Right unified itself and the country and led the United States to historic political, economic, and global victories.

The Heritage Foundation is proud to have played a small but pivotal role in that
story. It was in early 1979—amid stagflation, gas lines, and the Red Army’s invasion of Afghanistan, the nadir of Jimmy Carter’s days of malaise—that Heritage launched the Mandate for Leadership project. We brought together hundreds of conservative scholars and academics across the conservative movement. Together,
this team created a 20-volume, 3,000-page governing handbook containing more
than 2,000 conservative policies to reform the federal government and rescue
the American people from Washington dysfunction. It was a promise from the
conservative movement to the country—confident, specific, and clear.
Mandate for Leadership was published in January 1981—the same month Ronald
Reagan was sworn into his presidency. 

By the end of that year, more than 60 percent
of its recommendations had become policy—and Reagan was on his way to ending
stagflation, reviving American confidence and prosperity, and winning the Cold War.
The bad news today is that our political establishment and cultural elite have
once again driven America toward decline. The good news is that we know the
way out even though the challenges today are not what they were in the 1970s.
Conservatives should be confident that we can rescue our kids, reclaim our culture,
revive our economy, and defeat the anti-American Left—at home and abroad. We
did it before and will do it again.
As Ronald Reagan put it:

Freedom is a fragile thing and it’s never more than one generation away from
extinction. It is not ours by way of inheritance; it must be fought for and
defended constantly by each generation[.]1

This is the duty history has put before us and the standard by which our gen-
eration of conservatives will be judged. And we should not want it any other way.
The legacy of Mandate for Leadership, and indeed of the entire Reagan Rev-
olution, is that if conservatives want to save the country, we need a bold and
courageous plan. This book is the first step in that plan.
