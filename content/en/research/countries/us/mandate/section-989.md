MONETARY RULE REFORM OPTIONS

While the above recommendations would reduce Federal Reserve manipulation
and subsidies, none would limit the inflationary and recessionary cycles caused by
the Federal Reserve. For that, major reform of the Federal Reserve’s core activity
of manipulating interest rates and money would be needed.
A core problem with government control of monetary policy is its exposure
to two unavoidable political pressures: pressure to print money to subsidize
— 735 —
﻿
A primary driver of higher costs during the past three years has been the
Federal Reserve’s purchases of mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Since
March 2020, the Federal Reserve has driven down mortgage interest rates
and fueled a rise in housing costs by purchasing $1.3 trillion of MBSs from
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. The $2.7 trillion now owned by
the Federal Reserve is nearly double the levels of March 2020. The flood of
capital from the Federal Reserve into MBSs increased the amount of capital
available for real estate purchases while lower interest rates on mortgage
borrowing—driven down in part by the Federal Reserve’s MBS purchases—
induced and enabled borrowers to take on even larger loans.21 The Federal
Reserve should be precluded from any future purchases of MBSs and should
wind down its holdings either by selling off the assets or by allowing them to
mature without replacement.﻿

government deficits and pressure to print money to boost the economy artificially
until the next election. Because both will always exist with self-interested politi-
cians, the only permanent remedy is to take the monetary steering wheel out of
the Federal Reserve’s hands and return it to the people.
This could be done by abolishing the federal role in money altogether, allowing
the use of commodity money, or embracing a strict monetary-policy rule to ward
off political meddling. Of course, neither free banking nor a allowing commodi-
ty-backed money is currently being discussed, so we have formulated a menu of
reforms. Each option involves trade-offs between how effectively it restrains the
Federal Reserve and how difficult each policy would be to implement, both polit-
ically for Congress and economically in terms of disruption to existing financial
institutions. We present these options in decreasing order of effectiveness against
inflation and boom-and-bust recessionary cycles.
Free Banking. In free banking, neither interest rates nor the supply of money
is controlled by the government. The Federal Reserve is effectively abolished, and
the Department of the Treasury largely limits itself to handling the government’s
money. Regions of the U.S. actually had a similar system, known as the “Suffolk
System,” from 1824 until the 1850s, and it minimized both inflation and economic
disruption while allowing lending to flourish.23
Under free banking, banks typically issue liabilities (for example, checking
accounts) denominated in dollars and backed by a valuable commodity. In the
19th century, this backing was commonly gold coins: Each dollar, for example, was
defined as about 1/20 of an ounce of gold, redeemable on demand at the issuing
bank. Today, we might expect most banks to back with gold, although some might
prefer to back their notes with another currency or even by equities or other assets
such as real estate. Competition would determine the right mix of assets in banks’
portfolios as backing for their liabilities.
As in the Suffolk System, competition keeps banks from overprinting or lending
irresponsibly. This is because any bank that issues more paper than it has assets
available would be subject to competitor banks’ presenting its notes for redemp-
tion. In the extreme, an overissuing bank could be liable to a bank run. Reckless
banks’ competitors have good incentives to police risk closely lest their own hold-
ings of competitor dollars become worthless.24
In this way, free banking leads to stable and sound currencies and strong finan-
cial systems because customers will avoid the riskier issuers, driving them out
of the market. As a result of this stability and lack of inflation inherent in fully
backed currencies, free banking could dramatically strengthen and increase both
the dominant role of America’s financial industry and the use of the U.S. dollar
as the global currency of choice.25 In fact, under free banking, the norm is for the
dollar’s purchasing power to rise gently over time, reflecting gains in economic
productivity. This “supply-side deflation” does not cause economic busts. In fact, by ensuring that cash earns a positive (inflation-adjusted) rate of return, it can pre-
vent households and businesses from holding inefficiently small money balances.
Further benefits of free banking include dramatic reduction of economic cycles,
an end to indirect financing of federal spending, removal of the “lender of last
resort” permanent bailout function of central banks, and promotion of currency
competition.26 This allows Americans many more ways to protect their savings.
Because free banking implies that financial services and banking would be gov-
erned by general business laws against, for example, fraud or misrepresentation,
crony regulatory burdens that hurt customers would be dramatically eased, and
innovation would be encouraged.

Potential downsides of free banking stem from its greatest benefit: It has mas-
sive political hurdles to clear. Economic theory predicts and economic history
confirms that free banking is both stable and productive, but it is radically different
from the system we have now. Transitioning to free banking would require polit-
ical authorities, including Congress and the President, to coordinate on multiple
reforms simultaneously. Getting any of them wrong could imbalance an otherwise
functional system. Ironically, it is the very strength of a true free banking system
that makes transitioning to one so difficult.

Commodity-Backed Money. For most of U.S. history, the dollar was defined in
terms of both gold and silver. The problem was that when the legal price differed
from the market price, the artificially undervalued currency would disappear from
circulation. There were times, for instance, when this mechanism put the U.S. on
a de facto silver standard. However, as a result, inflation was limited.
Given this track record, restoring a gold standard retains some appeal among
monetary reformers who do not wish to go so far as abolishing the Federal Reserve.
Both the 2012 and 2016 GOP platforms urged the establishment of a commis-
sion to consider the feasibility of a return to the gold standard,27 and in October
2022, Representative Alexander Mooney (R–WV) introduced a bill to restore the
gold standard.28

In economic effect, commodity-backing the dollar differs from free banking in
that the government (via the Fed) maintains both regulatory and bailout functions.
However, manipulation of money and credit is limited because new dollars are not
costless to the federal government: They must be backed by some hard asset like
gold. Compared to free banking, then, the benefits of commodity-backed money
are reduced, but transition disruptions are also smaller.
The process of commodity backing is very straightforward: Treasury could
set the price of a dollar at today’s market price of $2,000 per ounce of gold. This
means that each Federal Reserve note could be redeemed at the Federal Reserve
and exchanged for 1/2000 ounce of gold—about $80, for example, for a gold coin the
weight of a dime. Private bank liabilities would be redeemable upon their issuers.
Banks could send those traded-in dollars to the Treasury for gold to replenish their vaults. This creates a powerful self-policing mechanism: If the federal government creates dollars too quickly, more people will doubt the peg and turn in their
gold to banks, which then will turn in their gold and drain the government’s gold.
This forces governments to rein in spending and inflation lest their gold reserves
become depleted.
One concern raised against commodity backing is that there is not enough gold
in the federal government for all the dollars in existence. This is solved by making
sure that the initial peg on gold is correct. Also, in reality, a very small number of
users trade for gold as long as they believe the government will stick to the price
peg. The mere fact that people could exchange dollars for gold is what acts as the
enforcer. After all, if one is confident that a dollar will still be worth 1/2000 ounce
of gold in a year, it is much easier to walk about with paper dollars and use credit
cards than it is to mail tiny $80 coins. People would redeem en masse only if they
feared the government would not be able control itself, for which the only solution
is for the government to control itself.
Beyond full backing, alternate paths to gold backing might involve gold-con-
vertible Treasury instruments29 or allowing a parallel gold standard to operate
temporarily alongside the current fiat dollar.30 These could ease adoption while
minimizing disruption, but they should be temporary so that we can quickly enjoy
the benefits of gold’s ability to police government spending. In addition, Congress
could simply allow individuals to use commodity-backed money without fully
replacing the current system.

Among downsides to a commodity standard, there is no guarantee that the gov-
ernment will stick to the price peg. Also, allowing a commodity standard to operate
along with a fiat dollar opens both up for a speculative attack. Another downside is
that even under a commodity standard, the Federal Reserve can still influence the
economy via interest rate or other interventions. Therefore, at best, a commodity
standard is not a full solution to returning to free banking. We have good reasons
to worry that central banks and the gold standard are fundamentally incompati-
ble—as the disastrous experience of the Western nations on their “managed gold
standards” between World War I and World War II showed.
K-Percent Rule. Under this rule, proposed by Milton Friedman in 1960,31 the
Federal Reserve would create money at a fixed rate—say 3 percent per year. By
offering the inflation benefits of gold without the potential disruption to the finan-
cial system, a K-Percent Rule could be a more politically viable alternative to gold.
The principal flaw is that unlike commodities, a K-Percent Rule is not fixed
by physical costs: It could change according to political pressures or random
economic fluctuations. Importantly, financial innovation could destabilize the
market’s demand for liquidity, as happened with changes in consumer credit pat-
terns in the 1970s. When this happens, a given K-Percent Rule that previously
delivered stability could become destabilizing. In addition, monetary policy when

Friedman proposed the K-Percent Rule was very different from monetary policy
today. Adopting a K-Percent Rule would require considering what transitions need
to take place.

Inflation-Targeting Rules. Inflation targeting is the current de facto Federal
Reserve rule.32 Under inflation targeting, the Federal Reserve chooses a target infla-
tion rate—essentially the highest it thinks the public will accept—and then tries
to engineer the money supply to achieve that goal. Chairman Jerome Powell and
others before him have used 2 percent as their target inflation rate, although some
are now floating 3 percent or 4 percent.33 The result can be boom-and-bust cycles
of inflation and recession driven by disruptive policy manipulations both because
the Federal Reserve is liable to political pressure and because making economic
predictions is very difficult if not impossible.
Inflation and Growth–Targeting Rules. Inflation and growth targeting is a
popular proposal for reforming the Federal Reserve. Two of the most prominent
versions of inflation and growth targeting are a Taylor Rule and Nominal GDP
(NGDP) Targeting. Both offer similar costs and benefits.
Economists generally believe that the economy’s long-term real growth trend
is determined by non-monetary factors. The Fed’s job is to minimize fluctuations
around that trend nominal growth rate. Speculative booms and destructive busts
caused by swings in total spending should be avoided. NGDP targeting stabilizes
total nominal spending directly. The Taylor Rule does so indirectly, operating
through the federal funds rate.

NGDP targeting keeps total nominal spending growth on a steady path. If the
demand for money (liquidity) rises, the Fed meets it by increasing the money
supply; if the demand for money falls, the Fed responds by reducing the money
supply. This minimizes the effects of demand shocks on the economy. For example,
if the long-run growth rate of the U.S. economy is 3 percent and the Fed has a 5 per-
cent NGDP growth target, it expands the money supply enough to boost nominal
income by 5 percent each year, which translates into 3 percent real growth and 2
percent inflation. How much money must be created each year depends on how
fast money demand is growing.

The Taylor Rule works similarly. It says the Fed should raise its policy rate
when inflation and real output growth are above trend and lower its policy rate
when inflation and real output growth are below trend. Whereas NGDP targeting
focuses directly on stable demand as an outcome, the Taylor Rule focuses on the
Fed’s more reliable policy levers.

The problem with both rules is the knowledge burden they place on central
bankers. These rules state that the Fed should neutralize demand shocks but
not respond to supply shocks, which means that it should “see through” demand
shocks by tolerating higher (or lower) inflation. In theory, this has much to recom-
mend it. In practice, it can be very difficult to distinguish between demand-side
destabilization and supply-side destabilization in real time. There also are political
considerations: Fed officials may not be willing to curb unjustified economic booms
and all too willing to suppress necessary economic restructuring following a bust.
Either rule likely outperforms a strict inflation target and greatly outperforms
the Fed’s current pseudo-inflation target. While NGDP targeting and the Taylor
Rule have much to commend them, they might be harder to explain and justify to
the public. Inflation targeting has an intelligibility advantage: Voters know what
it means to stabilize the dollar’s purchasing power. Capable elected officials must
persuade the public that the advantages of NGDP targeting and the Taylor Rule,
especially in terms of supporting labor markets, outweigh the disadvantages.


MINIMUM EFFECTIVE REFORMS

Because Washington operates on two-year election cycles, any monetary reform
must take account of disruption to financial markets and the economy at large.
Free banking and commodity-backed money offer economic benefits by limiting
government manipulation, inflation, and recessionary cycles while dramatically
reducing federal deficits, but given potential disruption to the financial system, a
K-Percent Rule may be a more feasible option. The other rules discussed (infla-
tion targeting, NGDP targeting, and the Taylor Rule) are more complicated but
also more flexible. While their economic benefits are significant, public opinion
expressed through the lawmaking process in the Constitution should ultimately
determine the monetary-institutional order in a free society.
The minimum of effective reforms includes the following:

Eliminate “full employment” from the Fed’s mandate, requiring it to
focus on price stability alone.
Have elected officials compel the Fed to specify its target range for
inflation and inform the public of a concrete intended growth path.
There should be no more “flexible average inflation targeting,” which
amounts to ex post justification for bad policy.
Focus any regulatory activities on maintaining bank capital
adequacy. Elected officials must clamp down on the Fed’s incorporation of
environmental, social, and governance factors into its mandate, including by
amending its financial stability mandate.
Curb the Fed’s excessive last-resort lending practices. These practices
are directly responsible for “too big to fail” and the institutionalization of
moral hazard in our financial system.

SMALL BUSINESS
ADMINISTRATION
Karen Kerrigan
MISSION STATEMENT

OVERVIEW

Created almost 70 years ago, the SBA was launched under the Small Business
Act with a mission to “aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the
interests of small business concerns.”1 According to its current mission statement:
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) helps Americans start, grow,
and build resilient businesses.
SBA was created in 1953 as an independent agency of the federal government
to aid, counsel, assist and protect the interests of small business concerns;
preserve free competitive enterprise; and maintain and strengthen the overall
economy of our nation.2
The SBA’s founding mission has evolved over time as programs have been
expanded or implemented, subject to the philosophical grounding of each Admin-
istration as well as assorted economic challenges and the occurrence of natural
disasters. Because of its distinct role in the federal government, the SBA became The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) supports U.S. entrepreneurship
and small business growth by strengthening free enterprise through policy advo-
cacy and facilitating programs that help entrepreneurs to launch and grow their
businesses and compete effectively in the global marketplace.

the default agency for providing disaster loans to small businesses, homeowners,
renters, and organizations. As a result, hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars have
been funneled through the agency to businesses and individuals over the years.
Some SBA programs are effective; others are not. The largest program in SBA’s
history, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), has been credited with saving
millions of jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic.3 A conservative Administration
would rightly focus on saving small businesses during such a crisis. At the same
time, however, various SBA programs have generated waste, fraud, and misman-
agement of taxpayer dollars.

For example, and more recently, more than $1 trillion in COVID-19 relief was
distributed through the SBA.4 The SBA’s EIDL (Economic Injury Disaster Loan)
Advance program in particular shows the dangers that can come with direct
government lending. EIDL Advance provided direct cash grants and loans to
small businesses. The SBA Office of Inspector General “identified $78.1 billion in
potentially fraudulent EIDL loans and grants paid to ineligible entities,”5 which
represented more than half of all funds spent through the program. Although PPP
worked through private lenders and as a result experienced relatively less fraud
than EIDL experienced, it is estimated “that at least 70,000 [PPP] loans were
potentially fraudulent.”6
