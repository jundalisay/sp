POLICY PRIORITIES

The FCC needs to change course and bring new urgency to achieving
four main goals:
Reining in Big Tech,
lPromoting national security,
lUnleashing economic prosperity, and
lEnsuring FCC accountability and good governance.15

Reining in Big Tech. The FCC has an important role to play in addressing
the threats to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant
positions in the market. Nowhere is that clearer than when it comes to Big Tech
and its attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.
Today, a handful of corporations can shape everything from the information
we consume to the places we shop. These corporate behemoths are not merely
exercising market power; they are abusing dominant positions. They are not simply
prevailing in the free market; they are taking advantage of a landscape that has
been skewed—in many cases by the government—to favor their business models
over those of their competitors. It is hard to imagine another industry in which a
greater gap exists between power and accountability. That is why a new Adminis-
tration should support FCC action on several fronts. Specifically, the FCC should:

Eliminate immunities that courts added to Section 230. The FCC
should issue an order that interprets Section 230 in a way that eliminates
the expansive, non-textual immunities that courts have read into the statute.

As one of the FCC’s previous General Counsels noted, the FCC has authority
to take this action because Section 230 is codified in the Communications
Act.16 The FCC’s Section 230 reforms should track the positions outlined
in a July 2020 Petition for Rulemaking filed at the FCC near the end of
the Trump Administration.17 Any new presidential Administration should
consider filing a similar or new petition.

As Justice Clarence Thomas has made clear, courts have construed Section
230 broadly to confer on some of the world’s largest companies a sweeping
immunity that is found nowhere in the text of the statute.18 They have done
so in a way that nullifies the limits Congress placed on the types of actions
that Internet companies can take while continuing to benefit from Section
230. One way to start correcting this error is for the FCC to remind courts
how the various portions of Section 230 operate.

At the outset, the FCC can clarify that Section 230(c)(1) does not apply
broadly to every decision that a platform makes. Rather, its protections
apply only when a platform does not remove information provided by
someone else. In contrast, the FCC should clarify that the more limited
Section 230(c)(2) protections apply to any covered platform’s decision
to restrict access to material provided by someone else. Combined, these
actions will appropriately limit the number of cases in which a platform
can censor with the benefit of Section 230’s protections. Such clarifications
might also include drawing out the traditional legal distinction between
distributor and publisher liability; Section 230 did not do away with the
former, nor does it collapse into the latter.

Impose transparency rules on Big Tech. Today, Big Tech offers a black
box. After Google manipulates search results, a small business can see its
web traffic drop precipitously overnight for no apparent reason, potentially
flipping its outlook from black to red. On Facebook, social media posts
are left up or taken down, accounts suspended or permanently banned,
without any apparent consistency. Out of the blue, YouTube can demonetize
individuals who have risked their capital and invested their labor to build
online businesses.

At present, the FCC requires broadband providers to comply with a
transparency rule that can provide a good baseline for Big Tech. Under the
FCC’s rule, broadband providers must provide detailed disclosures about
practices that would shape Internet traffic—from blocking to prioritizing or
discriminating against content. The FCC could take a similar approach to Big Tech, and it should look to Section 230 and the Consolidated Reporting
Act as potential sources of authority.19 In acting, the FCC could require these
platforms to provide greater specificity regarding their terms of service, and it
could hold them accountable by prohibiting actions that are inconsistent with
those plain and particular terms. Within this framework, Big Tech should be
required to offer a transparent appeals process that allows for the challenging
of pretextual takedowns or other actions that violate clear rules of the road.

Support legislation that scraps Section 230’s current approach. The
FCC should work with Congress on more fundamental Section 230 reforms
that go beyond interpreting its current terms. Congress should do so by
ensuring that Internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor
protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections. As
part of those reforms, the FCC should work with Congress to ensure that
antidiscrimination provisions are applied to Big Tech—including “back-end”
companies that provide hosting services and DDoS protection. Reforms
that prohibit discrimination against core political viewpoints are one way to
do this and would track the approach taken in a social media law passed in
Texas, which was upheld on appeal in late 2022 by the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit.20

In all of this, Congress can make certain points clear. It could focus
legislation on dominant, general-use platforms rather than specialized
ones. This could include excluding comment sections in online publications,
specialized message boards, or communities within larger platforms that
self-moderate. Similarly, Congress could legislate in a way that does not
require any platform to host illegal content; child pornography; terrorist
speech; and indecent, profane, or similar categories of speech that Congress
has previously carved out.
l
Support efforts to empower consumers. The FCC and Congress should
work together to formulate rules that empower consumers. Section 230
itself codifies “user control” as an express policy goal and encourages
Internet platforms to provide tools that will “empower” users to engage
in their own content moderation. As Congress takes up reforms, it should
therefore be mindful of how we can return to Internet users the power to
control their online experiences. One idea is to empower consumers to
choose their own content filters and fact checkers, if any. The FCC should
also work with Congress to ensure stronger protections against young
children accessing social media sites despite age restrictions that generally
prohibit their use of these sites.


It should be noted at this point that the views expressed here are not shared
uniformly by all conservatives. There are some, including contributors to
this chapter, who do not think that the FCC or Congress should act in a way
that regulates the content-moderation decisions of private platforms. One
of the main arguments that this group offers is that doing so would intrude—
unlawfully in their view—on the First Amendment rights of corporations to
exclude content from their private platforms.

Require that Big Tech begin to contribute a fair share. Big Tech
has avoided accountability in several additional ways as well. One of
them concerns the FCC’s roughly $9 billion Universal Service Fund.
This initiative provides the support necessary to subsidize the agency’s
affordable Internet and rural connectivity programs. The FCC obtains this
funding through a line-item charge that carriers add to consumers’ monthly
bills for traditional telecommunications service.

While Big Tech derives tremendous value from the federal government’s
universal service investments—using those federally supported networks
to deliver their products and realize significant profits—these large
corporations have avoided paying a fair share into the program. On top of
that, the FCC’s current funding mechanism has been on an unsustainable
path.21 By requiring traditional telephone customers to contribute to a
fund that is being used increasingly to support broadband networks, the
FCC’s current approach is the regulatory equivalent of taxing horseshoes
to pay for highways. To put the FCC’s universal service program on a stable
footing, Congress should require Big Tech companies to start contributing
an appropriate amount.

Conservatives are not unanimous in agreeing that the FCC should expand
the USF contribution base. Instead, some argue that Congress should revisit
the program’s entire funding structure and determine whether to continue
subsidizing the provision of service. Future funding decisions, the argument
goes, should be made by Congress through the normal appropriation process
through which the USF program can compete for funding with other national
initiatives. These decisions should be made with an eye to right-sizing
the federal government’s existing broadband initiatives in light of both
technological advances and the recent influx of billions of dollars in new
appropriations that can be used to support efforts to end the digital divide.
Protecting America’s National Security. During the Trump Administra-
tion, the FCC ushered in a new and appropriately strong approach to the national security threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). During that time,
the FCC eliminated federal subsidies for telecommunications equipment from
Huawei and ZTE, thereby greatly reducing the chances of that equipment finding a
way into our nation’s communications networks. The FCC also stood up a program
to rip and replace insecure network gear to ensure that it did not remain a threat
lurking inside our systems. The FCC revoked or denied the licenses of carriers like
China Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom, which presented unacceptable
national security risks. There are, however, additional strong actions that the FCC
can and should take to address the CCP’s malign campaign. Specifically:
l
l
Expand the FCC’s Covered List. The FCC maintains a list of
communications equipment and services that pose an unacceptable risk to
the national security of the United States. It is known as the Covered List.23
Huawei is one of the companies on the Covered List, and its inclusion means
that the FCC will no longer review or approve new applications from Huawei.
Without FCC approval, new Huawei gear cannot be lawfully sold or used in
the U.S. However, the FCC must do a better job of ensuring that its Covered
List stays up to date and accounts for changes in corporate names and forms.
Therefore, a new Administration should create a more regular and timely
process for reviewing entities with ties to the CCP’s surveillance state.
End the unregulated end run. As noted above, China Telecom and similar
entities have been banned from operating in the U.S. in a manner that would
require an FCC license or authorization because of the national security
risks that those entities pose. However, many of these same entities are
still operating in the U.S. and offering services very similar to the ones that
they are prohibited from providing. China Telecom, for instance, continues
to provide services to data centers by offering the services on a private or
“unregulated” basis. A new Administration should work with the FCC to
close this loophole. One way to do so would be for the FCC to prohibit any
regulated carrier from interconnecting with an insecure provider.

Address TikTok’s threat to U.S. national security. As law enforcement
officials have made clear, TikTok poses a serious and unacceptable risk to
America’s national security.22 It also provides Beijing with an opportunity to
run a foreign influence campaign by determining the news and information
that the app feeds to millions of Americans. As of this writing, the Biden
Administration’s Treasury Department has not announced a final decision
concerning its long-pending review of TikTok. If that inaction persists, or if
the Administration allows TikTok to continue to operate in the U.S., a new
Administration should ban the application on national security grounds.

Publish a foreign adversary transparency list. As part of the FCC’s
ongoing work to secure our networks from entities that would do the
bidding of our foreign adversaries, the FCC should do more to shine the
light of transparency on the scope of the problem. To this end, the FCC
should compile and publish a list of all entities that hold FCC authorizations,
licenses, or other grants of authority with more than 10 percent ownership
by foreign adversarial governments, including the governments of China,
Russia, Iran, Syria, or North Korea. A bipartisan bill that would require
the FCC to publish this type of list has been introduced in the House of
Representatives by Representatives Elise Stefanik (R–NY), Ro Khanna (D–
CA), and Mike Gallagher (R–WI).24

Fully fund the federal “rip and replace” program. In 2019, Congress
established a $1.9 billion Secure and Trusted Communications Networks
Reimbursement Program (known colloquially as the “rip and replace”
program) to reimburse communications providers for the reasonable
expenses they would incur to remove, replace, and dispose of insecure
Huawei and ZTE gear. However, $1.9 billion is about $3 billion short of the
total amount of funding needed to complete the rip and replace process. A
new Administration should ensure that the program is fully funded and
should look first at repurposing and applying unused COVID-era emergency
funds for this purpose.

Launch a Clean Standards Initiative. During the Trump Administration,
the U.S. government launched a worldwide Clean Networks program.25
As a result of this initiative, many of the U.S. government’s allies started
the process of ending their relationships with Huawei. It is time for an
Administration to build and expand on this groundbreaking work by
taking a similar approach to the standard-setting process. Right now,
the CCP is seeking to extend its influence by exerting control over the
development of standards in a variety of areas, including technology and
telecommunications. It is vital that the United States meet this threat with a
comprehensive clean standards initiative.
Stop aiding the CCP’s authoritarian approach to artificial
intelligence. The CCP has set itself a goal of becoming the global leader in
artificial intelligence (AI) by 2030. Beijing is bent on using this technology
to exert authoritarian control domestically and export its authoritarian
governance model overseas. U.S. businesses are aiding Beijing in this effort—
often unwittingly—by feeding, training, and improving the AI datasets
of companies that are beholden to the CCP. One way that U.S. companies
— 852 —Federal Communications Commission
are doing this is by giving Beijing access to their high-powered cloud
computing services. Therefore, it is time for an Administration to put in
place a comprehensive plan that aims to stop U.S. entities from directly or
indirectly contributing to China’s malign AI goals.
Unleashing Economic Prosperity. The FCC needs to advance a pro-growth
agenda that gives every American a fair shot at next-generation connectivity.
This is vital for economic opportunity and prosperous communities. The current
Administration has appropriated a lot of money for broadband infrastructure proj-
ects, but it has failed to pair that spending with reforms that free more airwaves
for wireless connectivity or streamline the permitting processes for broadband
builds. That failure is holding back America’s hardworking telecommunications
crews and leaving Americans stuck waiting on the wrong side of the digital divide.
It is time for a return to the successful spectrum and infrastructure policies that
prevailed during the Trump Administration—policies that enabled the U.S. to lead
the world in 5G.
l
Facilitate coordination on spectrum issues. Wireless services now
play a central role in advancing America’s economic and national security
interests. Over the past few years, this dynamic has led to an increasing
number of headline-level disputes between the commercial wireless sector
and federal agencies. These disputes are often framed in zero-sum terms
as commercial wireless and federal agency stakeholders argue over the
appropriate types and amount of airwaves that the government should
allocate for various purposes. On the one hand, America’s global economic
leadership depends on its ability to free spectrum that will power the U.S.
commercial wireless industry. On the other hand, we must ensure that
America’s national security and other federal agencies have access to the
spectrum resources that they need to carry out their vital missions.
— 853 —
﻿
l
Refill America’s spectrum pipeline. From 2017 through 2020, the FCC
took unprecedented steps to free the airwaves needed to power 5G and
other next-generation wireless services. This work not only helped to secure
America’s wireless leadership and bolster competition, but also enabled the
private sector to create jobs and grow the economy. Recently, the FCC has
failed to match the pace and cadence of those spectrum actions. Therefore,
the FCC and a new Administration should work together to develop a
national spectrum strategy that both identifies the specific airwaves that
the FCC can free for commercial wireless services and sets an aggressive
timeline for agency action.
It is clear that the current process is not delivering optimal outcomes. In
December 2021 and January 2022, for instance, the lack of interagency
coordination and communication about mid-band 5G spectrum allocation
between the FCC and the Federal Aviation Authority led to significant
challenges for the U.S. aviation industry. Over the past two years, the FCC
has failed to move spectrum into the commercial marketplace at the same
pace and cadence that it did in the recent past. Creating better mechanisms
to improve communication and cooperation between different federal
agencies could enable a more effective and coordinated U.S. government
telecommunications strategy. The White House should work with Congress
to establish a spectrum coordination process that will work for both
commercial and federal users.
﻿
l
Modernize infrastructure rules. By 2016, the construction of new cell
sites—the building blocks for 5G—had essentially flatlined in America.
Because of outdated permitting rules, it cost too much and took too long to
build wireless infrastructure, so the FCC went to work. The agency updated
the environmental and historic preservation rules that needlessly drove up
the cost and slowed down the timeline for adding small cells. The FCC put in
place guardrails to address outlier fees and delays imposed at the state and
local levels on those same small-cell projects. It modernized the permitting
process in several additional ways as well.
Those FCC reforms delivered results. They allowed America’s private
sector to bring thousands of families across the digital divide and to keep
Americans connected during the pandemic. In fact, infrastructure builds
accelerated at a record pace after those reforms. In 2019, for instance, U.S.
providers built over 46,000 new cell sites—a sixty-fivefold increase over
2016 levels.
The FCC has not engaged in any similar infrastructure reforms in recent
years, and there is much more that needs to be done. For instance, the FCC’s
prior reforms focused on streamlining the rules for small wireless facilities.
The FCC should now explore similar action for the deployment of other
wired infrastructure by imposing limits on the fees that local and state
governments can charge for reviewing those wireline applications and time
restrictions on the government’s decision-making process.
The next Administration should also work to address the delays that
continue to persist when it comes to building Internet infrastructure on
federal lands. This is an area where the FCC itself has very little jurisdiction,
— 854 —Federal Communications Commission
so a new Administration should redouble efforts to require timely reviews
and final actions by agencies with jurisdiction over federal lands, including
the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service.
l
Advance America’s space leadership. One of the most significant
technological developments of the past few years has been the emergence
of a new generation of low-earth orbit satellites like StarLink and Kuiper.
This technology can beam a reliable, high-speed Internet signal to nearly
any part of the globe at a fraction of the cost of other technologies. This
has the potential to significantly accelerate efforts to end the digital divide
and disrupt the federal regulatory and subsidy regime that applies to
communications networks. The FCC should expedite its work to support
this new technology by acting more quickly in its review and approval of
applications to launch new satellites. Otherwise, the U.S. risks ceding space
leadership to entities based in countries with more friendly regulatory
environments.
l
End wasteful broadband spending policies. Many of the broadband
spending policies being pursued by the current Administration are
poised to waste taxpayer money while leaving rural communities and
unconnected Americans behind. At the same time, the dramatic recent
increases in funding through the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act mean that the federal government
has more than enough resources to meet its broadband connectivity
goals. Congress should therefore hold the agencies accountable so that
taxpayer money is used effectively to promote broadband connectivity
across the nation.
To that end, the next Administration should instruct the various
departments and agencies that are administering broadband infrastructure
funds to direct those resources to communities without adequate
Internet infrastructure instead of to places that already enjoy broadband
connectivity. Take, for example, the final rules that the Treasury
Department adopted in 2022 that govern the expenditure of $350 billion
in ARPA funds. Rather than directing those dollars to the rural and
other communities that have no Internet infrastructure, the current
— 855 —
﻿
Holding Government Accountable. Federal technology and telecommunica-
tions programs have been plagued by a troubling lack of accountability and good
governance. They would benefit from stronger oversight and a fresh look at elim-
inating outdated regulations that are doing more harm than good.
Administration gave the green light for recipients to spend those funds to
overbuild existing high-speed networks in communities that already have
multiple broadband providers. A new Administration should eliminate
government-funded overbuilding of existing networks.
l
Adopt a national coordinating strategy. Hundreds of billions of
infrastructure dollars have been appropriated by Congress or budgeted by
agencies over the past couple of years that can be used to end the digital
divide. Yet, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, “U.S.
broadband efforts are not guided by a national strategy”; instead, “[f ]ederal
broadband efforts are fragmented and overlapping, with more than 100
programs administered by 15 agencies,” risking overbuilding as well
as wasteful duplication.26 Many of these programs remain plagued by
inefficiency, further contributing to waste of limited taxpayer dollars.
﻿
Moreover, the federal government is failing to put appropriate guardrails
in place to govern the expenditure of billions in broadband funds. This
is the regulatory equivalent of turning the spigot on full blast and then
walking away from the hose. There is a worrisome lack of adequate
tracking, measurement, and accountability standards governing all of this
broadband spending. As a result, we are likely to see headline levels of waste,
fraud, and abuse.
A new Administration needs to bring fresh oversight to this spending and
put a national strategy in place to ensure that the federal government adopts
a coordinated approach to its various broadband initiatives. Similarly, the
next Administration should ask the FCC to launch a review of its existing
broadband programs, including the different components of the USF, with
the goal of avoiding duplication, improving efficiency of existing programs,
and saving taxpayer money.
l
Correct the FCC’s regulatory trajectory and encourage competition
to improve connectivity. The FCC is a New Deal–era agency. Its history
of regulation tends to reflect the view that the federal government should
impose heavy-handed regulation rather than relying on competition
and market forces to produce optimal outcomes. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt recommended that Congress create the FCC in February 1934
for the purposes of establishing “a single Government agency charged
with broad authority” over the field of communications.27 Congress
subsequently established the FCC through the Communications Act of 1934.
Congress has passed a number of additional statutes—some broad, some
— 856 —Federal Communications Commission
narrow—that pertain to the FCC’s authority, including most significantly
the Telecommunications Act of 1996,28 which opened up markets for greater
competition and largely deregulated industry segments.
Technological change in the connectivity sector is occurring rapidly. We
are now seeing an unprecedented level of convergence, innovation, and
competition in the market for connectivity. On the one hand, traditional
cable providers like Charter are now offering mobile wireless services to
consumers in direct competition with traditional wireless companies like
Verizon. On the other hand, a new generation of low-earth orbit satellite
services like StarLink and Amazon’s Project Kuiper stand to offer high-
speed home broadband in competition with legacy providers. Furthermore,
broadcasters are offering high-speed downloads directly to consumers over
spectrum that previously provided only TV service.
Ultimately, FCC reliance on competition and innovation is vital if the
agency is to deliver optimal outcomes for the American public. The
FCC should engage in a serious top-to-bottom review of its regulations
and take steps to rescind any that are overly cumbersome or outdated.
The Commission should focus its efforts on creating a market-friendly
regulatory environment that fosters innovation and competition from a
wide range of actors, including cable-based, broadband-based, and satellite-
based Internet providers.

﻿
These rapidly evolving market conditions counsel in favor of eliminating
many of the heavy-handed FCC regulations that were adopted in an era
when every technology operated in a silo. These include many of the FCC’s
media ownership rules, which can have the effect of restricting investment
and competition because those regulations assume a far more limited set of
competitors for advertising dollars than exist today, as well as its universal
service requirements.

ENDNOTES

Ibid. There are no limits on the President’s authority to designate a different Chairperson from among the
existing Commissioners. Further, though it is an open question, it is generally believed that the judiciary
would impose limits on the power of the President to remove a Commissioner during his or her five-year term.
The question is not settled because Congress did not include an express “for cause” or similar protection
against removal in the Communications Act itself. Scholars assume this is because Congress passed the
Communications Act in the years between the Supreme Court’s decision in Myers v. United States, 272 U.S.
52 (1926) and Humphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), when it was not entirely clear that
Congress could impose a limit on the President’s removal power. However, the Communications Act was
significantly amended in 1996, and Congress did not add “just cause” or other protections from removal
at that time. Considering the high-profile contemporary debates about the appointment and removal of
independent counsels under the Independent Counsel Act, one could reasonably assume that Congress was
aware of removal powers and protections for presidentially appointed and Senate-confirmed officials.

began operations in 1975 to enforce the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA)
passed by Congress in 1971 and amended in 1974.1 FECA governs the raising and
spending of funds in all federal campaigns for Congress and the presidency. The
FEC has no authority over the administration of federal elections, which is per-
formed by state governments.
While the FEC has exclusive civil enforcement authority over FECA,2 the
U.S. Justice Department has criminal enforcement authority, which is defined
as a knowing and willful violation of the law.3 Because the FEC is an independent
agency and not a division or office directly within the executive branch, the author-
ity of the President over the actions of the FEC is extremely limited.
As former FEC Commissioner Bradley Smith has said, the FEC’s “[r]egulation
of campaign finance deeply implicates First Amendment principles of free speech
and association.”4 The FEC regulates in one of the most sensitive areas of the Bill of
Rights: political speech and political activity by citizens, candidates, political par-
ties, and the voluntary membership organizations that represent Americans who
share common views on a huge range of important and vital public policy issues. 

because they stay in office until a new commissioner has been confirmed, many
commissioners continue to serve past their terms.5 Currently, the longest serv-
ing commissioner still at the FEC is Ellen Weintraub (D), whose regular term
expired in 2007.
Under FECA, no more than three commissioners may be from the same party.6
While that means that a commissioner could be an independent or a member of the
Libertarian or Green Parties, in practice, this has meant that the FEC has always
had three Democrat and three Republican commissioners.7
There is a long-held political tradition since the FEC’s founding that when a
commission slot held by a member of the opposition political party opens up, the
President consults with, and nominates, the chosen nominee of the opposition
party’s leader in the Senate. In exchange, the Senate party leader and his caucus
agree to approve the President’s nominee to fill an empty position for the Presi-
dent’s political party. It has also been customary to advance the two nominees of
the differing political parties at the same time; this bipartisan pairing has histori-
cally permitted easy confirmation of both parties’ selectees.
Thus, by convention, a Republican President will nominate a Republican and
a Democrat for two open commission slots, including the choice of the Democrat
Senate leader for his party’s seat. In turn, the senator will direct his party to vote
to confirm both nominees. In the almost 50-year history of the FEC, this tradition
has only been broken once—when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid refused to
approve one of George W. Bush’s nominees (Hans von Spakovsky) for a Republican
commission slot.8
In 2025, when a new President assumes office, the term of five of the current
FEC commissioners will have either expired or be about to expire:9
lShana M. Broussard (D)—April 30, 2023
lSean J. Cooksey (R)—April 30, 2021
lAllen Dickerson (R)—April 30, 2025
lJames Trainor, III (R)—April 30,2023
lEllen L. Weintraub (D)—April 30, 2007
During their terms, the three Republican commissioners have demonstrated
with their votes and their public statements that they believe the FEC should not
overregulate political activity and act beyond its statutory authority, construe
ambiguous and confusing provisions against candidates and the public instead of
the government, and infringe on protected First Amendment activity.

The President assuming office in 2025 must ensure, if the three
Republican commissioners do not wish to remain on the FEC past
their terms, that nominees for these positions share the views of
those commissioners.
Also, to the extent that the President has the ability to negotiate with
the Democratic Party leader in the Senate, he should try to temper
any choice of the opposition party to ensure that this individual does
not have extreme views on aggressive overenforcement that would
severely restrict political speech and protected party, campaign, and
associational activities.
U.S. Department of Justice/FEC-Related Activities. The President does
have control of the Department of Justice (DOJ). Thus, he has authority as Presi-
dent, primarily through his choice of attorney general and other political appointees,
to direct the prosecutorial functions of the DOJ regarding criminal enforcement of
FECA. Such investigations and prosecutions are carried out by the Public Integrity
Section of the Criminal Division, with the assistance, coordination, and help of the
Offices of U.S. Attorneys in whatever state an alleged violation occurs.
The President must ensure that the DOJ, just like the FEC, is
directed to only prosecute clear violations of FECA. The department
must not construe ambiguous provisions against the public instead of
the government or apply FECA in a way that infringes on protected First
Amendment activity.
It should be but is not always obvious to overzealous government prosecutors
that if a federal law is confusing, it would be unjust to prosecute individuals who
are unable to determine if they are violating the law.
l
l
The President should direct the DOJ and the attorney general not to
prosecute individuals under an interpretation of the law with which
the FEC—the expert agency designated by Congress to enforce the
law civilly and issue regulations establishing the standards under
which the law is applied—does not agree.
In making prosecution decisions, DOJ should be instructed to consult
and consider all official actions by the FEC that interpret the law
including prior enforcement actions, regulatory pronouncements,
and advisory opinions, just as private practitioners, the public, and
political actors must do.
— 863 —
﻿
l﻿

It is fundamentally unfair for the DOJ to prosecute an individual for supposedly
violating the law when the FEC has previously determined that a similarly situ-
ated individual has not violated the law. Furthermore, this rule should apply even
when there is a tied or three-to-three vote by the FEC commissioners whether in
an enforcement action or an advisory opinion since under the statute, the FEC
cannot take any action unless there are four affirmative votes.
Again, it seems obvious that if the commissioners designated by Congress to
interpret the law are unable to determine what the law requires, then it is unfair
to prosecute a citizen for violating that law. The DOJ should not engage in crim-
inal prosecutions that stretch legal theories and defy FEC interpretations and
regulations.
Another issue directly related to what has often been a contentious relationship
between the FEC and the DOJ is the conduct of litigation. The vast majority of
federal agencies are defended by the DOJ, which also represents them when the
agency is pursuing litigation as a plaintiff.
The FEC, however, is one of the few federal agencies with independent litigating
authority.10 The FEC’s lawyers represent the agency in federal court up through the
federal courts of appeal. If a case reaches the U.S. Supreme Court, then the Office
of the Solicitor General of the Justice Department represents the FEC.
In recent years, the FEC has failed to defend itself against litigation filed by
political allies of certain Democrat commissioners. It takes four votes to authorize
the general counsel of the FEC to defend a lawsuit filed against the agency, and
those commissioners have refused to provide that fourth vote, so “the public was
treated to the scandalous spectacle of the Commission—an independent agency
of the United States government—defaulting in litigation before federal courts.”11
These cases involved enforcement matters in which the commissioners dis-
agreed on whether a violation of the law had occurred. Accordingly, the final
votes of the commissioners did not approve moving forward with enforcement
because there were not four affirmative votes that a violation of the law occurred.
When private plaintiffs then sued the FEC for failing to take action, Democrat
commissioners refused to authorize the defense of the FEC in litigation as a
way of circumventing the prior final action of the FEC and the FECA four-vote
requirement to authorize an enforcement action. Such defaults in litigation are
unacceptable.
l
The President should direct the attorney general to defend the
FEC in all litigation when there is a failure of the commissioners to
authorize the general counsel of the agency to defend it. No legislation
would be needed to accomplish this; the DOJ has the general authority to
defend the government and its agencies in all litigation.
— 864 —Federal Election Commission
l
As a legislative matter and given this abuse, the President should
seriously consider recommending that Congress amend FECA to
remove the agency’s independent litigating authority and rely on the
Department of Justice to handle all litigation involving the FEC.
There are also multiple instances of existing statutory provisions of FECA and
the accompanying FEC regulations having been found unlawful or unconstitu-
tional by federal court decisions, yet those statutory provisions remain in the U.S.
Code and the implementing regulations remain in the Code of Federal Regula-
tions.12 In such instances, those regulated by the law, from candidates to the public,
have no way of knowing (without engaging in extensive legal research) whether
particular statutory provisions and regulations are still applicable to their actions
in the political arena.
l
l
The President should request that the commissioners on the FEC
prepare such guidance.
Legislative Changes. While a President’s ability to make any changes at an
independent agency like the FEC is limited,13 the President has the ability to make
legislative recommendations to Congress. One of the most obvious changes that
is needed is to end the current practice of allowing commissioners to remain as
serving commissioners long after their term has expired, defying the clear intent of
Congress in specifying that a commissioner can only serve a single term of six years.
l
l
The President should prioritize nominations to the FEC once
commissioners reach the end of their terms and should be assisted
by legislative language either eliminating or limiting overstays to
a reasonable period of time to permit the vetting, nomination, and
confirmation of successors.
The President should vigorously oppose all efforts, as proposed,
for example, in Section 6002 of the “For the People Act of 2021,”14
to change the structure of the FEC to reduce the number of
commissioners from six to five or another odd number. The current
requirement of four votes to authorize an enforcement action, provide

﻿
In the event that the FEC fails to act, the President should direct
the attorney general to prepare a guidance document from the
Department of Justice for the public that outlines all of the FECA
statutory provisions and FEC regulations that have been changed,
amended, or voided by specific court decisions.
an advisory opinion, or issue regulations, ensures that there is bipartisan
agreement before any action is taken and protects against the FEC being
used as a political weapon.
With only five commissioners, three members of the same political party could
control the enforcement process of the agency, raising the potential of a powerful
federal agency enforcing the law on a partisan basis against the members of the
opposition political party. Efforts to impose a “nonpartisan” or so-called “inde-
pendent” chair are impractical; the chair will inevitably be aligned with his or her
appointing party, at least as a matter of perception.
There are numerous other changes that should be considered in FECA and
the FEC’s regulations. The overly restrictive limits on the ability of party com-
mittees to coordinate with their candidates, for example, violates associational
rights and unjustifiably interferes with the very purpose of political parties: to
elect their candidates.
﻿
l
Raise contribution limits and index reporting requirements to
inflation. Contribution limits should generally be much higher, as they
hamstring candidates and parties while serving no practical anticorruption
purpose. And a wide range of reporting requirements have not been indexed
to inflation, clogging the public record and the FEC’s internal processes with
small-dollar information of little use to the public.
CONCLUSION
When taking any action related to the FEC, the President should keep in mind
that, as former FEC Chairman Bradley Smith says, the “greater problem at the
FEC has been overenforcement,” not underenforcement as some critics falsely
allege.15 As he correctly concludes, the FEC’s enforcement efforts “place a substan-
tial burden on small committees and campaigns, and are having a chilling effect
on some political speech...squeezing the life out of low level, volunteer politi-
cal activity.”16
Commissioners have a duty to enforce FECA in a fair, nonpartisan, objective
manner. But they must do so in a way that protects the First Amendment rights
of the public, political parties, and candidates to fully participate in the political
process. The President has the same duty to ensure that the Department of Justice
enforces the law in a similar manner.

FEDERAL TRADE
COMMISSION
Adam Candeub

MISSION/OVERVIEW

America’s antitrust laws are over a century old. In 1890, the U.S. Congress
enacted the Sherman Act,1 the first federal prohibition on trusts and restraints of
trade. The Clayton Act,2 adopted in 1914, builds upon the Sherman Act, outlawing
certain practices, such as price fixing, while bringing other business combinations,
such as mergers and acquisitions, under regulatory scrutiny.
The Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA),3 also adopted in 1914, gives the
federal government legal tools to combat anticompetitive, unfair, and deceptive
practices in the marketplace, empowering the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to
enforce provisions of the Sherman and Clayton Acts. The FTCA prohibits “unfair
methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting
commerce.” Sections 3, 7, and 8 of the Clayton Act empower the FTC to block
unlawful tying contracts, unlawful corporate mergers and acquisitions, and inter-
locking directorates. Under an amendment to the FTCA, the Robinson–Patman
Act,4 the FTC has authority to prohibit practices involving discriminatory pricing
and product promotion. While the FTC has enforcement or administrative respon-
sibilities under more than 70 laws, the FTCA and the Clayton Act are the focus of
its regulatory energy.
FTC actions, therefore, turn on the antitrust principles and market principles
it adopts. Modern approaches to antitrust stress that the objective of antitrust law
is to assure a competitive economy—which in economic terms maximizes both
allocative efficiency (optimal distribution of goods and services, taking into account
consumer’s preferences, so that prices tend toward marginal cost) and productive
﻿
efficiency (using the least amount of resources for optimal output)—and thereby
maximizes consumer welfare.5
Recently, however, many in the conservative movement have taken a broader
view of antitrust. They point out that the authors of our antitrust laws did not
intend this purely economic understanding of competitive markets—and the
normative assumptions that undergird it—to guide their legislation. First, these
principles were only imperfectly worked out at the time the antitrust laws were
passed. Second, contemporaneous statements concerning the Sherman and Clay-
ton Acts demonstrate Congress’s concern about the political and economic power
of the oil and railroad trusts of the first Gilded Age, and their influence on dem-
ocratic institutions and civil society. Antitrust law can combat dominant firms’
baleful effects on democratic institutions such as free speech, the marketplace
of ideas, shareholder control, and managerial accountability as well as collusive
behavior with government.
Republican Senator John Sherman explained to Congress in support of his
eponymous legislation:
If we will not endure a king as a political power, we should not endure a
king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries
of life. If we would not submit to an emperor, we should not submit to an
autocrat of trade, with power to prevent competition and to fix the price of
any commodity.6
Similarly, identifying the institutional threats that market concentration can
pose, the former Republican President and future Supreme Court Justice William
Howard Taft wrote at the time,
The federal antitrust law is one of the most important statutes ever passed
in this country. It was a step taken by Congress to meet what the public had
found to be a growing and intolerable evil in combinations between many
who had capital employed in a branch of trade, industry, or transportation, to
obtain control of it, regulate prices, and make unlimited profit.
Taft saw in this economic threat broader implications for American society
since “the building of great and powerful corporations which had, many of them,
intervened in politics and through use of corrupt machines and bosses threatened
us with a plutocracy.”7
Others in the conservative movement have maintained for numerous decades
that an economic justification is the only coherent approach to the antitrust laws.
Many view the first 90 years of U.S. antitrust policy as unprincipled in its approach,
often resulting in policies that, by trying to protect smaller competitors, ended up
— 870 —Federal Trade Commission
[T]here is one and only one social responsibility of business—to use its
resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long
as it stays in the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free
competition, without deception or fraud.10
For Friedman, market mechanisms, not political mechanisms, are the appropri-
ate way to determine the allocation of scarce resources to alternative uses. Business
managers appropriate shareholder wealth when they use corporate resources to
further their personal political beliefs, even when pursuing what they consider
a “socially responsible” or “moral” agenda. The business of American business is
business, not ideology.
More broadly, there is less and less debate around the growth of monopoly rents
throughout the U.S. economy. The current data strongly suggest that U.S. corpo-
rations are systematically earning far higher profits than they were 25 or 30 years
ago. Combined with other evidence that large corporations are accounting for an
increasing share of revenue and employment, it certainly appears that many large
U.S. corporations are earning substantial incumbency rents, and have been doing
so for at least 15 years, apart from during the depths of the Great Recession that
began in 2008.

raising prices for consumers. Judge Robert Bork in his influential book The Anti-
trust Paradox found economic justifications for previously denounced behavior
including small horizontal mergers, all vertical and conglomerate mergers, vertical
price maintenance and market division agreements, tying arrangements, exclusive
dealings and requirements contracts, “predatory” price cutting, and price “discrim-
ination.” Bork also defended corporate “bigness” if it came about through internal
growth or acceptable mergers. He also defended agreements between competitors
on prices, territories, refusals to deal, and other “suppressions of rivalry” that are
“ancillary” to some economic efficiency. The practical contribution of his work was
to put consumer welfare at the heart of competition law.8
Beyond antitrust injury, we are witnessing in today’s markets the use of eco-
nomic power—often market and perhaps even monopoly power—to undermine
democratic institutions and civil society. Practices such as Environmental, Social,
and Governance (ESG) requirements on publicly traded corporations and their
inclusion in business agreements, the so-called “de-banking” of industries and
individuals, and the interference of large internet firms with democratic political
discourse undermine liberal democracy, a truly open society, and, indeed, rule of
law. Without rule of law, markets themselves will wither.9
Critical of the “social responsibility” agenda, Milton Friedman in his provoc-
atively titled essay “The Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Its
Profits” states,


While the explanations for this shift are not clear, what is particularly disturbing
is the possibility that these rents are extracted at least in part through regulatory
capture—which can function as a bar to entrance for new competitors. In addition,
the sheer cost of compliance with regulation favors large firms, which can more
efficiently spread the cost of regulation over a larger revenue base and have the
resources to invest in sophisticated government relations. The FTC must consider,
therefore, the role of government itself in maintaining market concentration in
areas ranging from pharmaceuticals and healthcare to avionics, banking, and real
estate brokerage.

Beyond undermining small businesses and reducing their salubrious moral
effect on American civil society, concentration of economic power facilitates col-
lusion between government and private actors, undermining the rule of law. The
continued emergence of evidence documenting collusion—between the Big Tech
internet platforms and the Biden White House and administrative agencies—to
censor criticism, scientific fact, and uncomfortable political truths demonstrates
this unfortunate development.
But, there are some caveats. First, the FTC lacks the power to revisit developments
in antitrust laws, which have brought an invaluable rigor to the antitrust law—mat-
ters such as analyzing vertical integration, for example. Nor should it. Second, the
FTC’s recent rescinding of its 2015 Policy Statement was undoubtedly ill-consid-
ered.11 Of course, the consumer welfare standard must guide FTC action, but, in
appropriate situations and with strong evidence, this standard must be expanded
to include more factors than just price. Further, a similar standard of proof used to
establish that a practice challenged by the Commission causes harm to competition
must also apply in demonstrating the efficiencies that justify the practices.
President Harry Truman reportedly made the famous quip, “Give me a one-
handed economist. All my economists say ‘on the one hand...’, then ‘but on the
other.’” When it comes to some of the more vexing issues in antitrust regulation,
the conservative movement is in the same predicament. Many wish to preserve the
productivity and efficiency focus of an economic-based consumer welfare standard
approach to antitrust enforcements; others are more willing to look at the effects
of business concentration in certain industries on innovation, the institutional
resilience of our democracy, and children’s development. The following discussion
sets forth policy principles and initiatives on which there was agreement among
the contributors to this chapter, and notes and explains where there was dissent.
