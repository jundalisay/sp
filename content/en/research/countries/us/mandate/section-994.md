THE CASE FOR FREE TRADE

Kent Lassman

rade policy is about more than goods and services: It is a statement of Amer-
ican identity. Our trade policy choices reveal America’s values and where we
put our trust. Do we place our trust in Washington elites to revive a declining coun-
try, or do we trust in America’s tradition of entrepreneurs and everyday people
blazing new trails? Do we follow China by copying its strong-arm trade policies,
or do we lead China and the rest of the world by forging our own path? Our trade
policy decisions will tell you what we Americans really think of ourselves.




A CONSERVATIVE VISION FOR TRADE

The policy recommendations in this chapter reflect a belief in the strength of
America’s founding institutions, its economy, and its people. They are based on data
showing decades of American progress with all that this implies. They also reflect
a realistic understanding of the fact that trade policy has limited capabilities and
is vulnerable to mission creep and regulatory capture. Policymakers should be
modest about what they can accomplish through trade policy and need to exercise
constant vigilance against abuses. For example:

Trade can lower consumer prices for ordinary Americans and open new
markets for American businesses and their goods.
Trade can help American workers and businesses to specialize in what they
do best—which is how they outcompete the rest of the world in technology,
manufacturing, agriculture, and other areas.
In foreign policy, trade can help to preserve and strengthen alliances.
At the same time, sound trade policy requires humility. It is not a panacea for
every policy problem. Trade policy cannot favor one sector over another without
causing tradeoffs that outweigh the benefits.41 Neither free trade nor protectionism
will create jobs. Trade affects the types of jobs people have, but it has no long-run
effect on the number of jobs. Labor force size is tied to population size more than
anything else. The American people are smart and sophisticated enough to hear
these truths.

It is not just conservatives who overestimate the power of trade policy. Recent
progressive attempts to use trade policy to advance whole-of-government initia-
tives on climate, equity, and other issues will fail for the same reason that a hammer
cannot turn a screw: It is the wrong tool for the job. Conservatives should be sim-
ilarly skeptical of recent attempts on the Right to use progressive trade policy to
punish political opponents, remake manufacturing, or accomplish other objectives for which it is not suited. The next Administration needs to end the mission creep
that has all but taken over trade policy in recent years.
Trade policy works best when it sticks to trade and treats separate issues
separately. Trade agreements since the North American Free Trade Agreement
(NAFTA) have been increasingly burdened by trade-unrelated provisions involving
labor, environmental, intellectual property, and other regulations. Where these
were a side agreement to NAFTA in the 1990s, they were integrated into the main
text of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2019. The
Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) that the Biden Admin-
istration is currently pursuing consists entirely of trade-unrelated provisions:
Negotiations are steering clear of trade altogether.
Trade-unrelated provisions are routinely hijacked by progressives and rent-seek-
ers and dilute otherwise worthwhile trade agreements. They also create additional
points of contention that make agreements unnecessarily difficult to pass. A con-
servative trade policy should limit trade-unrelated provisions in trade agreements.
This does not mean that conservatives should ignore international negotiations
on labor, environment, intellectual property, and other non-trade issues. It means
they are more likely to succeed by treating each of them separately rather than
letting them die in committee with each providing an additional sticking point
for delaying the others.

A conservative trade policy must also take seriously the reality that in a democ-
racy, the other side holds power about half of the time, but progressives run most
agencies almost all of the time. A cardinal rule in public policy is not to give yourself
powers you wouldn’t want your opponents to have. That means building institu-
tion-level safeguards against mission creep to limit abuses.
Foreign policy considerations are not as separate from trade as are labor or
environmental standards. China deserves special consideration, as does the World
Trade Organization (WTO) along with its possible successors or alternatives. While
trade is not the star of American foreign policy, it does play a supporting role. It
should be used to strengthen alliances to help counter China, Russia, and other
threats while making economic and cultural inroads inside them. The next Amer-
ican President should use this aspect of trade to the nation’s advantage.
Drawing from America’s Roots. In 1776, nearly 90 percent of Americans were
farmers. For 10 people to eat, nine had to farm. That meant fewer people could
be factory workers, doctors, or teachers, or even live in cities, because they were
needed on the farm. Accordingly, life expectancy was around 40 years, and literacy
was 13 percent.42

Today, fewer than 1 percent of Americans work on farms, yet America is a net
exporter of food. People have infinite wants, so as rising productivity pushed some
people off of farms, there were countless other jobs they could do. In true American
fashion, many of these jobs were in brand new industries.﻿

This was possible because the same can-do cultural values that inspired the
American founding were accurately reflected in its new government. The U.S. Con-
stitution created what was then the world’s largest free trade area, and it did so on
purpose.43 The combination of the American self-improvement ethos and the large,
free internal market guaranteed by the Constitution yielded intensive growth on
a scale never before seen.

Many displaced farm laborers got jobs making the very farm equipment that
made intensive agricultural growth possible, from railroad networks to cotton gins.
Each fed the other. Agriculture and industry are not separate; they are as inter-
connected as everything else in the economy. None of this could have happened
had the government enacted policies to preserve full agricultural employment.
Understanding Value. Just as communication is impossible without agreed-
upon definitions of words, coherent policymaking is impossible without coherent
categories. Policies are not likely to succeed when they try to separate an intercon-
nected economy into arbitrary categories. The factory worker who builds a tractor
does as much to boost farm production as the farmers themselves, yet economic
planners put them in different categories. This problem is baked into industrial
policy, as progressive planners have learned again and again.

A conservative approach to economic policy should treat value as value, whether
it is created on a farm, in a factory, or in an office. A dollar of value created in
manufacturing is neither more nor less valuable than a dollar of value created in
agriculture or services.

Pursuing Access to Growing Markets. American history holds lessons for
today’s conservative trade policy. Some modern analysts see a correlation between
high tariffs and high growth and confuse it for causation,44 but 19th century Amer-
ica teaches a different lesson.

While the Constitution banned internal tariffs in the U.S., international tariffs
reached their highest levels in U.S. history during the 19th century, beginning with
the 1828 Tariff of Abominations.45 At their peak in 1830, the average tariff on duti-
able goods was 62 percent.46 Fortunately, however, the tariffs’ distorting effects
were outweighed by market growth elsewhere. The 19th century saw Western
expansion and a growing population (including millions of immigrants) working
for the American dream. America’s growing internal free trade zone allowed for
still more specialization and more trade across state borders.
America’s geographic expansion ended long ago, but population growth, the
U.S.-led rules-based international trading system, and the steady 75-year decline
in tariffs after World War II have made possible decades of continued prosperity.
Intensive growth requires specialization, and the larger the market, the more spe-
cialization is possible.

Fighting Pessimistic Bias. Farmers’ share of the population continued to
decline through this entire period, yet employment remained high, and the

economy continued to grow. Factories were not the only beneficiaries of agri-
culture’s productivity boom and the labor it freed; services also grew. In fact,
service-sector employment surpassed manufacturing employment around 1890—
far earlier than most people realize.47
Pessimistic bias is one of the most important cultural problems that conserva-
tive policymakers need to address. In trade, as in most other areas, few people ever
zoom out to see the big picture, which is one reason why so many people mistakenly
believe that U.S. manufacturing and the U.S. economy are in decline.
The data do not show American economic carnage. They show more than two
centuries of intensive growth, made possible by a growing internal market through-
out the 19th century and a growing international market in the post–World War
II era. The transition from farm to factory did not shrink the labor force or farm
output. Later, the transition from factories to services did not shrink the labor force, factory output, or farm output. Both transitions affected the types of jobs,
not the number of jobs.
Americans today can more easily afford everything from air conditioning to
flat-screen televisions and smartphones, and trade is one reason why. Bigger mar-
kets mean more specialization, more innovative ideas, more customers, and more
people from whom to buy.

America’s official unemployment rate went as low as 3.5 percent during 2022,
while real per capita gross domestic product (GDP) rose to an all-time record.
Clearly, people who wanted to work were able to find work that paid well even as
manufacturing jobs grew more slowly than service jobs.
IMPLEMENTING THE CONSERVATIVE VISION
Vision will be crucial for the next conservative Administration, but nuts-and-
bolts policies are also important. Making the conservative vision for trade a reality
will require several actions, some of which may prove to be more difficult to achieve
than others. Specifically:

Implement tariff relief to help counteract inflation by reducing prices
for affected goods as well as to strengthen supply chains and boost
manufacturing. End Section 232, 201, and 301 tariffs. Work with Congress
to pass legislation repealing those provisions so future Presidents
cannot abuse them.
Resist calls for more spending on trade adjustment assistance, which
is often hijacked for progressive ends. Technology and changing tastes
displace six times as many workers as does trade, yet those workers get no
such special treatment. Displaced workers should receive the same benefits
regardless of the reason.
Remove never-needed supply chain restrictions, which give families fewer
places to which they can turn. The recent shortage of baby formula, for
example, was caused largely by heavily protectionist regulations. Strength
and resilience come from openness.
Enact mutual recognition policies with allies. If a product is safe enough for
European or Japanese consumers, then it is safe enough for Americans as
well—and vice versa. This can reduce regulatory costs and open new markets.
Close the Export–Import Bank, which serves mainly to subsidize foreign
buyers’ purchases of goods from a handful of well-connected American
manufacturers.

Work with Congress to restore the President’s Trade Promotion Authority,
which would expedite the negotiation of trade agreements with the United
Kingdom, Switzerland, Taiwan, the European Union, and other allies, and
keep trade-unrelated provisions out of trade agreements.
Restore the World Trade Organization’s dispute resolution process to
full strength.
Create a successor to the WTO (assuming that it has been fatally wounded)
that is open only to liberal democracies. This would prevent authoritarian
countries like China from abusing the organization for their own ends.
Adopt a multi-pronged China strategy to convince the Chinese government
to reform its illiberal human rights and trade policies.
Rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), whose 11 members are
developing institutional trade norms in an important geopolitical region
without U.S. input or involvement.
Reorient the proposed Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity to
focus only on trade issues, which it currently ignores in favor of progressive
wish-list policies.

Strengthen diplomatic pressure (in concert with allies) against Beijing’s
abuses. Encourage cultural and intellectual engagement with the Chinese
people, remembering that blue jeans and rock ’n’ roll helped to win
the Cold War.

Tariff Relief. When people try something repeatedly and it still doesn’t work,
they should stop doing it—especially when the consequences turn out to be just
what conservative economists have long predicted they would be.49 With tariffs,
the proper reform is not only to get rid of the individual tariffs that have backfired,
but also to build institutional safeguards against future abuse.
We are five years into the biggest experiment with tariffs since the Great Depres-
sion, and the results are in: The new tariffs raise consumer prices for ordinary
Americans by about $1,200 per household every year50 and benefit only a small
number of special interests. Steel and aluminum tariffs, enacted on national
security grounds, angered allies. Beijing made not a single substantive reform in Repeal the Jones Act,48 a century-old “Buy American” maritime law that
has decimated the U.S. shipbuilding industry. response to four rounds of tariffs plus an attempted Phase One agreement. The
Biden Administration has left the tariffs in place and is expanding them to pursue
progressive policy goals.

The first order of business for a new Administration that is focused on American
workers and consumers is to repeal all tariffs enacted under Section 232 of the
Trade Expansion Act of 196251 and Sections 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974.52
The President can do this unilaterally, and Congress can do it through legislation.
The second order of business requires Congress to pass legislation repealing
Sections 232, 201, and 301. The U.S. Constitution places all taxing authority with
Congress53 and none with the President. Congress used those provisions of law
to delegate some of its taxing authority to the President because it was having
trouble passing “clean” tariff legislation in the 1960s and 1970s. Unless and until
this constitutional question about delegation is addressed, important reforms are
available to the next Congress and the next President.

Congress faced a problem of collective action in the 1960s and 1970s. As a whole,
Members generally wanted to lower tariffs, but few individual Members were will-
ing to remove tariffs that benefited special interests in their districts. Trade bills
were invariably watered down through amendments and logrolling. The thinking
was that the President, whose constituency is the entire nation, would be less prone
to special-interest pleading than Members of Congress would be, so Congress del-
egated some of its tariff-making authority to the President in 1962 and 1974 trade
legislation.


Delegating tariff-making might have worked in the short run, but in the long
run, it was both constitutionally dubious and ripe for abuse. That came to pass in
2018. The Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs, invoked in 2018 against Canada,
Europe, and other allies on national security grounds, raised car prices by an aver-
age of $250 per vehicle and gave America the world’s highest steel prices. They
also harmed the construction, canned food and beverage, and other metal-using industries.

While this may have benefited the steel industry itself, each steel job saved cost
an average of $650,000 per year that had been taken from elsewhere in the econo-
my.54 That is no way to strengthen American manufacturing. The New York Federal
Reserve estimated in 2019 that the Section 301 China tariffs cost the average house-
hold $831 per year,55 a figure that has likely increased with inflation.
The new tariffs have a clear record of failure—as conservative economists
almost unanimously warned would be the case. Job number one for the next
Administration is to return to sensible trade policies and eliminate the destruc-
tive Trump–Biden tariffs.

Strengthening American Manufacturing. The decline of American manu-
facturing is a common political trope in both parties, typically invoked before a call
for more government intervention. This narrative has several problems. 

One is that American manufacturing output is currently at an all-time high. The record was
not set during World War II and not during the 1950s boom. Output did not peak
when manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 or during the Reagan economic
revival in the 1980s. It is actually higher now than it has ever been.
American manufacturing is buoyant because each manufacturing worker’s pro-
ductivity is also at an all-time high. The key to prosperity is doing more with less.
The next President should ignore special interests and populist ideologues who
want government to do the opposite through industrial policy, trade protectionism,
and other failed progressive policies.
It takes surprisingly few people to achieve America’s record-high manufac-
turing output—currently about 13 million people out of a workforce of more than
160 million, compared to the 1979 peak of 19.5 million people out of a workforce
of 104 million.56 Productivity growth has freed the time and talents of millions of
people for other, additional uses.


The belief that manufacturing has to shrink for services to grow is the zero-
sum fallacy against which sensible economists often warn. It is anathema to the
optimism, hope, and confidence that are the natural birthright of conservatives.
Growing productivity enables more output of both manufacturing and services.
That is why America continues to have sustained booms and record-setting real
GDP despite the long-run decline in manufacturing employment.


Economists distinguish between two types of growth: extensive and intensive.
Extensive growth is the Soviet and Chinese model for manufacturing: If you have
more people use more resources, they will create more output. Extensive growth
is doing more with more; intensive growth is doing more with less. That is where
America’s superpower lies. The story of American manufacturing is one of intensive
growth dating back to our agricultural origins. Conservative leaders should draw
on this history to position America for continued success. With intensive growth,
it is not manufacturing or services; it is manufacturing and services.
Retaliatory Tariffs. Raising tariffs on another country almost always invites
retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. The latter tend to be directed at politically sen-
sitive American exports. Retaliatory tariffs by both China and American allies in
response to the 2018 steel tariffs were targeted primarily at American agriculture.
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, those tariffs cost farmers $27
billion with losses concentrated particularly in heartland states.57
Retaliatory tariffs also targeted U.S. industries that were not protected by tar-
iffs. Many imports become inputs into U.S. manufacturing. The motorcycle maker
Harley-Davidson was already facing higher production costs as domestic steel
producers raised their prices to accommodate the new steel tariff. A retaliatory
tariff on its motorcycles imposed by the European Union further raised its prices
and hurt its export business. Harm to such innocent bystanders was another unin-
tended (though foreseen) consequence.

Federal Reserve research shows that the tariffs have cost about 75,000 manufac-
turing jobs while creating only about 1,000 jobs in the steel industry—not including
the effects of the retaliatory tariffs described above.58 Higher steel prices added an
average of $250 to the price of new cars, and larger trucks—the vehicle of choice
in rural America—were hit even more dramatically.59

Trade is generally a win-win for both participants. Tariffs are a lose-lose-lose
game, with the tariff raiser losing affordable goods, the tariff target losing exports,
and the tariff raiser losing again from retaliatory tariffs. Tariffs also have an addi-
tional overlooked hidden cost: Companies redirect resources to dodge tariffs by
redesigning products, switching to more expensive suppliers, using lower-qual-
ity materials, and lobbying. This might be good for lawyers, but it is bad for the
economy. These resources could have been used instead to make a better product
more cheaply.

Conservatives warned against retaliation from the beginning: It was exactly
what happened after the 1930 Smoot–Hawley tariffs that worsened the Great
Depression.60

Undoing the Normalization of Protectionism. Inertia is one of the strongest
forces in politics. Radical new policies can become the new normal very quickly and
are extremely difficult to unwind if they backfire. This happened with the Trump
Administration’s progressive turn on protectionism. The Biden Administration
quickly undid the Trump Administration’s conservative regulatory reforms but
left its progressive, self-defeating trade policies in place—in many cases even
strengthening them.

Two presidential Administrations is a long time in politics, and the next conser-
vative Administration will have a tough time getting tariff relief past a bureaucracy
that dislikes change and special interests that will fight hard to preserve their
special privileges. But given the stakes for future American prosperity, it will
be worth it.

Dealing with Disruption. It is true that trade is disruptive. Though its long-
run effect on employment is approximately zero, in the short run it can cost jobs
and even depopulate towns.61 America’s resilience depends on its ability to adjust,
but successful and timely adaptation is generally spontaneous in nature—the work
of human action but not human design. Planned adjustment by governments has
a much poorer track record.

Context is also important to adjustment efforts. Technological change costs
approximately six times more jobs as does trade (though, again, only in the short
run).62 Any argument made against trade’s disruptive effects applies even more
strongly to technological change, yet no one seriously argues for reversing the
dramatic changes the Internet has wrought.
More than 11 million American jobs turn over through hirings, firings, retire-
ments, layoffs, and resignations every month,63 and nearly 85 percent of all
jobs turn over in the course of a year. Yet America has suffered only four bouts
of double-digit unemployment during the past century. Two of them, the Great
Depression and the comedown from the 1970s stagflation, were due to monetary
mismanagement, not trade.64 The third, the Great Recession, was due to a financial
crisis worsened by monetary mismanagement, not trade.65 The fourth was due to
COVID-19 lockdowns, not trade.66
Using trade restrictions to slow this churn is a mistake for two reasons: (1) trade
is at best a minor contributor to job churn compared to other factors like tech-
nology, changing consumer tastes, inflation, and business cycles, and (2) churn is
evidence of a healthy economy. Agricultural economies have low job churn and
low living standards.
When people see better opportunities, they should be allowed to pursue them.
To do otherwise slows economic growth, harms individual dignity, removes
humanity from our policies, and can contribute to societal ills like depression,
addiction, and isolation.
Trade adjustment could be made easier by regulatory reforms to remove its
attendant friction. These include:
lLess restrictive zoning and permit rules;
lOccupational licensing reform;
lAutomatic sunsets for new regulations; and

A presidentially appointed Regulatory Reduction Commission that would
examine the Code of Federal Regulations each year and send repeal
packages to Congress that include old, obsolete, redundant, and harmful
regulations.67
People who need help should be able to get it. Progressive trade policies
help only special interests while harming the very people they are supposedly
intended to help.
Trade Adjustment Assistance. Trade adjustment assistance is a popular
policy for aiding displaced workers. Though flawed, it is a bargaining tool that
can potentially help to get sound trade policy adopted. A conservative Adminis-
tration should approach trade adjustment assistance with caution and use it as a
last-resort political bargaining tool and not as a first-resort policy. Funding for job
training programs and the like will typically find its way to labor union slush funds,
left-leaning nonprofits, and other progressive causes that will not necessarily help
displaced workers.

A better approach to trade adjustment assistance, if it must be expanded, is
direct cash transfers. Not only would this prevent progressive hijacking of pro-
grams and their funding, but cash is the most flexible type of aid. It treats people as
adults and lets them make their own choices about their next steps. Major life deci-
sions should be made by individuals for themselves, not for them in Washington.
Trade adjustment assistance should treat workers who lose their jobs to inter-
national trade the same as workers who lose their jobs for any other reason are
treated. While that will not likely come to pass in the near future, steps in that
direction are possible. Technological change displaces six times as many workers
as trade displaces, yet workers displaced by technology get no special treatment.
Nor should they. Unemployment remains low because it grows alongside pop-
ulation, and real wages continue to rise over time. Trade-displaced workers
should be eligible for the same benefits for which anyone else is eligible, no more
and no less.

The Administration needs to attack the root of the problem. Temporary
fix-it bills are better than nothing, but they leave the rot in place. The
President needs to encourage bold liberalization.

Strength comes from openness. In the real world, markets fail. Factories will
get contaminated, and health inspectors will not always be as thorough as
they should be. The baby formula market is essentially a natural experiment
in self-sufficient industrial policy. When something went wrong, that single


Supply Chain Lessons from the Baby Formula Debacle. Protectionism
builds weaknesses into supply chains. This was demonstrated vividly by the baby
formula shortage, which may have peaked in 2022 but remains an ongoing concern.
Domestic baby formula producers benefit from a decades-old tariff that averages
17 percent, which is effectively high enough to shut imports out of the market. As
if tariffs were not enough, other requirements also help to keep competition out
of the market: ever-evolving labeling requirements and nutritional standards that
(conveniently for domestic manufacturers) are always just slightly different from
international standards. As a result, before the formula shortage in 2022, approx-
imately 98 percent of the country’s baby formula was produced domestically.
With foreign competition out of the way, other government policies helped to
concentrate almost the entire domestic formula industry into four firms. Roughly
40 percent of baby formula purchases are made by state-level food assistance pro-
grams, which typically do not let families choose their own formula brands. Instead
they must buy from a single producer, which guarantees producers large market
shares in states where they win contracts. This situation gives incumbent pro-
ducers a cozy existence but puts consumers at risk. Like all protectionist policies,
the benefits are concentrated in the hands of a few producers while the costs and
risks are widely distributed.

With so many eggs in so few baskets, whenever something goes wrong—which
is inevitable even when nobody is at fault—families find themselves scrambling.
That happened early in 2022 when contamination entered a Michigan facility that
makes about 40 percent of America’s baby formula. Trade protectionism all but
eliminated other options for many parents, who suddenly found empty shelves and
sky-high prices for an essential item that many of them were already struggling to
afford—while families in other countries were unaffected.
In response, Congress passed the Formula Act68 in the summer of 2022. The act
eased formula tariffs and loosened never-needed labeling requirements and other
import restrictions, but it was temporary. It expired at the end of 2022, leaving
families still vulnerable to the cascading consequences that ensue if one thing
goes wrong at only one plant.
The baby formula debacle has two lessons for the next Administration.
﻿
failure point crashed the whole system. It should not be that way, and the
next President can change it.

Part of the problem is that the supply chain analogy itself causes sloppy thinking.
In a chain, a link is connected only to the link ahead of it and the link behind it and
not to any other links. Real-world supply chains are more like networks in which
each point connects directly to countless others and is rarely more than six degrees
of separation from nearly anywhere on Earth. Because market failures happen
all the time, it is important to have as many connections as possible. Americans
need access to more ways to adapt and reroute around failure points, especially
for essential products like baby formula.

Trade protectionism makes us more vulnerable, but free trade makes our fam-
ilies and communities more resilient. Loosening restrictions similar to the ones
that stunt the baby formula market would make it easier to navigate future crises
while preventing the progressive and rent-seeking power grabs that come with
every crisis, whether it is as isolated as a baby formula shortage or as expansive
as a pandemic.

Mutual Recognition. A simple way to reduce friction in supply networks is
mutual recognition of other industrialized countries’ regulatory standards. This
can be done either in a larger trade agreement or independently. For baby for-
mula, this would mean allowing in brands that meet European Union standards
even if they do not meet Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling require-
ments. Infants’ nutritional needs do not change across borders. If a formula is
deemed healthy for European babies, then it is also healthy for American babies.
The reverse is equally true.

Mutual recognition could help to open new markets for American producers in
countless industries and give American consumers access to countless new prod-
ucts on more competitive terms. For example, U.S. regulations require washing
machine power cords to be at least six feet long, while the U.K. requires them to be
at least two meters.69 The difference (about six inches) affects neither safety nor
performance, but it does keep American-made washing machines out of an import-
ant foreign market. A mutual recognition policy would circumvent the problem.
Given the recent interest in increased antitrust enforcement, conservatives
should embrace policies like mutual recognition that have the double benefit of
increasing market competition while decreasing government’s regulatory footprint.
The U.S. should enact mutual recognition agreements for a wide variety goods
with the United Kingdom, European Union, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and
other governments with high standards comparable to our own. This would have
especially large benefits for pharmaceuticals, because America’s FDA drug approval
process is both slower and more expensive than those of other countries with-
out being any safer. Americans would gain access to more and lower-cost medical treatments, and American pharmaceutical companies could defray development costs and innovate faster by gaining access to more markets, all while cutting prices.
The Jones Act. 

The Jones Act (Merchant Marine Act of 1920)70 requires that
ships traveling between U.S. ports must be U.S.-built, U.S.-owned, and U.S.-crewed.
In practice, this is an “America last” policy that has decimated the American mari-
time industry.71 Because of Jones Act regulations, American-built ships cost three
to four times more to build than foreign-built ships cost. As a result, the entire
Jones Act fleet is down to just 92 ships, many of which are old and obsolete. In fact,
Jones Act–compliant shipping is so expensive that it is often cheaper for East Coast
ports to import oil from Vladimir Putin’s Russia than it is to send it up the coast
from Houston or New Orleans. The national security (to say nothing of energy
security) implications of reliance on Russia for oil and gas are obvious.
The Jones Act’s original national security justifications are just as dubious. The
act’s goal was to guarantee a sizable fleet of American ships that could be pressed
into war service if needed. Aircraft carriers and other post-1920 naval innovations
have made this argument obsolete. An $800 billion defense budget has plenty of
room to maintain a Navy to defend American security interests around the world.

The U.S. Navy would likely prefer not to use Jones Act ships anyway, because they
tend to be older and in poorer condition than its own ships or similar foreign-made
but domestically owned commercial ships that could also be pressed into service.
As with many other industries, U.S. shipbuilding could be the envy of the world if
it could operate in a free market, but the maritime lobby prefers a quiet, cozy exis-
tence on the dole even as it harms American consumers and national security. The
next conservative Administration should unleash American potential by unilater-
ally enacting Jones Act exemptions wherever allowed, as currently happens most
years during hurricane season, and working with Congress to repeal the Jones Act.
Trade and Inflation. The post-COVID inflation spike may be over long before
the next Administration takes office, but keeping it under control should remain
a high priority. Free traders should not oversell their case by saying that liberal-
ization would solve inflation. Inflation is predominantly a monetary phenomenon,
not a trade phenomenon, but tariff relief can help at the margin by immediately
lowering prices on tariffed goods and slightly boosting long-term growth.72 While
this would not affect the money supply, which is inflation’s key variable, even roll-
ing back the tariffs enacted since 2017 would likely have a positive effect on the
Consumer Price Index.

The easiest way to curb inflation (or to create it) is for the Federal Reserve to
work the monetary side of the equation, but the real output side has a similar effect
on prices. Lifting trade barriers is one way to boost output. It also has the added
benefit of requiring no additional spending. At the very least, this can make the
Federal Reserve’s job easier as the spending excesses of Congress and President
Biden continue unabated in the coming years.

It is important not to oversell trade’s inflation benefits as a cure-all, but at the
margin, it can help. The next Administration should keep this in mind as it tries
to cope with this politically volatile issue.

Trade and Foreign Policy. We have seen how trade liberalization would boost
the domestic economy and make American businesses more competitive, but
conservative trade policies also benefit America’s foreign policy interests. Policy-
makers should therefore:

Negotiate multilateral and bilateral trade agreements.
Reform the World Trade Organization or build a successor organization
with membership limited to liberal democracies.
Repeal the Jones Act to replace Russian energy imports with
domestic production.

Develop a multifaceted, long-term China policy that takes seriously
America’s biggest foreign policy threat and deals with it on several fronts.
National Security. The most persuasive arguments against a market-oriented
trade policy come from another national objective: national security. Protection-
ism and similar progressive policies tend to weaken American security, but trade
creates peace. The more countries trade, the less likely they are to fight one another
and the more robust their supply networks will be. Going to war with customers
is bad for business.

Without a strong economic interest in continued U.S. investment and exports,
for example, China’s behavior would likely become increasingly less predictable
and more dangerous. Anyone who thinks Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General
Secretary Xi Jinping and the government in Beijing are bad actors now—which they
are—should consider what would happen if the Chinese convinced liberal countries
like the United States to decouple from them, leaving them free to pursue whatever
policies they wish without the significant counterweight that America can provide.
That is one reason for Xi Jinping’s emphasis on centralization and self-suffi-
ciency. He does not like international pressure about his government’s human
rights violations and bad-faith trading policies, and decoupling from trading part-
ners like America is one way to avoid that pressure. A less constrained China would
be poorer but much more unstable and dangerous to its neighbors and to America
than it would be if it still had to engage regularly with the rest of the world.
Trade Promotion Authority. Trade agreements can take years to negotiate.
One way to accelerate the process is for Congress to grant the President Trade
Promotion Authority (TPA). It was first granted under the 1974 Trade Act, which contains the Sections 201 and 301 tariff delegations. TPA, then called fast-track, has aided several trade agreements, including NAFTA and the USMCA, which took
effect in 2020. TPA has lapsed before during slow periods in trade policy, most
recently in July 2021, and remains lapsed today.
The President should work with Congress to renew TPA to rationalize negoti-
ations for upcoming trade agreements with the United Kingdom, the European
Union, and others.

Both supporters and critics have questions regarding TPA’s implications for the
constitutional separation of powers, and policymakers should take those questions
seriously. As things currently stand, Congress has some oversight powers over the
President’s negotiations under TPA, but they are limited. Congress can increase
its oversight by passing new legislation superseding relevant provisions of the
1974 Trade Act. However, that is a double-edged sword. A Congress that largely
favors free trade could exercise oversight to keep the President on the straight and
narrow in trade negotiations. A progressive Congress would instead insist that the
President negotiate for as many trade-unrelated provisions as possible to benefit
labor and green constituencies while pushing progressive policies on the U.S. and
its trading partners.

On balance, a single voice at the negotiating table that is subject to congressional
oversight is the best posture for American workers and consumers. A fractious
Congress has yet to demonstrate the capacity to negotiate with other nations, but
it can help to hold the Administration accountable.
Trade Agreements with the United Kingdom, European Union, and
Others. Even with a renewed TPA, trade agreement negotiations will likely take
years. The Trump and Biden Administrations were not inclined to start the process,
so that job may well fall to the next Administration. In that sense, the delays may
end up being worth it.

If there is one lodestar to follow, it is to restrict these agreements to trade issues
only. Ever since NAFTA, trade-unrelated provisions have taken on a greater role
in trade agreements. These create sticking points and are routinely hijacked by
rent-seeking special interests and progressive ideologues who demand subsidies,
carve-outs, and economically distorting labor and environmental standards that
have nothing to do with trade. If governments are to negotiate these issues, they
should do so in separate agreements so they do not torpedo efforts to liberalize
and engage with allies. Trade agreements should lighten burdens, not create new
ones by attempting to address non-trade issues.
Policy leaders in the United States and the United Kingdom, including
experts from The Heritage Foundation and the Competitive Enterprise Insti-
tute, have prepared a model trade agreement along these lines.73 Along with TPA
renewal, this would greatly reduce negotiating costs. This template is also readily
adaptable for agreements with Europe and any other allies that are willing to﻿

liberalize their economies and build a stronger alliance with America. The draft
U.S.–U.K. agreement includes an accession chapter to allow others to join on
the same terms.

Restoring or Replacing the WTO Dispute Resolution Process. The World
Trade Organization as we know it may be mortally wounded. This deprives the U.S.
of the WTO’s dispute resolution process, under which the U.S. it won 85 percent of
the cases it brought. The WTO’s slow death began under the Obama Administra-
tion, which refused to allow appointees to the WTO’s appellate board, which as a
consequence is now nonfunctional. Both the Trump and Biden Administrations
have continued the Obama Administration’s approach.
That means that every case in the dispute resolution process will sputter to
a halt as parties file appeals that cannot be heard. If the WTO is no longer fit for
that purpose, it may be better to look in a different direction. More than 20 years
ago, a Heritage Foundation senior fellow proposed that America and other free
economies should form a Global Free Trade Alliance that is open to all countries
that adhere to a truly free market system with appropriate safeguards such as
property rights, lack of corruption, and enforcement of contracts.74 Alongside a
general agreement on low to zero tariffs, the alliance would move to reduce the
effect of nontariff barriers (such as the previously noted baby formula ingredient
and labeling barriers) by basing trade around the principle of mutual recognition.
Such an alliance could be started by a trade agreement between the United States
and, for example, the United Kingdom with an accession chapter allowing others
to join if they meet the criteria.

It would be essential for a Global Free Trade Alliance to avoid the WTO’s most
serious problem: the exemptions from its rules that are granted to developing
countries. When China joined the WTO in 2001, it was granted developing-na-
tion status, which it continues to use to dodge rules that should apply to it. Other
countries have used that status to delay needed reforms. Rule exemptions give
some countries a perverse incentive to remain poor and autocratic.
A Global Free Trade Alliance would allow the U.S. to enjoy the benefits of a rules-
based international trading system without the WTO’s shortcomings. Negotiation
costs would be lower because the countries would already be allied on many issues.
In addition, there would be no separate tiers with different rules, and this would
give developing countries an incentive to liberalize. In addition to being good for
its own sake, liberalization would give them entry into a prestigious club that tilted
toward America’s orbit and away from China’s.


Closing the Export–Import Bank. The Export–Import Bank (EXIM) is an
unusually clear example of how vulnerable trade protectionism is to being hijacked
by special interests.75 In most years, about half of EXIM’s business benefits a single
company, Boeing. Their relationship is so cozy that EXIM’s nickname around
Washington is “the Bank of Boeing.”
— 812 —Trade
lIt has a long record of deals with authoritarian governments.
lIt subsidizes direct foreign competitors of domestic businesses.

It has been hijacked by progressives to advance their climate and other
preferred policies.

Unlike most other agencies, EXIM has a charter that expires. Congress must
renew it periodically, or else the agency will permanently close. Its current charter
expires at the end of 2026. Closing this New Deal–era legacy agency would be a
conservative victory on a number of fronts. It is also a winnable battle: Congress
just needs to do nothing.
Conservatives have both foreign policy and economic reasons to oppose
EXIM. EXIM has a long history of providing financing for authoritarian govern-
ments in China, Russia, and the Middle East that often oppose U.S. foreign policy
interests, and its deals often oppose U.S. economic interests. EXIM financing
also harms domestic airlines. Many EXIM financing deals enable foreign state-
run airlines to buy Boeing jets at a discount. These foreign airlines, subsidized
by the U.S. government, then compete directly with U.S. airlines on interna-
tional routes.

More recently, the Biden Administration has expanded EXIM’s mission to
advance progressive policy goals, including limits on financing for projects that
involve fossil fuels or contribute to climate change, preferential treatment for
renewable energy projects, and quotas for projects that benefit women-owned and
minority-owned businesses. All of these could raise EXIM’s default rates, putting
taxpayer dollars at risk.

The strongest argument in EXIM’s favor is that it boosts U.S. exports by financ-
ing projects that would otherwise never receive financing. We now have evidence
that this argument is false: EXIM does not finance additional exports; instead, it
largely substitutes for other forms of export financing that would occur anyway.
EXIM’s authorization lapsed in 2014–2015 because of conservative opposition
to renewing its charter. During this lapse, EXIM maintained its existing portfo-
lio but was unable to take on new business. Boeing reported no trouble finding
alternative financing and even reported record profits during EXIM’s lapse while
working to fulfill a seven-year backlog of orders.76
EXIM boasts an extremely low default rate, but that is because of selection
bias. EXIM overwhelmingly takes on low-risk projects that private banks would
be happy to finance, although this admittedly could change somewhat with EXIM’s
Biden-era mandates to finance climate and other policy-focused projects.
EXIM is also a textbook example of regulatory capture.
﻿
l
Its beneficiaries have proven they can get adequate financing from
private banks.
EXIM’s charter expires at the end of 2026. The agency will close automatically
unless Congress and the President decide to extend it. Closing EXIM should be
one of the next Administration’s easiest decisions.


Adopting a Multi-Pronged China Strategy. An effective American policy
toward China needs to take a realistic view of the country, its leaders, their
strengths, and the serious challenges they face. It should be comprehensive and
flexible. A threatened CCP is dangerous, perhaps now more than at any time since
Mao Tse-Tung, as Xi Jinping continues to use strong-arm tactics to consolidate his
power and saber-rattling to challenge the international order.
At the same time, recent revelations about China’s official statistics overstating
its GDP by 30 percent track well with other problems that were already known.77
These include one of the world’s worst demographic aging curves thanks to China’s
one-child policy; a population that may already be declining; an unsustainable debt
load that is already causing problems; countless failed boondoggles, from empty
cities to its underwhelming Belt-and-Road Initiative, that are wasting significant
resources; Xi Jinping’s authoritarian turn; increasing state control of the economy;
and a zero-COVID policy that has sabotaged the economy and driven away foreign
investment.78

America has its problems, but it is in better shape than China on nearly every
measure, especially in the long run. While the facts on the ground should inoculate
the next Administration against the most strident China fearmongering circulating
in the media and in Washington, that does not mean that the government in Beijing
is no threat to American interests. The question is: What should we do about it?
A serious China policy will require American policymakers to integrate doc-
trines, institutional prerogatives, expertise, and realistic objectives. Traditional
Cabinet-level bureaucracies like those at the Departments of Defense, State, and
Commerce will need to work together to pursue a comprehensive American strat-
egy. Scores of incremental, narrowly targeted policies are necessary. They will not
make for good soundbites on cable news, and many will operate slowly and out of
sight from most news cycles even as progress is made.
An effective China policy must also allow for adaptation because the CCP will
not sit idly by. As people react to developments, America needs flexible options.
Trade isolationism is inherently inflexible because it reduces the number of con-
tact points with China.
This is a tougher political sell than loud, simplistic jeremiads, but going the extra
mile to solve these difficult coordination problems is vital to America’s interests.
Trade and engagement with China are necessary if we are to contain the threats
that China poses to its neighbors and to the U.S. The next Administration should:

End China’s developing-nation status in the WTO and other
international organizations. China is an advanced manufacturing
economy and should be treated as such, even if its political and legal
institutions remain those of a developing nation, to prevent it from
exploiting its status to gain special privileges.
Use a target, not a blanket. There should be actions against Chinese firms
that are known to have engaged in unfair trade practices such as intellectual
property theft. Rather than blanket tariffs or non-tariff barriers aimed
at entire Chinese industry sectors, firms that act in bad faith should be
targeted individually. This policy was employed to good effect early in the
Trump Administration but was abandoned in favor of a less effective blanket
tariff policy.

Rejoining this alliance should be a top priority in the next conservative
Administration’s China policy. Accession negotiations are likely to be
difficult, given that the CPATPP suspended several clauses that were
important to the United States (such as provisions relating to patents and
aspects of investor-state dispute resolution) when the U.S. pulled out of the
TPP agreement in 2017.

Diplomatic and economic pressure against Beijing will be more effective
when its largest trading partners work in concert. Beijing’s diplomats will
have a hard time employing a divide-and-conquer policy against a united
front of the sort that the TPP offers.

Refocus the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity
on trade. President Biden began the process to create IPEF in 2022,
but any agreement will likely still be under negotiation when the next
Administration takes office. IPEF is similar to the TPP, but its member

Rejoin the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Dropping out of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership agreement might have been the Trump Administration’s
biggest trade policy mistake. The TPP was already negotiated and would
have strengthened an alliance against China, including most of its biggest
trading partners in East Asia and the Americas. America’s departure created
tensions and infighting, distracting the U.S. and its allies from the goal at
hand: countering China. The other 11 TPP countries continue, without
American input or influence, under the Comprehensive and Progressive
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPATPP) to develop a modern
institutional framework to contain Chinese commercial imperialism.
countries are mostly China’s neighbors in Asia. Like the TPP, it seeks to
create an alliance to push China toward the rule of law, but the Biden
Administration so far has left trade entirely out of the agreement. Instead,
the IPEF negotiations are focusing entirely on non-trade issues like climate
and labor policy—issues that give progressives opportunities to impose their
policies on other countries and provide rent-seeking opportunities for labor
unions and politically connected businesses in renewable energy and other
favored industries.

IPEF has the potential to be a powerful diplomatic tool that helps to bring
countries into America’s orbit and away from China’s. Beijing’s chauvinistic
approach to foreign policy has alienated most of China’s neighbors and
allies. They follow along because they lack alternatives. IPEF and the TPP
could offer them a way out and make it easier for China’s smaller neighbors
to stand up for themselves in a united front as they move toward American-
style institutions that protect civil, political, and economic liberties.

IPEF could do all that, and so could the TPP, but America currently has
no voice in the TPP, and IPEF risks becoming little more than another
tool that progressives can use to force their policy wish list on countries
that don’t want it. From the perspective of IPEF’s members, the Biden
Administration’s approach is little different from Beijing’s. The next
Administration can give China’s neighbors a better choice by refocusing
IPEF on trade, dropping most of its non-trade issues, and turning it into a
forum to promote democracy and strengthen alliances while pressuring
Beijing to make needed reforms.

Play the long game. It took two generations to win the Cold War, and
there were many reasons for that success. The fact that the planned
economy is inherently inferior to free-market capitalism played a role. So
did diplomatic, military, and economic pressure from free countries. But
culture was just as important, and it did not come from any government.
Blue jeans and rock ’n’ roll helped to win the Cold War as much as any
deliberate policy did. So did images of fashion and prosperity in American
movies and television shows like Dallas.
Such informal bottom-up processes will also play a vital role in helping to
turn China from an authoritarian threat into a freer and less hostile power.
It will take a long time, and the slow process will garner few headlines, but
it can work. A conservative Administration will support efforts by ordinary
Americans to engage with ordinary Chinese people through social networks,
— 816 —Trade
Internet memes, fashion, movies, student exchange programs, tourism,
and more. China’s leaders are set in their ways, especially with Xi Jinping
presumably now in power for life, but the younger generation is more open
than their parents were—more individualistic and open to change.
Effective outreach to the Chinese people will need the same humility that
other sound trade policies require. Government-directed cultural and
economic outreach risks being heavy-handed and could backfire. Everyone
involved needs to know that the process is generational in scope and will
not work overnight. At the very least, Washington should stay out of the way
as much as possible when regular people want to contact each other across
national, language, and cultural divides.
Each of these many components, from tariffs to trade agreements to culture,
is a small part of a larger China policy. Many are not attention-grabbing
and cannot be put into sound bites. Cultural engagement is not something
Washington can plan. China’s own demographic and debt problems, along
with aging leadership and growing discontent over the zero-COVID policy,
might even cause an internal collapse. American policy must therefore be
prepared to face any contingency.

CONCLUSION

A conservative trade policy needs a conservative vision. America’s found-
ing institutions, based on free trade and entrepreneurship, have made America
the world’s leading economy and will help keep America strong through the
next century.

However, recent departures from those principles have hurt America’s econ-
omy and weakened alliances that are necessary to contain threats from Russia and
China. Reaffirming those principles through policies of openness, dynamism, and
free trade will boost America’s economy, make us more resilient against crises, and
remove opportunities for progressives and rent-seekers to use the levers of gov-
ernment for their own purposes. Rediscovering conservative principles on trade
policy and embracing America’s long history as the world’s leading commercial
republic are an important part of restoring a government of, by, and for the people.

INDEPENDENT
REGULATORY
AGENCIES

In addition to the executive departments and agencies discussed previously,
a number of independent commissions exist that are loosely affiliated with
the executive branch. In general, the President can appoint people to these
commissions but cannot remove them, which makes them constitutionally prob-
lematic in light of the Constitution’s having vested federal executive power in the
President. Nevertheless, they exist, their constitutional legitimacy has generally
been upheld by the courts, and there will be an opportunity for the next Adminis-
tration to use them as forces for good, particularly by making wise appointments.
Few appointments to these commissions will be as important as the President’s
selection of the next chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
In Chapter 28, FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr writes that the FCC chairman “is
empowered with significant authority that is not shared” with other FCC members.
Under a new chairman, he writes, “[t]he FCC needs to change course and bring new
urgency to achieving four main goals: [r]eining in Big Tech; [p]romoting national
security; [u]nleashing economic prosperity; and [e]nsuring FCC accountability
and good governance.”

“The FCC,” writes Carr, “has an important role to play in addressing the threats
to individual liberty posed by corporations that are abusing dominant positions
in the market.” Nowhere is that clearer “than when it comes to Big Tech and its
attempts to drive diverse political viewpoints from the digital town square.” Carr
writes that the FCC should require more transparency from Big Tech, which today
“offers a black box.” And it should issue “an order that interprets Section 230”—
which provides protection from legal liability to online computer services that moderate content in good faith—“in a way that eliminates the expansive, non-textual immunities that courts have read into the statute.” In addition to taking
unilateral action, Carr says, the FCC should work with Congress on legislative
changes to ensure that “Internet companies no longer have carte blanche to censor
protected speech while maintaining their Section 230 protections.”
Carr writes that during the Trump Administration, the FCC took an “appro-
priately strong approach to the national security threats posed by the Chinese
Communist Party.” The FCC put Huawei on its Covered List of entities—its list
of those posing “an unacceptable risk” to U.S. national security. Carr writes that
TikTok also poses a “serious and unacceptable” risk to U.S. national security, while
providing “Beijing with an opportunity to run a foreign influence campaign by
determining the news and information that the app feeds to millions of Americans,”
and the next Administration should ban it. What’s more, Carr writes, “U.S. busi-
nesses are aiding Beijing—often unwittingly”—in its effort to become, by 2030, “the
global leader in artificial intelligence.” In part, they are doing so by providing “Bei-
jing access to their high-powered cloud computing services.” Carr asserts that “it is
time for an Administration to put in place a comprehensive plan that aims to stop
U.S. entities from directly or indirectly contributing to China’s malign AI goals .”
Former Federal Election Commissioner Hans von Spakovsky writes in Chap-
ter 29 that while “the authority of the President over the actions of” the Federal
Election Commission “is extremely limited,” the President “must ensure that the
[Justice Department], just like the FEC, is directed to only prosecute clear viola-
tions” of the Federal Election Campaign Act. “The department must not construe
ambiguous provisions...in a way that infringes on protected First Amendment
activity,” he writes. The FEC has six members, three from each party, and its
determinations require a majority—so, they require the support of at least one
member of each party. DOJ should not “prosecute an individual for supposedly
violating the law when the FEC has previously determined that a similarly situated
individual has not violated the law,” writes von Spakovsky. Moreover, he writes
that the “President should vigorously oppose all efforts”—such as the language
in the “For the People Act of 2021”—“to change the structure of the FEC” so that
it would have an “odd number” of members. The current structure “ensures that
there is bipartisan agreement before any action is taken and protects against the
FEC being weaponized.”

In Chapter 27, David R. Burton writes that the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission (SEC) “should be reducing impediments to capital formation, not radically
increasing them” by pushing a costly “climate change” agenda, as it is doing under
the Biden Administration. Discussing the Federal Trade Commission, Adam Can-
deub writes in Chapter 30, “Antitrust law can combat dominant firms’ baleful
effects on democratic” notions—“such as free speech, the marketplace of ideas,
shareholder control, and managerial accountability as well as collusive behavior
— 826 —Section 5: Independent Regulatory Agencies
with government.” Under the Biden FTC, he writes, firms try “to get out of anti-
trust liability by offering climate, diversity, or other forms of ESG-type offerings.”
Candeub says that state AGs “are far more responsive to their constituents” than
the federal government generally is, and he recommends that the FTC establish
a position in the chairman’s office that is “focused on state AG cooperation and
inviting state AGs to Washington, DC, to discuss enforcement policy in key sectors
under the FTC’s jurisdiction: Big Tech, hospital mergers, supermarket mergers,
and so forth.”
