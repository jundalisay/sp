The royal palace, officialsâ€™ residences, and great houses all face east. 

The palace lies to the north of the gold tower with the gold bridge [Bayon], near the northern gateway. 

It is about 5-6 li in circumference.

The tiles of the main building are made of lead.

All the other tiles are made of yellow clay. 

The beams and pillars are huge, and are all carved and painted with images of the Buddha. 

The rooms are really quite grand-looking. The long corridors and complicated walkways, the soaring structures that rise and fall, all give a considerable sense of size.
