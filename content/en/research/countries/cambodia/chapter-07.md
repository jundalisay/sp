As soon as they give birth, the local women prepare some hot rice, mix it with salt, and put it into the entrance of the vagina. 

They usually take it out after a day and a night.

Because of this, women do not fall sick when they are giving birth, and usually contract so as to be like young girls again.

When I first heard this I was surprised by it, and seriously doubted whether it was true. 

Then a girl in the family I was staying with gave birth to a child. I saw what happened to her.

The day after the birth, she took up the baby right away and went to bathe in the river with it.

It was a truly amazing thing to see.

Then again, I have often heard people say that the local women are very lascivious, so that a day or two after giving birth they are immediately coupling with their husbands.

If a husband doesn't meet his wife's wishes he will be abandoned right away, as Zhu Maichen was.

If the husband happens to have work to do far away, if it is only for a few nights that is all right, but if it is for more than ten nights or so the wife will say, "I'm not a ghost-why am I sleeping alone?" 

This is how strong their sexual feelings are. I have heard that there are some who exercise self-restraint.

The women age very quickly because they marry and have children young.

A 20- or 30-year-old woman is like a Chinese woman of 40 or 50.
