Mathematics has several loose standards of equality.

We correct these standards by connecting them together.

We then imagine that the resulting standard is exact.
- This is because when the imagination (Part 2, Section 4) is set into any train of thinking, it tends to continue even when its object fails.
- The imagination continues its course without any new impulse, like a galley put in motion by the oars.

The same principle is why we apply continued existence to body.

Objects have a certain coherence even as they appear to our senses.

But this coherence is much greater and more uniform, if these object have a continued existence.

The mind starts to observe a train of uniformity among objects.
- It naturally continues until it renders the uniformity as complete as possible.


The simple supposition of their continued existence is gives us a notion of a much greater regularity among objects than when we perceive them.

 <!-- they have when we look no farther than our senses. -->

But this principle is too weak to alone support the continued existence of **all** external bodies.
- The coherence of the appearance of external bodies must be added to their constancy

<!-- , in order to give a satisfactory account of that opinion. -->

<!-- This will lead me into a very profound reasoning.

To avoid confusion, I will:
- give a short sketch of my system, and
- draw out all its parts in their full form. -->

This inference from the constancy of our perceptions is like the precedence from the coherence or our perceptions.

This inference from constancy creates the notion of the continued existence of body, which happens before its distinct existence.

It then creates the coherence.


We go to the beach and see the ocean as Perception 1.
- We leave the beach.
- Consequently, the existence of the ocean becomes absent in our minds.

 <!-- and is interrupted. -->

We come back to the beach and see the ocean again, as Perception 2.
- We do not see Perception 1 and 2 as different (though they really are different).

**We think of those 2 perceptions are the same because of their resemblance.**

This resemblance contradicts Perception 1 being different from Perception 2. 

We resolve this contradiction by thinking of both as one identity with a continued existence.

<!-- This interruption or absence of the ocean's existence is contrary to the ocean's perfect identity.

It makes us think of:
- the first impression as annihilated, and
- the second as newly created.

We find ourselves at a loss.

We are involved in a kind of contradiction.

To free ourselves from this difficulty, we:
- disguise the interruption as much as possible, or
- remove it entirely, by thinking that these interrupted perceptions are connected by a real existence that we are insensible of. -->

This idea of a continued existence gains a force from:
- the memory of these broken impressions,
- that propensity that they give us to make us think that they are the same

Thus, the very essence of belief consists in the force of the conception [strengthened by memory].
