The opinion of the continued existence of body depends on the coherence and constancy of certain impressions.

<!-- How do these qualities create so extraordinary an opinion?

Let us begin with coherence. -->

Our internal impressions are fleeting.
- Yet they have a coherence and regularity in their appearances.

This coherence and regularity in the appearances of internal impressions is different from the coherence and regularity in external bodies.

Our passions have a mutual connection and dependence on each other.

But we never think that our passions existed when our passions did not exist, just to preserve the same connection with the passions that have previously existed in us.

This does not happen with external objects.


Those external objects need a continued existence.
- Otherwise, they lose the regularity of their existence.

I am seated in my room on the second floor, facing the fire.
- All the objects that I see are a few yards around me.
- My memory informs me of the existence of many objects.
- But then, this information does not go beyond their past existence.

My senses or memory does not give any testimony to the continuance of their existence.

I hear the door of my room opening.
- I turn my head and see a servant walking towards me.
- This creates many new reflections and reasonings.

I know the noise of the door opening comes from the door's motion.
- I therefore conclude that the door still exists.

<!-- I have always found that a human body always had a quality called gravity.

This gravity hinders the body from flying.

This servant must have gone up to the second floor using gravity instead of flying, unless the stairs that I remember did not exist anymore.

I receive a letter.

Upon opening it, I see it to have come from a friend, by the handwriting and subscription.

He says he is 1,000 kilometers away.

I account for this phenomenon only by thinking about the continued existence of:
the whole sea and continent between us in my mind, and
the coaches and ferries which I remember.

The phenomena of the servant and letter are contradictions and objections to our maxims on causes and effects because I did not see their actual causes.

I am used to:
hear the sound of a door opening, and
see the door opening at the same time. -->

But in my example, I heard the door open, but did not turn my head enough to see it opened.

My mind only received one perception.

From this one perception, I assumed that:
- the door still exists, and
- it was opened without me seeing it opened.

<!-- Without this supposition, my auditory perception of the opened door would contradict the visual perception of not yet seeing the door being open. -->

**My assuming is initially entirely arbitrary and hypothetical.**

<!-- This supposition gains a force and evidence by being the only supposition that I can create to reconcile such a contradiction. -->

<!-- Similar instances have happened when I had to suppose the -->

We really **assume** the continued existence of objects.

<!--  in order to:
connect their past and present appearances, and
give them a union with each other that is suited to their natures and circumstances. -->

These have naturally led me to regard 

We **assume** the world is something that:
- is real and durable, and
- preserves its existence, even when we cannot see all of it.

<!-- no longer see all it is no longer present to my perception. -->

<!-- The coherence of appearances may seem to be of the same nature with our reasonings on causes and effects because they are both:
derived from custom, and
regulated by past experience. -->

This coherence that leads to our assumption of continued existence is different from cause and effect.

This inference arises from:
the understanding, and
habit, in an indirect and oblique manner.

Nothing is ever really present to the mind besides its own perceptions.

Habit:
- can only be acquired by the regular succession of these perceptions, and
- can never exceed that degree of regularity.

Therefore, unperceived things cannot gain a greater regularity than things we percieve regularly
<!-- any regularity in our perceptions can never be a foundation for us to infer a  in  -->

A habit cannot be acquired by something that was never present to the mind.

We give a greater regularity on real objects than the regularity in our mere perceptions by inferring the continued existence of sensory objects from:
- their coherence, and
- the frequency of their union.

We observe a connection between internal perceptions and external objects in their past appearance to the senses.

But this connection is not perfectly constant, since it can be broken by:
- the turning about of our head, or
- the shutting of our eyes is able to break it.

Yet these objects keep their usual connection, despite their apparent interruption.

Are they joined by something that we cannot perceive?

But all reasoning on matters of fact arises only from habit.

Habit can only be the effect of repeated perceptions.

The extension of habit and reasoning beyond the perceptions can never be the direct and natural effect of the constant repetition and connection.

Rather, it must arise from the cooperation of some other principles.
