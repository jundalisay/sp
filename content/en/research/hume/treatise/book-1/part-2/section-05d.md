Mathematicians will not be satisfied with these answers.
- They will immediately propose new objections.

They will probably say I explain only how objects affect the senses, not their real nature and operations.

<!-- - that my reasoning makes nothing to the matter at hand, and
- that 
 -->

There is nothing visible or tangible in between 2 bodies.

Yet we find by experience, that the bodies may:
- be placed in the same way to the eye, and
- require the same motion of the hand in passing from one to the other, as if divided by something visible and tangible.

This invisible and intangible distance is also found by experience to contain a capacity of:
- receiving body, or
- becoming visible and tangible.

<!-- Here is the whole of my system. -->

My system does not explain why bodies:
- are separated
- can receive other bodies between them, without any impulse or penetration.

<!-- I answer this objection by:
- pleading guilty, and
- confessing that my intention never was to:
- penetrate into the nature of bodies, or
- explain the secret causes of their operations.

This does not belong to my present purpose. -->

This is because those causes are beyond the reach of human understanding.

<!-- , and
- we can never pretend to know body otherwise than by those external properties discovered through the senses. -->

<!-- People might attempt anything further.

But I cannot approve of it until I see someone who has succeeded. -->

I am content with knowing perfectly:
- how objects affect my senses, and
- their connections with each other, as far as experience informs me of them.

This is enough for the conduct of life and for my philosophy, which only explains the nature and causes of our perceptions* [Footnote 4].

### Footnote 4

As long as we confine our speculations to the appearances of objects to our senses, without entering into a long essay about their real nature and operations, we:
- are safe from all difficulties, and
- can never be embarrassed by any question.

Thus, if asked whether the invisible distance between two objects is something or nothing, it is easy to answer that it is something, namely a property of the objects which affect the senses

If asked whether two objects with a distance between them touch or not, it may be answered that this depends on the definition of touch.

Objects touch if they touch when there is nothing sensible between them.

Objects do not touch, when:
- their images strike contiguous parts of the eye, and
- the hand feels both objects successively, without any interposed motion.

The appearances of objects to our senses are all consistent.

No difficulties can ever arise, but from the obscurity of the terms we use.

If we ask into why and how objects appear, most of our conclusions will be full of skepticism and uncertainty.

<!-- There are no very decisive arguments on either side, if asked whether -->

Is the invisible and intangible distance full of body or something that might become visible or tangible by improving of senses?

[The Caresians say yes. The Newtonians say no. The Newtonians match the vulgar and popular notions].

<!-- I am inclined to the contrary opinion as being more suitable to vulgar and popular notions. -->

Newtonian philosophy asserts that a vacuum is where bodies are placed in such a way to receive bodies between them, without impulsion or penetration.

The real nature of this position of bodies is unknown.

We are only acquainted with its:
- effects on the senses, and
- power of receiving body.

Newtonian philosophy is suitable for those who:
- have a modest skepticism, and
- a fair confession of ignorance in subjects that exceed all human capacity.



The foregoing reasoning will explain a paradox: if 'vacuum' is the name of the invisible and intangible distance, then space and matter are the same.

Yet there is a vacuum.

If you do not call the invisible and intangible distance as a 'vacuum', then motion is possible in a plenum without any impulse to infinity, without penetration and without returning in a circle.

We must always confess that we have no idea of any real space without:
- filling it with sensible objects, and
- conceiving its parts as visible or tangible.

The doctrine, that time is nothing but how some real objects exist, is liable to the same objections as the similar doctrine on space.

If we have the idea of a vacuum because we reason on it, we must also have the idea of time without any changeable existence, since time is the most frequent and common subject of dispute.

But we really have no such idea.

Where should we derive time from?

Does it arise from an impression of sensation or reflection?

Point it out distinctly to us, that we may know its nature and qualities.

But if you cannot point it out, you are certainly mistaken when you imagine you have any such idea.

It is impossible for an unchangeable object to give us an impression from which we get the idea of time.

But we can easily point out the successive appearances of such an unchanging object which then make us imagine that we have the idea of time.

There is a continual succession of perceptions in our mind.

The idea of time is forever present with us.

If we think of an unchanging object now and then 5 seconds later, the object appears twice in our minds.

This makes us impose the fictitious idea of time on that object in the same way as if the object had changed between those two appearances.

The more appearances the unchanging object has in our minds, the more of the fictitious time we assign to it.

These relations confound our ideas and make us imagine that we can create an idea of time without any change.*
