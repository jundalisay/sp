The idea of time arises altogether from how impressions appear to the mind, without time being one of those impressions.

Five notes played on a flute give us the impression and idea of time.

<!-- n n="No. The notes only produce a successive impressions from where we derive the idea of time. There is no feeling of time -->

But time is not a sixth impression.

Time:
- does not present itself to the hearing
- is not found by the mind in itself, by reflection

<!-- These 5 sounds:
- enter the mind,
- excite no emotion in the mind,
- do not produce any affection which can give rise to a new idea.

Emotion is necessary to produce a new idea of reflection.

By revolving over 1,000 times all its ideas of sensation, the mind can never extract from them any new original idea, unless it has a faculty which feels some new original impression from such a contemplation.

But here the mind only notices how the sounds appear.

It may afterwards:
- consider the general sound, without considering these specific sounds, and
- conjoin it with any other objects.

The mind certainly must have the ideas of some objects.

It is impossible for the mind, without these ideas, to ever arrive at any conception of time since time is:
- not a primary distinct impression, and
- nothing but different ideas, impressions, or objects succeeding each other. -->


The idea of duration cannot be applicable to perfectly unchangeable objects.

<!-- I take this as the common opinion of philosophers and the vulgar. -->

<!-- To be convinced of its falsehood, we only need to reflect on the conclusion, that the idea of duration:
- is always derived from a succession of changeable objects, and
- can never be conveyed to the mind by anything steadfast and unchangeable.

It inevitably follows, that since the idea of duration cannot be derived from an unchangeable object:
- time can never be applied to that object, and
- anything unchangeable cannot have duration. -->

Ideas always represent the objects or impressions, from which they are derived.

Ideas can never represent or be applied to any other impressions without a fiction.

Section 5 will explain why we:
- apply the idea of time to unchangeable objects
- suppose that duration is a measure of rest and motion.

<!-- There is another very decisive argument, which establishes the present doctrine on our ideas of space and time. -->



## 'Impressions of Atoms' as Quantum of Space and Time which Have a Quality


Our ideas of time are compounded of indivisible parts.

The compound idea of space is based on an indivisible idea of simple space [quantum of space] as an indivisible point.

<!-- Let us separate it from all other ideas and judge its nature and qualities.

The indivisible idea behind the compound idea of space is not the simple idea of space, for the idea of space consists of parts.

According to the supposition, the simple idea of space is perfectly simple and indivisible.

Is it therefore nothing?

That is absolutely impossible.

The real, compound idea of space is composed of no ideas because these many non-entities would make up a real existence, which is absurd.

Therefore, what is our idea of a simple and indivisible point?

My answer will be somewhat new, since the question itself has never been thought of.

We are used to dispute the nature of mathematical points, but seldom the nature of their ideas. -->

The idea of space is conveyed by sight and touch.
- Anything invisible or intangible never appears extended.

That compound impression of space consists of lesser indivisible impressions which I call 'impressions of atoms' or corpuscles endowed with colour and solidity.

 <!-- that are  to the eye or feeling. -->

These atoms must be coloured or tangible for our senses to discover them.

The ideas of their colours and  tangibility should be preserved to comprehend them by our imagination.

Without the ideas of these sensible qualities, they are utterly annihilated to the imagination.

[The black point would be the same as black space]

<!-- Such as the parts are, such is the whole.

If a point is not considered as coloured or tangible, it can convey to us no idea. -->

Consequently, the idea of space which is composed of the ideas of these points, can never possibly exist.

But if the idea of space really can exist, its parts must:
- also exist, and
- be considered as coloured or tangible.

We therefore only have an idea of space when we regard it as an object of our sight or feeling.

The same reasoning will prove that the indivisible moments of time must be filled with some real object or existence, whose succession:
- forms the duration, and
- makes it be conceivable by the mind.
