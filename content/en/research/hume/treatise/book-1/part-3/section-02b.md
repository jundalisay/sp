We impulsively think of motion in Body 1 as the cause of motion in Body 2.

When we consider these objects with utmost attention, we find only that:
- Body 1 approaches Body 2, and
- The motion of Body 2 comes from Body 1, but without any sensible interval.

It is in vain to rack ourselves thinking about this.

We can go no further in considering this particular example.

If anyone leaves this example and defines cause as something that produces another cause, then he would say nothing.

For what does he mean by 'produce'?

Can he define it, that will not be the same with that of causation?

If he cannot, then he runs in a circle.

He gives a synonymous term instead of a definition.


Contiguity and temporal succession are not the basis of the idea of causation.

<!-- An object may be contiguous and prior to another, without being its cause. -->

Causation needs a necessary, consequential connection.

<!-- That relation is much more important than any of the other two above-mentioned. -->

<!-- Again, I turn the object on all sides to discover the nature of this  -->

The idea of consequential connection can be derived from impression.

When I view the known qualities of objects, I immediately discover that the relation of cause and effect does not depend on them.

I can find only their relations of contiguity and succession.

I have already regarded them as imperfect and unsatisfactory.

Does this mean that I have an idea which is not preceded by any similar impression?

This would be too strong a proof of levity and inconstancy, since the contrary principle has already been established.

<!-- Instead, we should examine things more fully. -->

<!-- Some people who look for something, beat about all the neighbouring fields without any design, hoping their good fortune will guide them.

Therefore, we must proceed like them.

We need to:
- leave the direct survey of this question about the nature of that consequential connection of cause and effect, and
- try to answer two questions which might give a hint to clear up the present difficulty: -->

Why must everything have a cause?

Why should such causes have such effects?

What is the nature of:
- that inference we draw from the one to the other?
- our belief in that inference?

<!-- Impressions of reflection -->

The ideas of cause and effect are derived from:
- the 'impressions of reflection', and
- the 'impressions of sensation'.

For brevity, I mention only the impressions of sensation as the origin of these ideas.

Though everything that I say of the impressions of sensation also extend to the impressions of reflection.

Passions are connected with their objects and with one another, just as external bodies are connected.

The same relation of cause and effect, which belongs to one, must then be common to all of them.
