## The Constant Conjunction Between Cause and Effect Comes from Experience

<!-- The inference we draw from cause to effect is not derived merely from:
- a survey of these particular objects, and
- a penetration into the essences of such objects to discover the dependence of one objects on the other.

No object implies the existence of any other object if we:
- consider these objects in themselves, and
- never look beyond the ideas which we form of them.

Such an inference would:
- amount to knowledge, and
- imply the absolute contradiction and impossibility of conceiving anything different.

But as all distinct ideas are separable, there can be no impossibility of that kind.

When we pass from a present impression to the idea of any object, we might:
- separate the idea from the impression, and
- substitute any other idea in its room. -->


We infer the existence of one object from the existence of another object only through experience.

Experience lets us remember:
- frequent instances of the existence of one kind of objects, and
- that the other kinds of objects have:
  - always attended them, and
  - existed in a regular order of contiguity and succession relative to them.


We remember to have seen a flame and its sensation called heat.
- From this we readily recall the one from the other.

<!-- We likewise call to mind their constant conjunction in all past instances.

Without any further ceremony, we:
- call the one cause and the other effect, and
- infer the existence of the one from that of the other. -->

Learning the cause and effect of a phenomenon creates the conjunction.  

<!-- In all those instances where we learn the conjunction of particular causes and effects, both the causes and effects:
- have been perceived by the senses, and
- are remembered.

But in all cases, -->

When we have not learned the conjunction, we perceive or remember only the cause or the effect.
- The other is supplied by our past experience.

<!-- , only one is perceived or remembered. -->


Thus when we think about cause and effect, we create a new relation of constant conjunction between cause and effect.

<!--  when we:
- least expected it, and
- were examining another subject. -->

Contiguity and temporal succession are not enough to for 2 objects to be cause and effect of each other, unless there is constant conjunction between them in  several instances.


<!-- We can now see the advantage of quitting the direct survey of this relation, to discover the nature of that necessary connection which makes so essential a part of it.

We hope that through this, we can arrive at our proposed end.
But honestly, this newly discovered relation of a constant conjunction seems to advance us very little, because it only implies that like objects have always been placed in like relations of contiguity and succession.

This means that we can:
- never discover any new idea, and
- only multiply, but not enlarge the objects of our mind. -->


What we do not learn from one object, we can never learn from 100 of the same kind.

Our senses show us in one instance two bodies, motions, or qualities in certain relations of temporal succession and contiguity.

Our memory presents us only with a multitude of instances.

We always find like bodies, motions, or qualities in like relations in these instances.


<!-- , even to infinity, there never will arise any new original idea, such as that of  -->

A necessary connection never arises from the mere repetition of past preceptions [impressions].

<!-- The number of impressions has in this case no more effect than if we confined ourselves to one only.

This reasoning seems just and obvious.

But we will continue this examination, as it would be folly to despair too soon. -->

Our discovery of the constant conjunction of any objects allows us to always infer one object from another.

What is the nature of that inference?

How does it transition from the impression to the idea?

**The necessary connection depends on the inference  more than the inference depending on the necessary connection.**

The transition from remembrance or sensory perception to an idea, which is either a cause or effect, is founded on:
- past experience, and
- on our remembrance of their constant conjunction.

Does experience produce the idea via the understanding or imagination?

Do we make the transition:
- by reason, or
- by a certain association of perceptions?

If reason made us do the transition, it would be caused by the principle, that:
- instances that we had no experience of must resemble those that we have had experience, and
- the course of nature is always uniformly the same.



To clear up this matter, let us consider all the arguments on which such a proposition may be founded.

As these must be derived from knowledge or probability, let us view each of these degrees of evidence and see whether they afford any just conclusion of this nature.

No demonstrative arguments can prove that those instances, of which we have had no experience, resemble those, of which we have had experience.

We can at least conceive a change in the course of nature.

This proves that such a change is not absolutely impossible.

To form a clear idea of anything, is:
- an undeniable argument for its possibility, and
- alone a refutation of any pretended demonstration against it.
