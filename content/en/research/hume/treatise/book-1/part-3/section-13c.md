According to my system, all reasonings are nothing but the effects of custom.

Custom only influences by:
- enlivening the imagination, and
- giving us a strong conception of anything

 <!-- object. -->

<!-- We can conclude that: -->

Our judgment and imagination can never be contrary.
- Custom cannot make our imagination opposite our judgement.

Rather, it is the general rules that operate on our judgement on causes and effects.

<!-- We can only remove this difficulty by supposing the influence of general rules.

We shall afterwards notice (Section 15) some general rules which should regulate our judgment  -->

These rules are formed by:
- the nature of our understanding, and
- our experience 

<!-- of its operations in the judgments we form concerning objects. -->

By them we learn to distinguish the accidental circumstances from the effective causes.

 <!-- the concurrence of any particular circumstance,  circumstance -->
When we find that an effect can be produced without Event X, then we conclude that that Event X is not part of the cause, however frequently conjoined with it.

This necessity of frequent conjunction makes it have some effect on the mind.

Despite the opposite conclusion from general rules, the opposition of these 2 principles:
- produces a contrariety in our thoughts
- causes us to ascribe the:
  - one inference to our judgment, and
  - other inference to our imagination.

The general rule is attributed to our judgment, as being more extensive and constant.

The exception to the imagination is attributed as being more capricious and uncertain.
Thus our general rules oppose each other in a way.

General rules have 2 influences:

<!-- When an object, that resembles any cause, appears in very considerable circumstances, the imagination jumps to the usual effect -->
1. When an event that resembles a cause appears strongly, the imagination jumps to the usual effect.

<!-- carries us to a lively conception of the usual effect even if the object has different circumstances from that cause. -->

When we review this act of the mind and compare it with the operations of the understanding, we find it to be irregular and illogical.

<!-- - destructive of all the most established principles of reasonings. -->

This is why we reject it.
- The understanding condemns the uncontrolled mind

 <!-- first influence. -->

<!-- Sometimes the one, sometimes the other prevails, according to the person's disposition and character. -->

- The vulgar are commonly guided by the uncontrolled mind 
<!-- first influence. -->
- The wise are guided by the understanding
<!-- second influence. -->

<!-- Meanwhile, the skeptics may here have the pleasure of:
- observing a new and notable contradiction in our reason, and
- seeing all philosophy:
  - ready to be subverted by a principle of human nature, and
  - saved by a new direction of the very same principle. -->


The following general rules is a very unphilosophical kind of probability.
- Yet we can only correct such unphilosophical probabilities by following rules

General rules operate on the imagination even against our judgment.

This is why general rules add force on the ideas presented by the judgement.

<!--  we need not be surprised to:
- see their effects increase, when conjoined with judgment, and
- observe that  ideas. -->

For example, there are subtler ways to praise or insult someone. 

<!-- Everyone knows that there is an indirect way of insinuating praise or blame, which is much less shocking than open flattery or censure. -->

<!-- The influence of a man's feelings is not equally strong and powerful, even if he:
- communicates them by such secret insinuations, and
- makes them known with equal certainty through their open discovery. -->

If someone insults be using a different language or words, I would be less agitated had he used direct words. 

<!-- One who lashes me with concealed strokes of satire, does not move my indignation as if he flatly told me I were a fool, even if 
I would equally understand his meaning, as if he actually told me. -->

This difference is the result of general rules.

He uses general rules to insult me directly. 
- This uses a general connection
- This is like an impression

He uses niche rules to insult me indirectly. 
- This uses a specific connection
- This is like an idea

<!-- I do not immediately perceive a person's feeling whether he:
- openly abuses me, or
- slyly intimates his contempt.

I only become sensible of it by signs and its effects.

The only difference between these two cases is that in the open discovery of his feelings, he uses general and universal signs. -->

<!-- In the secret intimation, he uses more singular and uncommon signs.

This causes the imagination to make the transition with greater facility, in running from the present impression to the absent idea.

The imagination consequently conceives the object with greater force, where the connection is common and universal, than where it is more rare and particular. -->

This difference in the imagination has a suitable effect on the passions.

<!-- The open declaration of our feelings is called the taking off the mask.

The secret intimation of our opinions is the veiling of them.

The difference between an idea produced by a general connection, and an idea arising from a particular connection is here compared to the difference between an impression and an idea.

This effect is augmented by another circumstance.

A secret intimation of anger or contempt shows that we:
- still have some consideration for the person
- avoid abusing him directly.

This makes a concealed satire less disagreeable.

But this still depends on the same principle. -->
