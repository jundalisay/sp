<!-- In Addition to Cause and Effect, the Contiguity and Resemblance of Ideas Influence Belief -->

We must turn the subject of belief on every side to find some new points of view from which we may illustrate such fundamental principles.

Philosophers are correct in having a scrupulous hesitation to receive any new hypothesis.

This hesitation is so necessary to the examination of truth.

It deserves to be complied with.

It requires that:
- every argument be produced to satisfy that hesitation, and
- every objection removed, which may stop them in their reasoning.

This:
- deserves to be complied with, and
- requires that every:
  - argument be produced to satisfy them, and
  - objection be removed which may stop them in their reasoning.

Besides cause and effect, the two relations of resemblance and contiguity are often considered as:
- associating principles of thought, and
- capable of conveying the imagination from one idea to another.

When of one of two objects, connected together by these relations, is immediately presented to the memory or senses, the mind:
- is conveyed to its co-relative through the associating principle, and
- conceives it with an additional force and vigour through the united operation of the associating principle and the present impression.

All this I have observed to confirm by analogy, my explanation of our judgments on cause and effect.

But this very argument can be turned against me.

It can be used to object to my hypothesis.

For if all the parts of that hypothesis were true, that these three species of relations are derived from the same principles, then:
- their effects in informing and enlivening our ideas are the same, and
- belief is nothing but a more forcible and vivid conception of an idea.

It follows that that action of the mind may not only be derived from the relation of cause and effect, but also from those of contiguity and resemblance.

There is some error in that reasoning which leads us into such difficulties because we find by experience that:
- belief arises only from causation, and
- we can draw no inference from one object to another, except those connected by this relation.

My solution to this objection is that whatever is presented to the memory that:
- strikes the mind with vivacity, and
- resembles an immediate impression
must:
- become of considerable moment in all the operations of the mind, and
- easily distinguish itself above the mere fictions of the imagination.

We create a system of these impressions or ideas of the memory, comprehending whatever we remember.

Every part of that system, joined to the present impressions, we call a 'reality'.

But the mind does not stop not here.

The mind finds that there is another system of perceptions connected by custom, or by the relation of cause or effect, with this system of perceptions.

The mind proceeds to consider the ideas of this other system.

It feels determined to view these ideas.

It creates them into a new system since the custom or relation that determines it does not allow change.

It likewise calls them as 'realities'.
- The first of these systems is the object of the memory and senses.
- The second is of the judgment.

Judgment:
- peoples the world, and
- makes us acquainted with existences beyond the reach of the senses and memory, as they are removed in time and place.

Through judgment, I:
- paint the universe in my imagination, and
- fix my attention on any part of it I please.

I form an idea of Rome, which I do not see nor remember.

But this idea is connected with such impressions which I remember from the books of travelers and historians.

I place this idea of Rome in a certain situation on the idea of the globe.

I join to it the conception of a government, religion, and manners.

I look back and consider its first foundation, revolutions, successes, and misfortunes.

All this which I believe, are nothing but ideas.

Their force and settled order arises from custom and the relation of cause and effect.

These distinguish themselves from the other ideas, which are merely the offspring of the imagination.

As to the influence of contiguity and resemblance:
- if the contiguous and resembling object is comprehended in this system of realities, these two relations will:
- assist cause and effect, and
- infix the related idea with more force in the imagination.

I shall carry my observation a step farther.

I will assert that even where the related object is feigned, the relation will:
- enliven the idea, and
- increase its influence.

A poet can form a stronger description of the Elysian fields if he views a beautiful meadow or garden.

In other times, he can imagine himself in these fabulous regions, so that he may enliven his imagination by the feigned contiguity.

I cannot exclude the relations of resemblance and contiguity from operating on the fancy in this way.

But when single, their influence is very feeble and uncertain.

The relation of cause and effect is needed to persuade us of any real existence.

This persuasion is also needed to give force to these other relations.

There is only a small effect on the mind when, upon the appearance of an impression, we:
- feign another object arbitrarily, and
- give it a relation to the impression by our mere goodwill and pleasure.

There no reason why, on the return of the same impression, we should place the same object in the same relation to it.

The mind does not need to feign any resembling and contiguous objects.

If it does, there little need for it to always confine itself to the objects without any variation.

Such a fiction is founded on so little reason, that nothing but pure caprice can determine the mind to form it.

That principle is fluctuating and uncertain.

Thus, it is impossible that it can ever operate with any degree of force and constancy.

The mind foresees and anticipates the change.

It feels:
- the looseness of its actions from the very first instant, and
- its weak hold of its objects.

This imperfection is very sensible in every instance.

It further increases by experience and observation, when we:
- compare the several instances we may remember, and
- form a general rule against the reposing any assurance in those momentary glimpses of light, which arise in the imagination from a feigned resemblance and contiguity.
