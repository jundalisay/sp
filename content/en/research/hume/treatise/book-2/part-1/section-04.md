We have established 2 truths easily:

1. The causes of pride and humility are natural
2. Each different cause is adapted to its passion by a similar principle

How can we:
- reduce these principles fewer
- find among the causes some common origin of their influence?


The following properties of human nature influence our passions.

<!-- - However, these properties are not commonly insisted on by philosophers. -->

1. The association of ideas

The mind cannot fix itself steadily on one idea for a long time.*

{{< n n="This is because the 2 forces of yin yang, shakti shiva are acting always" >}}

<!-- ◦ It cannot by its utmost efforts ever arrive at such a constancy. -->

But the changing of our thoughts have a rule and method.

**The rule is to pass from one object to what is resembling, contiguous to, or produced by it.**

The mind flows from one idea to another idea which is related to it. 

<!--  is present to the imagination, any other idea, united by these relations, naturally:
        ◦ follows it
        ◦ enters with more facility by means of that introduction. -->

2. A like association of impressions [feelings].

All resembling impressions are connected.
- An impression is followed immediately by other impressions

Grief and disappointment give rise to anger.
- Anger gives rise to envy
- Envy gives rise to malice
- Malice gives rise to grief again, until the whole circle is completed.*


{{< n n="This is like a vortex that goes on until it runs out of energy" >}}

Joy gives rise to love, generosity, pity, courage, pride, and the other resembling affections.

Our mind finds it difficult to confine itself to one passion alone.

 <!-- without any change or variation. -->

Human nature is too inconstant to have such regularity.
- Changeableness is essential to it.
        
<!-- • And to what can it so naturally change as to affections or emotions, which are suitable to the temper, and agree with that set of passions, which then prevail? -->

**There is an attraction or association among impressions and ideas**, but with a remarkable difference:
- ideas are associated by resemblance, contiguity, and causation
- impressions are associated only by resemblance

### Superphysics Note:

1. Resemblance (line)
2. Causation
3. ?
4. Contiguity (Space and Time)

{{< /b >}}

<!-- 1. Resemblance
2. Quality, Identity
3. Contrariety, Quantity
4. Space and Time, Cause and Effect -->


3. These 2 kinds of association assist each other

The transition is easier where they both concur in the same object.

A man who is easily offended finds 100 subjects of discontent, impatience, fear, and other uneasy passions.

 <!-- especially if he can discover these subjects in the person who injured him. -->

Those principles which forward the transition of ideas concur here with those principles which operate on impressions.

<!-- the passions. -->

Both:
- unite in one action
- give a double impulse on the mind

This is why the new passion gets so much more force.*

{{< n n="The stronger the negative ego, the more it amplifies the feelings, as megative feelings and crude positive feelings" >}}


 <!-- greater violence. -->

<!-- ◦ The transition to it must be rendered so much more easy and natural. -->

According to Addison, an elegant writer:

{{< l a="Addison" c="Spectator 412, final paragraph" >}}
The fancy delights in everything that is great, strange, or beautiful.
<!--         ◦ is more pleased the more it finds of these perfections in the same object
            ▪ The fancy can receive a new satisfaction with the help of another sense. -->

Any continued sound, as the music of birds, or a fall of waters awakens the mind, making it more attentive.

A fragrant perfume also makes the colours of the landschape appear more agreeable. Smell and sight recommend each other and are pleasanter together than separate.
<!-- The different colours of a picture, when they are well disposed:
        ◦ set off one another
        ◦ receive an additional beauty from the advantage of the situation.” -->

This phenomenon shows the:
- association of impressions and ideas
- their mutual assistance
