The error of distinguishing power from its actual use is not all caused by the scholastic doctrine of free-will.

<!-- This enters very little into common life.

It has but small influence on our vulgar and popular ways of thinking. -->

According to that doctrine, motives do not:
- deprive us of free-will
- take away our power of acting or not acting

 <!-- performing or refraining from any action. -->

A man has no power if he cannot do what he wants. 

 <!-- has very considerable motives between him and the satisfaction of his desires but is unable to do it. -->

I do not feel that I have fallen into my enemy’s power if he approaches me in the streets with a sword.

I know that:
- the fear of the law is as strong as the fear of physical pain
 <!-- civil magistrate is as strong a restraint as any of iron -->
- I am safe because of the law

 <!-- as if he were chained or imprisoned. -->

But he acquires power over me if I let him. 

<!--  I attribute a full power to him and consider myself as his subject if he gets such an authority over me, that:
        ◦ there is no external obstacle to his actions
        ◦ he may punish or reward me as he pleases, without any dread of punishment in his turn. -->

Assume:
- Person 1 has motives to not act
- Person 2 has no motives to not act

Their only difference is that:
- Person 1 will never act. 
- Person 2 will probably act. 

<!--  of interest or safety to refrain from any action.
        ◦ Another person lies under no such obligation. -->

<!-- If we compare these two persons, we shall find that the only known difference between them is that the first person will never perform that action, but the second person will probably perform it. -->


<!-- Man’s will is most fluctuating and inconstant.

Only strong motives can give us an absolute certainty in Person 1's future actions.

When we see a person free from these motives, we suppose a possibility or probability of his acting or forbearing.

We may conclude him to be determined by motives and causes.

Yet this does not remove:
            ▪ the uncertainty of our judgment on these causes, or
            ▪ the influence of that uncertainty on the passions. -->

We:
- assign the idea of power of acting to those who have no motives for restraining action
- do not assign the idea of power to those who have motives for restraint

 <!-- everyone who has no very powerful motive to refrain from it, and refuse it to people who have such a motive,  -->

Thus:
- power always has a reference to its actual or probable use
- we consider a person having ability if he can actually or probably do it

  <!-- when we find from past experience, that it is probable, or at least possible he may exert it. -->
 
Our passions always regard the real existence of objects.

- We always judge of this reality from past instances.
- Power consists in the possibility or probability of any action, as discovered by experience.

Whenever a person who wants to hurt me loses the restraints that prevent him from hurting me, then he might get the power to hurt me. 


<!-- is in such a situation with regard to me, that there is no very powerful motive to deter him from injuring me.

Consequently, it is uncertain whether he will injure me or not. -->

I would then feel uneasy.

<!--  in such a situation
        ◦ sensibly concerned in the possibility or probability of that injury. -->

And so the passions are:
- greatly affected by events that are certain and infallible
- somewhat affected by events that are possible and contingent

<!-- I never really feel any harm from the person who never had any power of harming me, since he did not exert any.
        ◦ But this does not prevent my uneasiness from the preceding uncertainty.

The agreeable passions may here:
        ◦ operate as well as the uneasy passions.
        ◦ convey a pleasure when I perceive a possible or probable good from the possibility or probability of another giving it to me, after the removal of any strong motives which might have formerly hindered him.

This satisfaction increases when:
        ◦ any good approaches in such a way that it is in one’s own power to take or leave it
        ◦ there is no:
            ▪ physical impediment or
            ▪ any very strong motive to hinder our enjoyment. -->
