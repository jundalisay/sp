My principles are based on experience.

<!--  to determine whether these causes are to be regarded as:
        ◦ the qualities that operate, or
        ◦ the subjects, on which the qualities are placed. -->

The causes of pride [ego] and humility [shame] concur to produce pain and pleasure, independent of pride and humility [shame].
- Our beauty gives us pleasure and pride [ego].
- Our ugliness gives us pain and humility [shame].
- A magnificent feast delights us.
- A sordid one displeases us.

<!--     • What I discover as true in some instances, I suppose to be true in all.
        ◦ I take it for granted that  -->

Thus, every cause of:
- pride produces a separate pleasure
- humility produces a separate uneasiness

<!--     • I make a new probable supposition that these subjects are:
        ◦ parts of ourselves, or
        ◦ something nearly related to us. -->


Thus, virtue and vice are the good and bad qualities of our actions and manners.
- These determine our personal character

 <!-- than which nothing operates more strongly on these passions. -->

Likewise, the beauty or ugliness of our face, house, equipage, or furniture renders us vain or humble.

We do not become vain or humble when the same qualities are transferred to others which are unrelated to us.


The causes of pride [ego] and humility [shame] have 2 properties. The things that create pride [ego] and humility [shame]:

1. produce a separate pain or pleasure
2. are related to the self

The are the 2 properties of pride and humility.

Pride [ego] and humility [shame]:
- comes from a natural, inherent instinct
- never looks beyond the self

<!-- The view always rests on the self, when we are actuated by pride or humility. -->
    
We can never lose sight of ourself.
<!--                 • I do not to give any reason for this.
                • Instead, I consider such a peculiar direction of the thought as an original quality. -->

<!--     • The second quality is an original quality.
        ◦ This quality is the sensations or peculiar emotions which:
            ▪ they excite in the soul
            ▪ constitute their very being and essence. -->

<!--     • Thus, pride is a pleasant sensation and humility a painful one.
        ◦ Upon the removal of the pleasure and pain, there is in reality no pride nor humility.
    • Our very feeling convinces us of this.
        ◦ We cannot reason about this beyond our feeling, -->


<!-- The 2 properties of pride and humility are:

1. It has the self as their object
2. Their sensation is pleasant or painful -->


<!-- • If we compare these to the two properties of the causes, I find that this system breaks in on me with an irresistible evidence. -->


The trigger for pride or humility is the pleasurable feeling. 
- That feeling is related to the sensation of pride or humility.


<!--  object which nature has attributed to pride or humility.
        ◦ The sensation, which the cause separately produces, is related to  -->
