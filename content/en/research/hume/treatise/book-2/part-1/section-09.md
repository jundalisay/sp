<!-- Pride and humility have the qualities of our mind and body that is the self, for their natural and more immediate causes. -->

Many other objects which produce pride or humility besides our inherent beauty or ugliness.

<!-- The primary object is obscured and lost by the multiplicity of foreign and extrinsic objects. -->

We feel a vanity from our:
- houses, gardens, equipages
- personal merit and accomplishments

These are external advantages which are far from our persons.

 <!-- are in themselves widely distant from thought or a person. -->

Yet they considerably influence the passions of people. 

<!--  even a passion directed to that as its ultimate object.
    • This happens when external objects:
        ◦ acquire any particular relation to ourselves
        ◦ are associated or connected with us. -->

A beautiful fish in the ocean does not make us vain. 

<!-- , an animal in a desert, and anything that neither belongs, nor is related to us, has no influence on our vanity:
        ◦ whatever extraordinary qualities it may be endowed with
        ◦ whatever degree of surprise and admiration it may naturally occasion. -->

It must be in some way associated with us, as the idea of ourselves, to touch our pride.

The transition from "beautiful fish" to "mine" must be easy and natural.

The relation of resemblance operates on the mind in the same way as contiguity and causation, in conveying us from one idea to another.
- **But it is remarkable that it is seldom a foundation of pride or humility.**

<!-- We do not feel much pride if we resemble a great person. -->

<!--  in any of the valuable parts of his character, we must have the quality, in which we resemble him.

We always choose this quality to directly survey in ourselves rather than by reflection in another person, when we would found upon it any degree of vanity.

So that though a likeness may occasionally produce that passion by suggesting a more advantageous idea of ourselves, it is there the view fixes at last, and the passion finds its ultimate and final cause. -->

Men sometimes show a vanity from resembling a great man in his looks or actions. 

 <!-- countenance, shape, air, or other minute circumstances, that contribute not in any degree to his reputation; -->

But this does not extend very far. Why not?

<!-- • It is not of any considerable moment in these affections.
    • For this I assign the following reason. -->

<!-- We can never have a vanity of resembling in trifles any person, unless he has very shining qualities, which make us respect and venerate him. -->

The good qualities of a great man are many. 

<!--  then are the causes of our vanity through their relation to ourselves.
◦ How are they related to ourselves?

They are parts of the person we value. -->

We match each of such qualities with each of the qualities of the resembling man.
- These form a chain of several links to the great person.

<!--         ◦ Consequently, they are connected with these trifles which are also supposed to be parts of him.
        ◦ These trifles are connected with the resembling qualities in us.
        ◦ These qualities in us are parts connected with the whole.
        ◦ They form  -->

This multitude of relations weakens the connection.

The mind perceives the mismatch between:
- the qualities of the great man and 
- the qualities of the man who resembles him


<!-- , in passing from the shining qualities to the trivial ones, must by that contrast:
            ▪ better perceive the minuteness of the latter
            ▪ be ashamed of the comparison and resemblance. -->

Therefore, contiguity or causation between the thing that causes pride or humility is alone requisite to cause pride and humility.

These relations are qualities that conveys the imagination from one idea to another.

What effect can these relations have on the mind?

        <!-- ◦ How can they become so requisite to the production of the passions? -->

The association of ideas operates so imperceptibly.
- We discover it more by its effects than by any immediate feeling or perception.
- It produces no emotion.
- It creates no new impression.
- It only modifies those ideas which the mind had and could recall.

This is why an association of ideas, however necessary, is insufficient to give rise to any passion.

When the mind feels pride or humility on the appearance of a related object, there is an emotion or original impression produced by some other principle, besides the relation or transition of thought.

Is the emotion first produced by pride or humility itself, or some other impression related to it?

The relation of ideas, which is so requisite a circumstance to the production of pride or humility, would be entirely superfluous, were it not to:
        ◦ second a relation of affections
        ◦ facilitate the transition from one impression to another.

If nature immediately produced pride or humility, it would:
- be completed in itself
- require no further addition or increase from any other affection.

But supposing the first emotion to be only related to pride or humility, it is easily conceived to what purpose the relation of objects may serve

    • and how the two different associations, of impressions and ideas, by uniting their forces, may assist each other’s operation.

This is the only way we can conceive this subject.

An easy transition of ideas which causes no emotion can never be necessary or useful to the passions.
- It is only useful by forwarding the transition between some related impressions.

The same object causes a greater or smaller degree of pride in proportion to:
            ▪ the increase or decrease of its qualities and
            ▪ the distance or nearness of the relation.

This is a clear argument for the transition of affections along the relation of ideas.

Since every change in the relation produces a proportional change in the passion.

Thus one part of the preceding system on the relations of ideas is a sufficient proof of the other part on the relations of impressions.

It is itself founded on experience that I will not waste time to further prove it.

This will appear more evidently in particular instances.

Men are vain of the beauty of their country, county, or parish.

Here, the idea of beauty plainly produces a pleasure.

This pleasure is related to pride.
            ▪ The object or cause of this pleasure is related to the self or the object of pride.
            ▪ By this double relation of impressions and ideas, a transition is made from the one impression to the other.
