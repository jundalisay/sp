Pride [ego] and humility [shame] are:
- simple and uniform impressions
- directly contrary, but have the self as the object


<!-- We can never give a just definition of them or any of the passions. -->

<!-- We can pretend to describe them by enumerating the circumstances that attend them. -->

<!-- But the words ‘pride’ and ‘humility’ are of general use.
        ◦ The impressions they represent are the most common of any.
        ◦ Everyone will be able to form a just idea of them, without mistake.
    • This is why I shall immediately enter their examination. -->


**The self is the succession of related ideas and impressions that we are intimately aware of.**

 <!-- memory and consciousness of. -->

<!-- Here, the view always fixes when we are actuated by pride or humility. -->

We feel elated by pride [ego] or dejected with humility the larger our idea of our self is. 

 <!-- ourself is more or less advantageous. -->

All other objects comprehended by the mind are always considered with a view to ourselves.

Otherwise they would never be able to excite these passions.

 <!-- or produce the smallest increase or reduction of them. -->

When there is no self, there is no pride or humility.

<!-- The self is always the object of pride and humility. -->

But the self can never:
- be their cause
- be enough alone to trigger them

But if the object of pride [ego] and humility [shame] were also the cause of pride [ego] and humility [shame], then that object could never produce pride [ego] and humility [shame].

If it could produce pride [ego] and humility [shame] by itself, then pride [ego] and humility [shame] would cancel each other. 

<!-- At the same time, it must excite an equal degree of the other.

Opposition and contrariety must destroy both. -->

- A man can never be proud and humble at the same time.

Pride [ego] and humility [shame] happen alternately depending on their causes.
- If these 2 encounter, the stronger one annihilates the other.
- Only the superior one continues to operate on the mind.

Our selves alone cannot produce pride [ego] and humility [shame].

If our self did produce pride [ego] and humility [shame] by itself then both would cancel each other. 

<!-- But in the present case neither of them could ever become superior.
        ◦ The view of ourself alone is indifferent to pride and humility.
        ◦ If this excited pride and humility, this view:
            ▪ must produce both passions in the very same proportion; or
            ▪ can produce neither.
    • To excite any passion and raise an equal opposing passion at the same time, is immediately to undo what was done.
        ◦ It must leave the mind perfectly calm and indifferent in the end. -->

Therefore, there is something between the self and the thing that triggers pride [ego] and humility [shame].


<!--   we must distinguish between:
        ◦ the cause and the object of these passions
        ◦ between that idea which excites them, and the idea to which they direct their view, when excited. -->

<!--     • Pride and humility, being once raised, immediately:
        ◦ turn our attention to ourself
        ◦ regard the self as their ultimate and final object.
    • But there is something needed to further raise them.
        ◦ This something:
            ▪ is peculiar to one of the passions
            ▪ does not produce both in the very same degree.
    • The first idea presented to the mind is the idea of the cause or productive principle.
        ◦ This excites the passion connected with it.
        ◦ When excited, that passion turns our view to another idea which is that of self.
    • Here then is a passion placed between two ideas of which the one produces it, and the other is produced by it.
        ◦ The first idea, therefore, represents the cause.
        ◦ The second idea represents the object of the passion.
    • To begin with the causes of pride and humility.
        ◦ Their most obvious and remarkable property is the vast variety of subjects, on which they may be placed. -->

Pride is caused by:
- every valuable quality of the mind, imagination, judgment, memory or disposition
- wit, good-sense, learning, courage, justice, integrity

Humility is caused by their opposites.

These passions are not confined to the mind.
- They extend their view to the body.

A man may be proud of his beauty, strength, agility, good mein, address in dancing, riding, etc.

<!--  and of his dexterity in any manual business or manufacture.
        ◦ But this is not all. -->

<!-- The passions, looking further, comprehend whatever  -->

These objects are related to us.

Our country, family, children, relations, riches, houses, gardens, horses, dogs, and clothes may become a cause of pride or humility.

<!-- We should make a new distinction in the causes of the passion, between that quality, which operates, and the subject, on which it is placed.

A man is vain of a beautiful house belonging to him or which he built himself.
        ◦ Here the object of the passion is himself.
        ◦ The cause is the beautiful house.
            ▪ This cause again is sub-divided into two:
                • the quality, which operates on the passion
                    ◦ The quality is the beauty.
                • the subject in which the quality inheres.
                    ◦ The subject is the house, considered as his property or contrivance.
            ▪ Both these parts are essential.
            ▪ The distinction is not vain and chimerical.
    • Beauty in itself never produces any pride or vanity, unless placed on something related to us.
        ◦ The strongest relation alone, without beauty, or something else in its place, has as little influence on pride.
    • These two particulars are easily separated.
        ◦ There is a necessity for their conjunction to produce pride.
    • We should:
        ◦ consider them as component parts of the cause
        ◦ infix in our minds an exact idea of this distinction.
