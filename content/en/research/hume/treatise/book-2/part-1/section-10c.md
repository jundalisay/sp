All men desire pleasure.

Desire will exist when there is no external obstacle to produce pleasure.

Men perceive no danger in following their inclinations.

In that case their imagination easily:
- anticipates the satisfaction
- conveys the same joy, as if they were persuaded of its real and actual existence.

But this does not explain the satisfaction from riches.

A miser receives delight from his money even if he has never used his riches for 40 years. 

<!-- or the power it affords him of procuring all of life’s pleasures and conveniences, even if he 
        ◦ Consequently, he cannot reason that the real existence of these pleasures is closer than if he had no money at all.
        ◦ But he still imagines these pleasures to approach nearer, whenever all external obstacles are removed along with the more powerful motives of interest and danger which oppose it. -->

This is explained by my account of the will.

<!-- In Part 3, Sec. 2, I shall explain that false sensation of liberty, which makes us imagine we can do anything that is not very dangerous or destructive. -->

Whenever any other person is not restrained from pursuing pleasure, we judge that he will probably obtain it even through it was still not attained.

<!--  under no strong obligations of interest to refrain from any pleasure, 
- the pleasure will exist
- he will  -->

<!-- But when ourselves are in that situation, we judge from an illusion of the fancy, that the pleasure is still closer and more immediate. -->

The willpower seems to:
- move easily every way
- cast a shadow or image of itself, even to that side on which it did not settle.

This image makes the enjoyment seem nearer.

<!-- - approach nearer to us
- give us the same lively satisfaction -->

 <!-- as if it were perfectly certain and unavoidable. -->

Riches produce pride or vanity in their possessors only through a double relation of impressions and ideas.

The essence of riches is in the power of procuring life’s pleasures and conveniences.

<!-- The very essence of this is in:
- the probability of its exercise
- its causing us to anticipate, by a true or false reasoning, the real existence of the pleasure. -->

**This anticipation of pleasure is, in itself, a very considerable pleasure.**

<!-- Its cause is some possession or property which:
            ▪ we enjoy
            ▪ is thereby related to us, we here dearly see all the parts of the foregoing system most exactly and distinctly drawn out before us. -->

This is also why:
- power and riches cause pleasure and pride.
- poverty and slavery excites uneasiness and humility


Power or an authority over others lets us satisfy all our desires.

Slavery subjects us to the will of others.

 <!-- and exposes us to a thousand wants and mortifications. -->

The vanity of power is increased by the consideration of the persons we rule. 

The shame of slavery is increased by the consideration of the persons who rule us.

Suppose we owned robots who acted based on our will. 
- Owning them would give us pleasure and pride.
- But it would not match the pleasure of ruling over sensible and rational creatures.
  - Their condition, compared to our own, makes our authority seem more honourable.

<!-- it were possible to build moving statues that could move and act according to the will. -->
 <!-- to such a degree as when we have the same authority over  -->

In every case, comparison augments our esteem of anything.

A rich man feels his wealthy sitution more by opposing it to that of a beggar.

 <!-- the felicity of his condition better  -->

<!-- But there is a peculiar advantage in power, by the contrast, which is, in a manner, presented to us, between ourselves and the person we command.

The comparison is obvious and natural:

The imagination finds it in the very subject.

The passage of the thought to its conception is smooth and easy.

Our examination of the nature of malice and envy later will reveal that this circumstance has a considerable effect in augmenting its influence.
