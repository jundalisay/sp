The object of a passion is different from its cause. 

<!-- We have observed a difference between the object of the passions and their cause. -->

<!-- ◦ We distinguish in the cause the quality, which operates on the passions, from the subject, in which it inheres.

• We now examine what:
        ◦ determines each of them to be what it is
        ◦ assigns such a particular object, quality, and subject to these affections.

• Through this, we shall fully understand the origin of  -->

Pride [ego] and humility [shame] have the self for their object through a natural and original property.
- The constancy of this phenomenon proves this.

<!-- ◦ No one can doubt but this property is natural from the  and steadiness of its operations. -->

The self is always the object of pride [ego] and humility [shame]
- This makes pride [ego] and humility [shame] different from other passions. 


<!--     ◦ The passions look beyond, still with a view to ourselves.
    ◦ Otherwise, any person or object cannot have any influence on us.

• This proceeds from an original quality or primary impulse, if we consider that it is the distinguishing characteristic of these passions.
        ◦ Unless nature had given some original qualities to the mind, it could never have any secondary qualities.
        ◦ In that case, it:
            ▪ would have no foundation for action, nor
            ▪ could ever begin to exert itself. -->

These original qualities are from the soul itself.

<!-- ◦ can be resolved into no other. -->

This makes the a soul with pride and humility have the self for its object.

Is the cause of pride [ego] and humility [shame] as natural as the self which is it object?

<!-- Does that vast variety proceed from caprice or from the mind’s constitution?
        ◦ We shall remove this doubt if we:
            ▪ cast our eye on human nature
            ▪ consider that in all nations and ages, the same objects still give rise to pride and humility. -->

<!-- Upon the view even of a stranger, we can know what will increase or reduce his passions.

◦ If there is any variation in this, it only proceeds from a difference in the men’s tempers and complexions.
            ▪ It is besides very inconsiderable.

Can we imagine it possible for: -->

Men can never become entirely indifferent to their power, riches, beauty or personal merit.

        <!-- ◦ men’s pride and vanity to be unaffected by these advantages? -->

The causes of pride and humility are:
- natural, **but not original [fixed or constant]**
- very many, many of which:
  - are the effects of art
  - arise partly from:
    - the industry which houses, furniture, clothes
    - caprice
      - Caprice determines their kinds and qualities.
    - the good fortune of men

<!--         ◦ It is impossible for each of them be adapted to these passions by a:
            ▪ particular provision
            ▪ primary constitution of nature. -->

It discovers the effects that result from the different mixtures and combinations of bodies.

<!--     • Each of these was not foreseen nor provided for by nature.
    • Every new production of art, which causes pride or humility, is itself not the object of an original principle.
        ◦ This principle did not lay concealed in the soul.
        ◦ It was not brought to light only by accident.
    • Instead, it adapts itself to pride or humility by sharing some general quality that naturally operates on the mind.
    • It is ridiculous to think that:
        ◦ a fine scritoire, created by an inventor, produced pride in the inventor
        ◦ this principle is then different from those which made him proud of handsome chairs and tables. -->


We must conclude that each cause of pride and humility is not adapted to the passions by a distinct original quality.

Instead, there are some circumstances common to all of them, which their efficacy depends on.

The principles of Nature are few, but the effects are many.

The unskillful naturalist recourses to a different quality for each different operation.

<!-- • How much more must this be true with regard to the human mind?
        ◦ Such a confined a subject may justly be thought incapable of containing such a monstrous heap of principles.
        ◦ These principles would be necessary to excite pride and humility.
        ◦ Each distinct cause would then need to be adapted to pride and humility by a distinct set of principles. -->

Moral philosophy is in the same condition as natural philosophy, with regard to astronomy before Copernicus’ time.

**The ancients knew the maxim that nature does nothing in vain.**

But they invented intricate systems of the heavens which seemed inconsistent with true philosophy.

<!-- They gave way to something more simple and natural in the end. -->

<!-- The following proves that:
        ◦ none of those systems is the just one
        ◦ we want to cover our ignorance of the truth by:
            ▪ a number of falsehoods
            ▪ the invention of a new principle to every new phenomenon, instead of adapting it to the old
        ◦ overloading our hypotheses with a variety of this kind.
