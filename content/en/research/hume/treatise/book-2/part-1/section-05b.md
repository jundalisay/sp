**Pride [ego] or humility [shame] is derived from this double relation of ideas and impressions.**

An idea is easily converted into its correlative impression which resembles and matches it.

This transition is easier when 
- these movements mutually assist each other
- the mind receives a double impulse from the relations of its impressions and ideas

Nature has given to the human mind’s organs the idea of the self.
- This produces pride depending on its disposition.*

{{< n n="This is related to Descartes' animal spirits" >}}

<!--         ◦ She has assigned an idea of the self, to pride.
        ◦ Pride never fails to this idea of the self.
        ◦ This contrivance of nature is easily conceived.
    • We have many instances of this. -->

- The nerves of the nose and tongue convey sensations to the mind.
- The sensations of lust and hunger always produce the idea of objects suitable to lust and hunger.

These 2 circumstances are united in pride [ego].

The organs produce pride [ego].
- Pride [ego] then naturally produces an idea [of the self].


We would never have pride [ego] if the mind had no proper disposition for it.

Pride [ego] always:
- turns our view to ourselves
- makes us think of our own qualities and circumstances

Does nature produce pride [ego] immediately of herself?
- Or is she be assisted by other causes?

Nature's conduct is different in the different passions and sensations.

The palate must be triggered by an external object to produce any relish.

But hunger arises internally, without the concurrence of any external object.

Pride [ego] requires the assistance of some foreign object.

The organs which produce pride [ego] do not exert an original internal movement by themselves, unlike the heart and arteries.

1. Pride [ego] requires causes to excite it.

We do not have pride when we are unsupported by some excellency in ourselves or our things.

<!-- the character, in bodily accomplishments, clothes, equipage or fortune. -->

2. Pride [ego] would be perpetual if it arose immediately from nature since:
- the object is always the same
- there is no disposition of body peculiar to pride, as there is to thirst and hunger.

3. Humility [shame] is in the very same situation with pride [ego].
- It must likewise be perpetual and destroy pride so that neither of them could ever appear.

Thus:
- pride must have a cause and an object
- the one has no influence without the other

The difficulty is only to discover this cause.

<!-- - find what:
            ▪ gives us the first motion to pride
            ▪ sets those organs in action -->

Many different causes that produce pride [ego].

But they all concur in 2 circumstances when the causes:

1. produce an impression of themselves, allied to pride [ego]
2. are placed on a subject, allied to the object of pride [ego].

Pride [ego] is caused by relation and its effects on the passions and ideas.

<!--         ◦ I can no longer doubt, upon these suppositions, that it is the very principle which:
            ▪ causes pride
            ▪ bestows motion on those organs
                • Those organs require only a first impulse or beginning to their action. -->


Pride is excited by anything that:
- gives a pleasant sensation and
- is related to the self

Pride [ego]:
- is agreeable
- has the self for its object.

Humility [shame] is uneasy.

<!-- This is why the separate sensation, arising from the causes, must be reversed while the relation to self continues the same. -->

Pride [ego] and humility [shame] are directly contrary.
- But they have the same object as the self.

We only need to change the relation of impressions, without changing the relation of ideas.

We feel pride from our beautiful house.

The same house produces humility when it is deformed by any accident.
- In this case, pleasure is transformed into pain, which is related to humility [shame].

The double relation between the ideas and impressions:
- subsists in both cases
- produces an easy transition from one emotion to the other.

**Nature has bestowed a kind of attraction on certain impressions and ideas.**
- The appearance of one of them naturally introduces its correlative.

If these 2 attractions or associations of impressions and ideas concur on the same object, they mutually assist each other.
- The transition of the affections and of the imagination is made easily.


Idea 3 produces Impression 2 related to Impression 1 connected with Idea 2 related to Idea 1.
- These 2 impressions must be inseparable.

The one will not be unattended with the other in any case.

This lets us determine the cause of pride [ego] and humility [shame].

The [positive] quality of a thing creates pride by separately producing an impression resembling that [positive] quality.

The thing that has that [positive] quality is related to the self.

The self is the object of the pride.

And so the whole cause consists of:
- a quality of a thing
- a thing

This leads to pride.


## Cause and Effect

My hypothesis is similar to cause and effect.

In causation, there is always:
- a present strong impression
 <!-- which gives a vivacity to the imagination -->
- a related idea which conveys this strength by an easy transition to the related idea.


Without the present [strong] impression:
- the attention is not fixed
- the spirits are not excited*

{{< n n="This is the Cartesian animal spirits" >}}

Without the relation, this attention:
- rests on its first object
- has no farther consequence

There is a great analogy between:
- that hypothesis and
- my present hypothesis of an impression and idea.

This analogy makes them transfuse themselves into another impression and idea through their double relation.

This analogy is proof of both hypotheses.
