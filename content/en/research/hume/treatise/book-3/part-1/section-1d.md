When any quality or character has a tendency to the good of mankind, we are pleased with it and approve of it.
        Because it presents the lively idea of pleasure.
        This idea affects us by sympathy.
            It itself is a kind of pleasure.
            But this sympathy is very variable.

Our sentiments of morals must admit of all the same variations.
            We sympathize more with:
                persons contiguous to us, than with persons remote from us,
                our acquaintance, than with strangers,
                our countrymen, than with foreigners.

Despite this variation of our sympathy, we give the same approbation to the same moral qualities in China as in England.
- They appear equally virtuous.
- They recommend themselves equally to a judicious spectator's esteem.

The sympathy varies without a variation in our esteem.
            Therefore, our esteem does not proceed from sympathy.


I answer that the approbation of moral qualities is not derived from reason or any comparison of ideas.
        It proceeds entirely from:
            a moral taste, and
            certain sentiments of pleasure or disgust.
                These arise on the contemplation and view of particular qualities or characters.
Those sentiments must vary according to the distance or contiguity of the objects.
        I cannot feel the same lively pleasure from the virtues of a person who lived in Greece 2,000 years ago, that I feel from the virtues of a familiar friend and acquaintance.
            I do not say that I esteem the one more than the other:
        Therefore, if the variation of the sentiment without a variation of the esteem is an objection, it must have equal force against every other system, as against the system of sympathy.

To correct this matter, I assert that the variation has no force at all.
        This is easy to prove.
        Our situation, with regard to persons and things, is in continual fluctuation.
        A person that lies at a distance from us, may become a familiar acquaintance in a short time.
        Besides, every person one has a peculiar position with regard to others.
        It is impossible for us to converse together reasonably if each of us considered others only as they appear from our own point of view.
        To prevent those continual contradictions and to arrive at a more stable judgment of things, we:
            fix on some steady and general points of view, and
            always place ourselves in them, whatever our present situation.
Similarly, external beauty is determined merely by pleasure.
        A beautiful face cannot give much pleasure when seen 20 paces away.
        But we do not say that it is less beautiful.
        Because we know what effect it will have in a distant position.
        By this reflection, we correct its momentary appearance.


In general, all sentiments of blame or praise vary according to:
        our nearness or remoteness to the person blamed or praised, and
        our mind's present disposition.
    But we do not regard these variations in our general decision.
        We still apply the terms expressive of our liking or dislike, in the same way as if we remained in one point of view.
    Experience soon teaches us this method of correcting our sentiments or language.
        If our servant is diligent and faithful, he may excite stronger sentiments of love and kindness than Marcus Brutus as represented in history.
        But we do not say that our servant is more laudable than Marcus Brutus who is a renowned patriot.
        Marcus Brutus would command much more affection and admiration if we came closer to him.
    Such corrections are common with regard to all the senses.
        It would be impossible for us to communicate our sentiments if we did not:
            correct the momentary appearances of things, and
            overlook our present situation.

    We blame or praise a person we talk to from the influence of his characters and qualities.
        We do not consider whether the persons, affected by the qualities, are our acquaintance or strangers, countrymen or foreigners.
    We overlook our own interest in those general judgments.
        We do not blame a man for opposing us in any of our pretensions, when his own interest is particularly concerned.
    We make allowance for a certain degree of selfishness in men.
        Because we know it to be:
            inseparable from human nature, and
            inherent in our frame and constitution.
        By this reflection, we correct those sentiments of blame which naturally arise upon any opposition.

    Thus, the general principle of our blame or praise may be corrected by those other principles.
        But the general principles are not altogether effective.
        Our passions do not often correspond entirely to this present theory.
    Men seldom heartily love what:
        lies far from them, and
        does not contribute to their benefit.
    It also rare to meet persons who can pardon another who opposes their interest, no matter how justifiable that opposition may be by the general rules of morality.
        We are contented with saying that reason requires such an impartial conduct.
        But we seldom can bring ourselves to it.
        Our passions do not readily follow our judgment's determination.
    This will be easily understood if we consider what we have said concerning that reason:
        which is able to oppose our passion, and
        which is nothing but a general calm determination of the passions, founded on some distant view.
    When we form our judgments of persons merely from their tendency to benefit us or our friends, we find:
        so many contradictions to our sentiments in society and conversation, and
        an uncertainty from the incessant changes of our situation.
            We seek some other standard of merit and demerit which may not admit of so great variation.
    We are thus loosened from our first station.
    We cannot then fix ourselves with people who have any commerce with the person we consider, as what we did by sympathy.
        We are not as lively as when our own interest or that of our friends is concerned.
        This also has no such influence on our love and hatred.
        But it is equally conformable to our calm and general principles.
            Therefore, it is said to:
                have an equal authority over our reason, and
                command our judgment and opinion.
        We equally blame a bad action we read in history, with a bad action performed in our neighbourhood the other day.
            Because, we know that the historical bad action would also excite sentiments of disapprobation as the nearby one, if it were placed in the same position.

    The second remarkable circumstance is that when a person has a character naturally beneficial to society:
        we esteem him as virtuous, and
        we are delighted with the view of his character, even though particular accidents:
            prevent its operation, and
            incapacitate him from being serviceable to his friends and country.

    Virtue in rags is still virtue.
        The love it procures attends a man into a dungeon or desert, where the virtue:
            can no longer be exerted, and
            is lost to all the world.
        This may be seen as an objection to the present system.
    Sympathy interests us in the good of mankind.
        If sympathy were the source of our esteem for virtue, that sentiment of approbation could only take place where the virtue:
            actually attained its end, and
            was beneficial to mankind.
    It is only an imperfect means when it fails of its end.
        It can never acquire any merit from that end.
    The goodness of an end can bestow a merit on the means alone, as if it were complete and actually produced the end.
