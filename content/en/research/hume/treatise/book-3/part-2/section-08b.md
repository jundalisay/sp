Those philosophers, who assert justice to be a natural virtue antecedent to human conventions, can reasonably:
- resolve all civil allegiance into the obligation of a promise, and
- assert that it is our own consent alone, which binds us to any submission to magistracy.

All government is plainly an invention of men.

If our political duties had any natural moral obligation, we would need to mount higher to find their source.

These philosophers quickly observe that:
- society is as ancient as the human species, and
- those three fundamental laws of nature are as ancient as society.
  

Men invented the three fundamental laws of nature when they:
        observed the necessity of society, and
        found that it was impossible to maintain correspondence without some restraint on their natural appetites.

The same self-love which renders men so incommodious to each other:
        takes a new and more convenient direction,
        produces the rules of justice, and
        is the first motive of the observance of those rules.

But when it is impossible for men to observe those rules in large and polished societies, they invent government to:
        attain their ends,
        preserve the old, or
        procure new advantages by a stricter execution of justice.

So far, our civil duties are connected with our natural duties.
        Our civil duties are invented chiefly for the sake of our natural duties.
        The principal object of government is to constrain men to observe the laws of nature.
            However, that law of nature on the performance of promises is only comprised along with the rest.
            Its exact observance is an effect of the institution of government.
            The obedience to government is not an effect of the obligation of a promise.
        The object of our civil duties is the enforcement of our natural duties.
            Yet the initial motive of the invention of government and the performance of both is self-interest.
            Since there is a separate interest in the obedience to government from the interest in the performance of promises, we must allow a separate obligation.
    Obeying the civil magistrate is needed to preserve order and concord in society.
    Performing promises is needed to beget mutual trust and confidence in life.
    The ends and the means are perfectly distinct.
        The one is not subordinate to the other.




Those philosophers take advantage of the antiquity and the obscure origin of these laws.
- They first deny them to be men's artificial and voluntary inventions.
- They then seek to ingraft other more artificial duties on these laws.

But after we are undeceived and find that natural and civil justice derives its origin from human conventions, we quickly perceive how fruitless it is to:
- resolve the one into the other, and
- seek a stronger foundation in the laws of nature for our political duties than interest and human conventions.

These duties themselves are built on interest and human conventions.

Whichever side we turn this subject, we shall find that natural and artificial duties:
- are exactly on the same footing, and
- have the same source of their first invention and moral obligation.

They are contrived to:
- remedy similar inconveniences, and
- acquire their moral sanction from their remedying those inconveniences.

We shall prove these two points.

Footnote 22:

This proposition must hold strictly true with regard to every quality determined by sentiment.

Afterwards, we shall consider in what sense we can talk of a right or a wrong taste in morals, eloquence, or beauty.
    Mankind's general sentiments are uniform
        They render such questions of small importance.

Men invented the three fundamental laws of nature when they:
- observed the necessity of society, and
- found that it was impossible to maintain correspondence without some restraint on their natural appetites.



The same self-love which renders men so incommodious to each other:
- takes a new and more convenient direction,
- produces the rules of justice, and
- is the first motive of the observance of those rules.

But when it is impossible for men to observe those rules in large and polished societies, they invent government to:
- attain their ends,
- preserve the old, or
- procure new advantages by a stricter execution of justice.


So far, our civil duties are connected with our natural duties.

Our civil duties are invented chiefly for the sake of our natural duties.

The principal object of government is to constrain men to observe the laws of nature.
- However, that law of nature on the performance of promises is only comprised along with the rest.
- Its exact observance is an effect of the institution of government.
- The obedience to government is not an effect of the obligation of a promise.


The object of our civil duties is the enforcement of our natural duties.

Yet the initial motive of the invention of government and the performance of both is self-interest.

Since there is a separate interest in the obedience to government from the interest in the performance of promises, we must allow a separate obligation.

Obeying the civil magistrate is needed to preserve order and concord in society.

Performing promises is needed to beget mutual trust and confidence in life.

The ends and the means are perfectly distinct.

The one is not subordinate to the other.

People will often promise to perform what they have been interested to perform.

This is in the same way that they give others a fuller security by adding a new obligation of interest to their old obligation.

Besides its moral obligation, the interest in the performance of promises is general, avowed, and of the last consequence in life.

Other interests may be more particular and doubtful.

We suspect that people may indulge their humour or passion, in acting contrary to them.

Here, promises:
- come naturally in play, and
- are often required for fuller satisfaction and security.

But if those other interests were as general and avowed as the interest in the performance of a promise:
- they would be on the same footing, and
- people would give the same confidence to them.

This is exactly the case with regard to our civil duties, or obedience to the magistrate.


Magistrates do not derive their authority from a promise or original contract.
        If this were the sanction of government, our rulers would never receive it tacitly.
        Since what is given tacitly can never have such influence on mankind, as what is performed openly.

A tacit promise is where the will is signified by more diffuse signs other than those of speech.
        But there must be a will, no matter how silent or tacit.

But if you ask the people whether they had ever consented to the authority of their rulers, or promised to obey them, they would think very strangely of you.
        They would reply that it did not depend on their consent, but that they were born to such an obedience.

Because of this opinion, we frequently see the people imagine such persons to be their natural rulers.
        Their rulers might have come from that line of rulers, from a long time ago.
        But now they might be deprived of all power and authority.
        No man would voluntarily choose them today or give them any promise of obedience.
    Does a government then have no authority over the people, because they never consented to it?
        Will a government see the attempt of such a free choice as arrogance and impiety?
    The government punishes them very freely for treason and rebellion.
        According to this system, the government reduces itself to common injustice.
    If you say that by living in its territory, they in effect consented to the established government, I answer that this can only be true where they think the affair depends on their choice.
        Besides those philosophers, few or no one has ever yet imagined this.
    A rebel never waged war against the sovereign as his first act upon reaching legal age.
        As a child, he never showed that he could not be obedient.
        On the contrary, we find that civil laws punish this crime at the same legal age as any other crime without our consent.
        There should be some intermediate time for a tacit consent to be supposed in crimes of rebellion.
    A man living under an absolute government would owe no allegiance to that government.
        Since the nature of the absolute government does not depend on consent.
        But as an absolute government is as natural and common a government as any, it must occasion some obligation.
            The men subjected to it always think so.
    This is a clear proof that we do not commonly esteem our allegiance to be derived from our consent or promise.
        Another poof is that when we make an express promise, we always distinguish between the two obligations.
        The promise adds more force to the allegiance, than in a repetition of the same promise.
    Where no promise is given, a man does not look on his allegiance as broken.
        But he keeps those two duties of honour and allegiance perfectly distinct and separate.
    These philosophers thought that their unity was a very subtle invention.
        This is a convincing proof that it is not a true unity.
        Since no man can give a promise, or be restrained by its obligation that is unknown to himself.
