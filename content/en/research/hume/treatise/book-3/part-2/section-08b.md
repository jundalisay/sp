Those philosophers, who assert justice to be a natural virtue antecedent to human conventions, can reasonably:
- resolve all civil allegiance into the obligation of a promise, and
- assert that it is our own consent alone, which binds us to any submission to magistracy.

All government is plainly an invention of men.

The origin of most governments is known in history.

If our political duties had any natural moral obligation, we would need to mount higher to find their source.

These philosophers quickly observe that:
- society is as ancient as the human species, and
- those three fundamental laws of nature are as ancient as society.

Those philosophers take advantage of the antiquity and the obscure origin of these laws.
- They first deny them to be men's artificial and voluntary inventions.
- They then seek to ingraft other more artificial duties on these laws.

But after we are undeceived and find that natural and civil justice derives its origin from human conventions, we quickly perceive how fruitless it is to:
- resolve the one into the other, and
- seek a stronger foundation in the laws of nature for our political duties than interest and human conventions.

These duties themselves are built on interest and human conventions.

Whichever side we turn this subject, we shall find that natural and artificial duties:
- are exactly on the same footing, and
- have the same source of their first invention and moral obligation.

They are contrived to:
- remedy similar inconveniences, and
- acquire their moral sanction from their remedying those inconveniences.

We shall prove these two points.


Men invented the three fundamental laws of nature when they:
- observed the necessity of society, and
- found that it was impossible to maintain correspondence without some restraint on their natural appetites.


The same self-love which renders men so incommodious to each other:
- takes a new and more convenient direction,
- produces the rules of justice, and
- is the first motive of the observance of those rules.

But when it is impossible for men to observe those rules in large and polished societies, they invent government to:
- attain their ends,
- preserve the old, or
- procure new advantages by a stricter execution of justice.


So far, our civil duties are connected with our natural duties.

Our civil duties are invented chiefly for the sake of our natural duties.

The principal object of government is to constrain men to observe the laws of nature.
- However, that law of nature on the performance of promises is only comprised along with the rest.
- Its exact observance is an effect of the institution of government.
- The obedience to government is not an effect of the obligation of a promise.


The object of our civil duties is the enforcement of our natural duties.

Yet the initial motive of the invention of government and the performance of both is self-interest.

Since there is a separate interest in the obedience to government from the interest in the performance of promises, we must allow a separate obligation.

Obeying the civil magistrate is needed to preserve order and concord in society.

Performing promises is needed to beget mutual trust and confidence in life.

The ends and the means are perfectly distinct.

The one is not subordinate to the other.

People will often promise to perform what they have been interested to perform.

This is in the same way that they give others a fuller security by adding a new obligation of interest to their old obligation.

Besides its moral obligation, the interest in the performance of promises is general, avowed, and of the last consequence in life.

Other interests may be more particular and doubtful.

We suspect that people may indulge their humour or passion, in acting contrary to them.

Here, promises:
- come naturally in play, and
- are often required for fuller satisfaction and security.

But if those other interests were as general and avowed as the interest in the performance of a promise:
- they would be on the same footing, and
- people would give the same confidence to them.

This is exactly the case with regard to our civil duties, or obedience to the magistrate.
