The island Timor is around 70 leagues long and 14-16 leagues wide.

It lies nearly north-east and south-west. 

Its middle lies in around 9 degrees south latitude. 

It has no navigable rivers nor many harbours. But it has many bays for ships to ride in at some seasons of the year.

The shore is very bold, free from rocks, shoals or islands, excepting a few which are visible and therefore easily avoided.

On the south side there is a shoal laid down in our charts about thirty leagues from the south-west end; I was 15-20 leagues further to the east than that distance, but saw nothing of the shoal; neither could I find any harbour.

It is a pretty even shore, with sandy bays and low land for about three or four miles up; and then it is mountainous.

There is no anchoring but with half a league or a league at farthest from the shore.

The low land that bounds the sea has nothing but red mangroves, even from the foot of the mountains till you come within a 150-200 paces of the sea.

Then you have sandbanks clothed with a sort of pine; so that there is no getting water on this side because of the mangroves.


### The Island Anabao. Fault Of The Charts. The Channel Between Timor And Anabao.

At the south-west end of Timor is a pretty high island called Anabao. It is about ten or twelve leagues long and about four broad; near which the Dutch are settled.

It lies so near Timor that it is laid down in our charts as part of that island; yet we found a narrow deep channel fit for any ships to pass between them. 

This channel is about ten leagues long and in some places not above a league wide. It runs north-east and south-west, so deep that there is no anchoring but very nigh the shore. 

There is but little tide; the flood setting north and the ebb to the southward. At the north-east end of this channel are two points of land not above a league asunder; one on the south side upon Timor, called Kupang; the other on the north side, upon the island Anabao. 

From this last point the land trends away northerly two or three leagues, opens to the sea, and then bends in again to the westward.


### Kupang Bay. Fort Concordia.

Being past these points you open a bay of about eight leagues long and four wide.

This bay trends in on the south side north-east by east from the south point before mentioned; making many small points or little coves.

About a league to the east of the said south point, the Dutch have a small stone fort called Concordia. 

On the east side of the fort there is a small river of fresh water which has a broad boarded bridge over it, near to the entry into the fort.

Beyond this river is a small sandy bay where the boats and barks land and convey their traffic in or out of the fort. 

About 100 yards from the seaside, and as many from the fort, and forty yards from the bridge on the east side, the Company have a fine garden, surrounded with a good stone wall.

In it is plenty of all sorts of salads, cabbages, roots for the kitchen; in some parts of it are fruit-trees, as jacas, pumplenose, oranges, sweet lemons, etc. And by the walls are coconut and toddy-trees in great plenty. 

Besides these they have musk and watermelons, pineapples, pomecitrons, pomegranates, and other sorts of fruits. Between this garden and the river there is a pen for black cattle, whereof they have plenty. 

Beyond the Company's ground the natives have their houses, in number about fifty or sixty. 

There are 50 soldiers in this fort, but I know not how many guns they have.

I had only seen one bastion which had 4 guns. Within the walls there is a neat little church or chapel.


### A Particular Description Of The Bay

Beyond Concordia the land runs 7 leagues to the bottom of the bay.

Then it is not above a league and a half from side to side, and the land trends away northerly to the north shore, then turns about again to the westward, making the south side of the bay. 

3.5 leagues from the bottom of the bay on this side there is a small island about a musket-shot from the shore; and a reef of rocks that runs from it to the eastward about a mile. 

On the west side of the island is a channel of three fathom at low-water, of which depth it is also within, where ships may haul in and careen.

West from this island the land rounds away in a bight or elbow, and at last ends in a low point of land which shoots forth a ledge of rocks a mile into the sea, which is dry at low water. 

Just against the low point of land and to the west of the ledge of rocks is another pretty high and rocky yet woody island, about half a mile from the low point; which island has a ledge of corally rocks running from it all along to the other small island, only leaving one channel between them. 

Many of these rocks are to be seen at low-water, and there seldom is water enough for a boat to go over them till quarter flood or more. 

Within this ledge there is 2-3 fathom water, and without it no less than 10-12 fathom close to the rocks.

A league without this last rocky island is another small low sandy island, about 4 miles from the low point, 3 leagues from the Dutch fort Concordia and 3 leagues and a half from the south-west point of the bay.

Ships that come in this way must pass between this low isle and the low point, keeping near the isle.


### The Anchoring-Place, Called Babao.

This bay is from 33 fathom, very good oazy holding ground. 

This affords the best shelter against all winds of any place about the island Timor. 

But from March to October, while either the southerly winds or only land and seabreezes hold, the Concordia side is best to ride in; but when the more violent northerly winds come then the best riding is between the 2 rocky islands in 20 fathom. 

If you bring the westernmost island to bear south-west by west about a league distance, and the low point west by south; then the body of the sandy island will bear south-west half west, distance two leagues; and the ledges of rocks shooting from each make such a bar that no sea can come in. 

Then you have the land from west by south to east-north-east to defend you on that side: and other winds do not here blow violently. 

But if they did yet you are so land-locked that there can be no sea to hurt you. This anchoring-place is called Babao, about 5 leagues from Concordia. 

The greatest inconveniency in it is the multitude of worms. Here is fresh water enough to be had in the wet season; every little gulley discharging fresh water into the sea.


### The Malayans Here Kill All The Europeans They Can.

In the dry season you must search for it in standing ponds or gulleys, where the wild buffaloes, hogs, etc. resort every morning and evening to drink; where you may lie and shoot them, taking care that you go strong enough and well-armed against the natives upon all occasions. 

For though there are no inhabitants near this place yet the Malayans come in great companies when ships are here; and if they meet with any Europeans they kill them, of what nation soever they be, not excepting the Portuguese themselves. 

It is but two years since a Portuguese ship riding here had all the boat's crew cut off as they were watering; as I was informed by the Dutch. Here likewise is plenty of fish of several sorts, which may be caught with a seine; also tortoise and oysters.

From the north-east point of this bay, on the north side of the island, the land trends away north-north-east for four or five leagues; afterward north-east or more easterly; 

When you are 15 leagues to the eastward of Babao you come up with a point that makes like Flamborough Head, if you are pretty nigh the land; but if at a distance from it on either side it appears like an island. This point is very remarkable, there being none other like it in all this island.

When you are abreast of this point you will see another point about four leagues to the eastward.

When you are abreast of this latter point you will see a small island bearing east or east by north (according to your distance from the land) just rising out of the water.

When you see it plain you will be abreast of a pretty deep sandy bay, which has a point in the middle that comes sloping from the mountains with a curious valley on each side: the sandy bay runs from one valley to the other. You may sail into this bay, and anchor a little to the eastward of the point in twenty fathom water, half a mile from the shore, soft oaze. 

Then you will be about 2 leagues from the west point of the bay, and about 8 leagues from the small island before mentioned, which you can see pretty plain bearing east-north-east a little northwardly.

Some other marks are set down in the foregoing chapter. In this sandy bay you will find fresh water in two or three places. At spring tides you will see many ripplings, like shoals; but they are only eddies caused by the two points of the bay.

We saw smokes all day up in the mountains, and fires by night, at certain places where we supposed the natives lived, but saw none of them.

The tides ran between the two points of the bay, very strong and uncertain: yet it did not rise and fall above nine foot upon a spring tide: but it made great ripplings and a roaring noise, whirling about like whirlpools. We had constantly eddy tides under the shore, made by the points on each side of the bay.
