<sup>1</sup> Sphærus, a native of the Bosphorus was a pupil of Cleanthes after the death of Zeno.


<sup>2</sup> When he made a considerable advance in philosophy he went to Alexandria, to the court of Ptolemy Philopater. 

When there was a discussion concerning the question whether a wise man would allow himself to be guided by opinion, and when Sphærus affirmed that he would not, the king, wishing to refute him, ordered some pomegranates of wax to be set before him; and when Sphærus was deceived by them, the king shouted that he had given his assent to a false perception. 

But Sphærus answered very neatly, that he had not given his assent to the fact that they were pomegranates, but to the fact that it was probable that they might be pomegranates. And that a perception which could be comprehended differed from one that was only probable.

Once, when Mnesistratus accused him of denying that[327] Ptolemy was a king, he said to him, “That Ptolemy was a man with such and such qualities, and a king.”[101]
