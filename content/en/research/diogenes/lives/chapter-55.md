<sup>1</sup> Myson was:
- the son of Strymon, as Sosicrates states, quoting Hermippus as his authority
- a Chenean by birth, of some Œtæan or Laconian village
- one of the seven wise men

His father was tyrant of his country. 

When Anacharsis inquired if any one was wiser than he, the priestess at Delphi gave the answer which has been already quoted in the life of Thales in reference to Chilo:

I say that Myson the Œtæan sage,
The citizen of Chen, is wiser far
In his deep mind than you.

And that he, having taken a great deal of trouble, came to the village, and found him in the summer season fitting a handle to a plough, and he addressed him, 

“O Myson, this is not now the season for the plough.” 

“Yes It is a capital season for preparing one;” 

but others say, that the words of the oracle are the Etean sage, and they raise the question, what the word Etean means. So Parmenides says, that it is a borough of Laconia, of which Myson was a native; but Sosicrates, in his Successions says, that he was an Etean on his father’s side, and a Chenean by his mother’s. But Euthyphron, the son of Heraclides Ponticus, says that he was a Cretan, for that Etea was a city of Crete.



<sup>2</sup> Anaxilaus says that he was an Arcadian.

Hipponax also mentions him, saying, “Apollo said that Myson was the most prudent of all men.”

But Aristoxenus, in his Miscellanies, says that his habits were not very different from those of Timon and Apemantus -- he was a misanthrope.

He was found in Sparta laughing by himself in a solitary place.

For that very reason!

Aristoxenus says that he was not thought much of because he was not a native of any city, but only of a small village.

His obscurity is why people attribute his sayings and doings to Pisistratus the tyrant.

But he excepts Plato the philosopher, for he mentions Myson in his Protagoras, placing him among the wise men instead of Periander.

<sup>3</sup> Myson commonly said that men should not seek for things in words, but for words in things. For things are not made on account of words, but that words are put together for the sake of things.

<sup>4</sup> He died at 96 years old.
