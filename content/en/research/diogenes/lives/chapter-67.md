<sup>1</sup> Simon was an Athenian, a leather-cutter. 

He, whenever Socrates came into his workshop and conversed, used to make memorandums of all his sayings that he recollected.


<sup>2</sup> From this circumstance, people have called his dialogues leathern ones. 

But he has written 33 which are all combined in 1 volume:

- On the Gods
- on the Good
- on the Honourable
- what the Honourable is
- the first and 2nd Dialogue on Justice 
- on Virtue, showing that it is not to be taught
- the first Dialogue on Courage; the second; the third; on Laws; on the Art of Guiding the People; on Honour; on Poetry; on Good Health
- on Love
- on Philosophy
- on Knowledge
- on Music
- on Poetry
- on what the Honourable is
- on Teaching
- on Conversation
- on Judgment
- on the Existent
- on Number
- on Diligence
- on Activity
- on Covetousness
- on Insolence
- on the Honourable

Some also add to these dialogues; on taking Counsel; on Reason or Suitableness; on doing Harm.


<sup>3</sup> He is, as some people say, the first writer who reduced the conversations of Socrates into the form of dialogues. 

When Pericles offered to provide for him, and invited him to come to him, he said that he would not sell his freedom of speech.


<sup>4</sup> There was also another Simon, who wrote a treatise on Oratorical Art. And another, who was a physician in the time of Seleucus Nicanor. 

And another, who was a statuary.
