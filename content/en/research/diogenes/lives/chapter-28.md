<sup>1</sup> Crito was an Athenian. 

He looked upon Socrates with the greatest affection; and paid such great attention to him, that he took care that he should never be in want of anything.


<sup>2</sup> His sons also were all constant pupils of Socrates:
- Critobulus
- Hermogenes
- Epigenes
- Ctesippus


<sup>3</sup> Crito wrote 17 dialogues, which were all published in 1 volume.

I subjoin their titles:â€”That men are not made good by Teaching; on Superfluity; what is Suitable, or the Statesman; on the Honourable; on doing ill; on Good Government; on Law; on the Divine Being; on Arts; on Society; Protagoras, or the Statesman; on Letters; on Political Science; on the Honourable; on Learning; on Knowledge; on Science; on what Knowledge is.
