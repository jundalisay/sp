<sup>1</sup> Clitomachus was a Carthaginian. He was called Asdrubal, and used to lecture on philosophy in his own country in his native language.

<sup>2</sup> He came to Athens at 40 years old amd became a pupil of Carneades who was pleased with his industry.

So he caused him to be instructed in literature, and himself educated the man carefully. And he carried his diligence to such a degree, that he composed more than 400 books.


<sup>3</sup> He succeeded Carneades in his schools.

He illustrated his principles a great deal by his writings; as he[180] himself had studied the doctrines of their sects, the Academic, the Peripatetic, and the Stoic.

Timon attacks the whole school of Academics, as a body, in these lines:

Nor the unprofitable chattering
Of all the Academics.

<!-- But now that we have gone through the philosophers of Platoâ€™s school, let us go to the Peripatetics, who also derived their doctrines from Plato; and the founder of their sect was Aristotle. -->
