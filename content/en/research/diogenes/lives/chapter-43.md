<sup>1</sup> Herillus was:
- a native of Carthage

He said that:
- the chief good was knowledge
- we should live according to knowledge, and not be misled by ignorance
- that knowledge was a habit not departing from reason in the reception of perceptions
- there was no such thing as a chief good
- circumstances and events changed the good, just as the same piece of brass might become a statue either of Alexander or of Socrates
- the chief good or end (τέλος]), there was a subordinate end (ὑποτελίς) different from it
- those who were not wise aimed at the latter
- only the wise man directed his views to the former
- all the things between virtue and vice were indifferent


<sup>2</sup> His books contain a few lines. But they are full of power, and contain arguments in opposition to Zeno.
