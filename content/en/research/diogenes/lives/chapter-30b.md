### Democritus' Doctrines

<sup>12</sup> Atoms and the vacuum were the beginning of the universe.

Everything else existed only in opinion. 

The worlds were infinite, created, and perishable.

Nothing was created out of nothing, and that nothing was destroyed so as to become nothing.

The atoms are:
- infinite both in magnitude and number
- revolved endlessly

<!-- borne about through the universe in endless revolutions.  -->

Thus, atoms produced all the combinations that exist; fire, water, air, and earth.

All these things are only combinations of atoms.

These combinations:
- cannot be affected by external circumstances
- are unchangeable by reason of their solidity

The sun and the moon are formed by such revolutions and round bodies.

The soul is produced in the same way. 

The soul and the mind are identical.

We see by the falling of visions across our sight.

Motion causes the production of everything.
- He calls motion as necessity. 

Everything that happens, happens of necessity. 

Cheerfulness is the chief good. 
- This is not the same as pleasure

Some people, who have misunderstood him, have fancied that he meant cheerfulness as pleasure.

But cheerfulness to him is a condition where the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, or superstition, or other passion. 

He calls this state εὐθυμία, and εὐεστὼ, and several other names. 

Everything existing is based on opinion. But atoms and the vacuum he believes exist by nature.
