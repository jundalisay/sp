<sup>1</sup> Democritus was:
- the son of Hegesistratus, but as some say, of Athenocrites, and, according to other accounts, of Damasippus.
- a native of Abdera, and a citizen of Miletus.


<sup>2</sup> He was a pupil of some of the Magi and Chaldæans, whom Xerxes had left with his father as teachers, when he had been hospitably received by him, as Herodotus informs us.

From these men he, while still a boy, learned the principles of astronomy and theology. 

Afterwards, his father entrusted him to Leucippus, and to Anaxagoras who was 40 years older than he.

Phavorinus, in his Universal History, says that Democritus said of Anaxagoras, that his opinions about the sun and moon were not his own, but were old theories, and that he had stolen them.

He used also to pull to pieces his assertions about the composition of the world, and about mind, as he was hostile to him, because he had declined to admit him as a pupil.

How then can he have been a pupil of his, as some assert? 

<!-- in his treatise on People of the same Name, in his Successions-->
Demetrius and Antisthenes affirm that Democritus:
- travelled to Egypt to learn mathematics from the priests there
- went next to the Chaldæans, then into Persia as far the Persian Gulf

Some say he made acquaintance with the Gymnosophists in India, and that he went to Ethiopia.


<sup>3</sup> He was one of 3 brothers who divided their patrimony among them.

The most common story is, that he took the smaller portion, as it was in money, because he required money for travelling.

Though his brothers suspected him of entertaining some treacherous design.

Demetrius says that:
- his share was more than 100 talents
- he spent the whole of it.


<sup>4</sup> Demetrius also says that Democritus was so industrious that he cut off for himself a small portion of the garden which surrounded his house, in which there was a small cottage, and shut himself up in it.

When his father brought him an ox to sacrifice, and fastened it there, he for a long time did not discover it, until his father having roused him, on the pretext of the sacrifice, told him what he had done with the ox.


<sup>5</sup> When Democritus went to Athens, it was known that he despised glory and did not desire to be known.

He became acquainted with Socrates, without Socrates knowing who he was.

“For I came,” says he, “to Athens, and no one knew me.”

“If,” says Thrasylus, “the Rivals is really the work of Plato, then Democritus must be the anonymous interlocutor, who is introduced in that dialogue, besides Œnopides and Anaxagoras, the one I mean who, in the conversation with Socrates, is arguing about philosophy, and whom the philosopher tells, that a philosopher resembles a conqueror in the Pentathlum.” 

He was veritably a master of five branches of philosophy. For he was thoroughly acquainted with physics, and ethics, and mathematics, and the whole encyclic system, and indeed he was thoroughly experienced and skilful in every kind of art. He it was who was the author of the saying, “Speech is the shadow of action.” 

But Demetrius Phalereus, in his Defence of Socrates, affirms that he never came to Athens at all. that is a still stranger circumstance than any, if he despised so important a city, not wishing to derive glory from the place in which he was, but preferring rather himself to invest the place with glory.


<sup>6</sup> Thrasylus says that Democritus admired the Pythagoreans.

Democritus derived all his doctrines from him to such a degree, that one would have thought that he had been his pupil, if the difference of time did not prevent it. 

At all events, Glaucus, of Rhegium, who was a contemporary of his, affirms that he was a pupil of some of the Pythagorean school.

Apollodorus, of Cyzicus, says that he was intimate with Philolaus; “He used to practise himself,” says Antisthenes, “in testing perceptions in various manners; sometimes retiring into solitary places, and spending his time even among tombs.”


<sup>7</sup> When he returned from his travels, he lived in a most humble manner; like a man who had spent all his property.

Because of his poverty, he was supported by his brother Damasus. 

But when he had foretold some future event, which happened as he had predicted, and had in consequence become famous, he was for all the rest of his life thought worthy of almost divine honours by the generality of people. 

There was a law that a man who had squandered his whole patrimony should not be allowed funeral rites in his country.

Antisthenes says that he:
- recited to the people his work called "the Great World" which is superior to all his other writings
- was givem 500 talents as reward
- had some brazen statues erected in his honour.

<!-- , being aware of this law, and not wishing to be exposed to the calumnies of those who envied him, and would be glad to accuse him,  -->

When he died at the age of over 100 years, he was buried at the public expense.

But Demetrius says, that it was his relations who read the Great World, and that they were presented with a hundred talents only; and Hippobotus coincides in this statement.



<sup>8</sup> Aristoxenus, in his Historic Commentaries, says that Plato wished to burn all the writings of Democritus that he was able to collect.

But that Amyclas and Cleinias, the Pythagoreans, prevented him, as it would do no good; for that copies of his books were already in many hands.

That was the case; for Plato, who mentions nearly all the ancient philosophers, nowhere speaks of Democritus; not even in those passages where he has occasion to contradict his theories, evidently, because he said that if he did, he would be showing his disagreement with the best of all philosophers; a man whom even Timon praises in the following terms:

Like that Democritus, wisest of men,
Sage ruler of his speech; profound converser,
Whose works I love to read among the first.


<sup>9</sup> But he was, according to the statement made by himself in the Little World, a youth when Anaxagoras was an old man, being 40 years younger than he was.

And he says, that he composed the Little World seven hundred and thirty years after the capture of Troy. 

He must have been born, according to the account given by Apollodorus in his Chronicles, in the eightieth olympiad; but, as Thrasylus says, in his work entitled the Events, which took place before the reading of the books of Democritus, in the third year of the seventy-seventh olympiad, being, as it is there stated, one year older than Socrates. 

He must therefore have been a contemporary of Archelaus, the pupil of Anaxagoras, and of Œnopides, for he makes mention of this letter. 

He also speaks of the theories of Parmenides and Zeno, on the subject of the One, as they were the men of the highest reputation in histories, and he also speaks of Protagoras of Abdera, who confessedly lived at the same time as Socrates.


<sup>10</sup> Athenodorus tells us, in the eighth book of his Conversations, that once, when Hippocrates came to see him, he ordered some milk to be brought; and that, when he saw the milk, he said that it was the milk of a black goat, with her first kid; on which Hippocrates marvelled at his accurate knowledge. Also, as a young girl came with Hippocrates, on the first day, he saluted her thus, “Good morning, my maid;”[394] but on the next day, “Good morning, woman;” for, indeed, she had ceased to be a maid during the night.

<sup>11</sup> Hermippus relates, that Democritus died when he was exceedingly old.

His sister was lamenting that he would die during the festival of the Thesmophoria,[128] and so prevent her from discharging her duties to the Goddess.

So he bade her be of good cheer, and desired her to bring him hot loaves every day. And, by applying these to his nostrils, he kept himself alive even over the festival. 

But when the days of the festival were passed (and it lasted three days), then he expired, without any pain, as Hipparchus assures us, having lived a hundred and nine years. And we have written an epigram upon him in our collection of poems in every metre, which runs thus:

What man was e’er so wise, who ever did
So great a deed as this Democritus?
Who kept off death, though present for three days,
And entertained him with hot steam of bread.
