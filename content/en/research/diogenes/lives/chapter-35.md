<sup>1</sup> Epicharmus was:
- a native of Cos
- the son of Helothales
- a pupil of Pythagoras

When he was 3 months old, he was brought to Megara, in Sicily.

From thence he came to Syracuse, as he himself tells us in his writings. And on his statue there is the following inscription.

As the bright sun excels the other stars,
As the sea far exceeds the river streams:
So does sage Epicharmus men surpass,
Whom hospitable Syracuse has crowned.


II. He has left behind him Commentaries in which he treats of natural philosophy, and delivers apophthegms, and discusses medicine.

He has also added brief notes to many of his commentaries, in which he declares plainly that he is the author of the works.


III. He died at 90 years.
