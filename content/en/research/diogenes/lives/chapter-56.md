<sup>1</sup> Onesicritus is called by some authors an Æginetan.

But Demetrius the Magnesian affirms that he was a native of Astypalæa. 

He also was one of the most eminent of the disciples of Diogenes.

<sup>2</sup> He resembles Xenophon.

Xenophon joined in the expedition of Cyrus, and Onesicritus in that of Alexander.

Xenophon wrote the Cyropædia, and Onesicritus wrote an account of the education of Alexander.

Xenophon, too, wrote a Panegyric on Cyrus, and Onesicritus one on Alexander. 

They were also both similar to one another in style, except that a copyist is naturally inferior to the original.


<sup>3</sup> Menander was surnamed Drymus. He was a pupil of Diogenes, and a great admirer of Homer.

And so was Hegesæus of Sinope, who was nicknamed Clœus, and Philiscus the Æginetan.
