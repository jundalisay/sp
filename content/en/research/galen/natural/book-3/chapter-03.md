We can detect the retentive faculty in the uterus more clearly in proportion to the longer duration of its activity as compared with that of the stomach.

It takes 9 months in most women for the fetus to attain maturity in the womb.

This organ has its neck quite closed, and entirely surrounding the embryo together with the chorion. 

Further, it is the utility of the function which determines the closure of the os and the stay of the foetus in the uterus. 

For it is not casually nor without reason that Nature has made the uterus capable of contracting upon, and of retaining the embryo, but in order that the latter may arrive at a proper size. 

When, therefore, the object for which the uterus brought its retentive faculty into play has been fulfilled, it then stops this faculty and brings it back to a state of rest, and employs instead of it another faculty hitherto quiescent—the propulsive faculty. 

In this case again the quiescent and active states are both determined by utility; when this calls, there is activity; when it does not, there is rest.

Here, then, once more, we must observe well the Art [artistic tendency] of Nature—how she has not merely placed in each organ the capabilities of useful activities, but has also fore-ordained the times both of rest and movement. 

When everything connected with the pregnancy proceeds properly, the eliminative faculty remains quiescent as though it did not exist.

The completion is entirely despaired of if anything goes wrong with:
- the chorion or
- any of the other membranes or
- with the foetus


Then the uterus no longer awaits the 9-months period. The retentive faculty forthwith ceases and allows the heretofore inoperative faculty to come into action. 

It is that something is done—in fact, useful work effected—by the eliminative or propulsive faculty (for so it, too, has been called, receiving, like the rest, its names from the corresponding activities).

My theory can demonstrate both as they succeed each other.

The one gives place to the other according as utility demands.

Thus, the retentive faculty makes the uterus contract upon the foetus at every point.

When the midwives palpate it:
- the os is found to be closed
- the pregnant women during the first days—and particularly on that on which conception takes place—experience a sensation as if the uterus were moving and contracting on itself. 

If both of these things occur—if the os closes apart from inflammation or any other disease, and if this is accompanied by a feeling of movement in the uterus—then the women believe that they have received the semen which comes from the male, and that they are retaining it.


Herophilus writes that up to the time of labour, the os uteri will not admit even the tip of a probe. 

It:
- no longer opens after pregnancy has begun.
- dilates more widely at the times of the menstrual flow.

Hippocrates was the first to declare that the os uteri closes during pregnancy and inflammation.

But in pregnancy it does not depart from its own nature, whilst in inflammation it becomes hard.

In the case of the opposite (the eliminative) faculty, the os opens, whilst the whole fundus approaches as near as possible to the os, expelling the embryo as it does so; and along with the fundus the contiguous parts—which form as it were a girdle round the whole organ—co-operate in the work; they squeeze upon the embryo and propel it bodily outwards. 

In many women who exercise such a faculty immoderately, violent pains cause forcible prolapse of the whole womb.

Here almost the same thing happens as frequently occurs in wrestling-bouts and struggles, when in our eagerness to overturn and throw others we are ourselves upset along with them.

For similarly, when the uterus is forcing the embryo forward it sometimes becomes entirely prolapsed, and particularly when the ligaments connecting it with the spine happen to be naturally lax.

When the foetus is alive, the os uteri is closed with perfect accuracy.

But if it dies, the os at once opens up to let the foetus exit. 

The midwife does not make the parturient woman get up at once and sit down on the [obstetric] chair.

Instead, she begins by palpating the os as it gradually dilates.

The first thing she says is that it has dilated “enough to admit the little finger,” then that “it is bigger now,”. She will say that the size of the dilatation is increasing. 

When it is sufficient to allow of the transit of the foetus, she then makes the patient get up from her bed and sit on the chair, and bids her make every effort to expel the child.

This additional work which the patient does herself is no longer the work of the uterus.
- It is the work of the epigastric muscles, which also help in defecation and micturition.
