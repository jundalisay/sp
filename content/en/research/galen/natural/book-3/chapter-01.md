Nutrition occurs by an alteration or assimilation of that nourishing thing to that which receives it.

 <!-- in view of its activity we call, in general terms, alterative, or, more specifically,  -->

Every part of the animal has a faculty which is assimilative and nutritive.

The part being nourished assimilates that nourishing matter as nutriment for itself.

Another faculty naturally attracts the proper juice [humour] for that part being nourished.

 <!-- that juice is proper to each part which is adapted for assimilation, and that  -->

The faculty which attracts the juice is called "attractive" or "epispastic", by reason of its activity.

Assimilation is preceded by adhesion.

<!-- This, again, by presentation, the latter stage being, as one might say, the end or goal of the activity corresponding to the attractive faculty.  -->

The actual bringing up of nutriment from the veins into each parts to be nourished is done by the attractive faculty.

  <!-- takes place through the activation of the , whilst to have been finally brought up and presented to the part is the actual end for which we desired such an activity. -->

It is attracted in order that it may be presented. 

After this, considerable time is needed for the animal's nutrition.

A thing can be rapidly attracted.

A lot of time is needed for the nutriment to adhere and be entirely assimilated to the part being nourished and to become a part of it.


The nutritive juice that fails assimilation will withdraw to another part and keeps flowing away, and constantly changing and shifting its position.

Here, the retentive faculty is needed to ensure a prolonged stay of the presented juice for the part being nourished.
- It is resident in the part which is to be nourished. 

<!-- The necessity for the genesis of such a faculty, and whoever has an appreciation of logical sequence must be firmly persuaded from what we have said that, if it be laid down and proved by previous demonstration that  -->

Nature is artistic and solicitous for the animalâ€™s welfare.
- It follows that she must also possess a faculty of this kind.



## Chapter 2: The Retentive Faculty

In certain parts of the body, the retentive faculty is so obvious.*

{{< n n="In Bio Superphysics, this is the Contracting Vayu" >}}

Its operation is sometime obvious, sometimes not. 

It is most obvious in the largest and hollowest organs such as:
- the stomach
- the womb or uterus.

We conduct this enquiry on:
- our own persons for those activities obvious without dissection.
- animals which are near to man in obscure activities which require dissecting

<!-- not that even animals unlike him will not show, in a general way, the faculty in question, but because in this manner we may find out at once what is common to all and what is peculiar to ourselves, and so may become more resourceful in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. -->

The stomach retains the food until it has quite digested it. The uterus retains the embryo until it brings it to completion.

<!-- , but the time taken for the completion of the embryo is many times more than that for the digestion of food. -->
