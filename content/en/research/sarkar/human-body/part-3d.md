The mańipura area is the primary location of dehágni [bodily fire], the main sphere of vitality. 

An unborn baby, through the medium of this mańipura cakra, remains joined with the mother’s body thorugh the umbilical chord. 

Through this medium, the lymph from the mother’s body penetrates into the body of the infant. 

**That is why the baby is not incinerated by the normal temperatures of fire.** 

After a cremation, the descendants of the deceased carry this part away from the funeral pyre, along with the bone remnants, and ultimately throw it into the Ganges. 

This is known as asthivisarjana [immersion of the bone remnants].

Below the mańipura cakra there are also many glands and sub-glands.

The hormones secreted by these are not metabolized by any of the plexi. 

They go out of the body, not getting absorbed to any appreciable extent. 

Through particular yoga-based actions, they can be retained in the body to a great extent. 

In Tantra Shástra, in Avidyá Tantra, this is called stambhana kriyá [a process to stop bodily functions]. 

Stool, urine, sweat and semen get excreted from the body because the concerned reflexes originate from under the navel.

The influence exerted by the nerve cells of the brain controls lower nerve cells down as far as the anáhata cakra. 

The following are directly linked with the mundane faculties:
- navel cakra (mańipura)
- svádhiśt́hána cakra
- múládhára cakra 


This is why, in the sphere of spiritual practices, the mańipura cakra and the one below it are generally not recognized as cakras for repeating the Iśt́a mantra [a personal mantra repeated in meditation]. 

The recognized cakras for japa [repetition of mantra] are the:
- anáhata cakra
- vishuddha cakra
- ájiṋá cakra
- a few other cakras and upacakras of the upper region. 


## Guru Chakra

The Guru cakra is:
- the highest cakra
- used as the place of dhyána

The hormones secreted by various glands and sub-glands are directly connected with the human body and mind.

The nerve cells of the brain each regulate a particular kind of sentiment and thought. 

The glands and sub-glands of the lower regions maintain an organic link with the above-mentioned nerve cells of the brain. 

Particular courses of thought depend on the secretions of these hormones. 

Then again, while moving along mundane mental paths, the human mind is influenced by many kinds of susceptibilities which are based on mundane activities. 

Under these circumstances there is a need, on the one hand, for purity of thought, and on the other, for satsauṋga [associating with good people]. 

The same person who is elevated in the company of good people, gets degenerated in an evil environment. This is a tested truth. 

So in human life there is as much need of satsauṋga as there is the need to shun evil company. Therefore, it is necessary to look for satsauṋga and avoid asatsauṋga [associating with bad people].

<!-- Satsaungena bhavenmuktirasatsaungeśu bandhanam;
Asatsauṋgamudrańaḿ sá mudrá parikiirttitá.
[Keeping good company leads to liberation, whereas the company of bad people leads to greater bondage. The mudrańam – shunning – of bad company is called mudrá sádhaná.] -->
