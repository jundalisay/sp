Svádhyáya means the clear understanding of any spiritual subject. 

In ancient days students carried on their day-to-day Svádhyáya in the hermitage of the rśis.

But the circumstances have changed and the term Svádhyáya has also lost its meaning with passage of time.

Nowadays reading religious scriptures without grasping the meaning is also considered to be Svádhyáya.

Religious professionals have misguided the public by their misinterpretation of the term svádhyáya. 

They say, “These are the results of reading such-and-such books; it matters little whether you understand the meaning or not. If you cannot find time to read books, simply touch your head with them thrice; or if you have no time to hear religious sermons, offer fruits or sweets to the deity. This will yield the same result. This is the real thing”.


Svádhyáya means not only to read or hear a subject, but also to understand its significance, the underlying idea. 

Acceptance of the outward or crude meaning has only led to the corruption of Vaeśńava and Shákta sádhaná and this ultimately greatly distorted people’s religious belief. 

For example, one aspect of tantra sádhaná is called máḿsa sádhaná. What is this máḿsa sádhaná?

Má shabdát rasaná jineyá tadamshán rasaná priye
Yastad bhakśayennityaḿ sa eva máḿsa sádhakah.

“Ma” means “tongue” and “máḿsa” means “action of the tongue”, i.e., vocal expression. 

The sádhaka who takes máḿsa (vocal expression) every day, i.e., who practises control over speech, is a máḿsa sádhaka. How beautiful the meaning is! 

But the so-called interpreters who are dominated by their material desires never hesitate to slaughter innocent goats at the altar of the deities in the name of máḿsa (meat) sádhaná. 

The number of goats to be sacrificed is determined by the number of those who will eat the flesh. Alas! what an interpretation!

To understand the underlying meaning of what is laid down in scriptures, the idea is to be grasped first; otherwise the proper spirit will never be realized. 

If I say, “Shaońd́ikah surálayaḿ gacchati,” it will naturally mean “The liquor merchant is going to the liquor (surá) shop.” 

But if I say, “Naradah surálayaḿ gacchati,” it means “Nárada is going to the abode of surá (heaven).” 

But in the former case it was the house of surá, i.e., liquor shop. 

Thus the same word carries different meanings in different contexts. 

You have now understood how cautious you have to be in practising svádhyáya. 

Those with vested interest seek to keep the public away from the true spirit of the true shástras, because this facilitates their exploitation.
