There may be many interpretations of the term “Iishvara.” 

But it commonly means “the controller of this universe”. 

He who controls the thought-waves of this universe is Iishvara. 

Therefore, “Puruśottama” and “Iishvara” are not identical conceptions. 

In philosophy, “Iishvara” is also the witnessing counterpart of the objective Prakrti where the static principle is dominant.

It is the witnessing entity of the causal world, it is the magnified essence of prájiṋa, it is an entity free from all bondages.

Klesha-karma-vipákáshae raparámrśt́ah Puruśavisheśa Iishvarah.

Whatever may be the minor differences, to a sádhaka, Iishvara is Saguńa Brahma or God.

Prańidhána means:
- to understand clearly or
- to adopt something as a shelter. 

Therefore Iishvara prańidhána means:
- to establish oneself in the Cosmic idea
- to accept Iishvara as the only ideal of life. 

The physical body constituted of 5 fundamental factors **does not disobey** the laws of the cycle of His thought-wave, extroversial or introversial. 

**It is your mind that violates them**.

This results in the degeneration of the unit consciousness because unit consciousness is reflected in the mind and nowhere else. 

So Iishvara prańidhána means to move with accelerated speed towards that Supreme Shelter, God. 

Therefore, Iishvara prańidhána is:
- absolutely based on bháva, or ideation.
- a mental effort in its entirety. 

Shouting at the top of one’s voice for a big crowd to assemble, or showing devotion by beating drums, etc., has got no place in it. 

Your Iishvara is not deaf. Don’t shout to convey your mental feelings to Him.

One will have to detach the mind from worldly propensities while meditating on Iishvara (God). 

First, the mind will have to be withdrawn from the limited “I” feeling, and focused at a point. 

Then one will take the thought of the Macrocosm around that point with the help of the ideation of the mantra prescribed according to one’s own saḿskára (mental potentiality). 

He is the subtlest Entity. Therefore, He can be realized only through feeling and by no other means.

Japa is of 3 kinds:

1. vácanika

Vácanika japa is the attempt to attract His attention by reciting prayers loudly.
- It is absolutely meaningless.

Respect, affection, sincerity and devotion are attributes of the inner heart and are not to be expressed loudly in the language of flatterers.

Vácanika japa, therefore, serves no purpose. 


2. upáḿshu

However, when a desire for vocal expression of an internal feeling is aroused, the divine touch can be expressed in sweet language in the form of a verse or song, for example in the mantra “Oṋḿ namaste sate sarvalokáshrayáya”. 

Mantras of this type are very good. But they cannot serve the purpose of auto-suggestion of Iishvara prańidhána.

Verses or mantras uttered in such a low tone that they are hardly audible are called upáḿshu japa. 

This is better than vácanika japa. But it cannot be an ideal style of japa. 


3. mánasika

Mental japa is the best process of Iishvara prańidhána. One’s ideation should be expressed mentally. The mind should be its witnessing entity.

If this mental japa is practised regularly and properly after learning the same from a competent teacher, the mind will progress in a particular flow, a forward movement on the path of Pratisaiṋcara of Brahma. 

**The speed of the mind generated by a Sádhaka through Iishvara prańidhána is faster than the mental speed of Brahma by which He is leading His psychic creations towards perfection through the path of Pratisaiṋcara.**

When the mental flow of a spiritual aspirant moves along the introversial phase of Macrocosmic meditation, one’s animative force, having the potentiality of divinity itself, rises above all tendencies – all saḿskáras – and proceeds towards Eternal bliss. 

In this state, the mind is vibrated with Cosmic feeling. 

The unexpressed divine qualities of the higher glands find expression and the resonance of the mind vibrates the nervous system. 

This gives rise to pious expressions in the physical body. 

In the case of those people whose occult feelings are not physically expressed due to causes associated with the nerves, the mental vibrations cause certain radical changes, in the various glands within the body. 

These occult feelings are basically of 8 types:

1. stambha (astounding)
2. kampa (trembling)
3. sveda (sweating)
4. svarabheda (hoarseness of voice)
5. ashru (tears)
6. romáiṋca (horripilation)
7. vaevarńa (change of colour)
8. pralaya (fainting fit)

There are other feelings associated with these major feelings. For examples:
- nrtya (dancing)
- giita (singing)
- viluńt́hana (rolling)
- kroshana (weeping)
- huḿkára (roaring)
- lálásráva (salivating)
- jrmbhańa (yawning)
- lokápekśá tyága (indifference)
- at́t́ahásya (bursting into laughter)
- ghúrńana (whirling)
- hikká (hiccoughing)
- tanumot́ana (relaxation of the physical body)
- diirghashvása (deep breathing)

The probability of such signs is very little in the case of vácanika and upáḿshu japa. 

That expression is very natural in case of those who have learned the correct process of sádhaná. 

These are associated with pleasure, and not with pain of any kind. 

Therefore, those who do not practise sádhaná should not be afraid of these signs.

When such occult symptoms appear, the sádhaka also should not worry in any way. 

In this state, if the sádhakas pay attention to expressing those signs, their progress will be retarded. 

If they suppress these occult feelings, their bháva or ideation itself will be disturbed.

Their minds will become detached from Iishvara prańidhána. 

**You should always remember that Cosmic feeling is above everything else.**

It is unwise to waste time paying attention to the external symptoms of the ideation or bháva.

These occult symptoms disappear as soon as the mind is detached from Cosmic objectivity. 

When sádhakas attain the capability to establish themselves in Cosmic feeling for long periods, those ideations are confined to the mental body only.
- The physical body becomes calm to a great extent.

It is desirable to practise various lessons of sádhaná alone, in a lonely place. But Iishvara prańidhána can be practised both individually and  collectively. 

In collective Iishvara prańidhána, the combined mental efforts work together. This gives rise to the expression of the higher signs in a very short time. 

Therefore, like all other aspects of sádhaná, Iishvara prańidhána should positively be practised alone, in a lonely place.

But in addition, do not miss the opportunity of collective Iishvara prańidhána whenever some of you conveniently meet together. 

**The indomitable mental force aroused as a result of collective Iishvara prańidhána will help you solve any problem, great or small, on this earth.**

It is for this reason that you should always be zealous to attend weekly dharmacakra regularly.

Ánanda Púrńimá 1957, Jamalpur
