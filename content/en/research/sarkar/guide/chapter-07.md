Santośa means the state of mental ease. Santośa, therefore, means a state of proper ease.


Contentment is not at all possible if the individual is running after carnal pleasures like a beast. As a result of extroversial analysis, the objects of enjoyments go on increasing both in number and abstraction and that is why one’s mental flow never gets any rest. 

Under such circumstances how can one attain perfect peace of mind? 


Achieving the desired objects may give one pleasure for an hour or so, but that will not last long. The mind will again run in pursuit of new objects, leaving behind the objects already tasted – the long-cherished objects will lose their importance. This is the rule; this is the law of nature.

Human desire knows no end. Millionaires want to become multimillionaires, because they are not satisfied with their million. Ask the millionaires if they are happy with their money. 

They will say, “Where is the money? I am somehow pulling on.” 

This answer indicates their ignorance of aparigraha. But such feelings have another adverse effect on body and mind. 

Out of excessive fondness for physical or mental pleasures people become mad to earn money and amass wealth. 


As money becomes the be-all and end-all of life, the mind gets crudified.

Constant hankering after money results in negligence of one’s health, and this makes the body unfit. Therefore, santośa sádhaná lies in being contented with the earnings of normal labour, without any undue pressure on the body and mind.

To remain contented, one has to make a special type of mental effort to keep aloof from external allurements.

There are 2 effective methods to detach the mind from tendencies:

1. Auto-suggestion 

This is done by always thinking of thoughts just opposite to the mean tendencies which occupied the mind. This eventually creates a change in one’s nature.


2. Outer-suggestion

This is done by repeatingly conveying to one’s ears, by some external agents, such ideals.



**In the case of santośa sádhaná, the aspirant must always follow auto-suggestion.**

Santośa sádhaná does not imply that you should allow yourself to be exploited or oppressed by someone who takes advantage of your simplicity, and you should tolerate it silently. 

It is by no means proper for you to give up your right of self-preservation or your legitimate dues in life. 

You have to go on fighting with concerted efforts for the establishment of your rights. 

But you must never violate the principle of santośa by wasting your physical and mental energy under the sway of excessive greed.
