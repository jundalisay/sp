Tapah means to practise penance to reach the goal. 

To practise shaoca it is not necessary to undergo physical discomfort to serve humanity.

A donation of 10 rupees brings no physical discomfort for millionaires. It is, therefore, not tapah for them but this gift helps them in practising mental shaoca. 

There must be one and only one purpose behind the practice of penance and that is to shoulder sorrows and miseries of others to make them happy, to free them from grief and to give them comforts.

*Just like shaoca sádhaná, in the practice of tapah there must not be even the least bit of commercial mentality. *


Shudrocita sevá (physical service) in almost all cases relates to tapah.

Therefore, those who are afraid of physical labour or hate the shúdra (labourer) can never become a tápasa. If you serve sick people who are in great pain for hours together to give them needed relief, this is tapah; but if you serve them with the selfish motive of securing their assistance in your bad days, the entire effort of tapah is lost in a moment. Tapah sádhaná is, therefore, to be above selfishness.

As a rule, practice of tapah will lead to mental dilation, and this dilation will certainly help a sádhaka, to a large extent, in practising Iishvara prańidhána. 

The sádhakas of tapah know that the served is Brahma, their cherished goal. They are servants and the service rendered by them is their sádhaná.

The very purpose of tapasyá of those who ready themselves to render service to the served only after consideration of their caste, creed, religion or nationality is defeated, because it is not possible for them to serve with due sincerity with such a lack of large-heartedness.

Those who look upon the served only as an expression of the Cosmos and look after their comforts selflessly develop devotion or love for the Supreme in a short time. 

When love is aroused, and devotional sentiment is expressed, what else remains to be achieved?

What place does knowledge or reasoning occupy in tapah sádhaná? 

This is a very important question. 

Far greater knowledge is required to render service pertaining to tapah than to render service pertaining to shaoca. 

**Tapah devoid of knowledge is bound to be misused.**

The opportunists will misuse your energy by extracting work from you to serve their selfish ends, and at the same time this will deprive the real sufferers of their due services from you.

A rich miser approaches you with a tale of woe and entreats you to give him relief. 

Being moved with pity, if you do what is needed to relieve him of his suffering, the very purpose of tapah will be defeated, as it is without any knowledge or reasoning.

The end result of your service will be that the rich man whom you have served will become more miserly and more selfish and will, in the future, try to deceive in a greater way people who dedicate themselves to the service of humanity.

Secondly, as you will, to some extent, know his inner motive, you will become mentally depressed and you will also develop a hostile attitude towards him.

***Therefore, while following the principle of tapah you should ascertain fully well whether the person you are going to serve, really needs your service. ***

Only then should you engage yourself in service.

In practising tapah you should always give consideration to those who are inferior to you and not to those who are superior. 

Your responsibility is greater for those who are weaker, poorer, less educated, more ignorant and downtrodden than you.

Your responsibility is very little for those who are above your level, who are better off and more powerful than you. Therefore, you will have to ascertain with discrimination where your responsibility lies and to what extent; otherwise all your time, energy and labour employed in tapah will be in vain. 

To banquet the rich is of no use – give food to the starving. 

There is no need to send presents to your superiors – send medicine and food to the sick.

Don’t waste your time in flattering the rich; it will yield no result. Conquer the hearts of the underprivileged by your sympathetic behaviour and accept them in your society.

You cannot attain Brahma by tapah, if it is devoid of discrimination; because in such cases you do not make the proper use of objects. 

Of course it is better to do something than nothing and with this end in view, tapah even without discrimination has some value. It has some psychological benefit. 


Buddha said,

Win the miser by charity,
Win the liar by speaking the truth.

You can definitely influence a miser by your charity, and there is nothing bad in this; but it is not what is understood by the term “tapah”.

There is another peculiarity in tapah. When the activities of human beings are not guided by discrimination, they are goaded by instinct. 

Tapah with discrimination changes the course of action and leads people towards emancipation. Of course, devotion also gives rise to discrimination but such devotion cannot be aroused in those who have not experienced Cosmic bliss.
