Paradravyápaharańo tyágo’steyam.



Not to take possession what belongs to others is asteya. It means non-stealing. Stealing may be of four types:

1. Physical theft of any material object.

Ordinarily those persons who steal material objects are called thieves. But thieves are not only those persons who flee with stolen objects after committing armed robbery.

Whatever is taken in possession by the use of brute physical force, of arms or of strength of intellect, whether it is money or goods, amounts to theft, because behind such actions there is the intention of taking others’ property deceitfully. 

However, acceptance of anything like money, crops, gold, etc., in exchange for money in a proper way is not theft.


2. Psychic theft.

Here you did not take material possession of anything, but you planned it in your mind. This also called theft, because you have mentally stolen. 

Only the fear of law or of adverse criticism prevented you from doing the action physically.


3. Depriving others of their due physically. 

Even if you do not take possession of what belongs to others, but you deprive others of what is their due, you become responsible for their loss. 

This is also stealing.

4. Depriving others of their due mentally. 

If you do not actually deprive anybody of what is justifiably their due, but you plan in your mind to do so, that too amounts to theft.

Some explanation here is necessary regarding the third and fourth types of theft referred to above. You may have seen that many educated people travel by train without purchasing proper tickets. 

They do not directly steal money from the Railway administration, but they deprive the railway administration of its due. 

A little thought will reveal that there is a sort of barter relationship of the passengers and the railway administration and therefore ticketless travel amounts to theft of the type referred to under 3 and 4 above. 

Those who travel by train have obtained the facility from the railway administration. By purchasing tickets they pay for that facility in full and consequently the railway administration cannot be held in high esteem for rendering a social service. 

When the railway is not rendering free services, not to pay one’s travelling fare is theft.

Consider for a moment: what type of person commits such a theft for a few rupees only! 

Often people of the type indulge in all types of tall talks, freely criticize the leaders, and accuse them of corruption and nepotism. 

If their shortcoming is pointed out, they plead “It is difficult to live in the world with such strict morality. Those who run the railway administration in such a manner deserve it – this type of theft is justified.” 

Missionaries or ascetics who convey a divine message, or political leaders with the noble purpose of doing good to the country, are seen to be often indulging in ticketless travel. 

This is a daily occurrence. Bribing government employees to evade income and other taxes, or demanding travelling allowance for a higher class when they actually travel in a lower class, these are all nothing but cheating. 

It is not only theft, it is also pettiness.

All these tendencies to steal are contradictory to the code of asteya. 

In many cases even educated people often act knowingly against the principle of asteya or do not want to accept that petty stealing violates it.

The author was once questioned by an acquaintance who was a Railway employee as to why he had purchased a full ticket for a nephew aged 13 years, when a half ticket might have done (half tickets being permitted up to the age of twelve only).

There are some moralists who do not want to cheat any particular individual, but do not consider anything wrong in cheating the well-to-do or the government. 

Many a shopkeeper would sell adulterated commodities to his customers but entertain his own friends and guests with genuine items. 

It should be remembered that all actions with such a psychological background are against asteya. 

The easiest way of practising asteya, as in the case of all other principles of Yama and Niyama, is auto-suggestion. 

If people, right from the childhood, remember these codes and remind themselves what is correct, they will not go astray when they grow up – even in the midst of temptations – and they will be able to maintain the high standard of thoughts and character.
