Dada Aksayananda tells another story. It is a long story, but this one will have to win the final prize for experiences showing how Baba preplanned everything. 

Dada said: 


In 1979, Ananda Marga purchased a house in Lake Gardens, Calcutta for our Marga Guru Quarters. I was then Baba's second personal assistant. 

I frequently had the chance to talk with Him while performing massage. It was shortly after moving into the new house. 

I was alone with Him when I said

{{< r a="Aksayananda" >}}
Baba, at last there is a house in Calcutta which belongs to us. How would it be if we were to plant the grounds around the building and make a garden on the roof?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
You can do it, but do you know what the result will be? If you plant around the house, the roots of the plants will damage the building's foundation. If you make a roof garden, the roof will be spoiled by water draining out of the flower pots.
{{< /l >}}


We didn't talk for a few minutes. When I looked at His face He seemed to be sleeping. 

Then a thought occurred to me. I started thinking we should get a much larger piece of land than this with a bigger house. 
Then I could make a big garden away from the building. 

There Baba could walk and enjoy the plants and the fresh air. 

"Aksayananda, are you saying anything?" Baba suddenly asked. 

I understood that Baba had been listening to my thoughts, so I replied, "Yes, Baba," and expressed my thoughts to Him. Baba only smiled and kept silent. 

He became reserved and silent for a few minutes. Then Baba closed His eyes for more than ten minutes. I wondered whether 
Baba was angry at me because at first I had told Him that I liked the new 
house, and then had started talking about getting another. 

Quite suddenly, Baba asked me to come near. I went close to His head, but Baba still did not open His eyes. I said, "Yes, Baba." 

He opened His eyes with a loving smile, and placed both His palms on my cheeks. 

"Yes, my son, what you thought may come true some day." He asked me to sit in meditation pose, close my eyes, and keep my mind concentrated in my sixth chakra. He then asked me what I saw. 

I told Baba that I saw a grand house surrounded by beautiful trees  and many plants. He told me to go further and see more. Then I heard the sounds of hundreds of birds and saw that they were flying from tree 
to tree. 

Again Baba asked me to see more. I told Him that I saw Him  walking under the trees on a narrow path. Some Dadas were with Him. 

Baba asked me to go towards the house. 


"What are you seeing now?" 

{{< r a="Aksayananda" >}}
I see that the building has 2 parts, one on the east and one on the west. Also there are a few underground rooms.
{{< /r >}}


Go inside the western room. What do you see there?

{{< r a="Aksayananda" >}}
Baba, there are rooms but no one is there
{{< /r >}}


Go outside and look around.

{{< r a="Aksayananda" >}}
"Baba, I see the rooms in the eastern part of the building." 
{{< /r >}}

Go inside. Now tell me what you see.

{{< r a="Aksayananda" >}}
Baba, there are many Dadas and Didis there. There is a door, but it's closed.
{{< /r >}}


"Open it. What do you see?" 

{{< r a="Aksayananda" >}}
I see You there, Baba, lying on a bed.
{{< /r >}}


"All right. Come out of the room and go upstairs. What do you see?" 

{{< r a="Aksayananda" >}}
Baba, there is a big function going on with many people, and the room is beautifully decorated. Baba, You are sitting there with some other people.
{{< /r >}}


"Can you recognize them?" 

"No, Baba. I have never seen them before." 

"Is anybody else there?" 

"Yes. Two Dadas are doing something. They seem very busy." 

"And what else do you see?" 

"Baba, I see a marriage going on." 

"Can you recognize the bride and groom?" 

"No, Baba." 

"Now come downstairs. What do you see?" 

"A fountain." 

"And now what do you see?" 


"Baba, I see you going up in an elevator," I answered with 
surprise. 

"Go inside again. What do you see now?" "Baba, all the Dadas and Didis are weeping." "Ask them why they are weeping." 
"Baba, I am asking them, but no one is replying. They just raise their 
heads and look at me. No one will answer." 

"Ask them again." 


{{< r a="Aksayananda" >}}
Baba, they are simply weeping, and not replying.
{{< /r >}}

"All right. Come out now. Do you recognize the location of the  house?" 


"It is somewhere in Calcutta, Baba, but not in Lake Gardens." 


Then the demonstration was over. He said, 

"Don't tell anyone about  this just now. Keep it to yourself for now."
