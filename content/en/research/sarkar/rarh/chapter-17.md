The soil of Ráŕh is approximately 30 crore [300m] years old.

The first vibration of life in Ráŕh came at the same time as the first vibration of life on earth.

The atmosphere of Ráŕh reverberated with the sounds made by animals at the same time that the atmosphere of the earth first reverberated with such cries. 

When western Ráŕh was first created, it had no animated world.

 <!-- there, but when the sand and silt carried by the rivers of the undulating western Ráŕh formed the plain lands of eastern Ráŕh, different kinds of flora and fauna appeared there. It is assumed that  -->

Eastern Ráŕh was formed before the appearance of human beings on earth. The fossils that we have found in western Ráŕh lead us to assume that Ráŕh pulsed with the vibration of the animated world at the very dawn of [animate] creation. 

The fossils bear witness that hard-bodied tiny animals moved on the soil of Ráŕh after unicellular tiny animals, and ekadharmii multicellular tiny animals [multicellular tiny animals sharing one characteristic], had come into being. Thereafter came the age of large animals on the earth, and the fossils of Ráŕh are proof of that age also. All of this concerns western Ráŕh. 

It does not seem that an age of large animals ever occurred in eastern Ráŕh. At least no proof is available for that. It is also assumed that if there were lofty mountain ranges in the Ráŕh of that time, between the mountains there were very deep gorges, some of which had a link with the seas.

The whole of northern India and Samatat-D́abák were deep in the seas. This is why fossils of sea animals have been foundn in the mountainous areas of western Ráŕh.

In the past, a short-lived ice age engulfed the world.

The large animals and other living beings of the prehistoric age were frozen to death. We have found in Ráŕh the fossils of animals that had been frozen to death in this way.

But after the ice age, in the post-ice age, when Ráŕh basked in warmth again, various kinds of animals appeared in Ráŕh – because Ráŕh got its heat back within a very short time. 

We can find fossils of lions and lion-type animals, mammoths, monkeys, monkey-type men and ancient human beings of the Ráŕh of this time.

They did not become crippled and die out due to cold, because no ice age followed their emergence in Ráŕh. They probably died from earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. 

Today’s Ráŕh does not fall [geologically] in the volcanic belt. But in those times the volcanic belt probably went along the western end of western Ráŕh, because between those days and today a polar shift has occurred.

Instead of having decomposed naturally, these suddenly-expired animals and men were transformed into hard fossils. We have found samples of all these kinds of fossils.

Samatat, Vauṋgá and Barendrabhúmi had come up from the sea. They were not the habitats of lions, but of large tigers. 

Ráŕh was the habitat of large and medium-sized maned lions. It cannot be said, however, that there were not a small number of tigers in western Ráŕh. (In western Ráŕh, in common parlance, lions are called tigers.) 

- Tigers like damp climates and dense jungles
- Lions like dry weather and less-dense forests

So tigers came via the north-east corner from the direction of China.

But lions are children of the soil of Ráŕh.

As ancient Ráŕh abounded with lions, the word siḿha [lion – “Sinha”] is associated with the names of many a person and many a village. 

Scattered all around in the east of Ranchi District, and all around the Bagmundi, Dalma, Meghasini, Tilabani, Jaychandi and Panchakot hills in the west of Purulia District, and around [the Shushunia Hills], there are heaps of different fossils, known, or unknown, or unrecognized – the fossils of all those lion, mammoth, rhino, monkey and human species.

The small-sized indigenous cows that are found in Ráŕh, besides being small, do not give so much milk. But the milk is very nice-tasting and nice-smelling.

These cows are the descendants of the ancient cow-type forest animals of Ráŕh. 

In the past, the forests in Ráŕh teemed with wolves. 

When the Aryans first tried to enter Ráŕh, the people of Ráŕh, from their side, set their pet lions and wolves on them. 

It forced the Aryans to declare Ráŕh as Páńd́avavarjita [forsaken by the Páńd́avas] or anáryyávartta [not part of Áryyávartta, the land of the Aryans].

As long as King Shashanka was alive, the Aryans were unable to exert a pervasive influence on Ráŕh. 

Of the many reasons for this, one was Ráŕh’s fearful forests. After the death of Shashanka, there was no one with governmental power to save Ráŕh.

So the land-hungry Aryans entered Ráŕh through different waterways and did everything to rob Ráŕh of its freedom, and later on destroyed the priceless asset of Ráŕh, its forest cover.

In the wake of the destruction of the forests came the destruction of Ráŕh’s wildlife and natural beauty. 

Today Ráŕh is no better than a neglected desert. This all happened about 1750 years ago. Since then Ráŕh, bereft of its own rhythm of life, has remained as a colony of Áryyávartta.

Ráŕh has never been recognized as a part of Áryyávartta, but it had to live a life of disgrace under the rule of Áryyávartta.
