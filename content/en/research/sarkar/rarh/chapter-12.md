The culture of the human race is one. But there are variations in the cultural expressions according to changes of time, place and person. These variations in expression are not cultural differences. If all the children in one family have different food habits and speak in different styles, then do they belong to different cultures? Nevertheless we speak much about culture, and we keenly observe cultural advancements and declines. The more introversial the movement of a culture is, the subtler it is.

It cannot be said just what the culture of Ráŕh was like at the dawn of human history. But it is obvious that it could not have been developed, because the movement of the human intellect is from crude to subtle.

If there is anything that is sweet and anything that is worth following in the culture of Ráŕh, it is due to the advent of Lord Sadáshiva. There is neither caste discrimination nor caste division in Shaeva Dharma, so where did the caste discrimination and caste division in today’s Ráŕh come from? Another question may arise here: why do I bring up caste discrimination and caste division while talking about culture? It is because culture cannot move in an appropriate way if caste division, which is the expression of a fissiparous mentality, exists. Hence everything comes within the purview of a discussion on culture.

The Aryans entered India between seven and ten thousand years ago. This was well before the advent of Shiva. The conflict between the pre-Aryan civilization and that of the invading Aryans went on for centuries. Then in the course of time synthesis began to come. This state of synthesis went on for thousands of years and extended up to the Buddhist and Jain ages. The process of give-and-take between the pre-Aryan civilization and the invading Aryan civilization did take place, but not without much bargaining and many a tug-of-war. Of all the defective gifts of the Aryans that the indigenous Indians accepted, one was the system of caste division, which spread hatred between the high and the low.

The Aryan civilization came to a standstill at the threshold of the kingdom of Káshiirájya (Varanasi). Then a lot of strenuous efforts were made in order for Mithila to be accepted in Áryyavartta [Land of the Aryans], or Uttarápath [northern India]. But in the end Magadh did not win this acceptance. The word magadh means “a population which is opposed to the Vedic system”. Maga means “opposed to the Vedas” and dha means “one who abides by”. Ráŕh, which was located on the further [eastern] border of Magadh, had no opportunity to become “sanctified” by the touch of the Aryans’ feet. But just as the system of caste division entered Magadh under the influence of Áryavartta, so also did it enter Ráŕh to some extent. Ráŕh too became segmented into so many castes, but thanks to the firmly-rooted Shaeva Dharma, caste-based hatred could not crystallize in Ráŕh.

That there was casteism in India even before the emergence of Buddhism and Jainism is best proven by the fact that Buddha came from a Kśatriya varńa [here, a sub-caste] belonging to the Malla branch of the Shakya pravara [dynasty]. (His father was a feudal king.) And Vardhaman Mahavir was born in a Vaeshya family of Bideha. His father, Siddhartha, was a businessman. So the caste system did exist in India. This caste system also reached a peak in Magadh in a later period. After the demise of Buddha, the kings – both Buddhists and non-Buddhists – said clearly that since Buddha was a Kśatriya, they were entitled to the ashes from his cremation. But it was not like this in Ráŕh. The caste system was made to grow among the common people in Ráŕh [inhabitants of Ráŕh].

There is no logic behind the contention that the Ráŕhiiya Utkal Brahmans came from outside. To say, based on imaginative stories, that the Brahmans of Ráŕh were outsiders, would not be logical. In clear terms I hereby refute the Kulatantrárńava of the Ráŕhii Brahmans.(1)

But it is true that caste discrimination came to Ráŕh much later. The Paoráńika Dharma of Shankaracharya weighed Ráŕh down and immobilized its social consciousness. It converted the spontaneous flow of life in Ráŕh into a stagnant pool and paved the way for countless weeds to burgeon. The defective mentality and way of life of Paoráńika Dharma became intolerable for people, hence a great number of people in Ráŕh-Samatat-Barendra-D́abák who came in contact with the more humanitarian Islam took shelter in it.

Ráŕh – 13.
The question remains as to the origin of the Utkal Brahmans in Ráŕh. They live in large numbers in the south-west part of Ráŕh. Did lakhs of people, batch after batch, sail across the seven seas and thirteen rivers and settle down in Ráŕh? It is not possible. The fact is different. I have already mentioned that caste division was present in the Buddhist age. But it was not as strict as it had been in the pre-Buddhist age. Many elements were combined together in a confused way. So advocates of Paoráńika Dharma, and their Prayágiiya Bráhmańa Sabhá [Prayag Brahman Conference], accepted and thereafter formally recognized a conglomerate of five branches of North Indian Brahmans, and another conglomerate of South Indian Brahmans, all of them followers of Paoráńika Dharma, in the names Paiṋca Gaoŕii and Paiṋca Drávid́ii(1) respectively. As the Brahmans of Ráŕh represented a more developed culture, they found it hard to accept the dominance of Paoráńika Dharma (which teaches the supremacy of the Vedas, Brahmans, cows and kings). Besides that, there was an unwillingness to study the Vedas that was deep-rooted in their nature. For this reason they did not get the recognition of the Prayag conference. The Brahmans living in that part of Ráŕh which was under the rule of the king of Gaoŕa at that time accepted that non-recognition. But as a mark of their own speciality, they introduced a beautiful social system, the Dáyabhága system, and thus displayed an example of their own originality of thought. But the Brahmans living in those parts of Ráŕh which were not under the rule of the king of Gaoŕa began to call themselves Utkal [Orissa] or post-Utkal Brahmans with a view to getting recognition from the Prayágiiya system. They went on with the old Mitákśará system. So none of them came from outside. Their lifestyle, customs and physical structures – all bear the stamp of Ráŕh.

Does this mean that no Brahmans came from Utkal? No, a good many did come [later]. They were brought for their scholarly capacity. These invited Brahmans called themselves Dákśińátya Vaedika (Southern, or Deccan, Vedics). They follow the Dáyabhága system. Shibnath Shastri, M.N. Ray and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu were all Deccan Vedic. (According to some, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu was Western Vedic.) They live in the districts of Midnapore, Burdwan, Howrah, Hooghly, 24 Parganas, Jessore, etc. Some of them use common surnames such as Chakravorty and Bhattacharya, but some of course use the old Utkal Brahman surnames such as Panigrahi, Panda, Sarangi, Patra, etc.
