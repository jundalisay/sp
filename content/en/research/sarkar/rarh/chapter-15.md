The people of Ráŕh are a mixture of Austric and Negroid.

In eastern Ráŕh there is also some Mongolian influence.

Pure Austric and pure Negroid are not to be found in Ráŕh.

Mongolian blood will not be found in the western part of Ráŕh.

So very fair-complexioned persons are very few in that region. 

The people there are dark-complexioned. 

But due to the Mongolian influence, the people of eastern Ráŕh are a bit fair-complexioned. 

Though the inhabitants of Ráŕh are a mixture of Austric, Negro and Mongolian blood, they are not very flat-nosed. And they are taller than the Austrics. 

The Kurmis and the Mahatos of Ráŕh are medium-sized or short, yet not shorter than the Austrics. 

The people of Midnapore are more or less short, but some are medium-sized, and a few are tall. The Sadgopes of Ráŕh are medium-sized or tall. 

If anybody draws a straight line from Arambag of Hooghly District to the north across Burdwan and Kandi, the people living along that line, especially the Brahmans, the Kayasthas and the Sadgopes, are the tallest of all the people of Ráŕh. 

They have comparatively high-bridged noses and are somewhat fair-complexioned. It was possibly due to the long-time political importance of this region, and its importance in trade and commerce, and the existence of Buddhist and Jain places of pilgrimage, monasteries, etc., that the Aryan outsiders’ blood entered in, and brought about these changes.

But the people who live along that line are not the most long-lived. Those who have the longest lifespan in Ráŕh are the Kayasthas of Bankura and Manbhum. 

They are also tall and have high noses, but they are not as fair-complexioned as those who live along the line of Arambag, Burdwan and Kandi.
