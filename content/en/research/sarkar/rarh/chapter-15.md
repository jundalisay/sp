The People of Ráŕh

The people of Ráŕh are a mixture mainly of two races, Austric and Negroid. In eastern Ráŕh there is also some Mongolian influence. Pure Austric and pure Negroid are not to be found in Ráŕh; but Mongolian blood will not be found in the western part of Ráŕh. So very fair-complexioned persons are very few in that region. The people there are dark-complexioned. But due to the Mongolian influence, the people of eastern Ráŕh are a bit fair-complexioned. Though the inhabitants of Ráŕh are a mixture of Austric, Negro and Mongolian blood, they are not very flat-nosed. And they are taller than the Austrics. The Kurmis and the Mahatos of Ráŕh are medium-sized or short, yet not shorter than the Austrics. The people of Midnapore are more or less short, but some are medium-sized, and a few are tall. The Sadgopes of Ráŕh are medium-sized or tall. If anybody draws a straight line from Arambag of Hooghly District to the north across Burdwan and Kandi, the people living along that line, especially the Brahmans, the Kayasthas and the Sadgopes, are the tallest of all the people of Ráŕh. They have comparatively high-bridged noses and are somewhat fair-complexioned. It was possibly due to the long-time political importance of this region, and its importance in trade and commerce, and the existence of Buddhist and Jain places of pilgrimage, monasteries, etc., that the Aryan outsiders’ blood entered in, and brought about these changes. But the people who live along that line are not the most long-lived. Those who have the longest lifespan in Ráŕh are the Kayasthas of Bankura and Manbhum. They are also tall and have high noses, but they are not as fair-complexioned as those who live along the line of Arambag, Burdwan and Kandi.


Ráŕh – 16.
When the Puranic religion came to Ráŕh it did not come alone, it brought with it incalculable social ulcers and social ills.

After the first Aryan migrations to India, caste divisions overtook Ráŕh just as they did other parts of India. I have mentioned this before. Although caste divisions entered in, there was no caste discrimination; there was not even any social bar to inter-caste marriages. But when the kings of Ráŕh embraced the Puranic religion, they imposed an inflexible system of caste discrimination with the help of orthodox Brahmans and Kayasthas. Ráŕh, which was not a restrictive caste-oriented society, could not accept this completely. As a result, there was a lot of social chaos. It became difficult for the people to categorize the many castes that arose from the social intermingling of Brahmans and non-Brahmans.

When a particular wrong is decreed, one has to continuously support a chain of wrongs. Similarly, in promulgating one falsehood, a chain of falsehoods is created. So when this unnatural system of caste distinctions was adopted, other theories supporting this sort of discrimination needed to be invented. At this juncture,(1) Raghunandan came and attempted to solve the problem. Being unable to trace the complicated lines of descent underlying the caste divisions, he gave his decision that Ráŕh should not follow the four-caste system of India, rather it should recognize a two-tier system of Vipra and Shúdra.

The common people accepted this divisive social system out of fear of the kings who supported the Puranic religion (though mentally they did not accept it). The system of one-month purification [in mourning or as a penance], which had once applied only to Shúdras, was imposed on 95% of the people of Ráŕh [all non-Vipras had become classified as Shúdras]. This two-caste system developed by Raghunandan did no good to Ráŕh, rather it harmed the society enormously. It also brought down the curse of the kuliina [nobility] system on Ráŕh.

The kuliina system was introduced among the Brahmans, Kayasthas and Vaidyas who blindly supported the Puranic religion. The intention was to keep those Brahmans, Kayasthas and Vaidyas recently converted from Jainism and Buddhism under the control of the orthodox Puranic Brahmans, Kayasthas and Vaidyas.(2) It was proclaimed that a girl of a kuliina [noble] family must marry into another kuliina family, otherwise the kuliina status [of her family] would be lost. If, on the contrary, shrotriya Brahmans married their daughters to kuliina boys, their social status would increase. (In the Brahman social hierarchy the shrotriyas were non-kuliina, and in the Kayastha social hierarchy the maoliks were non-kuliina.) The result was that a kuliina Brahman or Kayastha could marry a hundred or more girls. Their numbers increased by leaps and bounds. The numbers of followers of the Puranic religion also increased by leaps and bounds, and the numbers of shrotriyas and maoliks considerably decreased. No one wished to marry their daughters into non-kuliina families. As another result, the influence of Buddhism and Jainism substantially waned. But quantitative growth does not necessarily lead to qualitative growth. Social vices overtook the society due to the rampant polygamy among the kuliinas and its opposite among the non-kuliinas.

During the Pathan rule,(3) the prime minister of Bengal, Gopinath Basu, introduced a new system to save the Kayastha community from this vicious atmosphere. The eldest son of a Kayastha family must marry a kuliina girl [though the other sons were not required to do so]. But the Brahman community did not accept this system.

Since as a result of the kuliina system, one section of society had a lot of marriages and the other few, society suffered a lot of degeneration and deterioration. Later on, Devibar Ghatak of Ráŕh introduced melbandhan (in Barendra it is known as pat́ibandhan) so that conversion to another religion or surrender to social vices might stop,(4) and society might be saved from degeneration and distortion. Melbandhan meant the creation of groups made up of people having similar defects or virtues. This allowed them to remain within the [Hindu] society. In a community of people having similar qualities, no one could ostracize others. No doubt the Brahmans saved their skin through this system, but they could not maintain their honour.

The social degeneration that resulted from the imposition of the Puranic religion in Ráŕh caused a simmering discontent in the minds of the people. The harmful effects of this became clearly visible after a few hundred years, particularly during the Pathan rule and during the days of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. These disgruntled people embraced either Islam or the Gaoŕiiya Vaishnavism propagated by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. In the Buddhist-influenced parts of Bengal, the people converted to Islam in large numbers long before the birth of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Those who did not convert to Islam embraced Gaoŕiiya Vaishnavism, especially in western Ráŕh where the influence of Jainism was greater. Both internal and external differences between Jainism and Islam are great. For this reason the people of western Ráŕh did not readily accept Islam. On the contrary, they accepted Gaoŕiiya Vaishnavism in overwhelming numbers. For the differences in practical life between Jainism and Vaishnavism were minimal, whatever the philosophical differences may have been.

We can find traces of the above-mentioned suppressed anger in the Shúnya Puráńa by Ramai Pandit.

The Puranic religion weighed heavily on Ráŕh, like an immovable stone. It struck a heavy blow at the roots of sama-samája tattva, the principle of social equality, the invaluable asset of Ráŕh, and threw it deep into the darkest dungeon. One of the main factors responsible for the present backwardness of Ráŕh, especially western Ráŕh, is the Puranic religion that was forcibly imposed on it.

Ráŕh – 17. Animals of Ráŕh

The soil of Ráŕh is approximately thirty crore years old. It can be assumed that the first vibration of life in Ráŕh came at the same time as the first vibration of life on earth. The atmosphere of Ráŕh reverberated with the sounds made by animals at the same time that the atmosphere of the earth first reverberated with such cries. When western Ráŕh was first created, there was no animated world there, but when the sand and silt carried by the rivers of the undulating western Ráŕh formed the plain lands of eastern Ráŕh, different kinds of flora and fauna appeared there. It is assumed that eastern Ráŕh was formed before the appearance of human beings on earth. The fossils that we have found in western Ráŕh lead us to assume that Ráŕh pulsed with the vibration of the animated world at the very dawn of [animate] creation. The fossils bear witness that hard-bodied tiny animals moved on the soil of Ráŕh after unicellular tiny animals, and ekadharmii multicellular tiny animals [multicellular tiny animals sharing one characteristic], had come into being. Thereafter came the age of large animals on the earth, and the fossils of Ráŕh are proof of that age also. All of this concerns western Ráŕh. It does not seem that an age of large animals ever occurred in eastern Ráŕh. At least no proof is available for that. It is also assumed that if there were lofty mountain ranges in the Ráŕh of that time, between the mountains there were very deep gorges, some of which had a link with the seas. We should remember that the whole of northern India and Samatat-D́abák were deep in the seas, and that for this reason we have found fossils of sea animals in the mountainous areas of western Ráŕh.

In the past a short-lived ice age engulfed the world. Ráŕh was not excepted. It is assumed that the large animals and other living beings of the prehistoric age were frozen to death for want of heat. We have found in Ráŕh the fossils of animals that had been frozen to death in this way. But after the ice age, in the post-ice age, when Ráŕh basked in warmth again, various kinds of animals appeared in Ráŕh – because Ráŕh got its heat back within a very short time. We can find fossils of lions and lion-type animals, mammoths, monkeys, monkey-type men and ancient human beings of the Ráŕh of this time. They did not become crippled and die out due to cold, because no ice age followed their emergence in Ráŕh. They probably died from earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Today’s Ráŕh does not fall [geologically] in the volcanic belt. But in those times the volcanic belt probably went along the western end of western Ráŕh, because between those days and today a polar shift has occurred. Instead of having decomposed naturally, these suddenly-expired animals and men were transformed into hard fossils. We have found samples of all these kinds of fossils.

I have said before and will say again now that Samatat, Vauṋgá and Barendrabhúmi, which had come up from the sea, were not the habitats of lions, but of large tigers. And Ráŕh was the habitat of large and medium-sized maned lions. It cannot be said, however, that there were not a small number of tigers in western Ráŕh. (In western Ráŕh, in common parlance, lions are called tigers.) Tigers like damp climates and dense jungles, while lions like dry weather and less-dense forests. So it is assumed that tigers came via the north-east corner from the direction of China; but lions came to Ráŕh from no direction; lions are children of the soil of Ráŕh. As ancient Ráŕh abounded with lions, the word siḿha [lion – “Sinha”] is associated with the names of many a person and many a village. Scattered all around in the east of Ranchi District, and all around the Bagmundi, Dalma, Meghasini, Tilabani, Jaychandi and Panchakot hills in the west of Purulia District, and around [the Shushunia Hills], there are heaps of different fossils, known, or unknown, or unrecognized – the fossils of all those lion, mammoth, rhino, monkey and human species.

The small-sized indigenous cows that are found in Ráŕh, besides being small, do not give so much milk; but the milk is very nice-tasting and nice-smelling. These cows are the descendants of the ancient cow-type forest animals of Ráŕh. Once upon a time the forests in Ráŕh teemed with wolves. The traditional story goes that when the Aryans first tried to enter Ráŕh, the people of Ráŕh, from their side, set their pet lions and wolves on them. It forced the Aryans to declare Ráŕh as Páńd́avavarjita [forsaken by the Páńd́avas] or anáryyávartta [not part of Áryyávartta, the land of the Aryans]. As long as King Shashanka was alive, the Aryans were unable to exert a pervasive influence on Ráŕh. Of the many reasons for this, one was Ráŕh’s fearful forests. After the death of Shashanka, there was no one with governmental power to save Ráŕh. So the land-hungry Aryans entered Ráŕh through different waterways and did everything to rob Ráŕh of its freedom, and later on destroyed the priceless asset of Ráŕh, its forest cover. In the wake of the destruction of the forests came the destruction of Ráŕh’s wildlife and natural beauty. Today Ráŕh is no better than a neglected desert. This all happened about 1750 years ago. Since then Ráŕh, bereft of its own rhythm of life, has remained as a colony of Áryyávartta. Ráŕh has never been recognized as a part of Áryyávartta, but it had to live a life of disgrace under the rule of Áryyávartta.

Ráŕh – 18.

The surface of Ráŕh slopes from the west and the northwest towards the east and the southeast. The courses of the rivers are the same. All the rivers from the Bansh River in the north to the Suvarnarekha in the extreme south follow the same pattern. These east-flowing rivers formed eastern Ráŕh and Samatat, and the silt and sand of these rivers, together with the silt and sand of the Gauṋgá and the Brahmaputra, formed Barendrabhumi and D́abák. The Kansai and the Keleghai-Suvarnarekha formed the south and the south-east of Midnapore District and the southernmost part of Samatat. Where the Damodar Valley, the Kangsavati Valley and the Suvarnarekha Valley come in closest proximity in the western extremity of Ráŕh, there are some hills (in ancient times mountains) which are the principal watersheds of Ráŕh.

The cultural evaluation of these rivers of Ráŕh will be dealt with later. Let me now speak of their power to create fertility.

In the rock formations of Ráŕh we find all varieties of rock. For example, 1) ancient hard (granitic) rock – this provides us with gold, silver, copper, mercury, mica, manganese, etc.; 2) igneous rock – this provides us quartz and other rocks of certain special kinds; 3) ancient sedimentary rock and mrta prastar [dead rock] – this provides us coal, and sand of high quality. Presumably in the past diamonds were available in small quantities, since in the regions rich in coal, many a village bears the name Hirapur [“a place where diamonds are available”]. The Damodar, the biggest river in Ráŕh, flowed down the course of a kind of rock, and on either bank there was in ancient times a dense forest, thick with tall trees. Those forests underwent gradual changes for a long time and have now turned into coal. In Ráŕh, coal is colloquially called áḿgár (aḿgár in Sanskrit). There is no dearth of villages bearing the name Áḿgárd́ihi in Ráŕh.

There being profuse coal beneath the riverbed, the river is known as Dámodar (dám + udar). In the Sanskrit language dám means “fire”. The river which has dám in its udar [belly], or fire, is the Dámodar.

There is also some coal in the Ajay Valley. We should remember that the existence of this coal depends on the extent of a special kind of rock on the bank of the river. Another noteworthy thing is that the coal-fields are situated in western Ráŕh, as the river-valleys there have an accumulation of coal. Not even one coal-field is to be found in eastern Ráŕh. Western Ráŕh is old, so are its forests. So coal is to be found there. Eastern Ráŕh emerged from under the sea; so in eastern Ráŕh there were no forests to be transformed into coal. However, in all the regions of eastern Ráŕh which were the site of sargasso seas, mineral oil may be available. In ancient times, this abundance of minerals in western Ráŕh helped very much in its economic and social development.

Let me come also to another matter. While the wealth of western Ráŕh is under the ground, the wealth of eastern Ráŕh is above the ground. Land as fertile as that of Burdwan, Hooghly and Howrah [Districts], and East Midnapore and Kandi Sub-divisions, is rare in the world. This is so because of the ancient and medieval sedimentary rock, rich in calcium and other minerals, in the upstream parts of the Damodar and other rivers of Ráŕh. And however much silt and sand carried by the rivers may fall on the surface of the land, in almost all cases there is sticky soil, able to hold water, a little below the surface.

The hills of today in the watershed regions of western Ráŕh, such as Dalma, Bagmundi, Tilabani, Panchakot, Shushunia and Jaychandi, were once lofty mountains. Their melting snow nourished the rivers of Ráŕh. The foothills were covered with dense forests. Because of the high mountains and the forests, rainfall was plentiful in Ráŕh. The rivers were navigable. Because of the forested tablelands on either side of the rivers, soil erosion was little. Ships used to navigate these rivers – not only in ancient times, but also in the middle ages. Not long ago the farmers cultivating their land in the valleys of the Damodar and Mayurakshi could retrieve masts from under the earth. Due to river currents washing over different types of rocks, even today sand (silica) of various qualities is found underground in eastern Ráŕh.

It will be a mistake if one thinks that the resources of western Ráŕh lie under the surface only. The surface soil of western Ráŕh is red (laterite) soil. In the Austric language, Ráŕh, or Ráŕho, means a land of red soil; such a land is called láti in Chinese and riŕi in Greek. This red soil is not completely barren. With a little effort, in this soil of western Ráŕh rich in calcium (rocky lime and powdered limestone), apples, pears, mandarin oranges, papayas, guavas, grapes, custard-apples, etc., of good quality can be produced in large quantities. Also efforts can be made to create orchards, and to cultivate three strains of paddy (áush [early paddy], áman [autumn paddy] and boro [late paddy]) in a single year, by introducing different kinds of irrigation (small-scale river irrigation, pond-water irrigation and lift irrigation). It is needless to say much about eastern Ráŕh as it has all potential for good agriculture.

It is interesting to know that shál [Shorea robusta], piyáshál (piyál) [Mimosa odoratassima], hijal [Barringtonia acutangula], palásh [Butea monosperma], ashok [Saraca asoca], kusum [lac tree], garjan [a forest tree], kuŕcii [Holarrhena antidysenterica], bakul [Spanish cherry, Minusops elangi], belphul [Jasminium sambae], kundaphul [Jasminium malabaricum], kút́araj [a medicinal tree], nágeshvar chánpá [a kind of magnolia], nágkeshar (nágchánpá or diighalchánpá) [Mesua ferraca], shvet padma [white lotus], jám [Eugenia jambolana Lam.], kánt́ál [jackfruit], kendu (small gáb [small mangosteen]), arjuna [Terminalia arjuna], krśńabat́ [black banyan, Ficus benghalensis krishnae], jahurii chánpá [a kind of magnolia], etc., all originated in Ráŕh.

Ráŕh – 19. Language, Literature and Culture of Ráŕh

As ancient Ráŕh is our main subject matter, before we begin to discuss the language of Ráŕh, we should say something about the origin of language. Though the inhabitants of Ráŕh are a mixed race of Austric and Negro (and in a few cases Mongolian), there is an abundance of Sanskrit words in the language of Ráŕh. The language is replete with tatsama words [Sanskrit words used in unchanged form in the Bengali language], bhagnatatsama words [Sanskrit words used in changed form in Bengali language], tadbhava words [Bengali words derived from Sanskrit root but used in a corrupted form in the Bengali language] and semi-tadbhava words [Bengali words derived from Sanskrit root but corrupted to the point of their roots being unrecognizable]. About ninety-two percent of the words are directly or indirectly related to the Sanskrit language. Ráŕh is situated in the extreme east of India. If Sanskrit were a foreign language and if it were thought to have come into India across its north-west border, then how could so many Sanskrit words have entered the colloquial language of the remote outpost Ráŕh? It will not, therefore, be out of place to guess that Sanskrit had almost no relation with the influx of the Aryans, nor is Sanskrit of foreign origin.

The language in which the Vedic scriptures were composed was not Sanskrit; hence it is called the Vedic language. There is a heaven-and-hell difference between Sanskrit and Vedic. What many people say, that the Prákrta language is a metamorphosed form of this Vedic language, is true to some extent. Some parts of Prákrta are purely a popular form of Sanskrit, and other parts are a popular form of a mixture of Sanskrit and Vedic.

A language survives for approximately one thousand years on the average. Were Prákrta [entirely] a metamorphosed form of the ancient Vedic language, by now it would have veered so greatly from that Vedic that the trail of its lineage would have been lost. Instead of regarding Sanskrit as the changed form of Vedic, we shall have to search for the origin of Prákrta.

The few foreign words found in ancient Bengali literature did not come to Ráŕh either leaping or limping on horseback across the soil of the Áryyávarta. Those words came by river through foreign trade with Ráŕh. We received words such as kágaj [paper], vanát [velvet], palte [wick], adálat [court of law], káchári [office], and rajju [rope] in this way. I said earlier that the Mayurakshi, Ajay, Damodar, Dwarakeshwar, Rupnarayan, Kangsavati and Suvarnarekha rivers of Ráŕh were navigable even a few hundred years ago. Ships navigated them, foreign trade went on. The principal exports of Ráŕh were shál wood, fine rice, silk, tasar [cloth of non-mulberry silk], scented articles, fine cloth (Vishnupuri muslin, dhúpcháyá saris made in Burdwan), sugar, copper, etc. It could be assumed that along with this export trade, the import of a few items would go on in a natural way. So on river-bank sites in Ráŕh and the regions of Bagri near Ráŕh we find earthenware from Egypt and drinking vessels from China. No wonder if some foreign words came in as well! An ancient port of Ráŕh engaged (lipta) mainly in the export of copper (támra) was called Támralipta (now Tamluk). In the past, copper was abundantly available in Támákhun of Puncha [Block], in the Manbhum area of Ráŕh [Purulia District and adjoining areas]. Following the destruction of the ancient port of Támralipta, another port was built in Ráŕh – Saptagram in the district of Hooghly.

There are seven metamorphosed forms of Sanskrit, that is, seven Prákrta languages. (Prákrta means “related to the populace”.) They are 1) Mágadhii Prákrta of eastern India, 2) Shaorasenii Prákrta of mid-northern India, 3) Paeshácii Prákrta of north-western India, 4) Páshcatya [Western] Prákrta of extreme northwestern India, 5) Saendhavii Prákrta of the Sindhu Delta, 6) Málavii Prákrta of mid-western India and (7) Maháráśt́rii Prákrta of south-western India.

In connection with Ráŕh, the subject of Mágadhii Prákrta needs further elaboration. Mágadhii Prákrta has two daughters: a) Púrvii [Eastern] Ardha-Mágadhii and b) Pashcimii [Western] Ardha-Mágadhii. Púrvii Ardha-Mágadhii in turn has six daughters, and Pashcimii Ardha-Mágadhii four daughters. The six daughters of Púrvii Ardha-Mágadhii are i) Maethilii, ii) Angika, iii) Báḿlá [Bengali], iv) Assamese, v) Oriya and vi) Koshali. The four daughters of Pashcimii Ardha-Mágadhii are i) Magahi, ii) Bhojpuri, iii) Nagpuri (Sadani) and (iv) Chattrishgarhi. Of them, though Nagpuri has come from Pashcimii Ardha-Mágadhii, Báḿlá and Koshali have had a tremendous influence on it. And though Koshali has come from Púrvii Ardha-Mágadhii, Nagpuri and Chattrishgarhi, which have come from Pashcimii Ardha-Mágadhii, have had a tremendous influence on it. Chattrishgarhi comes from Pashcimii Ardha-Mágadhii, yet it has been greatly influenced by Koshali, from Púrvii Ardha-Mágadhii, and the Váŕárii language (Vidarbha) of Maharashtra Prákrta.

Chattrishgarhi is such a remote language of Mágadhii that the languages of Shaorasenii Prákrta did not have any influence on it. Chattrishgarhi does not show change in gender of a verb in consonance with change in gender of the subject in nominative case, which is one of the many characteristics of the Shaorasenii language. But though Maethilii has come from Mágadhii, it does show, in some cases, change in gender of a verb in consonance with change in gender in nominative case (only in the present perfect tense, such as Rám geláh [“Ram has gone”], Siitá geliih [“Sita has gone”]). Such changes are more frequent in Bhojpuri. For example, Rám karatá, Siitá karatiiyá). This is so because Shaorasenii Prákrta is geographically close to Bhojpuri.

Bengali, which has come from Púrvii Ardha-Mágadhii, is the language of Ráŕh. Within this Bengali language there are twelve main dialects. Some of the dialects are so big that they include more than one sub-dialect within them. The twelve dialects are:

1) Mid-Ráŕhii Báḿlá:

a) Birbhum District, except for Nalhati and Murari
b) Kandi Subdivision
c) Dumka, Jámtuŕá and Deoghar Subdivisions of Santal Parganas District

e) Dhanbad District (up to Pareshnath Hill in the west)
f) Purulia District
g) some parts of Giridih District
h) the eastern part of Ranchi District, – Silli, Sonahatu, Bundu and Tamáŕ
i) the north-eastern part of Singhbhum District
j) Midnapur District except for the Contai area
k) Bankura District except for the Indás police station

Within this dialect there are numerous sub-dialects. Two of the many characteristics of this dialect are: i) the use of the second [objective] case-ending if destination is meant, for example, Mui ghare áchi [“I am at home”], but Mui gharke yábu [“I shall go home”], ii) the use of the suffix ek in the first person of a transitive verb, for example, dilek [“I/We shall deliver”], dibek [“I/We shall give”], basibek [“I/We shall sit”], habek [“I/We shall be”].

[As we can see,] Bengali has a number of sub-dialects. The above list [also] tells us that five dialects or so, some primary and some secondary, are prevalent in Ráŕh. Today every dialect of Bengali has a natural tendency towards literary Bengali. And within a short time, no dialect will be prevalent among the people. So all the folk-rhymes and folk-songs of the different dialects should be collected and preserved without delay. Otherwise, there will be no trace of them within another fifty years.

Bengali pronunciation: Every language has some specialities of pronunciation. The dialects of Ráŕh as well as the [other dialects of the] Bengali language have a host of specialities in pronunciation. These specialities more or less follow the Yajurvedic system. Unlike “a” in the English alphabet, which has twenty-one different pronunciations, a [the first letter of all Indo-Aryan alphabets] is pronounced mainly in three ways in India: 1) saḿvrta [short], 2) vivrta [long] and 3) tiryak [extended]. When a is pronounced according to the saḿvrta system, it sounds like “au” in the English word “authentic”. When a is pronounced according to the vivrta system, it sounds somewhat like “u” in the English word “but”. And when a is pronounced according to the tiryak system, it sounds somewhat like “o” in the English word “origin”. In the Bengali language the saḿvrta and tiryak pronunciations of a are in use, while the vivrta is not in use.

The pronunciation of ণ [cerebral ńa] in Bengali is according to the Yajurvedic rule – নঁ [dental na with dot and crescent to indicate nasalization]. It is not like the Rgvedic ঢ়ঁ [ŕha with dot and crescent to indicate nasalization]. In Bengali the pronunciations of antahstha ব [the semi-vowel va] and vargiiya ৰ [ba belonging to a particular varga, or group of consonants, namely the labial group] are the same. In Bengali, regarding the pronunciations of antahstha য [the semi-vowel ya] and antahstha য় [the semi-vowel ya occurring in the middle of a word], Padánte padamadhyasthe ya-kár “ia” ucyate, that is, “If the letter comes at the beginning of a word, it is pronounced somewhat like vargiiya জ [ja belonging to a particular varga, or group of consonants, namely the palatal group] (it is pronounced like a soft version of vargiiya ja), but if it is in the middle or at the end, it is pronounced ia.” ড় and ঢ় [ŕa and ŕha in the middle of a word] follow the same rule as does য়. As regards two of the other semi-vowel letters, র [ra] and ব [va] (ua) the difference between their semi-vowel and non-semi-vowel versions has been lost.(2) In Bengali the semi-vowel ল [la] has no pronunciation of ল় [lra]. In Bengali dental স [sa] has almost no [separate] pronunciation. In most cases, the pronunciation of tálavya শ [palatal sha] is used. Múrdhanya ষ [cerebral śa] has no separate pronunciation, but in accordance with the Yajurvedic rule, if this ষ follows ক [ka], it is pronounced like ক্ষ [kśa – an aspirated “k” sound]. In Assamese and Punjabi, however, múrdhanya ষ is pronounced in all cases like múrdhanya খ [cerebral kha – খ being used here for purposes of illustration].

As regards the pronunciations of mahápráń [letters – i.e., emphatic letters] and hiinapráń [letters – i.e., mild letters] in the Bengali language, mahápráń has not been given much importance. In fact, except for the Sher Shahvadiya dialect, in no dialect do we find full pronunciation of mahápráń [letters]. In Chattal and some other dialects, the pronunciation of mahápráń is almost negligible. In the pronunciation of words of the Kolkata dialect, the mahápráń pronunciation is given fully only at the beginning of the words: for example, chele [“boy”], d́háká [covered], jháláno [soldering], thálá [plate] dhámá [a basket made of rattan], etc. If such letters are in or at the end of words, they are converted into the respective hiinapráń: for example, mách (mác) [fish], májh (máj) [middle], kathá (katá) [word], sádh (sád) [desire], etc.

Full pronunciation and pronunciation with hasanta [consonantal mark]: For the most part all letters in the Bengali language are fully pronounced. There are, however, some exceptions, such as Shiva (Shiv), Ráma (Rám), rúpa (rúp), etc. The rules which govern such pronunciations are roughly as follows:

1) The consonants are fully pronounced if they are at the beginning of, or in the middle of, words, but if they are at the end of words, they are pronounced with consonantal mark; for example, rúpa becomes rúp, but rúpaváńii will not be pronounced as rúpváńii, as pa is no longer at the end of the word, it has now come inside the word. So its pronunciation will be rúp-a-váńii. Shiva will be Shiv, but Shivarám will be Shiv-a-rám, Shivaprasád will be Shiva-a-prasád.

2) In the case of a conjunct letter, it will be fully pronounced; pronunciation with hasanta [consonantal mark] is not acceptable – for example, Kanishka (not Kanishk), Devadatta (not Devadat), Vaedya (not Vaed), etc.

3) Even if the letter is not a conjunct, its pronunciation will be full, should there be a suffix like kta in krdanta or ta in taddhitartha;(3) for example, sammata [“agreed”] (not sammat), grhiita [“accepted”] (not grhiit), sthagita [“postponed”] (not sthagit), álocita [“discussed”] (not álocit), diirgháyata [“prolonged”] (not diirgháyat), etc. It is a pity that very often incorrect pronunciations such as sthagit, ápyáyit, etc., are heard on radio and television. This creates confusion among students. The lack of knowledge of Bengali phonetics is the cause of this kind of defective pronunciation.

4) Even in the absence of suffixes such as kta and ta, non-[conjuncts] will be fully pronounced if the letter concerned is preceded by anusvára (ং [aḿ]), visarga (ঃ [ah]), the sign for ঐ [ae] or the sign for ঔ [ao], for example, Kaḿsa (not Kaḿs), vaḿsha [“lineage, pedigree”] (not vaḿsh), siḿha [“lion”] (not siḿ), duhkha [“woe”] (not dukh), nihsva [“penniless”] (not nis), Jaena [“Jain”] (not Jaen), gaońa [“inconsequential”] (not gaoń), saodha [“mansion”] (not saodh), etc. Moreover, where as a consequence of metamorphosis vowels are used in place of consonants in Sanskrit, it is desirable to use i and u (respectively) instead of ae and ao even if there is no difference so far as pronunciation is concerned. (I have not mentioned ঈ [ii] and ঊ [ú], as they are not pronounced in Bengali.) Dadhi → dahi → dai (dai, not dae [though the pronunciation would be the same – dai indicates that a vowel has replaced a consonant]), badhú → bahu → bau (bau, not bao), madhu → mahu → mau (mau, not mao).

5) Words which are created with the suffix d́a will be pronounced fully; for example, jalada [“rain-cloud”] (not jalad), varada [“one who gives a boon”] (not varad), Amitábha (not Amitábh), drutaga [“someone or something that goes fast”] (not drutag), etc.

Ráŕh – 20. The Script of Ráŕh

The metamorphosed form of the ancient Bráhmii script is the Shriiharśa script. It was named Shriiharśa after King Harshavardhan, since a seal in his handwriting that was discovered, was written in this script. This Shriiharśa script was the script of the whole of eastern India (Allahabad and the regions to the east). Manipuri (Mithei and Viśeńpurii), Assamese, Bengali, Maethilii and the like are written in this script, though with local variations, of course. Languages such as Angika, Magahi, Bhojpuri, Nagpuri and Chattrishgarhi also use this script. But those people’s mother tongues having been suppressed for a long time, their mother script is unfamiliar to them. The script of Oriya also is this Shriiharśa script. The characters in the Shriiharśa script are basically angular. In Orissa it was the custom to write on palmyra leaves with an iron kitchen implement, but writing the angular characters in this way with that iron implement, the palmyra leaves were likely to be damaged. Thus the practice was introduced of avoiding angles and writing in a circular way. Hence the present Oriya script is nothing but the Shriiharśa script, avoiding angles.

As Shriiharśa is one of the ancient scripts of India, Sanskrit has been written in this script since ancient times, and most ancient books in Sanskrit were written in this script. The Devanagari script came much later. The deed of gift written in the Sanskrit language by King Chandravarma of Shushunia Hill, Ráŕh, was written in Shriiharśa script, and that Shushuniyá script is the most ancient example of Bengali script.(1) From this perspective, Shushunia Hill may be regarded by scholars and litterateurs as a sort of tiirtha [sacred place]. Such inscriptions carved in stone in ancient Bengali script are available in Jaida of Singhbhum District and Chiyada of Bankura District. If searches are carried out, such will be found in many more places. Some think that Devanagari is the script of Sanskrit, but this idea is totally wrong. Sanskrit has no script of its own. The Shriiharśa script is much older than Devanagari, and it facilitates swift writing (as one can write for a long time without raising one’s hand).

(1) The Shushuniyá script is 1100 years old. In 1984, a few years after writing the above, the author himself discovered some older scripts at Bhula-Pavanpur village under Patamda Police Station, Bangurdá village under Kamalpur Police Station, and at Jaida village under Chandil Police Station, all within East Singhbhum and Seraikela Districts. The author opined that these scripts must date back 1700 years or more, clearly indicating that they are older than the Shushunia script. The author named this script Dálmá script, because the river basins where they were available (as mentioned above) are surrounded by the Dálmá Hills in western Ráŕh.
