The Gaoŕádya Vedics are inhabitants of Ráŕh.

The middle-class Brahmans, composed of the Ráŕhiiya Brahmans and Ráŕhiiya Utkal Brahmans, and the Maharashtrian Brahmans who had come from outside, live in the southern region of Ráŕh.

They call themselves Madhya Deshiiya Ráŕhii Brahmans. 

There is nothing wrong with this [with their calling themselves Ráŕhii].

The Kayasthas of western Ráŕh are very few.

From this one might assume that the Kayasthas came from outside. But in eastern Ráŕh and adjoining Bagri (Kandi, Katwa, Kalna, Kulingram, Konnagar, Kolkata, Krishnanagar, Jessore, Baghhati, Baghanchra, Akna, Mahinagar and Jyotsiram), the Kayasthas are very many in number. 

Is it probable that such a large number of Kayasthas came from outside? 

Rather, the Kayasthas in the whole of Ráŕh and also in adjoining Bagri call themselves Ráŕhiiya Kayasthas. 

In other words, they have completely identified themselves with the red soil of Ráŕh. Now, there is a tradition that Shashanka, the king of Ráŕh, unified all the small Kayastha leaders in his battle against Buddhism. 

And let us judge whether it is believable that Vijaysingha conquered Lanka with the help of his Kayastha followers.

In the Buddhist age, the Kayasthas lived in Ráŕh. Their domination also was immense.

Many used to write, while introducing themselves, Sadbaoddha-Karańa-Káyastha-T́hakkur [surnames of Kayasthas in the Pali language]. 

The Buddhist and the Jain ages were really different expressions, according to changes of place and person, of the same age. 

So the Kayasthas were certainly there in Ráŕh during the Jain age. Since they were there in the Jain-Buddhist age, it can easily be supposed that they had been there even in the pre-Jain-Buddhist age. 

So according to their psychology and also from a historical standpoint, the Kayasthas are originally sons of the soil of Ráŕh. 

Maybe a handful of Kayasthas who followed Paoráńika Dharma came or were brought to Ráŕh from outside to assist the Brahmans in imposing Paoráńika Dharma on Ráŕh like a jagaddal stone [a kind of immovable stone].

But the idea that all the Kayasthas of Ráŕh have come from outside is absolutely untenable. Those who came from outside were probably honoured as kuliina Káyasthas [Kayasthas of noble descent].

The rest were denied that honour due to their relationship with Buddhism or Jainism. They are known everywhere as maolik [original] or ancient Bengalees.

A considerable number of Ráŕhii Kayasthas migrated from the Singur and Haripal regions of Hooghly District in the south of Ráŕh and settled in Samatat across the Bhagirathi, and also in Vauṋga-D́abák further east. 

It is they who are the kuliinas [of noble descent] of those areas, and not those who had been living there previously. King Shashanka did unify the strength of the Kayasthas.

Vijaysingha, accompanied by his followers, conquered Singhal [Sri Lanka] and Kerala in c. 534 BCE.

The Singhalese became Buddhists. But Buddhism did not get firmly established in Kerala.

The progeny of the followers of Vijaysingha still live in Kerala. They are known as the Kerala Kayasthas (Nairs).

They use surnames such as Nair, Menon, Kaimal, Panikkar, etc. Their customs, lifestyle, facial appearance, everything, resemble those of the Ráŕhii Kayasthas. 

Therefore it seems that Vijaysingha, in association with his Kayastha followers, may possibly have done something like this. But in conclusion I will mention that whatever I have said about Shashanka and Vijaysingha is more speculative than based on concrete information.
