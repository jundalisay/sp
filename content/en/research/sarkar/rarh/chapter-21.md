Sáhitya means all those [literary] manifestations of the human minds that always move along the path of welfare [hita], that are associated with [with = sa] welfare. Hitena saha ityarthe sáhitya, that is, sáhitya is a reflection of social movement on the mirror of welfare. The basic idea of sáhitya is not simply to give joy to people, since crude enjoyment can sometimes be presented through [popular] songs and folk-rhymes, but such compositions are not of the category of sáhitya. [And] there are some [popular] songs, folk-rhymes and other verbal expressions that fail to lead one along the path of hita [welfare], but at the same time do not add to the burden of ahita [troubles]. Such compositions may be accepted as folk tales and folk songs, but they can never be accepted as classical sáhitya.

It cannot be said emphatically that there can be no literature in the absence of civilization. But the diamond splendour of literature bursts out in all its radiance and captures people’s attention only when it is associated with civilization. No doubt the radiant literature of Ráŕh came only after civilization had dawned. When on that long-ago morning in the remote past the golden light of civilization fell on the bosom of Ráŕh and diffused in all directions, the simple, open faces of the young men of Ráŕh in that bright dawn broke out in smiles; the flower-bedecked hair buns of the young women of Ráŕh tossed to the rhythm of a dance; and the rhythm of that dance spread amid the intoxicating fragrance of the mahul-tree groves; and the radiant literature of Ráŕh was born.

The ancient folk tales and folk songs of Ráŕh are now extinct, as that language is now extinct. But perhaps that oldest of compositions, the Sáḿkhya philosophy of Kapil (from Jhalda) can be included within the classical literature. Presumably the language of Ráŕh at that time was the earliest form of Mágadhii Prákrta. Rather than writing in that language, Kapil wrote in the classical language of that time, Sanskrit. And much later, Maharshi Patanjali (of Patun village of Burdwan) also wrote his Yoga Sútram, or Seshvarsáḿkhya, in the classical language, Sanskrit, and not in the then-prevalent Púrvii Ardha-Mágadhii. In a still later age (the Sen dynasty), Jaydev, a poet of Ráŕh, composed his Giitagovindam in Sanskrit, and not in the spoken language of that time (an ancient form of modern Bengali). But as one age gave way to the next, the spoken language gradually came to attain the status of a classical language. For this reason, Jaydev’s Sanskrit is not classical Sanskrit in the true sense of the term, but rather Bengali with the Sanskrit anusvára and visarga endings [aḿ and ah].

It is to be noted that what both Kapil and Patanjali composed was philosophical literature. The joys and sorrows and hopes and desires of the common people have not been reflected in their works. Jaydev’s Giitagovindam is a devotional scripture. It is not a mirror of the common people either. Thus it is not difficult to understand that the literature of Ráŕh which was concerned with the life of the common people was handed down verbally, and did not attain the status of book form. Of the ancient books that first began to sparkle like rubies and emeralds with the joy and sorrow and tears and smile of the populace, Shriikrśńakiirtana, by Barhu Chandidas (of Chatna of Bankura) deserves special mention.(1)

People’s tastes go on changing in accordance with changes in time, place and person. There is no good reason to think that people’s judgement will become subtler and more introversial simply with the onward march of time. Just as we find instances of subtler feelings in ancient literature, so we find a profusion of crude taste and extroversial mentality in ultra-modern literature. In the Shriikrśńakiirtana we find an assortment of the various tastes of that age. So some parts of this book can be considered classical literature, some parts can be considered folk songs, and some parts, if tested on the touchstone of literature, are merely fool’s gold. In the compositions of Dwija Chandidas (from Nanur village of Birbhum), characteristic human psychology, with its sometimes inward, sometimes outward, perspective, has been given more importance than the joys and sorrows of the common people.

Ráŕh – 22. Mauṋgalkávya and Vaeśńavkávya
The golden age of the Mauṋgalkávya(1) came in Ráŕh. Though the main theme of the Mauṋgalkávya was to establish certain deities – non-scriptural deities, Buddhist deities, Jain deities and Paoráńika deities – in society, in doing so the poets have depicted the joys and sorrows of the common people. Kavikankan Mukundaram (from Damunya of Burdwan) sketched a picture of the life of the distressed Ráŕh of his time in his Phullarár Váramasyá [“Twelve Months in the Life of Phullará”]. In order to show how the deities of the Mauṋgalkávya wreaked havoc on those at whom they became angry, the poets have depicted in words the life of that distressed Ráŕh.

In the post-Buddhist era, under the rule of the Paoráńika cult, no poet dared to express the kinds of tortures that were meted out to followers of Buddhism and Jainism. But when Islam arose, the Buddhist poets, experiencing the joy of heaving a free sigh, sang a song of liberation through their Mauṋgalkávya; that is, they opened their hearts. In Shúnyapuráńa, by Ramai Pandit, in Niraiṋjaner Ruśmá, and in Dharmamauṋgal by Ghanaram Chakravorty (Burdwan), etc., a clear picture has been presented of all this.

The age of Vaishnavite literature [Vaeśńavkávya] ran almost parallel with – sometimes a little ahead of, sometimes a little behind – the age of the Mauṋgalkávya. I am not speaking of Baul here since it is more verbal than written; whereas Vaishnavite literature, through writing, portrayal and oral expression has made itself exquisitely charming. The main theme of Vaishnavite literature is to define the relationship between the limited and the limitless. So wherever Vaishnavite literature has delved a little bit into one’s inner feeling, it has become delicately sweet, unparalleled in its soothing beauty. Since long before the advent of Mahaprabhu Chaitanyadev, Vaeśńava literature had been surging across Ráŕh. Jaydev, Barhu Chandidas, Dwija Chandidas, Dina Chandidas, Lochandas Thakur, Brindavandas Thakur, Naraharidas Thakur, Govindadas Thakur, Gyanadas Thakur – all were sons of Ráŕh, representatives of the aesthetic flow of Ráŕh. The deepest melody of Ráŕh reverberates on the ektárá [single-stringed instrument] of Baul. It was in this way that Vaishnavite padávalii [verses] and mahájaniiya kiirtanas originated. (Those who are great sádhakas and composers of Vaeśńava literature are called mahájanas [great souls].) This kind of Vaeśńava mystic literature is unparalleled in this world. This literature has added heretofore-unseen verdure to the almost treeless Ráŕh. Much later, Rabindranath too, sitting on the soil of Ráŕh, created unique cadence on the ektárá of Baul. Now the question is, from where did Ráŕh get this unprecedented literary wealth and incomparable treasury of art?

Ráŕh – 23.

Everything has a point of origin, a source; nothing is without a source. [The waves that cause] all feelings and sensations, crude, subtle or causal, start from some source and proceed towards the infinite. From the very moment a feeling or sensation originates, it begins to stir the human mind and to make the soul surge with bliss. The farther it [the wave] travels from the source, the less power it has to stir and to saturate with bliss. Lord Sadáshiva, the central figure of universal humanity, appeared around 7500 years ago. It is not that He sat in just one particular place and created ideational waves; riding on his yak, He travelled all over the world and propagated the keynote of humanism. Though the keynote of this humanism has Parama Puruśa as its goal, this movement towards Parama Puruśa is multi-staged, is prolonged in manifold directions, and experiences myriad flows of sweetness, before it reaches its single goal.

For their survival, human beings have to make constant efforts (sádhaná) not only in body but also in mind and spirit. And the seed of escaping the monotony of existence has to be kept embedded in their constant onward march itself. Without that, life becomes unbearable. The subtler pulsations of humanity are the means to keep human life enlivened with this aesthetic flow. Those subtler pulsations contain within them literature, art and various sweeter and sweeter humanistic and spiritual expressions. This was what beloved Shiva gave to the world.

Shiva appeared after the influx of the Aryans into India. During that conflict-ridden period, Shiva was ekamevádvitiiyam [“one without a second”] – the singular ideal of humanity. If the highly-aesthetic expressions of Ráŕh are anything to go by, it will not be wrong to say that the soil of Ráŕh was blessed by Shiva’s holy footsteps. And it was from this starting-point that Ráŕh assimilated all subtle and aesthetic manifestations of humanism and then diffused them into every atom of the air, the sky and every pulsation of existence. A poet says:

Tomár parash chaŕáye rekhecha
Bhúloke dyuloke goloke
Sattár prati palake;

[You have spread your touch in all places
In human and divine worlds, in paradise
Everywhere, in every blink of existence.]

Herein lies the superiority of Ráŕh – the virtuosity of Ráŕh’s vitality.
