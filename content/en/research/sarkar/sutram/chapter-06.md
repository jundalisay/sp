<!-- CHAPTER 1 -->

1. Brahma is the composite of Shiva and Shakti

<!-- Shivashaktyátmakaḿ Brahma. -->

Shiva = Puruśa, Cosmic Consciousness, literally “in whom all things lie”

Shakti = Prakrti, Cosmic Operative Principle, literally “ability to create something”

átmakaḿ = composite of; 

Brahma = Supreme Entity (from brhat, meaning “great”)


1-2 Shaktih Sá Shivasya Shaktih.

Shaktih = Operative Principle, Cosmic Force, Prakrti; Sá = She, Prakrti; Shivasya (6th case) = of Shiva

[Shakti (the Operative Principle) is the shakti (force) of Shiva.]

1-3 Tayoh siddhih saiṋcare pratisaiṋcare ca.

tayoh (6th case) = of the two

siddhih = proof, fulfilment

saiṋcare (7th case) = in saiṋcara. saiṋcara = literally “proper movement”, the extroversive phase of creation from subtle to crude: sam (proper) – car (to go) + ghaiṋ (suffix)

pratisaiṋcare (7th case) = in the introversive phase of creation from crude to subtle: prati = reverse, counter; ca = and

[Puruśa and Prakrti find their fulfilment in saiṋcara (extroversial movement) and pratisaiṋcara (introversial movement.]


### 1-4 Paramashivah Puruśottamah vishvasya kendram.

Parama = Supreme

Shivah = Consciousness

Puruśottamah = literally “Highest Consciousness”, name for Cosmic Consciousness in the nucleus of creation; vishvasya (6th case) = of the universe; kendram = nucleus

[Supreme Consciousness at the nucleus of the universe is known as Paramashiva or Puruśottama.]


### 1-5 Pravrttimukhii saiṋcarah guńadháráyám.

pravrtti = desire, movement towards crudeness

mukhii = towards

saiṋcarah = “proper movement”; guńa = binding principles, attributes, qualities; dháráyám (7th case) = in the flow

[Saiṋcara (in the Cosmic Cycle) is the gradual extroversial movement under the increasing influence of the guńas (binding principles).]


### 1-6 Nivrttimukhii pratisaiṋcarah guńávakśayeńa.

nivrttimukhii = movement towards decreasing desire: ni (lack of) – vrtti (desire) + mukhii (towards)

pratisaiṋcarah = centripetal movement towards the Cosmic Nucleus; guńa = binding principles; avakśayeńa (3rd case) = by means of the waning

[Pratisaiṋcara (in the Cosmic Cycle) is the gradual introversial movement under the waning influence of the guńas.]


### 1-7 Drk Puruśah darshanaḿ Shaktishca.

drk = witness; Puruśa = Cosmic Consciousness; darshanaḿ = act of seeing; Shaktishca = and Shakti

[Puruśa is the substantiator, the ultimate witness; (the actional faculty of) Prakrti is the act of witnessing (and that which is witnessed).]


### 1-8 Guńabandhanena guńábhivyaktih.

guńa = binding principles

bandhanena (3rd case) = by the binding or bondage

guńa = quality; abhi = well, complete; vyaktih = expression, manifestation

[As the guńas increase their bondage, they express themselves fully in the emergence of the fundamental factors.]


### 1-9 Guńádhikye jad́asphot́ah bhútasámyábhávát.

guńa = bondage, binding principles

adhikye (7th case) = excess

jad́a = solid factor, crude physicality; sphot́a = bursting, due to excess external pressure; bhúta = literally “created object”, one of the five fundamental factors; sámya = balance; abhávát (5th case) = from the absence of

[Due to excessive pressure of the guńas, proper balance among the bhútas (five fundamental factors) is lost and jad́asphot́a (explosion of matter) occurs.]


### 1-10 Guńaprabhávena bhútasaungharśádbalam.

guńa = binding principles; prabhávena (3rd case) = by means of the influence; bhúta = created object, fundamental factor; saungharśát (5th case) = from clash; balam = energy

[Due to the increasing influence of the guńas, clash occurs among the fundamental factors and bala (energy) is produced.]

1-11 Dehakendrikáńi parińámabhútáńi baláni práńáh.

deha = body, structure; kendrikáńi (adj.) = centripetal or interial movement; parińámabhútáńi (adj.) = resultant in the objects; baláni = forces; práńáh (pl.) = vital energies, the collective name for many forces

[The resultant interial force forming the nucleus within the physical structure and maintaining its solidarity, is called práńáh (vital energy).]

1-12 Due to excessive clash, some crude matter is pulverized, and cittáńu (ectoplasmic particles), or mind-stuff, is evolved.

**Tiivrasaungharśeńa cúrńiibhútáni jad́áni cittáńu mánasadhátuh vá.**

tiivra = excessive; saungharśeńa (3rd case) = by means of clash; cúrńiibhútáni = pulverized in the objects; jad́áni (pl.) = crude factors; cittáńu = ectoplasmic particles: citta (mental objectivity) +anu (small particle); mánasa = mind; dhátuh = substance, elements; vá = or


### 1-13 Through the combination of ectoplasmic particles in the unit structure, the feeling of citta (objective mind) evolves.

**Vyaśt́idehe cittáńusamaváyena cittabodhah.**

vyaśt́i = individual, unit; dehe (7th case) = in the structure; cittáńu = ectoplasmic particle; samaváyena (3rd) = by means of combination; bodhah = feeling, sense


### 1-14 As the influence of the guńas wanes and rajoguńa becomes dominant, the aham (sense of doership) evolves out of the citta.

Cittát guńávakśaye rajoguńaprábalye aham. cittát (5th case) = from citta; avakśaye = in the waning; rajoguńa = mutative force; prábalye = in the dominance; aham = sense of doership, doer “I”, or owner “I”
