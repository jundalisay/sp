I was also helpless before my nature. But how was I to ignore it? Baba gave me
the heart and mentality of a king and means of a beggar. Now how to bring balance
between these two? Baba had correctly written that this was the cause of my painful
career.

Now I am in the evening of my life and when I look back I find that at every
stage I have passed through great economic problems. It appears that the rest of my
life will also he spent amidst economic problems by Baba’s grace. Why should it not be
so? Baba has said in his message that “suffering is your asset'’. 

Although I remember
Baba very much when I am in trouble, but when troubles came in succession, whether
they are regarding material, mental or spiritual matters, they do drag the mind in
crudeness. This makes one uncivilized, hard, pessimistic and angry. My prayer it that
Baba may protect me from this crudity.

In Mithilii the beautiful poetry of the poet Vidyapati is very popular and the
following song of his is sung by all with great emotion when one is passing through
dark days of life:

“Kakhan haraba dukho mor he bholanath?”
O Lord Shiva, when will you remove my sufferings?
Now in the evening of my life
I recite this song with every beat
Of my heart before Baba
Oh Lord take away the
Crudity of my mind.
I know none else except you.
I surrender to you.

Spiritualist may take pity on my condition! But those engrossed in the world will
never understand my condition. Struggle is Sadhana. Therefore, though in poverty, I
began to make efforts to somehow meet with my difficult situations. The only support
was the blessings received from Baba in his letter. Whenever I felt disturbed I would
reread the letters received from Baba. This would give me some cordage and I would
again plunge into work.

Thus, by the month of September all the problems of the new place were sorted
out. Now, I was feeling restless there in the absence of the atmosphere of Marga.
Therefore, one evening while alone began to pray to Baba that my work there was over
and now let me be transferred to a place where I can get Margii atmosphere. I would
be able to forget my worries amidst Margii brothers.


### POSTED BACK TO MUZAFFARPUR

Baba heard my ardent prayer and I was surprised when the next day at 4 p.m.
in the afternoon, my superior officer from Patna told me on the telephone that another
officer was being posted at Dalmianagar, and he wanted to know whether I would like
to be posted back to Muzaffarpur. 

He communicated my desire to my boss and within 2 days orders came for my transfer to Muzaffarpur: I reached Muzaffarpur in the first week of October.

<!-- Great is the Lord, and great are His ways of giving Grace. First the web of
problems would torture the mind and then his kindness would bring peace and
tranquillity Great is my Baba that he gives the taste of the bitter and the sweet in such
harmonious succession. -->

Even after coming to Muzaffarpur, my family problems continued but I was in
the midst of Margii brothers and atmosphere, therefore my mind continued to flow
towards spirituality. Even so hard realities would sometime strike me harshly. In such astate of mind, I once thought that I should take this matter of my reversion to a court of
law. My well-wishers in the department also had the same viewpoint. The problem was
that those who were junior to me once, had become my bosses and it was hard to keep
contact with them. It was to their credit that they respected me, even so I felt very much
my own degradation. This was due to my human weakness.

Now it appeared to me as if I had submitted to injustice and therefore I began to
curse myself for it. When I consulted my well-wishers in the department I would think of
challenging them in a court of law. But at this time that portion of my mind that was
under the influence of vidya and was devoted to the lotus feet of Baba, felt determined
as to why should I not consult Baba in this regard and then proceed further accordingly.
I therefore, wrote a letter to Baba on this subject in the month of November and began
to wait for his instructions. 

Soon came Baba’s reply like this:

GURU
STRICTLY PRIVATE
Jamalpur 26.11.56


Nagina,

Do not file any suit. Just obey the orders of your departmental
authorities and acquire experience from the circumstances created thereby. This
experience will be of immense value, more valuable then the post of
superintendent. At that time you will realise that such a course was not at all an
act of surrender before injustice – it is what may be correctly defined as to bow
down for lighting the weapon.
Anandamurti 26.11.56

After receiving this letter from Baba I tried that I should forget this sorrowful
chapter of life altogether although it took lot of time to do so. I was always conscious
that I may drive out the memory of this event from my memory and that is what
happened after sometime through Baba’s Grace.
