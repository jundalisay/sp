<!-- On winter evening, I was enjoying Baba's talk while sitting on the tiger's grave.

Baba suddenly said:

l a="Baba" >}}
Let us go, Nagina. Today I want to return home somewhat early. There is pain in my mother's neck. I have to rub warm oil to her neck. This will remove the pain. If we delay, I won't be able to do this.
/l >}} -->


<!-- Then Baba immediately stood up to leave. I was also surprised as to why Baba was in a hurry to return.

In my contact with Him for 1.5 years, this was the first time when Baba returned earlier than usual time. I asked hom why. -->

<!-- could not suppress my curiosity and asked what emergency disturbed His daily routine and compelled Him to return early. -->

<!-- I was moved to hear this, and to see His devotion to His mother. He who controls the whole universe, who Himself is the supreme doctor, also cares for His mother's health! This was a great lesson for a person like me who was not conscious of
my duties.

Winter was not yet over, when  -->

One evening I reached Baba's residence to do my pranam.

I found that another gentleman of my department was also waiting outside.

He informed me that he was to be initiated that day. 

<!-- I felt very happy at this. After some time when the door opened,  -->

I went in after doing pranam. I told Baba that a gentleman was waiting outside for diiksa.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Send him in and you wait outside. After initiation, we shall go for a walk.
{{< /l >}}


I came out and sent that gentleman in and as I was waiting outside, I heard Baba saying in a loud voice:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
"Be normal. Be normal."
{{< /l >}}

In between I could also hear the voice of that gentleman. He was calling out, "God!” Sometimes he would say, "Oh Krsna, Oh God." 

Sometimes he would say, "Jai Guru” (Victory to the Guru”).

I heard Baba's repeated instructions to him to be normal.

After initiation, that gentleman came out and said to me:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
Have you seen God face to face? Baba is God Himself, He is my Supreme Father.
{{< /r >}}

He was in an ecstasy and absorbed in God. He was not fully conscious of his body.

Meanwhile Baba called me in. He said, 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Take care of him. He became abnormal just touching my feet. With great difficulty I have been able to give him his mantra. I am coming in a minute. We will go for a walk.
{{< /l >}}

I came out and began talking to that gentleman. When Baba came out, he pointed towards Baba and said in Bengali:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
He is my Baba, my Supreme Father! Are you my Father, Baba?
{{< /r >}}

Baba said, "Yes, I am your Baba."

Then Baba asked me whether I could take him to the field for a walk. I agreed.

But after supporting him for some distance, I realized that he did not need support; he had to be carried along. 

Although his legs were on the ground, but the burden of his whole body was on my shoulders.

In the field, when Baba sat on the tiger’s grave, this gentleman sat close to Him on His right side. 

For some time, he was silent then he asked Baba:

{{< r a="Man" >}}
Will you do me a favour?
{{< /r >}}


Baba replied "Yes, certainly."

As Baba said this, he put his head on Baba's lap and lay down. Baba began to rub his back and arm. Sometimes Baba was also massaging his arms. 

Seeing this, I also began to massage his legs and feet. He removed his head from Baba's lap only when it was time for Baba to return. 

Thus, for about 1.5 hours, he received Baba's sweet love in His lap. Baba was also keeping him on his lap as if a child was sleeping there, and was rubbing his body gently. 

I will never forget this experience of witnessing Baba's divine love. Blessed is that gentleman also. 

How pure must his previous life's karma be, that in the first darshan itself he had God realization on Baba and was getting such affection from Him. 

On return, Baba said, "Nagina, take him with you and look after his needs."

I asked, "Baba, will he be able to travel today?”

Baba said, "Yes."

I took him along to Bindeshwariji’s house, and after taking care of everything, I took him to the railway station and saw him off.

Many times after that when he came for Baba's darshan, that gentleman would become abnormal. 

In that condition he would normally say, “Hare Ram Hare Krishna”, and then would become quiet again.

I once asked Baba, “Why does he speak like this in Your presence?”

Baba gently smiled and said, "He sees me sometimes as Rama and sometimes as Krishna and so speaks like this."

One day, while the man was crying and was in ecstasy, Baba asked me:

"Nagina, do you recall that chapter of Bhagavad Giita where Arjuna says, ‘My body perspires and trembles. My mouth is dry, my hair stands on end due to overwhelming bliss’?

I said, "Yes, Baba."

Baba said, "This is the state of this sadhaka."
