Doing these days my second appeal was rejected in April so I felt very sad.

<!-- I do not know why I did not feel such pain even when I was first demoted or when my first appeal was rejected. -->

So I wrote to Baba asking whether the samskaras were so strong that guru and God were both helpless before their power.

Why do people forget the guru and God and give more importance to karma and samskaras?

<!-- Kindly do not allow so much
importance to gain ground, otherwise humanity will repeat its mistakes again.  -->

<!-- Baba sent me a reply, which is highly educative, and encouraging and which redressed my
mental torture: -->

Baba replied:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Samskaras cannot be stronger than Cosmic Consciousness. When unit consciousness start its march towards the Supreme Self – the Cosmic Consciousness, it advances through fight against avidya and bhoga of its prarabdha. Its march is the march of a solider undaunted and unbaffled. It gets the final rest when crowned with victory – the feeling of oneness with Him, earned by the heroic spirit both in the inner and outer, spheres of life “ Anandamurti 27.4.56

After reading Baba’s letter I again became active and optimistic and became involved in my job and in my work of the Marga. A few days after the receipt of this letter, Baba’s Ananda Vanii for the Ananda Purnima of 1956 also came which said: 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Every sadhaka (aspirant) is a soldier. The symbols of their progress are the hurts received from thorns by the march on the difficult path. Their victory is the collective welfare of the world.

<!-- It is not easy to grasp fully the significance of Revered Baba’s messages. Even
so I give below what I understood of the above message. -->

<!-- The life of a sadhaka like that of a soldier is really full of difficulties and pains.
Sadhana is a process to rise above pains and pleasure. Therefore a good Sadhaka
alone can be a good soldier. The soldier of a sadhaka advances smilingly on the most
difficult terrain as he fights against all types of odds. Difficulties are only signposts of
his success and are good indications of his progress. A good soldier is always thinking
of the collective welfare and with this object in view, he advances further. Surely
success will come to such a soldier. This message of Baba encouraged all the
sadhakas immensely. Without courage neither a soldier nor a sadhaka can progress
forward.  -->

By the middle of 1956, immorality was on the increase, hence this message of Baba’s not only encouraged sadhakas to lead a moral life, but also gave them strength to fight immorality. Baba’s message was timely.


### My Posting To Dalmianagar

After a few days, my contacts with Margii brothers became less and less. I was transferred to Dalmianagar in the first week of June. 

There the problems were so constant that I was busy in tackling them.

In this new place, my wife’s health deteriorated further. Now and then, I had to rush to Patna with her. I had informed Baba about this through a letter.

<!-- Even so, now and then I did manage to take some time for Marga work. But success in this work at this time was negligible. There were so many problems that I wrote to Baba that I was thinking to ask for a transfer and asked for His advice.

There came a message from  -->

His message said that I have to correct the whole situation from that place.

I said I would not take any decisive step so long as the department does not fix a definite policy for Dalmianagar. 

It was under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent at Gaya who was very simple Margii and was very scared of the atmosphere at Dalmianagar. 

Officers of my department regarded Dalmianagar as a black hole in those days, which would darken my reputation.

Anyway, keeping Baba foremost in my thoughts, I started my work. Meanwhile, our department head thought of visiting the city on tour, and he gave me five minutes to discuss the situation of Dalmianagar at a meeting at eight in the morning. I reached the Circuit House of Gaya at the appointed time.

<!-- At eight I presented myself before my head. I remembered Baba and began to talk about the administration at Dalmianagar. I had only mentioned a few things and my five minutes were over and therefore I stopped. When my boss enquired as to why I had stopped, I pointed out that my time was over. He asked me to resume.

Again I remembered Baba. During this discussion, when some messenger entered from
another officer, my boss felt very annoyed. 

There were others waiting for consultation, but he did not heed this. Even so, it was good of my boss that he started to agree with me. That day, five minutes extended into five hours. My discussion with this boss for such a long time was a mater of wonder. My departmental colleagues or even very senior officers used to get hardly ten minutes with him. 

All this was possible only
through Baba’s grace. At the end of the discussion, my boss enquired about my
personal well being. 

I told him that he had put me from frying pan into the fire and now are enquiring about my welfare. I was happy at Muzaffarpur and he transferred me within 6 months to Dalmianagar. 

He said that the chaos there forced him to put me to this inconvenience. Then he enquired as to how be could help me now?

I said, “ Excuse me Sir, I do not rely on help from man. Man himself is miserable. What help can be one man render to another man?”

As I said this be got up from his chair and embraced me and said, “ I wish I could have this much mental strength in me”. -->

We were discussing matters in English I have therefore recorded his words as such. He told me that at one time, he had also been initiated into Ananda Marga but be could not do sadhana properly. 

I advised him to meet has acarya again After his return from Gaya, whenever my departmental head would see a report from some senior officer, he would ask what is the report on Nagina on this subject? And after seeing my views, he would reject others and agree with me.

Now I was asked to attend a conference connected with Dalmianagar, on behalf of my department. Everyone was wondering as to what Nagina has done to him in these five hours that he would reject every ones’ views and accent mine. Just within a few months of our meeting, this gentlemen sought retirement. I was all along feeling that Baba was helping me at every step and where my intellect failed he gave me new ideas was it not the grace of Baba that I could continue discussion with this temperamental and snobbish man for five hours.

My days continued to pass in this manner so I tried to solve the departmental problems there. Meanwhile my economic condition continued to deteriorate due to the illness of my wife. 

I had no other recourse except to inform Baba about my personal problems. Baba's letter was as follows:

“Dear Nagina, 
The reason of your mental agonies and family trouble is that you are careless in money matters. You should therefore give more stress to aparigraha. Think a thousand times before you spend a single pie”.

With my love to you
Your well-wisher
Anandamurti

I was very much worried to read Baba’s letter was true to the last syllable. But
would it be possible for me to follow the spirit of these instructions?
