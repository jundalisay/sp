The second chamber of knowledge is the objective mind.

The third chamber or factor  is the subjective mind. 
- The fundamental entity behind this faculty of knowledge is the Supreme Subject. 

This entity is the noumenal factor behind each and every action.
- But it does nothing by itself. 

Everything takes place because of His presence. 
- His presence is an obligatory prerequisite for everything. 

It can be compared to the catalyst in a scientific experiment. 
- The catalytic agent itself has no direct role.
- But its presence makes the whole process work very smoothly.
- Thus, it is a great help.

While preparing makaradhvaja (a special Indian áyurvaedik medicine), gold is added. 
- Gold is not mixed directly with the makaradhvaja, but its presence in the process is essential. 

Similarly, behind the action of knowing or the function of the objective and subjective minds, there is the presence of the Supreme Subjectivity.
- This makes all things work smoothly and lets everything happen. 

This Entity can neither be called the subjectivated mind, nor the objectivated mind.
- He is only a distinguishing presence.

He is lik the head of a family celebrating marriage. 
- He does not do anything specific.
- He neither cooks, distributes the food, nor does anything.

Yet he is still the central figure, the supreme guide of the whole celebration.

He oversees, supervises and directs everyone and everything everywhere.
- He sits silently on a chair in one corner of the house. 

Apparently he is inactive.

But it is his commanding presence alone which keeps all the participants in the celebration alert. 

Those people who are allotted specific duties carry them out to satisfy the head of the house. 

Likewise, the Supreme Entity is also the Supreme Subject.

The subjectivated mind:
- is the witnessing counterpart of the objectivated mind
- may take its object both from the external physical world and the internal psychic world. 
- may create an object within itself
- can convert its own subject into an object. 

For example, you see a real elephant.

Your objective mind takes its form, and your subjective mind witnesses it. 

This is one aspect. 

Later, when the real elephant is gone, you can turn a portion of your mind into an elephant by visualizing that imaginary elephant and argue within yourself: 

“Well, the trunk is all right but one of the tusks seems to be a little small, I’ll make them the same length.” 

<!-- And so you make the smaller one a little larger. All this is done within the mind. -->

<!-- “The other day Rambabu said so many unpleasant things to me. I should have spoken back, but instead I kept silent, swallowing the insults. In future, if I meet him again, and the same unpleasant thing happens, I’ll give him a piece of my mind.” 

Here, one becomes as one perceives. -->

Suppose you visit your aunt. Afterwards, she told you not to visit. In your mind you say to the mental image of your aunt: 

{{< l a="You" >}}
I shall not visit you any more.
{{< /l >}}

 <!-- and at the time of departure she did not request you to visit her again.  -->

{{< r a="Aunt" >}}
Why?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="You" >}}
I shall not go to your place.
{{< /l >}}



These words are said mentally to the aunt of your mental creation. 

But the real aunt remains far away, completely ignorant of what you are thinking.


Can the unit subjective mind ever know or think of the Supreme Subjectivity? 



In the world of humans we notice that those people participating in a celebration, or in-charges having specific duties, never sit idly looking towards the Supreme, the Supreme Subjectivity. 

If those to whom special roles have been allotted do not act properly, the Supreme Head will be displeased. 

He will be all the more displeased if you sit idly, looking towards Him with a vacant expression. 

If you tell Him, flatteringly, “How kind you are, how merciful! How fine you look in your gorgeous apparels and ornaments!” 

He will say in reply, “Stop this silly nonsense.” 

It is most improper to treat the Supreme Subjectivity in this way.


<!-- Now, let us discuss this from the psychological point of view.  -->

The subjective mind is the objective mind’s subjective counterpart.
- The objective mind is the “known” 
  - This is the unit subjectivity
- The subjective mind the “knower”
  - This is the Supreme Subjectivity


The peacock looks at the snake.
- The peacock is the subject.
- The snake the object.

The snake looks at the frog.
- The snake is the subject.
- The frog the object. 

The frog watches the mosquito. 
- The frog is the subject.
- The mosquito the object.

The mosquito looks at the dew-drop.
- The mosquito is the subject.
- The dew-drop the object. 

But:
- the snake is not aware that it is being watched by peacock
- the frog is not aware that it is being watched by snake
- the mosquito is not aware that it is being watched by frog

<!-- The peacock is not aware that it is being watched by the fowler. -->

<!-- The fowler is the subject, the peacock the object.  -->

The usual practice is for **nobody to look at the subject**

 <!-- Had people chosen to look at the subject, everything would be in proper order. -->

Everything takes place within the mental arena of the Supreme Subjectivity. 

The objective counterpart, too, is within the Cosmic Mind. 

In other words, all the objectivities of the world together are the object of the Supreme Subjectivity.
