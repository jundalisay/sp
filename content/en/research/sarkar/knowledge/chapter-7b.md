What is this? What is this? 

“It is a flower.” 

Light waves come from the flower and touch your eyes. A similar flower is created in your mind.

Actually, you are not seeing the flower. You are seeing the mental image of the flower within. 

**You never see anything, you never hear anything, you never even touch anything.** 

When you see something or touch something, the corresponding sympathetic vibration is created within your mind. 

At that time, you feel that you:
- are seeing the flower
- hear some song
- are touching something hot or cold.

**In fact, you never come in physical contact with anything.** 

Your contact with everything is through your:
- mind
- nerve fibres
- nerve cells
- objective mind. 

When you feel, you see an internal projection with the help of your nerves.

<!-- What a mystery!  -->

It is a great mystery that whatever you perceive or whatever you conceive – **everything is within you, nothing is outside of you.** 

That is why it is said that the entire universe is within you in miniature form. 

**You are seeing the psychic projection of the material world.** 

This is why I say that **the human entity is more psychic than physical**.

Your existence is more important in the psychic world than in the physical world.

But, in DMC, I said that you must maintain parallelism between your:
- entitative waves
- incantative waves
- spiritual waves.

Human approaches are of 2 kinds:

1. Extro-internal
2. Intro-external


## Extro-internal

Extro-internal means created outside but going within.

This is the subject of **applied psychology**.

The waves from a flower move from the external world to the eye. 

Then it goes through the optic nerve to the nerve cells and finally to the brain.

There, a similar flower is created inside the mind according to the light waves that are outside your body.

This movement is from external to internal.

It is something external. 
- Its creation is in your mind, that is external to internal.



## Intro-external

Intro-external movement is created within the mind and sent outside. 

Suppose you:
- have a strong ectoplasmic structure
- created an elephant within your mind

With the help of this strong ectoplasmic structure*, **you create sympathetic vibrations outside**. 

{{< n n="This is the aetherspace being expanded outside the normal spatial limits, and is similar to Bob Lazar's Gravity A waves expanding past the perimeter of the atom" >}}


That external projection can be seen by you and by others.

In your mind, you are creating an ectoplasmic elephant, and that elephant is projected outside.

Others may see it. In the language of psychology, it is called a “positive hallucination”.

Similarly, suppose there is a real elephant.

With the help of your ectoplasmic power, **you withdraw the light waves emanating from the external elephant.** *

{{< n n="This is because the aetherspace is superior to light (and is similar to UFOs being transparent?)" >}} 

Everyone will not see the elephant, even if it is actually there.

In psychology, this is called a “negative hallucination.” 

- Positive hallucination means that what appears to exist does not exist
- Negative hallucination means that what actually exists appears not to exist


For you there are 2 worlds, the external world and the internal world.

Waves from the outside enter the internal world.

Ectoplasmic waves with a strong pressure may create strong extroversial waves. 

**In order to create positive hallucinations or negative hallucinations, there is always extroversial projection of your thought-waves.**

It is a very nice, interesting and *intellectual* subject.

But for Parama Puruśa what happens? 

Parama Puruśa is creating everything with His ectoplasmic force.

When a man has got devotion, he may or may not be a scientist.
- But he may unify his existence with Parama Puruśa because of his extreme love for Parama Puruśa. 
- In that case, he will become one with Parama Puruśa. 
- At that time he maintains no separate identity. 

If Joseph becomes one with Parama Puruśa there will no longer be Joseph.

So, Parama Puruśa is one. 

A little girl might be able to dance, sing, and paint, but not speak French.
- She has 1 weakness.

Everybody has got certain imperfections. 

But Parama Puruśa has got 2 imperfections. 

1. He cannot create a second Parama Puruśa. 

Whoever will be in love with Him, in close contact with Him, will also become Parama Puruśa. 

But Parama Puruśa remains one. 

Magnet and iron. When iron comes in contact with the magnet, the iron and magnet become one entity. So, Parama Puruśa remains one. 

Have you heard the name Huang Ho? What happens when it comes in contact with the Pacific Ocean? 

When a person comes in contact with Parama Puruśa, one does not remain a person. One becomes absorbed, just like the Huang Ho.


2. He cannot hate anyone.

If you dislike a person, you will say:

“I do not want to see your face. I hate you. Get out!” 

But Parama Puruśa cannot hate anyone. 

Suppose you have created a bad drunkard in your mind. You cannot hate that man because he is in your mind.

If Parama Puruśa hated you. He cannot tell you to go away since He is everywhere.


<!-- and yet you order me to get out. Where will I go?”  -->

<!-- Then Parama Puruśa will have to say, “Go outside my area.” 

But outside there is nothing. Everything is inside.  -->

<!-- So then you will challenge Parama Puruśa. “Either you change your name or withdraw your order.” -->

<!-- So, Parama Puruśa cannot do two things. He cannot create a second Parama Puruśa, and he cannot hate anyone. He cannot even hate a bad person. All are His creation.  -->

So Parama Puruśa cannot hate.

There are two worlds, the external world and the internal world. 

For you, there are extro-internal vibrations and intro-external vibrations. 

But for Parama Puruśa:
- everything is within, everything is internal
- there can neither be extro-internal projection nor intro-external projection

<!-- Nothing is without, nothing is external. So for Him,  -->

 <!-- because everything is within, nothing is external. So  -->

Whatever He thinks in His mind, others see as real. 

You see the Pacific Ocean externally, but for Parama Puruśa, the Pacific Ocean is within His mind. 

He has created the ocean within His mind, and mentally He is seeing it. 

Seeing mental objects requires no eyes. If you create a tiger in your mind, do you require any eyes to see it? You will mentally be seeing the tiger you created. 

For seeing anything Parama Puruśa requires no eyes. He sees with His mental eyes. For Him, there is nothing external. Everything is internal.

<!-- Now what will an intellectual do? Many learned people are puffed up with vanity. Have you seen some scholars who have much vanity, who are proud of their intellect? You have seen such people.  -->


Intellectuals puffed up with vanity can never become one with Parama Puruśa because their psychic projection is towards the external world. 

They want to get more name and fame, to establish themselves in the arena of vanity. 

<!-- Those who have intellectual vanity will never be able to come in close contact with Him. -->

Those who are established in actional faculties will be engaged in action.

**Action is relative change of place.** 

When there is a change of place, we say that an action is being done. 

It is a relative change of place and not an absolute one. 

Those who are engaged in actional faculties are doing so with time, space and person.

But Parama Puruśa is beyond the periphery of time, space and person. 

So, by dint of one’s actional faculties, one cannot get Him.

Then who can get Him? They say it is very, very easy. Say:

“O Lord, I am Your creation. I am Yours, I am at Your disposal. This body is a machine. Utilize it.” 

But you are to do one thing. 

Parama Puruśa has 2 imperfections:

1. He cannot create another Parama Puruśa
2. He cannot hate anybody

But is there any want in Him? 

There is no want – name, fame, money, etc. – because the entire universe is within His mind, so all the properties of the universe are His. 

He has no want.

But the true devotee says: 

“Oh Parama Puruśa, there are so many great devotees, and I am only an ordinary devotee, the worst devotee. But Lord, those who are your big devotees have done one thing. They have stolen Your mind.” 

Because Parama Puruśa loves His devotees very much, His mind has been stolen by them. 

Parama Puruśa’s mind has been stolen by His devotees, so He has got one want – mind. 

His mind has been taken by His devotees. 

“Oh Lord, your devotees have stolen your mind, so You have got one want. You have lost your mind. Do one thing, Lord, take my mind. Let there be no want in You. **I offer my mind to You**. Accept it.”


So the devotees are very intelligent. They are more intelligent than:
- intellectuals, and
- those engaged in action
