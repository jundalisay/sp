Baba visited Maulana Azad Park, previously it was known as Company Bag, which was used as stable for the horses of the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir. 

It had also orange orchards. Baba said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
An attempt to develop Kashmir was made since Jahangir, but the city of Jammu was neglected.
- Now some attempt to develop this area is being made.

The first phase of Dogra empire begins about 3,000 years ago, 400 to 500 years after Krsna. 

But there is no history of those days, no historical narration of Jammu Locan Bala. 

There is no proper history available of the pre-British days. 

Ranjit Singh conquered the area from Kabul to Sirmaur, no proper account of his rule in Kasmir is available. 

There is a gap of more than 2,500 years between Jammu Locan and Gulab Singh. 

No history of the period between Kumarayana, a great Kashmiri scholar and Gulab Singh is available. 

There is a gap of 1.000 years. But no proper account of this period is available. 

The propounder of Vaeshesika philosophy, Kanada and the first grammarian Panini were born here.

According to Kalhan's Rajtarangini, Kashmir kingdom was stretched over from Sarda Math to Kumkum (Pamir), it touched the southern portion of Russia.

It streched over 50 x 12=600 sq. miles. In the south of Kashmir is Jammu, and both of them were included in the Dogra kingdom.

After the last Anglo-Sikh battle, half of the kingdom of Ranajit Singh, from Persia to Peshavar, was left over.

But Punjab was annexed by Britishers to have soldiers for the army. 

Kashmir was sold to Gulab Singh (1846).

Some people of the north western portion, never accepted the suzerainty of Britishers. 

Britishers kept their boundary at Ladakh. 

Sher Shah had built a road from Dhaka to Ladakh. 

Later, Jorawar Singh conquered Ladakh and Tibet and according to treaty of Lhasa, he took "Chauth" of 4,000 gold Asharfis (coins). 

Locus standii should be classified. 

There should be a Board of Historians to link the ancient with the modern and the Government should manage and arrange for the research work.

Butt and Dhar* were originally Bengali Brahmans and pronoun ced ksa as Kha, in the Yajurvediya style. 

The disciples of Guru Nanak were called Shikhya (Shisya) which later became Sikk.

Sanskrit should be taught.

The mother of all the languages from Afghanistan to Malayasia is Sanskrit. 

( Baba mentioned about His family and said that His ancestors since the days of Shahjahan were government officers. In Bengal, court language was Urdu, but Baba's ancestors were well-versed in Sanskrt, His father was also a Sanskrit scholar). 

Philological research is also very important. 

Pashto, Kurdi and Kashmiri languages come from Pashcattya Prakrit. 

In Pashcattya Prakrit, the word 'Pama' became 'Pam' in demi Pashcattya Prakrit.
- In modera Kashmiri it is 'Pamposh'.

For possessive case, one uses `Ka, Ke, Kii, Kena`, and `Kerii` in Shaorseni Prakrit.

Ram's sister is said as 'Ram Keri Bahan'.

In Pascati Prakrit (Punjabi, Pahari, Punjabi, Dogri) `Da, De, Dii` is used for possessive case. 

For example, Amm Di Acar (piceles of mango). Ka, Ke, Kii of Hindi have been taken from Shaorseni Prakrta.

Baba said that He had travelled in the villages of Amritsa some 30 years back and had collected some folksongs. 

The mother tongue of Punjabi was neglected and Urdu was imposed. 

Baba said that He had collected some 500 songs of Hola.

Ai Basant Di Bahara Amba mole tesu mole
Mol rahi kacna'r

Every language has its own phonetic style. 

The script of Kashmiri was removed. 

It was difficult to write Sanskrt in Persian script. 

1,500-2,000 years before Persian script, Kharosti was used. 

Arabic script came in use after the dominance of Islam. 

In Persian Ga and Ja are one while in Arabic they are separate.

40 years ago, Baba had made research in Arabic. 

In Persian, it will be Talib-i-Ilm, in Arabic it shall be Talib-ul-Ilm. 

Arabic names will be written Sirajud Daula, Fajlur Rahman, Unnissa. 

In English ('s) or 'of' serves the purpose of possessive case.

In Kashmir court, official work should be done in Kashmiri while in Jammu it should be done in Dogri.

The village folk could not understand Urdu with which they had no contact. Urdu was imposed during the reign of Jahangir. Before Queen Didda Namskrta had its important position here. Damodar Gupta was A great Samskrta scholar.
