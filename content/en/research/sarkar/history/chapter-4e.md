30 lakh years ago, Ara'valli ranges was under the sea. 

Due to plutonic earthquake, it came up above the sea and the sand of the place is from sea and not from any river. Due to sargossa se, oil can be found from the Aravalli ranges to Rann of Kutch; Around Jaipur it would be salt-range, oil is not found in salt- Fange.

The old Digambar Jains used Singh title. Raja Pratapaditya of Bengal had defeated Akbar twice. Thereafter Mansingh was sent against Pratapaditya. Mansingh sent chains and sword to Pratapaditya. 

The latter accepted sword and sent back chains for Mansingh and said, 'I take sword and send chains for you since you are already in chains'. 

In the battle Pratapaditya was defeated and made a prisoner, but he committed suicide, enroute to Agra at Varanasi. As a result Jaipur to which place Mansingh belonged, became very unpopular in Bengal and Bengal Rajputs left using 'Singh' title-tatha'pi singhah pashure- VÃ¡sti: (though a lion, but still it is an animal ). 

The relations got improved after Maharaja of Jaipur was married to Gayatri Devi, sister of Raja Dwipendra Bahadur, of Tripura. Rajputs had two basic demerits, because of which they were defeated in battles: (1) fighting without proper preparation; (2) No unity. 

Without these demerits the history of India would have been different. The above lapses were the cause of the fall of Rajputs; lack of these demerits was the cause of Maratha victory, the cause of Rajput defeat was lack of fire-arms and lack of unity. If in western India Rajputs and Marathas would have united a great work would have been done.

Dumraj:
- was the Commander of Ajmer fort
- had decided to fight to the end
- was a great warrior

But the king ordered him to surrender. 

When Marathas invaded the fort, they found the gate of the fort open and Dumraj dead from suicide. 

He followed the orders of the king and also acted according to his determination. 

He After the fall of Ajmer, was the last hero of Rajputdom. Rajasthan went under the influence of Marathas.

The last war of Panipat decided the fate of India. 

In the war of Sitabaldi, near Naapur, only Bhanstes power was defeated.

At Panipat, the entire Maratha power got vanquished. The inscriptions at Jaipur are found since the Pathan period.

Better fight is possible if the fort is on a hill. 

Strategically it is better since stones could be thrown from the hill fort.

People living on small hills (not snow-covered) have a better fighting capacity.
- If the place is dry, the capacity is still more

The male population on snow-covered hills has less longevity, they cannot do much physical work. 

Male population of Himachal and Bhutan have tender life. 
- Ladies do all the physical work. 

Bundi is the hot belt of Hada dynasty.

The area consists of stout and physically strong populace. 

The name of the place was Hada and the spoken language is Harauti. 

Kota and Bundi were in the same state, Bhiils were the original population of this land. 

They are Austric Scythians. 

The language of Bhils contains more distorted Sanskit words than the language of other tribes. 

The king of the place was Kotia Bhil, in whose name the place is known as Kota. 

Bhils are of soilish colour and are muscular, as a consequence they are good fighters. 

The sandy-land besides Chambal Valley is known Bihorh (difficult terrain ). The robbers of this area do not rob the poor. People of the place are brave and devotees. 

Bhils were so brave that Pathans and Moghuls never attacked them.

It was only Wellesly who intervened through the system of subsidiary alliance. 

People are the devotees of Krisna; on hearing the name of Krisna, tears would roll down their eyes and body would shiver. People are very simple and due to muscular body they are stout and brave.

The Holi festival was first started by Bhils. 

Later, the festival was aryanised. Yet it is still the main festival of Bhils. 

Holi is observed as Dola-Yatra in Bengal, Orissa and Assam. 

A day earlier than Holi, Holika burning is observed. 

<!-- Holika would eat a man every day, people burnt her to death.  -->

Holi is observed as Phagua in east Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Navaratra is a ceremony according to Shakta Tantrik cult.
