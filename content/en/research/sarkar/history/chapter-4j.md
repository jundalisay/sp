Kota, Mach 18th, 1984

[Kota is the foremost city of Rajasthan named after the famous Bhil king. Kotia-Bhit It is the centre of Harauti civilisation manifesting the blending of tribal and Aryan trends. A few kilometres away from Kota, lies a place Alánia which depicts the presence of a civilisation as ancient as Mohanjodaro. About 70 Kilometres away from Kota, statue of post-Aryan Ganesh could be seen, which depicts the cultural characteristics of a period when demi-Brahmi script was vogue)


Walking in the night in the courtyard of the place where Baba stayed, He said:

Until 100 years after death of Hazrat Mohammed, no division as Hanifi or Vahavi occured in Islamic worship. 

There is no mention of any division in Bukhari Sharif.

Hadith is of 3 categories:

1. Sahih

This is what Hazrat Mohammed has said as Pharz to be observed as the order of Khuda (God)

2. Kaili [Hasan?]

This is what he said and did himself.

3. Karori [Daif?]

<!-- 103 -->

This is what he did not oppose, but did not speak or do. 


In an Islamic conference, there was difference over kadiani.

Baba had said that Karori Hadith should not be given recognition in Islam.

In Sindh, there are more Shias than Sunnis.

Agha Khan is the leader of Bhora Muslims, with their central office at Bombay.

The Quran had been their religious book written in Persian in Kacchi script (Landaii or Maudi). 

Up to 1907, they were guided by Hindu law and not Muslim law.

Landal or Maudi is the original script of Sindhi.

Later it gave birth to 2 sections Multani and Hyderabadi (Sindh).

Multani is a blending of Punjabi and Sindhi. 

It was the dialect of Sindh (India) as the grand daughter of Pahlvi Prakrta, which was the people's language, some 4000 years ago.

Later, under the Influence of Islam they adopted Persian script. 

The script of Punjab was also Landal or Maudi. 

Gurumukhi script was given by Guru Arjuna deva and accepted by Guru Govinda Singh. Hards is the ancient traditional script. 

Sindhi script is fast vanishing: Literature is also written in Persian script. 

It happened since the advanced stage of Pathan period some 450-500 years Apo. Hindhi is not being taught in schools. 

Sindhi is the only Heine language of Pahivi Prakta (Baba wants to save it from exitution. Halue and Brahvi are the languages of Dravidian group. 

Sindhi gentlemen can not understand it. Dravidian civilization has its influence on Maudi script as well.

Indus valley had 3 main layers, 2 layers were swept away by the Indus and got destroyed.

Mohanjodaro is a non Dravadian term. 

The Bengali gentleman who found this city had no knowledge of Dravidian language and so he named the city as Mohanjodara wrongly. 

Saeadhavi Prakrit is the daughter of Vardi Ramakris.

Distorted Sanskrit words are found in abundance.

For example, puttra (son) in Sanskrit, is 'putta' in Sindhi language.

Kota, March 19, 1984

Baba visited a temple of Balaji 6 kilometers away from Kota.

Not far from it is (the monkey-god of epic Ramayana) temple.

The Hanuman temple is 500 years old. The sof Kotia Bhil live nearby. Here about 60 families wha come from nearby places are living, they came here years back. 

Before this there was no habitation Bhils, who had been here, had migrated southward eastward, and south-west wards towards Mewar, Ujjain. The dieties in the temple are standing Ganesh of and shitala Devi. Baba said:

The Ganesh idol does not have sacred thread on it, E also no priest nor mouse nor Shiva and Parvati. non-Aryan tribal origin. There are ten types of Gamit, Primitive Ganesh, Pre-Buddhist Ganesh, Pauranika d etc. Here is pre-Buddhist Ganesh.

Speaking on Ganesh Baba said: Ganesh (Gan's means people's leader. Ganesh is a non-Aryan deity, ski Aryans came to India, Ganesh was a popular deity amon Aryans. 

Aryans accepted him as their own deity. Lender amongst tribals had always been very popular and strong

If you touch a tribal leader. the entire tribal popul will come together. Tribal leader Genesh was a very leader. 

Ganesh is not an ordinary stout and healthy person. Ha was not a petty person. His face is that of an elephant the gest animal. Aryans had accepted Shiva, accepted Ganesh made Ganesh the son of Shiva. The priest becomes a l though Ganesh was an accepted deity before. Aryan cam India. Aryans got Ganesh to wear a sacred thread. 

Shiva wa also made to wear sacred thread by Aryans. 

In the idols of Aryan influence there was no sacred thread on the body. H Aryans did not use sacred thread, and so the orginal dat the non-Aryans also had no sacred thread.

Later sacred thread was put on the stone idals. had been a very popular deity in Scythian tribals.

Assir seythians. Bhils were austric scythions. Ganesh was pular in Maharashtra and Maharashtrian Shils, same is the with south India, since Scythians had been in south as well, thians are not found in Bengal, Sihar and east Uttar Pradesh. Hanesh is not such a popular deity in these areas. 

Bhils were to short-statured as Marathas are.

In Pauranic era, Tantra had five branchs-Shaiva, Shakta, Vaishnava, Saora and Ganapatya. Ganipatya refrered to Gania- Fall of Ganesh. The mouse at the feet of Ganesh represents the If there is no mouse with my lying at the feet like a mouse. the Cianesh-idol, it is definitely a pre-Aryan idol. 

If the mouse is there, it may or may not be pre-Aryan. In pre-Aryan Ganesh Ganesh was fully dity there shall not be a Brahman-Priest.
Afyanised, so was Shiva.

Kartika is an Aryan deity, Saraswati' Is a Buddhist deity, Lakami is a Pauranic deity. Dogma-dominating Brahmanism and Hinduism had made a Kumbha-Mela (big fair) of deities and gods.
