Jaipur, March 10, 1984

Jaipur is the capital of Rajasthan which has a glorious Fecord of warriors and fighters. Besides it, the civilisation around it depicts the influence of Tantra, Jainism and also of Sakaldwipi Brahmans who were worshippers of Sun-god. Cul tural and civilisational accomplishments of the land are annals of Indian History

Baba came to Jaipur from Delhi and while in Jaipur visited the fort Jaigarh. 

In it lies a cannon named Jaibana, which is 20 feet long, weighing 50 tons, and having a shooting range of 45 kilometers. Jai Singh had built it. Baba observed:

Jai Singh I started the construction of the city of Jaipur and his grandson Jai Singh II completed it, Jai Singh requested Allah Dastur Peer of Bengal, for the town-planning of Jaipur. He could Hot come here. Puspadhar Mitra, of Krishnagar (Bengal) came and got Jaipur constructed. Jaipur is the oldest planned city of India. Chandigarh is the second planned city. Paris is also a planned city.

The state of Jaipur extended up to Bikaner. It had been the biggest state of Rajasthan. Previously Jodhpur was the biggest state, when the Thar desert seceded from Jodhpur and was in- eluded in Sindh, Jaipur became the biggest one. Thar was a Hindu-majority area, it should not have been included in Pakistan The spoken language of Thar was Thari-Marvari, a blending of Marvari and Jodhpuri. The old light railway of Jodhpur extended up to Thar.

Though Jaipur was the biggest state of Rajasthan, its pres- tige went down when Mansingh compromised with Akbar, be- same his commander and got a family daughter married to the Moghul Emperor. Consequently, Jaipur got looked down be- fore Cittor, Udaipur, Bikaner and Kota states.
Babar was the first person who used firearms in India in the

Best battle of Panipath (1526) in which Ibrahim Lodi was defeated. After this battle, India got the knowledge of firearms. Jai Singh. I got this cannon made. 

Puskar, a sacred place, had a big and strong fort. Jaipur-king fought many sanguinary battles with Pushkar but could not conquer it.
In Samskrta, Ambar means that which touches the sky, when 'ma' and 'ta' are after 'ma' it becomes 'ma' in Malvi-Prakrta, And so Ambar became Ammar as Amrta becomes 'Ammirasa'. In old Rajasthan Ammar became Ammera, in modern Rajasthani it is known as Amera..
In Bengal, there were twelve landlords who did not accept the sovereignty of the Moghul Emperor; Pratapaditya Rai was their leader. Moghul emperor attacked twice but could not Aucceed against Pratapaditya. Thereafter, Mansingh was sent as commander of the army to conquer Pratapaditya Rai who lost the battle. Mansingh made him a prisoner to bring him to Agra. Dhakeshwari Devi was the goddess deity of Pratapaditya. Man- singh brought this deity and established it in this fort (Jaigarh), he also brought the priest from Bengal (In the area of Ramana of Dacca there was a deity known as Ramana Kali who is known as Dhakeshvari Devi!.

The city of Jaipur is famous for the five P's palace, prince. peacock. pink and path, it is a place of glory. Old Jaipur also exists today. Sabera dynasty, originally kings of Udaipur, came here (Jaipur) from Mewar and settled down, to become rulers of Jaipur.

The Scythian people of Mewar are small but stout and mighty in strength. 

Ksattriyas of Mewar and Jaipur areas differ facially. In the south of Mount Abu Scythians had Gujrati influence and have betel type round face. In the northwest of Marvari area, distorted Marvari is spoken.

The shakas came to India from Middle East Asia. 

Three groups of people came to India during those times (the beginning of the Christian era): Shaka, Huna and Kushan, a branch of Kushans was known as 'Yue-Chi' Kajul Kadphisus was the king of Kushan dynasty, Kanishka was his successor, who ruled over west and north India. Vashiska was his sun, but his later succes- sors became very weak.

In Sirohi, Brahmans belong to Nagar section. Here they are Gaur Brahmins. People in India knew to make steel before the invasion of Mohammad Ghori In Prithwi Raj Stambha (tomb) and Kutub Minar, no rusting has yet occurred. Here in the cannon, if it is white, it would be either sine, or a galvanised amalgam. (It is told here that the cannon contains alloy.) The cannon should be securely maintained.


This place represents epoch-making glorious element of his tory. The history of the place should be recorded. The history of Rajasthan is not being properly taught. If there would not have been a brave Rajasthan, India would have been enslaved earlier. Jodhpur-Bikaner area was the first line of defence. 

Ganganagar is now green and fertile, previously it was a desert. In Bam'la language there are 15-20 books on history of this place. It is only one percent of what it should be, Hindus, after Shan- karacarya's Mayavada, developed a defective outlook that this world is a mirage, apathetic to history; it is a danger- ous mentality D. L. Rai was a poet cum dramatist. He travelled from village to village, recorded the songs which charans (folk singers) were singing, collected the old records and wrote history. Ramesh Dutt, a famous 1.C.S. officer, was a known historian. He was in Baroda quite long He came here and wrote the history book, 'The Last Evening of the Rajputs of Rajasthan". Ajmer and Marwar states were under the British suzerainty, the king cooperated with Ramesh Dutt, since he was an I. C. S. officer. Maharashtra Jewan Prabhat ("The Dawn of Life of Maharashtra)" was his second book. Very few have tried to write the real history of Rajasthan.
Carans (folk singers) are also getting extinct. No other place has such a glittering history like that of Rajasthan. People are lions and not sheep. In the old days, the brave kings. provided inspiration and leadership. In later days, no leadership could be provided. As a consequence, mutual bickerings and battles destroyed them. After the fall of Raja Dahir (A.D. 712), they should have become alert. If they would have been vigilantly attentive, there would not have been a Moghul rule in India. After the defeat of Dahir, Mohummad Ibn kasim did not dare to march ahead only because he knew that the people of Rajas- than were very brave.

Jaipur, March 11, 1984
Baba visited the garden of the queen of Sisodia. It contained a terrace garden. Looking at the place, Baba said:
The queen of Sisodia hailed from Udaipur. She was named Padmavati or Ratnavali. She was the father's sister of Chandra- vall, sister of Amar Singh. The north of Duggarpur in the central portion of Mewar is the water barrier of South Rajasthan. Neythians of Rajasthan were Sisodias.
in Malvi Prakrta, Duggar means small hill. Malvi Prakrta existed as a spoken language about 3500 years ago. From it emerged Gujarati (spoken in the eastern portion ). Malvi (spoken in the western portion) and Rajasthani (spoken in the southern portion) From western demi-Malvi emerged Marwari, Mewait, Harauti and Dhundhari (a blending of Mewani and Haraut), which are the modern spoken languages of the people. A blending of Marwari and Harauti is Mewati'. In the En portion, Gujarati and Saurashtri blended together to produce 'Kacchi', which has also a blended impact of Gujarati and Hindhi. 'Cha' is commonly used in Kacchi.
Brahmans east of Magadha were known as Gaura Brahmans Brahmans of the land of molasses (gur, palm gur). Gur Desh (the land of Gaura) comprised in it one third of west Hangat and two thirds of Bangladesh. About 1200 years ago, during the post Buddhist and Pauranic age, there was a Brahman convention at Allahabad, where only ten sections of Brahmans were recognized as Brahmans... those who were vegetarian and did not eat bah. They were five Gauriya and five Dramil Brah mans. The five Gauriya Brahmans were Saraswata (mostly of Kashmir, Jammu and Punjab), Kanyakubja (of west U.P.)

Shrii P. R. Sarkar
Nagars (in the southern portion of Sirohi, south of Rajasthan and Gujrat ). Gauras and Macthils of Mithila. The five Dramil were Citpavans of Maharastra, Utkals of Orissa, Taclang of Andhra, Tamil of Tamil Nadu and Kannada of Karnataka. Fish caters were not recognised as Brahmans, viz. Nambodari of Kerala (who had migrated to Kerala from Bengal by sea), Gaura Sara: swata, Pai, Senoy. According to the Pauranic system Brahman should not eat fish, Kasttriya can take fish only in the battle, Vaeshyas shall not eat fish, The Bratyas (Shudras) can take fish. The three higher castes shall also become Bratayas if they do not follow this rule of caste system.
Gaur Brahmans do reside here. That's why you find Gauriya style of architecture here, Gauriya style originated from Bengal All the Pauranic temples including those of Shiva are in Gauriya style But Jaina and Buddha temples are not found in Gauriya style. Nagar Brahmans came from Persia before the Pa'rees came. Parsees came to India during the days of Rudra Daman (about 130 A.D.). The Par'sees settled down in Navsa'ri. They brought with them the worship of Zoroaster; their religion was dear to them. The ruler of the place asked them to adopt the language of the place, which they did, but they maintained their system of religious worship.
'Wada' in Malwi Prakrta means habitation, viz. Bi Iwada Banswada. The language of people in Bhilwa'da is blending of Mewari, and Marwari-both are the offshoots of Malvi Prakrta.
The script of this place is Maud'i', which has three branches Curuwa'li, Landai and Marathi. The old Marwariis write their bahi (cash book) in Curuwa'li' Maud'i'.
Baba said
There was idol made of black stone. the idol is not old. The art of this place has the influence of Digambar Jaina Swetambar Jainas are found in South Rajasthan and Gujrat
About the terrace garden found here. Baba said: This garden is built on Mughal style; it is quite dificult to construct a terrace garden.


The Aravalli ranges extend from the western hedge of Brahmavarta to cast Bahawalpur state. The Aravalli ranges cause rain shadow-to the cast of Aravalli there are rains, but of the west there are no rains. it is desert; there are rains in Jaipur but no Fains in Bikaner, clouds are obstructed. From here to Delhi, it is subterranean Aravalli ranges. Trans Aravalli land is older. Underneath the Aravali Nalt will be found beneath the water.

soil, as in Kucch, kerosene oil can be found. Aravalli was within the Sargossa sca. Due to plutonic type of earthquake land came up, so happened in Kucch. The sand of the place is seasand.
In Malvi Prakrta salt was said as Lau-anna' from which 'Lavana' has been derived. The water beneath the Aravalli is saltish. Shaka, Huns, Kushans and Yue-chi's came over this place and Brahmans accepted them as Ksattriyas, they are the Rajput of Rajasthan. Gaur-Rajputs migrated from Bengal, they did not embrace Buddhism. Sisodias belonging to Mewar (Rajasthan) has Scythian influence while in Gujrat it is not so. It is only biological difference. Nagar Bramans are round headed Aryans. There are many titles based on profession. Daruwala (Daru- means wine) Broker, Engineer, Gandhi (who traded in perfumes).

Jaipur March, 13, 1984

Baba visited Ramgarh lake, about 30 K.M. away from Jaipur (Rajasthan). The lake has a span of 25 square miles with 64 ft. deep water, it supplies water to Jaipur city. Baba told us :

The nearest river of this place is the Ban Ganga which merges in Jamuna. This place contains the remains of the old city of Rampur-state, which had existed before Jaipur was founded. All around the city, there were temples, one of them is the temple of Goddess Jamuna'.

There should be a temple of the Sun-god between Ramgarh and Jaipur near Ramgarh. The costume of the Sun-god is trouser (as muslims wear), shervani and rosary, and frij-cap on the head. There should be village inhabited by Shakaldvipi Brahmns. came to south-east and They came here from north-west,
