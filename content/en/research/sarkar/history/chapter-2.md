Allahabad, Feb 3, 1984

Baba visited the famous Company Bag, Allahabad where He observed:

In the ancient times, India was a vast country.

- In the north was was Akshaya China.
- In the south was Kanyakumari
- In the east was Pragjyotishpur
- In the west was Kandahar

Many divisions were created in this vast sub-continent.

Today India, is a much smaller land. 

In the religious sphere also balkanization dominates. 

Hindu Tantiis or weavers and Muslim julahas have the same historical legacy, Muslims and Christians also have the same cultural hertiage, yet divisions have been created between both these groups. 

Balkanization divides humanity and encourages fissiparous tendencies, hence it has a destructive impact on society. Fissiparous tendencies are still causing balkanization and India may yet become smaller.

Hindu Tantiis are not guided by Puranic rule, nor are the Muslim julahas guided by the Alimfazil rules, they are more under Maulana domination.

India is a land in which several cultures and races have The five Pandavas were fair, while been blended together. Fair and dark as well as tall and short Draupadi was dark. The Turks were short in stature, while the Afghans were tall. Some Shias are dark and others are fair. Both dark and fair skinned people can be in the so-called high and low castes. All are Indians. The entire cultural phenomena of India is one. The cultural panorama, the inner cultural legacy of this ancient land, consists of a subterranean unity, based
upon the immutable spirit of humanity.

Baba also visited the Ganga Nath Jha Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapiitha, situated within the Company Bag. This institute contains about 50,000 manuscripts, some of them on palm leaves. Some are written in Maethili script and others are in Tirhutia script. Tirhutia script is a metamorphosed form of Shrii Harsha script of Kaushambi. The latter was metamorphosed into three scripts-Tirhutia, Gauriya and Utkal. tia script is no longer in use. In Nepal, the prevalent script is Madeshi or Madhya Deshi and it is an appendicised form of Tirhutia. Metamorphosed Newari was written in this script.

Tirhu-
Gorkhali language, in Devanagri script became the official language of Nepal after 1773, when Nepal was conquered by Prithwi Narayan Shah. Carving written in Shrii Harsha script may be found after excavation since this script stopped being used only five hundred years ago. To the north of Allahabad the popular script was Sharada and to the east Kutila was used. Both began 2000 years ago, but later Kutila was transmuted into Tirhutia, Utkal and Gouriya styles. The first book of Maethili language, Varna Ratnakar, written by Jyotiriishwar Thakur, was written in Tirhutia. It was written well before Vidyapati, and is the
oldest book in east India.

Allahabad, Feb. 4, 1934

Baba visited the other side of the Company Bag, today. He observed:

This is the biggest garden of the world. Baba Baba told that it covers an area of 180 acres. It is properly maintained but not properly developed. Several tropical and equatorial plants of different varieties can be grown here.

In Uttar Pradesh mulberry and non-mulberry silk can be grown. It is an ideal location for the development of the silk

industry since there are many weavers in the state, Resham is mulberry silk and the silk worms can be grown on the Shahtoot tree. 

The wood of this tree can be used to manufacture sporting goods which are today manufactured in Ludhiana. 

There are 3 varieties of non-mulberry silk:

1. Tasar

Eranda Tasar worms can be grown on Sakhua and Berry trees.

2. Endi

Endi worms Can be grown on Endi trees.

3. Munga

Munga worms can be grown on Drumstick trees known as Shobhaunjan in Sanskrit. 

Industries should be developed utilising both varieties of silk. 

**However, such industries should not depend on subsidies, as they invariably run at loss and deplete the collective wealth.** 

If Japan can develop industries based on genuine silk and artficial silk, then why can't India?


Prayag. Feb. 6, 1984

Baba travelled by boat to Prayag-sangam where the Yamuna merges in the Ganga. 

While sitting on the boat, He observed: the land between the Ganga and the Yamuna, starting from Gangottari and Yamunottari, was known as Brahma varta during Vedic times. It later became known as Shurasena during the time of the Mahabharata. 

Its capital before the era of the Mahabharata was Vrshnipura. 

The name of the place where the distance between the Yamuna and the Ganga was less than 10 miles was Brahmarshi Desa, while Vindhyamekhala was the name of the country in ancient times. 

Vindhyamekhala is divided into 2 parts:

1. The western side was called Bundelkhand 
2. The eastern side was called Baghelkhand

Since the Yamuna river passes through black cotton soil, the colour of the river-water appears to be bluish. 

The Ganga passes through yellow soil, so its colour appears to be white. 

Krsna Dvaepayan's grand father was a fisherman in an island-village situated in the trans-Yamuna region and located on black cotton soil. Being born on an island of black soil he was known as Krsna Dva payana Vyasa.


<!-- 45 -->

The language spoken in the trans-Ganga area is Avadhi and Braja while in the south of the Yamuna river people speak Bundeli, Avadhi, Braja and Bundeli are the offshoots of Shaurseni Parkrta. 

In the upper portion of Brahmavarta, the people's language is Jatu-Hariyanavii. 

The offshoots of Shauraseni Prakrta : Avadhi, Braja, Bagheli, Bundeli and Hariyanavii had philological similarity, the verb endings get changed according to the changes in the number and gender of the subject.

Prayag was once the cultural centre of India before the Aryans proceeded eastward. 

Afterwards, Varanasi became the cultural hub of India, and continues to be so even now.

When our motor boat passed near the fort Baba said: The fort dates back to the time of the Pandavas. 

Akshya bata (Banyan tree) is also very old. 

Kaushambi is a historical place. 

In ancient times, civilizations grew around river valleys. 

Kaushambi developed on the banks of the Saraswati river. 

It was a great centre of Therapanthi Jainism. 

Later, when the Saraswati vanished due to the raising of the riverbed, Kaushambi also lost its significance.
