[Allahabad has been the intellectual centre of northern India in the past. In ancient times, it was famous as Prayag, the confluence of that Ganga, Jamuna and Saraswati rivers matching the confluence of the Bundeli, Bagheli and Avadhi civiliszations. The river Saraswati has become extinct. Jamuna merges in the Ganga here. Near Prayag lies Kaushambi, the capital town of Maharaj Shrii Harsa after which name famous Shrii Harsa script, is known today. Prayag or Allahabad manifests the characteristics of Ganga-Jamuna river valley civilization. ]

Allahabad, Feb 3, 1984

Baba visited the famous Company Bag, Allahabad where He observed:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
In the ancient times, India was a vast country.

- In the north was was Akshaya China.
- In the south was Kanyakumari
- In the east was Pragjyotishpur
- In the west was Kandahar

Many divisions were created in this vast sub-continent.

Today India, is a much smaller land. 

In the religious sphere also balkanization dominates. 

Hindu Tantiis or weavers and Muslim julahas have the same historical legacy, Muslims and Christians also have the same cultural hertiage, yet divisions have been created between both these groups. 

Balkanization divides humanity and encourages fissiparous tendencies, hence it has a destructive impact on society. Fissiparous tendencies are still causing balkanization and India may yet become smaller.

Hindu Tantiis are not guided by Puranic rule, nor are the Muslim julahas guided by the Alimfazil rules, they are more under Maulana domination. 

The language of their cultural expression, their mother tongue is Bhojpuri in the Bhojpur area and Bagheli in their the Bagheli area.

<!-- 42 -->

Neither of them use Hindi or Urdu as mother tongue. 

If their mother tongues Bhojpuri and Bagheli had been encouraged, communal balkanization would not have happened. 

**Cultural unity and synthesis based upon a true appreciation of human history shall demolish communalism and destroy this divisive virus.**

India is a land in which several cultures and races have all blended together.

Fair, dark, tall, short have mingled together.

- The 5 Pandavas were fair.
- The Draupadi were dark. 
- The Turks were short.
- The Afghans were tall. 
- Some Shias are dark and others are fair. 

Both dark and fair skinned people can be in the so-called high and low castes. 

All are Indians. 
- The entire cultural phenomena of India is one. 

The cultural panorama, the inner cultural legacy of this ancient land, consists of a subterranean unity, based on the immutable spirit of humanity.

Baba also visited the Ganga Nath Jha Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapiitha, situated within the Company Bag. 

This institute contains about 50,000 manuscripts, some of them on palm leaves. 

Some are written in Maethili script and others are in Tirhutia script. 

Tirhutia script is a metamorphosed form of Shrii Harsha script of Kaushambi. 

The latter was metamorphosed into 3 scripts:

1. Tirhutia

This script is no longer in use.

In Nepal, the prevalent script is Madeshi or Madhya Deshi. It is an appendicised form of Tirhutia. 

Metamorphosed Newari was written in this script.

2. Gauriya
3. Utkal


Gorkhali language, in Devanagri script became the official language of Nepal after 1773, when Nepal was conquered by Prithwi Narayan Shah. 

Carving written in Shrii Harsha script may be found after excavation since this script stopped being used only 500 years ago.

To the north of Allahabad, the popular script was Sharada.

To the east, Kutila was used. 

Both began 2000 years ago, but later Kutila was transmuted into Tirhutia, Utkal and Gouriya styles. 

The first book of Maethili language, Varna Ratnakar, written by Jyotiriishwar Thakur, was written in Tirhutia. 

It was written well before Vidyapati, and is the oldest book in east India.

Kaushambi, the capital of Maharajadhiraj Shrii Harsha.
- It was situated on the banks of and the Saraswati river.

<!-- whose name Kutila became popular,  -->
<!-- 43 -->
The Carmanvati river came from the south.

The Drsdvati river came from the west.

Both merged into the Saraswati river which itself merged at the confluence of the Ganga and the Jamuna rivers near Prayag.

1,200 years ago, due to an earthquake, the bed of the Saraswati river rose and the river ceased to exist.

Consequently:
- the Carmanvati, now known as the chambal river merges into the Jamuna
- the Drsdvati river (also known as the Gharghara or Ghaghra river) merges into the Sona river near Rewa

Kaushambi lost its significance due to the disappearance of the Saraswati river because most civilizations in their intermediate stages grow and prosper in river valleys.

Nevertheless, Shrii Harsha script was the prevalent script from Allahabad to Assam.

Nagri script was in vogue in:
- West Uttar Pradesh
- Rajasthan
- Gujrat

Its lingual and cultural characteristics are well marked.

Women wore ghaghra up to Prayag including Rajasthan, Hariyana, and West Uttar Pradesh.
- Beyond this they wore sariis.

The cultural history of India should be popularised. 

Culture is a vast embracing term which includes social, economic and political factors. 

Scriptology is an integral part of Indian culture. 
- It should be taught as a special subject to encourage the preservation of ancient Indian languages.
