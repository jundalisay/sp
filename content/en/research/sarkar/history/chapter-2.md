Allahabad, Feb 3, 1984

Baba visited the famous Company Bag, Allahabad where He observed:

In the ancient times, India was a vast country.

- In the north was was Akshaya China.
- In the south was Kanyakumari
- In the east was Pragjyotishpur
- In the west was Kandahar

Many divisions were created in this vast sub-continent.

Today India, is a much smaller land. 

In the religious sphere also balkanization dominates. 

Hindu Tantiis or weavers and Muslim julahas have the same historical legacy, Muslims and Christians also have the same cultural hertiage, yet divisions have been created between both these groups. 

Balkanization divides humanity and encourages fissiparous tendencies, hence it has a destructive impact on society. Fissiparous tendencies are still causing balkanization and India may yet become smaller.

Hindu Tantiis are not guided by Puranic rule, nor are the Muslim julahas guided by the Alimfazil rules, they are more under Maulana domination. 

The language of their cultural expression, their mother tongue is Bhojpuri in the Bhojpur area and Bagheli in Neither of them use Hindi or Urdu as their the Bagheli area.

industry since there are many weavers in the state, Resham is mulberry silk and the silk worms can be grown on the Shahtoot tree. 

The wood of this tree can be used to manufacture sporting goods which are today manufactured in Ludhiana. 

There are 3 varieties of non-mulberry silk:

1. Tasar

Eranda Tasar worms can be grown on Sakhua and Berry trees.

2. Endi

Endi worms Can be grown on Endi trees.

3. Munga

Munga worms can be grown on Drumstick trees known as Shobhaunjan in Sanskrit. 

Industries should be developed utilising both varieties of silk. 

**However, such industries should not depend on subsidies, as they invariably run at loss and deplete the collective wealth.** 

If Japan can develop industries based on genuine silk and artficial silk, then why can't India?


Prayag. Feb. 6, 1984

Baba travelled by boat to Prayag-sangam where the Yamuna merges in the Ganga. 

While sitting on the boat, He observed: the land between the Ganga and the Yamuna, starting from Gangottari and Yamunottari, was known as Brahma varta during Vedic times. It later became known as Shurasena during the time of the Mahabharata. 

Its capital before the era of the Mahabharata was Vrshnipura. 

The name of the place where the distance between the Yamuna and the Ganga was less than 10 miles was Brahmarshi Desa, while Vindhyamekhala was the name of the country in ancient times. 

Vindhyamekhala is divided into 2 parts:

1. The western side was called Bundelkhand 
2. The eastern side was called Baghelkhand

Since the Yamuna river passes through black cotton soil, the colour of the river-water appears to be bluish. 

The Ganga passes through yellow soil, so its colour appears to be white. 

Krsna Dvaepayan's grand father was a fisherman in an island-village situated in the trans-Yamuna region and located on black cotton soil. Being born on an island of black soil he was known as Krsna Dva payana Vyasa.

The language spoken in the trans-Ganga area is Avadhi and Braja while in the south of the Yamuna river people speak Bundeli, Avadhi, Braja and Bundeli are the offshoots of Shaurseni Parkrta. 

In the upper portion of Brahmavarta, the people's language is Jatu-Hariyanavii. 

The offshoots of Shauraseni Prakrta : Avadhi, Braja, Bagheli, Bundeli and Hariyanavii had philological similarity, the verb endings get changed according to the changes in the number and gender of the subject.

Prayag was once the cultural centre of India before the Aryans proceeded eastward. 

Afterwards, Varanasi became the cultural hub of India, and continues to be so even now.

When our motor boat passed near the fort Baba said: The fort dates back to the time of the Pandavas. 

Akshya bata (Banyan tree) is also very old. 

Kaushambi is a historical place. 

In ancient times, civilizations grew around river valleys. 

Kaushambi developed on the banks of the Saraswati river. 

It was a great centre of Therapanthi Jainism. 

Later, when the Saraswati vanished due to the raising of the riverbed, Kaushambi also lost its significance.
