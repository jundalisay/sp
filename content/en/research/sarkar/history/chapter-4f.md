## Kota, March 15, 1984

Baba came to Kota from Jaipur and visited Badoli temple.

Walking in the vicinity during Baba said Digambar Jainism was earlier than Svetambar: Gauriya style of architecture came up 1300 years ago, Shiva-linga of BE gambar Jainism varies from that of Shvetambar. 

Puranicism is based on the glory of rivers.

 Due to clash and cohesion caused by whirls of rivers, stones take an oval shape. 

 In the river Gandaki, there is a lot of subteranian whirlwinds near the border of lithi and Uttar Pradesh; as a consequence the stone takes an eval form near the village known as Shaligram, representing Vin Visnu represents Brahmanda which is also oval-shaped. 

 Later Buddha was taken as incarnation of Visnu.

 Visnu in the form of Buddha spoke against yajina, against puranic dharma.

 And so the Puranics told:
 - not to worship shaligram, the representative of Visnu,
 - do not put Tulsi-Patra (leaves) on it.

Aryans came to this place via Jammu, Punjab and Hariyana and settled down here. 

It was the first settled principality of Aryans in this area. 

To consecrate the place, they performed Yajina, millions of animals were killed, heaps of skulls and bones piled here, also heap of skin was thrown here.

Hence the river was known as Charmanvati which got transferred as Carmanval and Cambala in Harauti and Bundeli.

This place was the hot bed of Digambar Jainism. 

Shiva is pre-Aryan and pre-Jainism deity. 

The Shiva lingam here is a blending of 3 trends:

1. Pre-Aryan
2. Aryan
3. Jainism

The Shiva lingam is quadrangle-shaped-a blending of Digambar.

It is an old Jainism, Shvetambar Jainism and Pauranicism. Jain temple and now a Shiva-temple, The style of temple is that of Digambar Jainism. 

The priest would not be a Gaur Brahman, The temple is made of granite stone. The Shiva is three. faced Trimurti, symbolising creation, maintenance and destruction.

in
Jainism faded from Rajasthan, about 1600-1700 years 80, This temple had been constructed in 5th-6th century, when Jainism was fading and Pauranicsm was on the advent. Pauranicsm, there is no worship of a naked Shiva, Shiva has tiger's skin on his body. "Vyaghrambara" is Hindu Shiva.

Nandi exists with Puranic Shiva. 

Jain Shiva is expressed as naked Shiva or in linga form. 

Puranic Shiva was worshipped in the form of Jyotirlinga and Vanalinga. 

There are 12 expressions of Shiva.

The architecture of Durga temple is of Rajawara style. 

The idol of Bhavani normally contains eight hands and in Bengal Durga idol has 10 hands. Here the idol has 10 hands. This is the influence of Gauriya Brahmans. 

Since the idol is broken. there is no head, worship of the idol is not possible, worship of broken idol is forbidden. 

The Devi is 'Jatajutasamayukta' Purnendu Nama'na' (With long hair and full moon on head). The toes of the left leg are on the head of demon Mahisa. Gaur Brahmans would have brought this idol.

Baba looked at Surya Mandir and said the temple is 1600-1700 years old, constructed by Shakaldvipi Brahmans, later the idol was destroyed. 

The style of outer portion is of Shakaldvip. The idol is muslim-like (Yavanrupii figure, having rosary or Tasvi ( rosary of muslim style ).

The history of Rajasthan can be found from this place. 

It was the meeting point of 'Hada and Mewar area'. 

The spoken language is Harauti.

The surya-temple must have jewels in it which would have been stolen. 

The temple was not destroyed by Mohammedans since Hadas accepted the suzerainty of Dehli and not soveignty while Mewar accepted none though they were defeated in battle and so the temple was not destroyed by Mohammedans.

In ancient days, the language of this area was Sanskrit.

During the days of Digambar Jains, it was Malvi Prakrta.

Later, it was Urdu and then Hindi. 

About 60/70 years ago, Haraut was in common use. 

Harauti is a full-fledged language with al the glamours of a living language. Ladies, in the villages, under stand only Harauti. 

If the mother tongue is not elevated to its proper status, people also do not make progress. Jainism was widely propagated in dry area, hence tank is commonly found i Jain-temples.

There is a tank in Pavapuri' and also in this temple, it is quite old. When Muslims invaded Mewar they could have destroyed the idols. 

But in that case, they would have destroyed the whole idol. 

Here only the hands of idols are broken, so that the broken idols could not be worshipped. 

It might have been done by Puranics.

Shashanka was the king of Rarh (Bengal), a Shaeva.

He destroyed non-Shaeva temples and idols.

Aryans migrated via Khyberpass, northwards they went to Pamir and north-west Ladakh, southeast wards they came to Punjab, Hariyana and this land. 

Upper valley is known as Chambal valley.

Aryans sacrificed millions of animals to consecrate this land.

Due to the enormous heap of skin (charma), the river was known as Charmanvati which later became Chambal.
