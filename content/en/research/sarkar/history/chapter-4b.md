The shakas came to India from Middle East Asia.

Three groups of people came to India during the beginning of the Christian era:

1. Shaka
2. Huna
3. Kushan

A branch of Kushans was known as 'Yue-Chi' 

Kajul Kadphisus was the king of Kushan dynasty, Kanishka was his successor, who ruled over west and north India. Vashiska was his sun, but his later successors became very weak.

In Sirohi, Brahmans belong to Nagar section. 

Here they are Gaur Brahmins. People in India knew to make steel before the invasion of Mohammad Ghori In Prithwi Raj Stambha (tomb) and Kutub Minar, no rusting has yet occurred. 

Here in the cannon, if it is white, it would be either sine, or a galvanised amalgam. (It is told here that the cannon contains alloy.) 

The cannon should be securely maintained.

This place represents epoch-making glorious element of history. The history of the place should be recorded. 

The history of Rajasthan is not properly taught. Without a brave Rajasthan, India would have been enslaved earlier. 

Jodhpur-Bikaner area was the first line of defence. 

Ganganagar is now green and fertile, previously it was a desert. 

In Bam'la language there are 15-20 books on history of this place. 

It is only 1% of what it is. 

After Shankaracarya's Mayavada, Hindus developed a defective outlook that this world is a mirage, apathetic to history.

It is a dangerous mentality.

D. L. Rai was a poet cum dramatist. He travelled from village to village, recorded the songs which charans (folk singers) were singing, collected the old records and wrote history. 

Ramesh Dutt, a famous ICS officer, was a known historian. 

He was in Baroda quite long.

He came here and wrote the history book, 'The Last Evening of the Rajputs of Rajasthan". 

Ajmer and Marwar states were under the British suzerainty, the king cooperated with Ramesh Dutt, since he was an ICS officer. 

Maharashtra Jewan Prabhat ("The Dawn of Life of Maharashtra)" was his second book. Very few have tried to write the real history of Rajasthan.

Carans (folk singers) are also getting extinct. 

No other place has such a glittering history like that of Rajasthan. 

People are lions and not sheep. In the old days, the brave kings. provided inspiration and leadership. In later days, no leadership could be provided. 

As a consequence, mutual bickerings and battles destroyed them. 

After the fall of Raja Dahir (A.D. 712), they should have become alert. If they would have been vigilantly attentive, there would not have been a Moghul rule in India. 

After the defeat of Dahir, Mohummad Ibn kasim did not dare to march ahead only because he knew that the people of Rajasthan were very brave.

Jaipur, March 11, 1984

Baba visited the garden of the queen of Sisodia. It contained a terrace garden. Looking at the place, Baba said:

The queen of Sisodia hailed from Udaipur. 

She was:
- named Padmavati or Ratnavali. 
- the father's sister of Chandravall, sister of Amar Singh.

The north of Duggarpur in the central portion of Mewar is the water barrier of South Rajasthan. Neythians of Rajasthan were Sisodias.

In Malvi Prakrta, Duggar means small hill. 

Malvi Prakrta existed as a spoken language about 3500 years ago. From it emerged Gujarati (spoken in the eastern portion ). 

Malvi (spoken in the western portion) and Rajasthani (spoken in the southern portion) From western demi-Malvi emerged Marwari, Mewait, Harauti and Dhundhari (a blending of Mewani and Haraut), which are the modern spoken languages of the people. 

A blending of Marwari and Harauti is Mewati'. 

In the soouthern portion, Gujarati and Saurashtri blended together to produce 'Kacchi', which has also a blended impact of Gujarati and Hindhi. 'Cha' is commonly used in Kacchi.

Brahmans east of Magadha were known as Gaura Brahmans Brahmans of the land of molasses (gur, palm gur). Gur Desh (the land of Gaura) comprised in it one third of west Hangat and two thirds of Bangladesh. 

About 1200 years ago, during the post Buddhist and Puranic age, there was a Brahman convention at Allahabad, where only 10 sections of Brahmans were recognized as Brahmans. 

Those who were vegetarian and did not eat fish. 

They were 5 Gauriya and 5 Dramil Brahmans. 

The 5 Gauriya Brahmans were:

1. Saraswata (mostly of Kashmir, Jammu and Punjab)
2. Kanyakubja (of west U.P.)
3. Nagars (in the southern portion of Sirohi, south of Rajasthan and Gujrat )
4. Gauras
5. Macthils of Mithila. 

<!-- 84 -->

The 5 Dramil were:

1. Citpavans of Maharastra
2. Utkals of Orissa
3. Taclang of Andhra
4. Tamil of Tamil Nadu
5. Kannada of Karnataka

Fish eaters were not recognised as Brahmans:

1. Nambodari of Kerala (who had migrated to Kerala from Bengal by sea)
2. Gaura Saraswata
3. Pai
4. Senoy

According to the Puranic system:
- Brahman should not eat fish
- Kasttriya can take fish only in the battle
- Vaeshyas shall not eat fish
- The Bratyas (Shudras) can take fish

The 3 higher castes shall also become Bratayas if they do not follow this rule of caste system.

Gaur Brahmans do reside here. 

That's why you find Gauriya style of architecture here, Gauriya style originated from Bengal.

All the Puranic temples including those of Shiva are in Gauriya style But Jaina and Buddha temples are not found in Gauriya style.
