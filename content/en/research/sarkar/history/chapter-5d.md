The religio-cultural history of Rarh has been influenced by several religions.

The impact of Digambara Jainism and Vaisnavism, for example, is quite evident in the Suvarnarekha valley civilization and at places there is a blending of Digambar Jainism and Mahayani Buddhism.

Buddhism believs in Dukkhvada or the theory of sorrow.

It is basically a negative philosophy. 

It has 4 noble truths or Catura'jya saccam-Duhkha:

1. pain is the eternal truth 

Duhkhasya Karanam, 

that there must be a reason for sorrow of pain: Duhkhanivritti, 

that there is liberation from pain and Dukkhanivrttiupaya, 

that there is a path to liberation from pain. 

Buddhism as Buddha taught was neither nihilism no cynicism. 

Later however a blending emerged and Atisukhavada, the opposite of Duhkhavada, was propounded. 

Buddhism was divided into 2 schools:

1. Mahayana
2. Hinayana

In India, Mahayana was dominant while Lamaism was dominant in Tibet. 

At Boudh Gaya, a blending of Mahayana and Hinayana took place. 

A blending of Jainism. Buddhism and Pauranicism has also taken place in India, and is evident by the acceptance of the same deities by these faiths.

Nudism is the special characteristic of Digambara Jainism.

It was not encouraged by either Buddhism or Puranicism. 

The nude Kali idol can be found at several places the banks of rivers near Tatanagar. 

Kali was originally a Jain deity but later Buddhism and Hinduism accepted Kalii as a daily, Bajra Tara and Niil Tara were Buddhist deities which were alan accepted by Hindus. 

The white Saraswati was derived from the Hill Tara of Hinduism. A blending of Jainism and non- Jainism is evident in the acceptance of deities like Shitala and Manasa.

A blending of deities is an indication of blending of cultures and civilisations. This is especially evident in Rarh which has composite culture and a rich history.

Despite this tradition, same monarchs. notably King Shasanka of Rarh, were fanatic Bhaevas King Shasanka was responsible for destroying and disfiguring several non-Shaeva Jain and Bhuddhist deities in Horthern and eastern India.

Even today Jainism continues to influence the culture of Bath.

For example, the Brahmans of Utkal and Rarh do not perform the duties of priests in the social and religious functions of several original Bengali castes and tribes. 

Pandeys who are Jain Brahmans, are accepted by these tribes as their priests. 

In the religious function of Casu Mahato, Brahmans do not act as priests And this is another example of the influence of Jainism on the traditions of Rarh.

The worship of Tusu Devi, and the observance of Tusu Parva is a unique phenomenon in Rarh. 

Bhadumani and Tusumani were the daughters of the King of Manbhum who lived about thirteen hundred years ago. 

The worship of Tusudevi is an honour to Tusumani although Brahmans have no role in this  religious festival.

The language of ancient Rarh was Sanskrit and Rarhii Bengali is full of Tadbhava or Sanskrit words. 

However Austric influence on the language is also evident, especially on the dialects of Kheriya Munda, Singh Munda, Bhumij and Bauri. 

Early scripts found in Rarh were rectangular and were used between the 2nd-12th centuries AD.

A similar script has been found on Susunia hill in the District of Bankura and is a transmuted form of Sri Harsha script. 

This dialect is known as Kera Bam'la from Angara to Mednipur (Sadar) and Gopiballabhpur.

Bamla script has also been discovered at Jayada where it was the script of Macthili, Chiya and Anamiese about 2,000 years ago.

Varahabhum or Varabhum and Patamda' are situated in the Suvarnarekha valley, and Bhavalbhum is located at the junction of the Khadga and Ruvarnarekha rivers. Raja Dhaval Deo was the King. 

'Cha' dance was invented by him at Bag- mundi: 'Che' means 'behaviour and character'; 

'Cho' dance has 3 styles:

1. hanbhum style where a mask is used
2. Dhavalbhum style where a mask may or may not be usd
3. Mayurabhanja style where a mask is not used.

Dhavalbhu'm was also known as Porahat rajya. 

Two brothers of the Rajya fought on the bank of the river Sanjaya.

As a result, the Rajya was divided.

The northern portion became known as Kharawan and the southern portion was called Saraikela'. 

To the south of Saraikela' is Adityapur, where Aditya Narain Singh Deo ruled. 

Further south is Famadia' which was ruled by Tamadia' Raja about 450 years ago but he was conquered by the king of Ratu who belonged to the Kheria munda' tribe.

To the west of Tamadia is Barh and to the west of Rarh is Chotanagpur. 

Sadani is the language spoken by the people of Tamadia. 

The Hod language of the Ora'on tribe was influenced by the Dravidians while the Hu'ra language of the Mura'ja tribe is similar to the Santha'i language. 

The people of the Muraj tribe ace short and have curly hair and a black complexion.

This area has immense horticultural potential.

Grapes, pears, citrus, papayas, guavas, pumpkins, long potatoes, Kudaris and Poppy seeds can be grown well here. 

Kudari keeps the body cool but does not have any food value.

The history of culture and civilisation of this area is rich and versatile. 

Almost 2,500 years ago, people were educated and advanced in different aspects of civilisation but today they have been made backward.
