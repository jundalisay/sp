Jaipur, March 10, 1984

{{< f f="Jaipur is the capital of Rajasthan which has a glorious record of warriors and fighters. The civilisation around it depicts the influence of Tantra, Jainism and also of Sakaldwipi Brahmans who were worshippers of Sun-god." >}}


Baba came to Jaipur from Delhi and visited the fort Jaigarh. 

It has a cannon named Jaibana, which:
- is 20 feet long, weighing 50 tons, with a range of 45 kilometers
- was built by Jai Singh

Jai Singh 1st started the construction of the city of Jaipur.

His grandson Jai Singh 2nd completed it.

Jai Singh requested Allah Dastur Peer of Bengal, for the town-planning of Jaipur. 

He could not come here. 

Puspadhar Mitra, of Krishnagar (Bengal) came and got Jaipur constructed.

Jaipur is the oldest planned city of India. 

Chandigarh is the second planned city. 

Paris is also a planned city.

The state of Jaipur extended up to Bikaner. 

It had been the biggest state of Rajasthan. 

Previously, Jodhpur was the biggest state.

When the Thar desert seceded from Jodhpur, Jaipur was included in Sindh and became the biggest one. 

Thar was a Hindu-majority area.
- It should not have been included in Pakistan.

The spoken language of Thar was Thari-Marvari, a blending of Marvari and Jodhpuri. 

The old light railway of Jodhpur extended up to Thar.

Jaipur was the biggest state of Rajasthan. But its prestige went down when Mansingh compromised with Akbar, because his commander got a family daughter married to the Mughal Emperor.

Consequently, Jaipur got looked down before Cittor, Udaipur, Bikaner and Kota states.

Babar was the first person who used firearms in India in the first battle of Panipath in 1526 in which Ibrahim Lodi was defeated. 

After this battle, India learned firearms. 

Jai Singh 2nd got this cannon made. 

Puskar, a sacred place, had a big and strong fort. 

Jaipur kings fought many sanguinary battles with Pushkar but could not conquer it.

In Sanskrit, Ambar means that which touches the sky, when 'ma' and 'ta' are after 'ma' it becomes 'ma' in Malvi-Prakrta.

And so Ambar became Ammar as Amrta becomes 'Ammirasa'. In old Rajasthan Ammar became Ammera, in modern Rajasthani it is known as Amera.

In Bengal, 12 landlords did not accept the sovereignty of the Moghul Emperor.

Pratapaditya Rai was their leader. 

Moghul emperor attacked twice but could not succeed against Pratapaditya. 

Thereafter, Mansingh was sent as commander of the army to conquer Pratapaditya Rai who lost the battle. 

Mansingh made him a prisoner to bring him to Agra. 

Dhakeshwari Devi was the goddess deity of Pratapaditya. 

Mansingh brought this deity and established it in this fort (Jaigarh). He also brought the priest from Bengal. 

In the area of Ramana of Dacca there was a deity known as Ramana Kali who is known as Dhakeshvari Devi.

The city of Jaipur is famous for the 5 P's:

1. Palace
2. Prince
3. Peacock
4. Pink
5. Path

It is a place of glory. Old Jaipur also exists today. 

Sabera dynasty, originally kings of Udaipur, came here (Jaipur) from Mewar and settled down, to become rulers of Jaipur.

The Scythian people of Mewar are small but stout and mighty in strength. 

Ksattriyas of Mewar and Jaipur areas differ facially. 

In the south of Mount Abu Scythians had Gujrati influence and have betel type round face. 

In the northwest of Marvari area, distorted Marvari is spoken.
