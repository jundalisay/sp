Allahabad, February 7, 1984

Baba visited Kaushambi near Allahabad. 

Kaushambi was named after Rsi Kaushamba, an ancient Indian sage who had Rsi-kula (ashram) two centuries before Buddha. 

During Buddha's time, Kaushambi was the seat of learning in India and grew into a large city.

Kaushambi was situated on the banks of the Saraswati river. 

The river flooded and destroyed the city which was rebuilt. 

If the area is excavated, the old city will be found in the second layer beneath the surface. 

When the Saraswati river ceased to exist due to an earthquake, the city lost its significance. 

The soil in the vicinity is sandy, a reminder of the Saraswati's impact on the land.

The temple Baba visited at Kaushambi contains nude male idols which have mukutas or head-dresses resembling a snake. 

Snakes are also carved on the outer side of the walls of the temple and the temple gates indicated the impact of Jainism on the temple architecture. 

Flowers, garlands and sandal paste are offered to the idols of the temple. 

The main deity is Padmaprabhu and a leg-print on a lotus with 6 or 12 petals can also be seen in the temple. 

The priest wears a sacred thread and uses the title Jain while this village is popularly called Garhwa.

In court papers, it is still known as Kaushambi.

## Allahabad, February 9, 1984

Today Baba visited Bithura where there is a Valmiki Ashram, a temple of Sita, Lava and Kusha, and an idol of Saptarsi on which a snake is carved. 

In 1762, the second Baji Rao Peshwa constructed the main temples here but no ancient book or manuscript is available which might reveal something of the cultural history of the area. 

The Brahmans living here are mainly Dwivedis of the Rgvediya branch, and are mostly vegetarian. A Shiva temple is also situated here. 

Baba observed:


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
The land between the Ganga and the Jamuna rivers was known as Brahma'varta during Vedic times. Vrsnipura was its capital. 

Vrsnipura is of great archaelogical and historical significance.

The bricks found here give an indication of its age. 

The Aryans came here through:
- Jambu-dwiipa or Jammu
- Sapta Sindhu or Punjab
- Harita dhanya or Hariyana 

They travelled the long distance to Allahabad in different phases. 

The land between the Ganga and the Jamuna rivers where the distance was less than 18 kilometers was very fertile, and was known as Brahmarsi Desh, a part of Brahmavarta. 

Some 3,500 years ago, during the days of the Mahabharata, it was known as Shurasena, and its capital was in Mathura. 

<!-- * Lava and Kusha are sons of Ram born to Sita according to the epic Ramayana. -->

Kamsa ruled over this land during the time of Krishna. 

A complete history of the area based on thorough research has yet to be written. 

The Kayasthas of Mathura are known as Mathur Shurasena and were situated on the other side of the Ganga.

The Kayasthas living there are known as Sakhasena. 

Vrindavana was situated outside Brahmavarta.

Avadha comprised of the area in and around Brahmavarta. 

The language of Shurasena was derived from Sanskrit. 

Some 4,000 years ago the language spoken to the east of Prayaga was Magadhi Prakrit.

To the west of Prayaga Shauraseni Prakrit was spoken.

Shauraseni Prakrit gave birth to 5 daughter languages:

1. Avadhi
2. Bundeli
3. Bagheli
4. Braja
5. Hariyanavi

Hariyanavi was spoken to the west of the Jamuna river. 

Further west, Paeshacii Prakrit was once the popular language, giving birth to 4 daughter languages:

1. Dogri
2. Pahari
3. Punjabi
4. Multani

Vesnipura was situated on the bank of the Ganga river. 

The soil here is alluvial and very soft. 

Normally, hard soil is compressed one inch every 100 years.

But soft soil can be compressed 6-8 inches during the same period. 

The land here has receded greatly and flood has frequently occurred. 

About 3,000 to 4,000 years ago, Vrsnipura was completely destroyed due to severe flood.

The capital was shifted to Mathura. 

The soil around the Jamuna river is of the black cotton variety. 
- It is very good for growing cotton and wheat. 

Between 500 and 1.200 years ago, Vrsnipura faced another severe flood, completely destroying the city again and killing many people. 

For many years people were afraid to live there as they had a deep fear of ghosts and believed that the city was haunted. 

It took 200-300 years before people resettled in the city. 

Historically, Vrsnipura is very similar to Mohenjodaro.

Shankaracharya lived around 1,300 years ago.
- He was not popular in this area. 

Kapil, the first philosopher in the world was more popular.

A temple was constructed here in his memory. 

Shiva was his Ista or deity of worship, hence a Shiva temple was also constructed here.
