Kaia, 19th March, 1984

We visited, in the afternoon, Phuta-talab, a place 70 kilome- er away from Kota. Baba did not go to this place. We saw the statue of standing Ganesh more than 5 ft. high. 

There was no red thread on the idol, nor there were Shiva-Parvati, nor a mouse. The priest was a Jata (a section of ksattriya) of Lahore, of pre Pakistan days. 

All around the idol there were walls except southwards, from which side water would come in and 2' ft. of the idol would get merged in water. On the northern side there was an outlet for water. 

All around the place, there is habitation of Gujjars ( a section of tribals). According to the Jata-priest, people came to worship on Wednesdays. 

In the nearby forest Nahar variety of lions are found. The entire scene depicted that in the long past, it must have been the habitation of tribals and tribal chief. Below the Ganesh idol there was stone.

When the detail of the place was told to Baba, He said:

It is pre-Aan Ganch, the temple might have been con- structed later his dead Brahm The Rajwara style stone may have been taken hum previous tribes like Bhils. Aryans came to this place from north west, and the original tribes were driven way to auth western direction the forests. They were not rustics but cultured people.


Gwalior, 21st March 1984

Baba came to Gwalior from Kots. During His stay here, He visited Phoolbag and said

This has been the place of Chandela Rajputs. Less than 2000 years ago, there was king Chandraketu who was the founder of Chandels dynasty. Temples existed here, these are the ruins of these temples. Chandela dynasty ruled around Gwalior. Marathas were divided into Ave sections, three of them are in Madhya Pradesh. 

Seindhias of Gwalior are one of them. Bundelkhand is the oldest land of Madhya Pradesh. It was known as Vindhya me- khla from Vaidie to Mahabharata age, it extended from Char- manvati (Chambal) valley to Harmada valley. In modern times it is known as Bundelkhanda. 

Its modern language is Bundeli, its original script was Maudi. The local people of business commu- nity write in Maudi' script which is easy to write but difficult to read.

The wave of Jainism dominated this area, Buddhist and Pauranic waves were also present. Shiva's influence could also be found, presence of Shaktism and Vaesha'avism can also be found to some extent, but Krisna is not present. Digambar and

<!-- 107 -->

Swetambar sects had their influence, but Therapanthis were very less in Nonnici, there are 101 Jain temples. It is the oldest complex of Digambar Jain temples. 

Vindhyamekhla had also experienced Jain influences. Beyond Kota upto Jabbalpur, Diga- mbar Jains dominated. Amba, Ambika and Varahi are the Jain Tantrika deities.

In Khajuraho, three types of temples-old, medieval and modern-are present. Native states except Baroda. Trivandrum and Cochin did no welfare work in the realm Education and public utility. History was not recorded, rather it was destroyed. After Bhonsles' defeat in the battle at Shita- baldi, Haspur was annexed by the British. 

Jabbalpur was included in Moghul empire after the defeat of Rani Durgavati. Later the British annexed it. Thus Nagpur and Jabbalpur were in British empire and the rest of the land was included in the native.

As said cartier Marathas were divided into 5 sections:

1. Bhonales of Haspur
2. Seindhias of Gwalior
3. Holkars of Indore
4. Gaikwads of Baroda
5. Peshwas of Pune. 

According to Macaulay the native states of India did only two things-building palaces and hunting animals; of couse, Gaikwada of Baroda had founded the famous university at Boroda.

On the western side of Vindhyamekhla people's language is Bundeli and on the east it is Bagheli. In the daughter languages of Anaurament Praketa Avadhi, Braj, Hariyanvi, Bundeli and Health" is not pronounced, 'sa' is pronounced. 

Urdu, Persian and Arable words were taken out, and Samskita words were added, it became Hindi which is not the mother tongus of any people. During the Pathan period, Harauti was the state language, beyond Moraina. There is a blending of Bra, Bundeli and Harauti at Shivapuri.

Fins Indica (Devadaru) or junior variety, is found here. The back of the place is very congenial for growing Pine Indica. De man god and daru means wood.

Pine Indica needs water- tigation in summer, only for two years, thereafter top grade paper and matchstick can be manufactured from it. Industries help to the poor. Brahmans of this place belong subsection of Kanyakubja group, a few Gaur Brahmans may also be found. Citpavan Brahman of H rasthra are also found in the city and around it use Karamkar, Kher and Kar as title-

The old inhabitants of the place were Gond whe towards south east into forest. The maximum number of t migrated to Mewar. Gonds were well-to-do people two sections-Dhruva Gond and Raja Gond. Raja Gon fair in colour, they became Rajputs and became rulers of states. Dhruva Gond were of soil-colour. Cultural hy the land is one with Rarh. Both have similarity. Cows of place are small like those of Rarh. 

They eat grass directly, milk is sweet, for the cows grass is enough to feed them cultural heritage of the place dates back between 7,500 and years ago. There should be ancient temple with Shiva Both Shiva linga, and Pauranic Shiva linga, folk songs reg Shiva and Krsna can be found in Bundeli.

The level of Hands is lower than the sea, people have constructed dikes the land and the sea. 

They have constructed wind-wheels the dyke through which mechanical energy is converted into trical energy. They provide cheap electricity to Holland.

Sindhias have snake and sun as their symbol. Shakaldviipi Brahmans were sun-worshippers. They had come to India, some
years ago, from Sacdonia (South Russia) due to fear of con- rain into Islam. 

They came from the north-west and did not ve in the Vedas. In Chattisgarh there are three sections of Brahmans-Chattisgarhi Kanojia. non-Chhattisgarhi Kanojia and Whakaldvipi Brahmans. Digambar Jains had little influence Hindhias, Shakaldvipis had some influence on them. 

Sindhias are more originally Austrico-scythian, the Ksatriyas started calling themselves as Marat'ha. Muslims started calling themselves as parate caste or race, but how can it be? They also speak Hundell'. Bundeli has an antiquity of 950 years. Bundeli intona- Han has 'a' in prominence. 

The non-development of mother-ton- que is one of the causes of people's backwardness. When mother language is suppressed, people lose confidence in themselves, they become hewers of wood and drawers of water. Mother language is a must. In Chhattisgarhi "Sha" is pronounced, in Bunde'li it is not. 

Bundeli has unwritten grammar. In its ancient days, Ham'skrta also had no written grammar, Pan'i'ni came 6000 years after the birth of Sam'skrta. Oriya and Assamese had also no grammar. Ram Chandra Bhanjdeva provided grammar to Oriya some 125 years ago. Konkani got the recognition of a lang- uage only 10-12 years before.

The dialect of Gwalior is Khari Bundeli, standard Bundeli Gwalior is the nerve centre of Bundelkhand.

Baba visited a place known at ChatariPark on His ficid walk. 

He observed
Swetambar Jaina tofuence shall be found in this area. 

The influence of Therapanth fans very me, it is only on the north eastern side. The culture of much eastern Bundelkhand varies from the south western side Hundehand has a special intonation in its music Khajuraho represents Bundelkhand culture. Nudism is the consequence of the binding of Digambar Jainism and Jain Tantra. 

It is not shame but an expression of cultural blending. People who do not understand this cultural expression, misrepresent it. 

Buddhist Tantra has its influence on the sun- temple situated on the northern side

Chambal valley is a fighting and. The history of Chandella Rajputs is one of victory Gautamiputra Satkarni of Andhra (2nd century A. D.) was a great Rghter, but he could not conquer and enter Maiva. Hatari was checked and could not enter Bundelkhand.

The Valdic name of the land was Vindhyamekhala'. 

The coveted language of the people is Bundeli on the western side of it, and Baghell on the eastern side. These langu- ges are fast getting extinct. This could affect the self-respect of the people. 

In Oxford University, there are 2 Bam'la speaking professors (Banerji and Chatterji ).

When they meet, they speak Bengali with each other. 

Inferiority complex towards one's own mother-tongue is a defective mentality, Temples here do not claim very long antiquity. 

Medieval history is not being properly taught. Satya Narayan worship started during later Pathan period-it is a blending of Pile-ism and Pauranic ism. 

There is no Sanskrit Dhyan mantra of Satya Narayan. Historically Visnu has four forms (1300-1500 years ago) Pratihar Visnu, Parihara- Visnu, Lokeshvar Visnu and Lokayata Vianu. In this land


<!-- 111 -->

Lokeshvar Viu shall not be found. 

It is in Gangetic Valley where Buddhism prevailed. 

All those deities have been created by the blending of Buddhist tantra, Jain tantra and Pauranicism. Visnu is a Pauranie deity, while Indra, Agni, Varun are Vaidic gads. 

Blending of deities means blending of cultures. Pir-ism is a blending of Islamic sunnism and Pauranicism. There have been no blending of Islamic shiaism. 

Indian sufism blended with Vaisnavian of south India. Indian sufism had Persian origin, while the official book of Vaisnavism is Bhagwat Sha- aura in Banskrit, written 1200 years ago Vaisnavism is a post- Buddhist concept. It is not very old. Bhagwat Shastra, not Srimad Bhagwat, was dictated by Narad. 

Vaisnav-ism had its influence here Ramananda's influence was aiso here. Bundelkhand is the land of Shaiva cult; old Shiva temples can be found here. 

Jainism, Buddhism, and Pauranicism recognised Shiva as deity. Kall, at goddess, was accepted by Buddhism and Paurancism, Tara was accepted as goddess by all the three. 

Tibet Buddhism accepted Faras Uara Tara. Bajra Tara and Niil Tara. The idol of Mill Tara is also found in Boudh Gaya. Niil Tara got trans- formed as white haraswati as Pauranik deity, a few hundred years aga Cultural history is a happy blending in the entire universe.
