Kumarayan Bhatt, a learned person of Kashmir, propagated Buddhism in China. 

His wife was a Tibetan lady. 

His son Kumarjiiva also preached Buddhism. Kumarjiiva was one of the greatest learned men of Kashmir.
- His father was "Kumarayan"
- His mother was "Jilva"

And so he was named Kumarajiiva.

The great philosopher, Jayanta Bhatt, also belonged to Kashmir.

He wrote a famous book Nyayamanjari, on Nyaya philosophy in Sarada script.

Sarada had 3 forms:

1. Punjabi Sarada
2. Duggar Sarada
3. Kashmiri Sarada

Brahmans also belonged to 3 categories:

1. Punjabi Brahman
2. Duggar Saraswata
3. Kashmir Saraswata

Palm tree was not found here. Bhurja-patra was used as writing paper. If research is undertaken, manuscript of Nyayamanjari can be found.

Pahari Punjabi is spoken from Kangara to Simla. 

Punjabi is the spoken language of the people from Ropar. From Ambla, the spoken language is Hariyanvil. 

Shaorseni Prakrit is the language of Doab or Shursena. 

Up to Banihal, the spoken language was Paeshachi Prakrit.

North of it, the language was Pashchatya Prakrit.

It includes Kashmiri, Tazaki languages.

Kashmiri is related with Pashto. 

In Pasheatya Prakrit, compound words are formed with the help of 'sii' as possessive case. 

The language of Sialkot is Dogri while that of Rawalpindi is a blended form of Dogri and Punjabi.

- 'Pinda' means food.
- 'Pindika' is where food was cooked and taken

The place where Aryans cooked and took food in their nomadic life was called rindika by them.

Gold was found in the river Tawi. 

In Vedic language, gold was called Jambunada, Suvarna, Kanaka. 

In this area, ripe wheat is also called 'Kanaka'. 

'Godhuma' was transmuted to 'Gonduma' then into 'Ganduma' then into 'Gohun' and finally into 'Gehun' which means wheat.

**Kashmir is the oldest seat of Aryan civilization in India.** 

Jammu had a university during the days of King Harsh. 

Temples were demolished during the Muslim rule. When temples and mosques are demolished history gets destroyed. 

Due to the destruction of temples, the history of Kasmir remains unknown. 

When the religious places are demolished, it hurts the sentiment of people and also destroys history. 

We should preserve them, they reveal the history of people and their society. 

Proper research and knowledge of history are essential.

The ruins of Buddhist period are here. The Buddhist range included:
- Jammu, Kashmir
- North West Frontier Provinces
- West Punjab
- Kumayun
- Garhwal and Nepal

Mahayani Buddhism prevailed here. There was no influence of Jainism in this area. 
- Therapanthi Jainism existed in the east of Punjab. 

Shitala, Marichi and Harifi were Buddhist goddesses. 

Kandahar had:
- the biggest Buddhist centre 
- its own school of art and architecture

The people of Kandahar embraced Islam.
- 95% of Kashmiri population have been converted to Islam.

In Jammu province, 35% of population are muslims. 

By embracing Islam, they are leaving their sentimental legacy. 

Kandahar architecture is an offshoot of Indian art and architecture.

The Buddhist belt extended from Sinkiang of China to east Afghanistan and Nepal.

Garhwal, Kumayun and Sirmaur were in one kingdom called Udayan rajya. 

Naban was its capital. 

Padma-sambhava, a Buddhist from Garhwal crossed India and entered Kimpurushvarsa (Tibet). 

The colour of Padmasambhava's hair was like that of Padma (lotus), so he was called Padmasambhava.

The king of Tibet, Sranget Sen-Gampo embraced Buddhism. 

He had 2 wives:

1. One from Nepal, the daughter of Anshu Varman, a Newari girl known as Trikuti
2. The other a Chinese princess called Tenzing

Buddhism spread in China and Nepal through these queens.
