Kumarayan Bhatt, a learned person of Kashmir, propagated Buddhism in China. 

His wife was a Tibetan lady. 

His son Kumarjiiva also preached Buddhism. Kumarjiiva was one of the greatest learned men of Kashmir; his father's name was Kuma- rayan and mother's name was Jilva and so he was named Kumarajiiva.

The great philosopher, Jayanta Bhatt, also belonged to Kash- mir. He wrote a famous book Nyayamanjari, on Nyaya philo- sophy in Sarada script. Sarada had three forms-Punjabi Sarada, Duggar Sarada and Kashmiri Sarada Brahmans also belonged to three categories-Punjabi Brahman, Duggar Saraswata and Kashmir Saraswata. Palm tree was not found here, bhurja- patra was used as writing paper. If research is undertaken, manuscript of Nyayamanjari can be found.

Pahari Punjabi is spoken from Kangara to Simla. Punjabi is the spoken language of the people from Ropar, and from Ambla the spoken language is Hariyanvil. Shaorseni Prakrta is the lan- guage of Doab or Shursena. Upto Banihal the spoken language was Paeshachi Prakrta, north of it the language was Pashchatya Prakrta. It includes Kashmiri, Tazaki languages; Kashmiri is related with Pashto. In Pasheatya Prakrta, compound words are formed with the help of 'sii' as possessive case. The language of Sialkot is Dogri while that of Rawalpindi is a blended form of Dogri and Punjabi.
Pin'd'a means food and the place where food was cooked and taken is known as Pin'd'ika: the place where Aryans cooked and took food in their nomadic life was called rin'd'ika' by them.

Gold was found in the river Tawi. In Vaedic language gold was called Jambunada, Suvarna, Kanaka. In this area ripe wheat is also called 'Kanaka'. The word Gehun (wheat) is the trans- muted form of Godhu'ma-Godhu'ma to Gonduma to Gan- duma to Gohun and from it came Gehun.
Kashmir is the oldest seat of Aryan civilization in India. Jammu had a university during the days of King Harsh. Tem- ples were demolished during the Muslim rule. When temples and mosques are demolished history gets destroyed. 

Due to the destruction of temples, history of Kasmir remains unknown. When the religious places are demolished, it hurts the sentiment of people and also destroys history. We should preserve them, they reveal the history of people and their society. Proper research and knowledge of history are essential.

Jammu, March 3, 1984

Baba visited Dept. of Agricultural Science and Technology of Bheri Kasmir Univerity of Jammu and its horticulture res- earch centre Nearby was situated the temple of Shitala Devi at Udhowala, Jammu Tawi. Viewing it, Baba said:

The ruins of Buddhist period are availble here. Buddhist range included Jammu, Kashmir, North West Frontier Provinces, West Punjab, Kumayun, Garhwal and Nepal. Mahayani Bud- dhism prevailed here. There was no influence of Jainism in this Area. Therapanthi Jainism existed in the east of Punjab. 

Shitala, Marichi and Harifi were Buddhist goddesses. Kandahara had the biggest Buddhist centre. Kandahara had its own school of art and architecture. The people of Kandahar embraced Islam, 95% of Kashmiri population have been converted to Islam ; in Jammu province 35% of population are muslims. By embracing Islam, they are leaving their sentimental legacy. Kandahara architecture is an offshoot of Indian art and architecture.
Buddhist belt extended from Sinkiang of China to east Afghanistan and NEPA.

Garhwal, Kumayun and Sirmaur were in one kingdom known as Udayan rajya. Naban was its capital. Padma- sambhava, a Buddhist from Garhwal crossed India and entered Kimpurushvarsa (Tibet). The colour of Padmasambhava's hair was like that of Padma (lotus), so he was called Padmasam- bhava. The king of Fibet, Sranget Sen-Gampo embraced Bud- dhism. He had two wives-one from Nepal, the daughter of Anshu Varman, a Newari girl known as Trikuti and the other a Chinese princess called Tenzing. Buddhism spread in China and Nepal through these queens.

other. The earlier man understands this fact, the better it would be. Birds are fast extinguishing, white kites are no more available, which could be seen some 40:30 years ago. 

In India white peacocks have been destroyed. Leopards which could be seen 40 years ago are rare today. 

Bame is the case with python. Last eagle in England was killed about 40 years ago. Man is the most dangerous carnivorous animal. That's why acceptance of Neo-humanism is most essential. The more one is intellectual, the more he is responsible for it. It should be expected from humans that they will protect the helpless animals.

The latter Deer also has two varieties junior and senior. variety is higher than man in height. Humans have destroyed. them, they kill the deer of senior variety on sunday and eat it on tuesday when its flesh becomes more tasty.

In Latin carnis means flesh; rorus means rural and rostus means rustic. It is difficult to tame deer, white ass and white donkey. Krsnasara deer has black spots on the mouth and can be tamed after a few years of attempt to do so. Zebra, the white horse found in Tibet can not be tamed. White ass found in the forests of Kuch (Gujrat) can be tamed in the second generation. Today mostly asses are of ash colour. White peacocks are found in Burma In India it has been destroyed. 

The flesh of male peacock is sweet, while that of female is sour. The bio-history of fauna is very interesting. Indian cow has four udders and give enough milk, but the deer which has two udders can hardly give half a kilo of milk. The cow can not run fast while the antelope can. Proto-deer was the predecessor of of antelope and deer.

 Later antelope and cow became separate animals. Cows could be tamed and would provide enough milk, but it is difficult to tame antelope and it is quite insecure in forest. Cow-slaughter should be banned from a moral point of view. They serve man, its milk is good for brain.

ibe Previously in pre-partition period (before 1947), Sundarban constituted of 6 districts-Midnapore, 21 Parganas, Khulna, Barisal, Noakhali and part of Howrah. Its span was 40,000 square miles. After partition 1.600 sq. miles remained in India and the rest in Bangladesh. Bangladesh destroyed its forests, and the lion

of that are swam over to Indian side. Forestpigs are strong enough to fight with lions, even they eat away the cubs. Some 2 million years back some of the pigs went into water and while adjusting with water, their feet became loose, their lungs became like that of water animals. Thus while adjusting with water, they were transformed into hydra-pig (dolphin), in Sanskrit called Shi- thumar or Bonsha in Hindi.

Australian powder-milk is from the milk of sheep, after sepa- rating butter from milk. This butter oil has no food-value but is better than dalda. Peanut oil has got some food value, it should be second choice. Palm oil is produced in Africa and Asia, from the seed of the ripened fruit. African palm is growing in Baba's quarters af Lake Garden and Tiljala in Calcutta.
