Nagar Brahmans came from Persia before the Parees came.

Parsees came to India during the days of Rudradaman (about 130 AD). 

The Parsees settled down in Navsari. 

They brought with them the worship of Zoroaster.

Their religion was dear to them. The ruler of the place asked them to adopt the language of the place, which they did, but they maintained their system of religious worship.

'Wada' in Malwi Prakrta means habitation, viz. Bi Iwada Banswada. 

The language of people in Bhilwa'da is blending of Mewari, and Marwari-both are the offshoots of Malvi Prakrta.

The script of this place is Maud'i', which has 3 branches:

1. Curuwali
2. Landai
3. Marathi

It is desert.

There are rains in Jaipur but no rains in Bikaner, clouds are obstructed. 

From here to Delhi, it is subterranean Aravalli ranges. Trans Aravalli land is older. 

Salt will be found beneath the water.

Underneath the Aravali, soil, as in Kucch, kerosene oil can be found.

Aravalli was within the Sargossa sca. 

Due to plutonic type of earthquake land came up, so happened in Kucch. The sand of the place is seasand.

In Malvi Prakrta salt was said as Lau-anna' from which 'Lavana' has been derived. The water beneath the Aravalli is saltish. 

Shaka, Huns, Kushans and Yue-chi's came over this place and Brahmans accepted them as Ksattriyas, they are the Rajput of Rajasthan. Gaur-Rajputs migrated from Bengal, they did not embrace Buddhism. Sisodias belonging to Mewar (Rajasthan) has Scythian influence while in Gujrat it is not so.
