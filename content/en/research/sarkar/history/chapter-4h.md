Human civilisation flourished in the river valleys, since humans did not how to dig wells before the stone age. 

Humans and animals could live wherever caves and water were available. 

Humans started digging wells from the stone-age.

Here is also a river-valley.

This Hada desh is the civilisation of Chambal valley. 

The nearby river Alania merges in the river Chambal. 

Alania is the subsidiary river of Chambal.

This civilisation is a part of Chambal valley civilisation, and people's language is Harauti.

Pre-Aryan Shiva was the deity of the place. 

Later Digambar Jains came here and brought some changes. 

When Digambar Jains left the place, the cave was deserted.

Like Bengal, Muslim Fule was short lived here. 

Excavation of the cave was done same 100-125 years before, when the figures in the cave were found. 

It is pre-Aryan civilisation in India, existing between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago.

Saendhavi was the script prevalent during the days of pre-Aryan civilisation. 

This script is older than Brahmi and Kharosti.

Haendhavi is the primordial embryonic stage of Brahmi and Kharosti.

The age of Mohanjadaro civilisation is near about the same, a bit later. 

This ancient relic of an ancient civilisation must be saved from destruction. 

When this figure in the cave was made, Shaevadharma was prevalent here.

There was no Vaesnava dharma, whose religious scripture is Ram Charit Manas.

Shiva was born some 7,500 years ago. This civilisation flourished later between 7,000 and 5,000 years ago. 

No civilization older than this exists today.

Chinese civilisation is 6000 years old.

Egyptian civilisation is 4000-5000 years old. 

While returning to the place of stay Baba said:

Ajanta, Hira Paintings are 1500-2000 years old. 

Ajanta-Elora was structed during medieval Buddhist period.

But this civilisation is about 4,000 years older than this, older than the days of Krisna.

During the pre-Aryan Shaeva civilisation, people didn't cremate dead bodies.

The cremation of dead bodies started with Aryans. 

In Bihar, even today, some people belonging to Musahar and Dusadha castes bury the dead bodies.

The same day at His place of stay in Kota, Baba asked same questions and then replied Himself.

While in Bihar people of some castes still bury the dead in the grave, other people cremate. The people of these castes do not call for a Brahman as priest, the leader of the caste acts as the priest. In this area, relics of Shaiva civilisation and pre Historie civilisation are present.

The Bhils of Gujrat speak 'Bagadi', the Bhils in Hada rural Aren speak Harauti. Baba asked what is the dialect of rural Bhils in their houses? Do they speak Harauti? What are the folk stories regarding Alania? Do the Charans (folklore singers) sing about Alania ? Is this civilisation pre-Mahanjodoro ? None Could answer these questions.

While talking to a Margii-brother, 'Baba said: The dialect of Bhils is Girasia, known as Bhili. There is no "Cha" in it: 'Ae' is commonly used. Mahakavi (great poet) Suryamal, Keshari Singh and Kaviraja were charans. All these were state employees, Suryamal was in the patronage of Raja Ramsingh.

Raja Achal Das who lived near Bhilavara (District Kota) fought against Allauddin Khilji, the latter could not succed against Acal Das.
Local folk songs can be found here. 

The department of History should work on it. A hundred miles (about 150 kilometers) east of this place there is blending of Harauti and Bundeli,

there is some influence of Brai Bhai aho 'Chi' is not used in verbs. The mother tongue of this is influenced by Harauti.

Kota, March 16, 1984

While walking in the night Baba sald

To write history one must know the local people and their language.

Sir Jadunath Sarkar studied Arabic, Persian, and Urdu in order to write the history of Moghul period.

Prof. N.N. Bose also had an intimate knowledge of the local tribes, without which the history of the people could not be written.

Bhils are found in Malava and Mewar, in other areas they are rare. 

Bhils are Scythian people. I have all affection for the place. 

"Jewel is hidden here like fire covered by ash History of the place continues since pre-Aryan days. There must be a University to reveal the hidden treasure of history. 

Harauti has its own philological characteristics its own intonation and acoustics. These are the fascinations and glories of a living language.

From Indo-Aryan word 'Tama', Tamiara' is derived' for cimmerian darkness 'Andha Tamiera is used. 

Shiva taught music to Maharshi Bharat who belonged to north India (north of Vindhya). To the south of Vindhya (in the south) Karnataka' style of music prevailed. 

In Indo-Gondvana valley Hindustani music was prevalent. Tappa of Gwalior was also famous. Deepal Raga should be sung only by them who practise Prana-yama.
