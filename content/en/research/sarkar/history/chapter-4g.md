On March 15, 1982 while walking in the courtyard, Baba said:

Harauti is a language like Sanskrit, Bangla, French, Latin and English.

It is 1,300 years old with a glorious past. 

Hindi is only 300 years old.

North-east demi-Malvi transformed into Mewari, Dhundhari and Mewati.

South demi Malvi transformed into Gujrati and Kathiawari, east of south demi-Malvi into Kacchi, a blending of Gujrati and Sindhi, Chambal merges in the river Jamuna near Agra.

River Saraswati joined Ganga and Jamuna near Allahabad. Drsadvati joins the Sone. The Chambal land has an antiquity of 5000 years. People are known as Hadas and their language fs known as Harauti.

There are 3 types of intonation:

1. Hrasva
2. Diirgh
3. pluta

In Rgveda, all the 3 intonations are present.

Bageshvari raga has 15 dharas. 

It is a popular raga in Rajasthan, Hariyana and Churu. 

Traditionally, devotional songs were more sung only in Bageshwari and Dhudi in Prabhat Samgiita.

This Raga has been used in Tappa and Gazal as well. Lauguage, Samgiit and Dhun do not obstruct Rapas, Pranayama helps in singing Bageshvari. No alcoholic should try to sing Bageshwari raga.

16th March, 1981

Baba visited a place called Alan, 22 kilometers away from Kota.

Baba said, this is within Hada area, which is a portion of Gondwanaland. 

This land of Hada was not beneath the sea, the soil is 50 60 lakh (5-6 million) years old.

Nearby flows a river, called by local people as river Alania which merges in the river Chambal. 

There are huge rocks on the bank of the river, the way to the river was excavated through the rocks Below on the bank of the river their are caves, the walls of which contain paintings. 

A temple was made out of rocks, beside the river. This temple was a later creation where presiding deity was Shiva.

The priest belonged to Ramanand sect. 

According to the priest, the Dhyana Mantra (meditation mantra) of the deity was:

Gam Name Bhagavate Va'sudeva'ya
Cam Namah Shiva'ya

Below there was Shiva Linga. The priest of the Linga- Temple was a Gaur Brahman. 

Baba said, there are several types of tinga's one is Bana linga and another Jyotirlinga. 

Here it is fain shiva. 

In Shiva and Shakta cults the local head of the temple is known as Mahantha and all India head is known as Maha Mandaleshwarn. 

In other sects, the local head is called Mathadhisha.

The main ashram of the sadhu (priest) of the temple was Ayodhya. 

He belonged to Shree branch of Ramananda sect. 

Here, both the shiva linga and Gauripitha were small.

Baba asked the sadhu: 

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Is there a cavity on the upper side of the linga? 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Priest" >}}
There is a little cavity, there is a coloured picture of Shiva, the trident and Parvati. The colour is soluble in water.
{{< /r >}}


Baba asked:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Is the colour metallic or taken from Howers and leaves ? Is it light red colour? 
{{< /l >}}

The sadhu could not reply.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}

There were pictorial expressions in the caves. 

There were pictorial expresiions of elephant with small teeth and no hair, the head was small. The houses had no doors. Here the bull. sts urinary organ in normal position.

There are certain types of bulls whose urinary organ is on a lower position.

As a consequence, insects can enter into it. 

Baba said:


This entire scaenario speaks of a pre-Aryan civilisation existing between 5,000-7,000 years ago.
- Much destruction of the place has been done.
- To save it from further destruction, immediate action has to be taken.


Baba asked the priest of the temple who are his Guru, Param guru. 

Parapar Guru, he could not reply. 

In the cave the hood of snake is found, there is no goddess carved out. 

When a matchstick is ignited, it gets extinguished, it does not glow.

Baba further said, this place is a bit older than the lower most layer of Mohenjodaro. 

Mahenjodaro and Harappa were destroyed by Sindh river.

But no such event occurred here. 

In absence of any natural calamity, this place was not destroyed.
