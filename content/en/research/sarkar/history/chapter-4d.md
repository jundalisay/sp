Jaipur March, 13, 1984

Baba visited Ramgarh lake, about 30 km away from Jaipur (Rajasthan). 

The lake has a span of 25 square miles with 64 ft. deep water, it supplies water to Jaipur city. Baba told us :

The nearest river of this place is the Ban Ganga which merges in Jamuna. This place contains the remains of the old city of Rampur-state, which had existed before Jaipur was founded. All around the city, there were temples, one of them is the temple of Goddess Jamuna'.

There should be a temple of the Sun-god between Ramgarh and Jaipur near Ramgarh. The costume of the Sun-god is trouser (as muslims wear), shervani and rosary, and frij-cap on the head. 

There should be village inhabited by Shakaldvipi Brahmns. came to south-east and They came here from north-west, south-west, their number is very less. 

They are not so tall, but ordinary tall. They are worshippers of the Sun-god. 

Temple of the Sun-god did indicate that there must be village inhabited by Shakaldvipi Brahmans. They came from South Russia-Saedonia or Shakdvipi, hence known as Shakaidvipi. 

After coming over here, they got themselves acquainted with two jobs-astrology and Ayurveda (medical science). They brought palmistry to India from Sacdonia. 

Some of Sakaldvipis came by land-route and some by sea route via Sindh after the fall of Raja Daliy (AD 712). they came to Bhanpur. The entire state was known as Rampura and the western portion of the state was Banpur. 

Some of the Shakldviipis settled in Jodhpur and Bikaner and very few in Kota and Udaipur. Afrology was known to India but knowledge of palmistry was brought by Shakaldviipis. 

Palmistry, being the knowledge from trans-Arabic land, from the other side of the sea, was knwn as Samudrika Vidya.

Before jaipur state came in existence, Bhanpur and Ajaigarh existed. 

Bhanpur was a big state. It was a Tantrik state. Here lies that coveted place. It is said that the place was destroyed in one night due to clash between Digambar Jainas and Tantrikas. 

This place was the capital town of Bhanpur-state, the time honoured seat of Tantrik cult. It has a time-honoured anti- quity; 700 years before Mohammad. Ibn Kasim came to India. 

The area upto eastern edge of Sindh was the seat of Tantrik- cult. The saints of those times were warriors as well, Digambar- Jainas could also fight in those days. The fight between Digam- bar Jains and Pauraniks was very common and the consequence of this fight was the birth of Shwetamber-Jaina-cult. 

Actually shwetambar Jainism was the blending of Tantrika cult and Digam- bar Jainsm. 

Jaina Tantra also came into vogue and the prevalent goddesses were Amba, Ambika and Ambalika. Here lies the temple of goddess Amba the goddess of Shwetambar Jainism, which is a blended form of Pauranika Tantra and Digambar Jainism. 

Digambar-Jainism, where there was no such blending got metamorphosed into Therapanth found in north side of this place, known as Churu. If excavations are done here more facts of history shall come out. Nothing has been done for this, pur-

You should form an All India Board of History to reveal the hidden facts of history.

Glauf Brahmans brought Tantra to this area. All Gaur-Brah- mans do not eat fish. Rajasthan is a land of valour. It is also a land of intellect. 

This aspect of Rajasthan's history has been neglected History should be properly written.

The state deity of Bhanpur was Lord Shiva, nearby here lies a very old Shiva's temple in ruined condition. Tantra has two main branches-Kashmiriya and Gauriya. 

Later Kashmiriya- Tantra metamorphosed into Shaeva and Buddha Tantra and Gauriva tantra into Buddha and Shakta trantras. This place
was the seat of Tantra and goddess Jamua was a Tantrik deity: The priest of temple could be follower of Digambar Jainism, Shwetamber Jainism, Buddhism (Mahayana) or Pauranicism.

His History of the place denotes that the place had bush forest, congenial for lion-habitation, In ancient Banpur, there was Han habitation (The villagers of the place say that 40 years ago Babbar variety lion could be seen in the vicinity) Babbar variety is different than Gurjar variety. In Gujrat non-kesharvala variety of Hon are found, which are medium in size, these are known as Giranars. To the cast upto Rarh, kesharwala variety of lions of medium size, are found and to north-west keshar- vala variety of big size are found.


In Banpur. 'Ba', of Magadhi-Prakrta gets distorted as "Bh", a diethong on 'va' and 'ha'-Bahan is pronounced as Bhena, Budhari is the dialect of this area (including Jaipur). Dudhari is the blended dialect of Marwari, a blending caused by the impact of Hariyanvi and Harauti about 4000 years ago, Malvi Prakrta was the spoken language of this place.


Bindhi language came from Seendhaui-Prakrta. The Ragini popular in fast Rajasthan (Vindhya ranges and Ajmer) and west, Madhya pradesh was Chayanata, Raga Bageshri is also from this portion of Rajasthan. 


<!-- 88 -->

In Malvi-Prakrta, pronoun, verb ending and case ending are different from Hindi which is an offshoot of Shauraseni Prakrta, In Shaurseni the verb Hai, Aut, Ho are used in the present tense, whlle in Malvi Prakrta, 'Ch' is more common. Rama ki Bahan, (Ram's sister) shall be pronounced as Rama 'Ri', Bhaena. 

'Rai' is used for possessive case.

This place was also known as Jamua-Ramgarh, an old weat of human civilisation, a very old seat of history. Historical survey of the place has yet to be done. 

When myth is mixed with history, history gets distorted. Charans (folk song-singers) would mix myth with history.
Banpur had good relations with Ajaimeru, now known as Aimer. It could not be conquered, so it was known as Ajmer Before Gaur Brahmans came to this place, there were no Brah mans in this area. 

Beyond Pushkar Brahmans are rare, Marwar speaking Brahmans are found in Thar desert, Marwari-speaking Brahmans are a blended form of Gaur-Brahmans. This was the only Hindu-majority area of Sindh. All around Thar were native states. To the east was Jodhpur (Baba wrote to Jawahar Lal Nehru that there should be a plebisite in Thar as well If plebiscite could be done in sylhet, why not in Thar ? Nehru did not accept it.) The priest of goddess Jamua is Gaur Brahman belonging to Atharvavediya section, who use sacred thread with its span upto waist.

During the reign of Bahlol Lodi, Sisodia, Gaura and Rather Rajputs were compelled to embrace Islam and are known a Meyo Rajputs. They have their marriage-relationships amongst themselves only and the marriage-ceremony is first solemnised according to Hindu rites and thereafter a Mulla performs muslim rites of marriage (nikah). The economic condition of Meye Rajputs is not good. Meyo Rajputs, partly, migrated to Pakis tan and some of them returned to India.

Gaur Bra'hmans did a lot for the transplantation of Tantrik eult, which, as said earlier, got metamorphosed into Shakta and Buddhist cults. In this area, Shakta and Shaeva cults prevail. 'Yatha' Shivah tatha' shaktih, yatha shaktih tatha Shival (wherever there is Shiva, there is Shakti and wherever there is Shakti, there is shiva )-

This area is the lion-habitation of north-west India A congenial habitation for lion needs dry land, shrubs and not dense forest, which existed upto Indus river, Babbar variety of lion came to India from the middle east and tigers came from the middle cast and tigers came from north-east. variety of Indian cows eat grass directly.
