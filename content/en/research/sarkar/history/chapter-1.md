## Gorakhpur, June 1984

Baba arrived at Gorakhpur (UP), East India on January 25 and visited Kushinagar on the 26th.

Here Lord Buddha attained permanent liberation about 2,500 years ago.

Baba walked around the place.


Kushinagar is historically important. 

It was the capital of the Malla kings belonging to the Indo-Tibetan tribes. 

They belonged to the sub Himalayan section of the Indo-impurunavarna is the Sanskrit name over the Himalayan ranges and plains,

<!-- 16 -->

Madhyadesha or Madesh, the Shivalik ranges, the valley and Tibet, and the entire Himalayan belt from Sikkim to Garhawal or Udayan. 

The Nevars, at present living in the Kathmandu valley, are the descendants of the ancient Mallas.

The Shakyas were also the descendants of the Mallas.

Shuddhodan was their chief about 560 BC. 

He pious man who earned his living by righteous means.

As such, Shuddhodan became his attributional name. 

The southern extremity of his kingdom was the Rapti or Rapitii river. 

It was called the Raptii River because it deposited rich alluvial soil onto the surrounding land. 

Buddha was born into this tribe and Shuddhodan was his father. 

<!-- Buddha died here, and his birthplace, Lumbini, is not very far from Gorakhpur.  -->

Buddha hence was a local prince who was also known as Kumar.

Mrta meant 'dead'. It became 'mata' in Magadhi Prakrta 2,500 years ago.

In Demi-Magadhi it became Matta.

Old Bhojpuri:
- is the daughter of Ardha Magadhi.
- transmuted it into 'Matta. 

In modern Bhojpuri this word has become obsolete. 

Kumar or prince became Kunvara in modern Bhojpuri. 

Thus Buddha came to be known as 'Matta Kunvara in Bhojpuri, which means the dead prince. 

Kushinagar is known as as Matha Kunvara by local people.

Kushinagar was a part of Kashii Rajya which was also known as northern Kashika Rajya. To the east of Kashi Rajya was Videha and Vacdehi was a princess of this kingdom. 

The mythological name for Videha was Mithila. 

To the west of Kashi Rajya was Shravastii or east Kaushal. Its king during Buddha's time was Prasenjita, a brother-in-law of Bimbisara, king of Magadha. 

Prasenjit's sister, Kaushal Kumari, was one of the wives of Bimbisara. The first democracy in the world was formed by the Licchavis of Vaishali which was a por tion of Shravastii. A comprehensive study of this locality which is so closely associated with Buddha, will not only reveal the cultural legacy of Kashii Rajya, but will also provide a better understanding of its impact on the world culture.

Around Gorakhpur, language developed in different ways For example, in Sanskrit the synonym for road is 'Varima and in Ma'gadhi' Pra'krta it became 'Bat't'a', which became 'Ba'ta' in Bhojpuri. The Sanskrit verb for 'existing' is 'Vartate, in Ma'gadhi' Pra'krta it became 'Bat't'aye' and in modern Bhojpuri 'Ba't".

<!-- 17 -->

The synonym for brick in Sanskrit is 'Istaka', which was transformed into 'It't'an' in Ma'gadhi' Pra'krta, and modern Bhojpuri it is pronounced 'Ita.

The bricks used around Gorakhpur 2800 years ago, were long and narrow.
- Bricks in this shape can still be found at Kushinagar. 
- The joining of bricks was done with the help of molasses and lime.

A 24-year old English man, Mr. Princep, an employee of the East India Company, was the first to discover that Pali or Magadhi Prakrit was written in Brahmi script which is also known as Lumbini script in Gorakhpur. 
- He read the script found in a Lumbini village and noted that it was Pali written in Brahmi script.

A blending of Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism took place at Kushiinagar. 

300 years after Buddlia's death, Buddhist ideology split into 2 schools:

1. The northern school was known as Mahasamghika, commonly called Mahayana Buddhism
2. The other school was known as Sthaviravada in Sanskrit and Pali.

Later Sthaviravada or Theravada became known as the southern school of Buddhism since it was predominant in south and southeast Asia.

In Mahasamghika or Mahayana scriptures, it was called Hinayana.

The blending of Shaevism and Mahayana Buddhism resulted in Natha Dharma. 

It is commonly believed that Gorakhnath was an incarnation of Shiva, and one of the preceptors of the Natha cult.

Mahayana Buddhism also blended with later Vaesnavism and dates back to just after Adi Shankaracarya. 

Lokeshvara Visnu was included among its deities. 

A statue of Lokeshvara Visnu can be seen in Virdhyavasini Park on the eastern outskirts of Gorakhpur city. 

In east India (that is, east India means to the east of Allahabad). statues of Lokeshvara Vis'n'u can be found.

The place where Buddha spoke was called Suvarnavarsa.

In Bhojpuri, it became Sonbarsa.

Several villages with this name can be found in the Magadha, Ka'shii and Videha kingdoms; that is. in east Uttar Pradesha and northern Bihar. The place where Buddha stayed for one night was named Dharahara', which means 'the sin of the place was taken away'.

<!-- 18 -->

The entire area around Kushiinagar was a hotbed of Buddhism. 

On the northeastern side of the Buddhist area of influence was Sha'kya'ran'ya or Sa'ran'a, on the eastern side was Campakaranya or Camparan.


The Bhojpuri language is the grand daughter of Magadhil Prakarta, commonly known as Pali. 

A knowledge of Pali will enable one to understand Bhojpuri which is a complete language, crowned with all the garlands of a developed language. 

It has 4 dialects. Gorakhpuri dialect is one of them. 

Khatir is used in this dialect.

In the dialect of Basti, Bhojpuri is influenced by Avadhil, and the dialect becomes Gondai dialect. 

Bhojpuri is a full-fledged language spoken by 40 million people spread over a vast area. In the north it is bordered by the Himalayas, in the south by the Vindhya Ranges, in the west by the Prayag (which is the con- fluence of the Ganga and Jamuna Rivers) and in the east by the Narayani, Gandak and the Son rivers. 

It is the fifth most widely spoken language in India after Bangla, Telugu, Mara'thi and Tamil. Teaching and research in Bhojpuri language and literature is a must for the cultural and economic regeneration of the people. A cultural museum should be established here.
