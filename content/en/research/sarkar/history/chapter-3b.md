The ruins of Buddhist period are here. The Buddhist range included:
- Jammu, Kashmir
- North West Frontier Provinces
- West Punjab
- Kumayun
- Garhwal and Nepal

Mahayani Buddhism prevailed here. There was no influence of Jainism in this area. 
- Therapanthi Jainism existed in the east of Punjab. 

Shitala, Marichi and Harifi were Buddhist goddesses. 

Kandahar had:
- the biggest Buddhist centre 
- its own school of art and architecture

The people of Kandahar embraced Islam.
- 95% of Kashmiri population have been converted to Islam.

In Jammu province, 35% of population are muslims. 

By embracing Islam, they are leaving their sentimental legacy. 

Kandahar architecture is an offshoot of Indian art and architecture.

The Buddhist belt extended from Sinkiang of China to east Afghanistan and Nepal.

Garhwal, Kumayun and Sirmaur were in one kingdom called Udayan rajya. 

Naban was its capital. 

Padma-sambhava, a Buddhist from Garhwal crossed India and entered Kimpurushvarsa (Tibet). 

The colour of Padmasambhava's hair was like that of Padma (lotus), so he was called Padmasambhava.

The king of Tibet, Sranget Sen-Gampo embraced Buddhism. 

He had 2 wives:

1. One from Nepal, the daughter of Anshu Varman, a Newari girl known as Trikuti
2. The other a Chinese princess called Tenzing

Buddhism spread in China and Nepal through these queens.
