Mahayana Buddhism prevailed in Garhwal, Kumayun, Ladakh, Kinnaur, Nepal, Bhutan and Sikkim. 

Dalai Lama was accepted as Dharma guru (ecclesiastical head) in these areas and not temporal head.

But in Tibet, he was accepted both as ecclesiastical and temporal head.

Mahasanghikas called themselves as Mahayanis and called Theravadis as Hinayanis. 

In Chitagong of Bengal, Hinayana Buddhism prevailed.

They did not embrace Islam and are known as Barua.

In the rest of Bengal, Mahayani Buddhism prevailed and later, they embraced Islam.

The universities should reveal real history and get them written. 

From here (the place of Shitala Devi) the history of Duggar Desh can be found.

The Newars ruled over Nepal till 1773, after which Nepal came under the Gorkhas.

Prithvi Narayan Shah was the king. 

The history of Duggar Desh will also tell the history of India. 

Many of the manuscripts had already been destroyed.
- The Brahmans have even left reading Sanskrit. 

Some of the manuscripts are still available in Kashmir.

In Kashmir, the mediterranean sub-group of Caucasian Aryans are found. 
- They are fair-complexioned, slim with bad health.

The nordic sub-group is found in Jammu.
- They are long, reddish and heavy in build. 

The Jath population of the plains have light build and are long in height. 

In Kashmir, a few of the Alpine group of Aryans were also seen by Baba.

The Alpines are fast getting extinct. 

Their colour is white and irishes blue. 

The history of Kash tribe is also extinct.

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Their history is only with me.

They have no trace in Tibet also. Gujjars in Kashmir embraced Islam. They have high nose. Gujjars in Hariyana and Punjab are Hindus.

Jammu is the first Aryan principality in India.


Jammu, March 4, 1984

<!-- 73 -->

Baba visited today Bag-i-Bahu fort at Jammu. Viewing the place Baba said:

{{< l a="Baba" >}}
Jammu Locana Bala and Bahu Locana Bala were cousins. 

Bahu Locan was the king, some 2,500 years ago, before the Buddhist period: the back-structure of the fort had been constructed by joining stones, which speaks of its period of construction.

The 'Bala' title is no more used in Jammu and Punjab. 

They ruled over Gandhar, Jammu, Kashmir, South Russia and West Tibet. 

Jammu-Dwiipa had been the ancient name used after the name Jammu-Desh. 

The name Jammu Locan Bala was derived from Jammu. That was the best period of the history of Jammu. It was the golden period of Dogra-period. 

Lalitaditya, the great king of this region reigned before Shanker Verman. 

The period of Bahu Locan was about 2,500 years ago, after the age of the Atharva Veda and after Krishna, between 2,500 and 3,000 yearas go. 

<!-- Krishna lived some 3,500 years ago. Mahaviir and Buddha lived 2500 years ago. -->

Baba called for a stone from the temple and asked to make sound by striking an iron ring over it. 

Listening to the sound Baba said it is a dead rock of the period between 2,500 and 3,000 years before, earlier than Lord Buddha and after Lord Krishna. You can get the ancient history of Jammu from this temple.

The deity of the temple is Kali or Kalika, whose legs are covered. 

Baba said that the statue of the deity is older than the Buddhist period and belongs to the Atharva-Vedik period; it is the deity of the Atharva Vediya Bhadra Kali. 

The deity has 3 eyes and nose ring is attached to the nose. 

Mangotra Brahmans are the Purohits (priests) of the temple. There is a lotus above the deity and the deity is wearing 'chola', not 'Sari". 

Aryans started the use of "Sari" after crossing Ganga, before that ladies were not wearing 'Sari'. The upper lotus expresses Mongolian influence. 

The face of the petals in a lotus represents different section of Tantra: the petals of lotus facing downwards represent Buddha Tantra, while that facing upwards represents Shaeva Tantra. 


The Kashmiri section of Tantra has been influenced by Buddha and Shaeva Tantra. 

<!-- Shell P. R. Sarkar -->

Here you find the influene of Sheva Tantra. This symbolisation of history must not be neglected.

The "Bala" ruled over a vast empire from Kabul to east Tibet and in the south upto Jwalamukhi.

It was the golden period of Dogra period.
- This land was known as Dwigarta-bhumi in Samskrta. 

Around 2,500-3,000 years ago, the spoken language of the people was Paeshacii Prakrit whose daugher was demi Parshacli, from which the languages, Dogri, Punjabi, Pahari Punjabi and Multani (a blending of Punjabi and Sindhi) emerged. 

Since the deity of the temple belongs to Shakta-tantra, there is every chance that it has been brought from Calcutta, since Bengal was the seat of Shakta Tantra. 

The architect of the temple is of Rajawara style.

It is the most ancient land. 

Aryans first came here on the northern side. 

Some of them went to Kashmir and above, and moving southwards, some went to the plains of India through Sapta Sindhu. 

After Kabul and the Indus rivers were taken away from the land, it was known as Panca Ab or Punjab. 

India extended up to Pamir in the north of Gilgit. 

On the north of Pamir, the language spoken was Pashchattya Prakrit.

The Brahmans of this place are vegetarians. They are Sarasvata Brahmans.

The Purohit (priest) of this temple wears long sacred thread which speaks of Bengal's influence.

The deity also belongs to Bengal since it is the deity of Shakta Tantra.

The influence of Kashmiri Tantra is very little.

It was an independent kingdom till Jahangir, the son of Akbar from his Hindu wife. 

It is a land of great historical importance.
