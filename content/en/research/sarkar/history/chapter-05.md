[Citraku'ta is famous for being a place where the ca mental concept of Ra'ma'yana was conceived by Valmiki wrote Ra'ma'yana in Samskrta. The place has a uni ecological similarity with what the poet has expressed in book. ]

25 March, 1984

On the route to Allahabad from Banda, Baba visited (har kuta. Chitrakuta is part of Gondwanaland and is situated af north-western extremity of the Vindhya ranges from when the Yamuna valley starts.

Baba asked us 3 questions about the locality:

1. Is there a river nearby?
2. Does the river take a turn!
3. Is there any village by the name of Ranka or Lanka situat here? 

While surveying the locality we discovered a river nearly which turned beside a place called Lanka.

While at Allahabad Baba made the following observat about the origin of the Ramayana.

Valmiki wrote the Ramayana in Sanskrit in the post Buddhist period about 1300 years ago sladi cated by the criticism Valmiki makes of Buddha in his book The Ramayana was translated in Bengali during the first portion of the Pathan period, while Tulsidas wrote Ram Charit Manas Avadhi during early Moghul rule. 

25% of the Ramcharit Manas is in Bhojpuri because Tulsidas wrote version of Ramayana in Varanasi.

The environment around Citrakuta most probably inspried Valmiki's imagination and explains why there is a close correla tion between the environment described in Valmiki's Ramayant and Chitrakuta. Kuta means a hill while Citrakuta means a hill on which Valmiki sat to conceive and compose the entire panel ma or citra of his epic Ramayana. 

In Avadhi, Bagheli, Bundeli and Bhojpuri, Ranka or Lanka is a low-lying place surrounded by a turning river. A place called Lanka, is situated near Cakula while another place by the same name is situated in Varanasi The latter place is situated on low land, where the Ganga makes turn. The Lanka near Chitrakuta was most likely covered in water during the days of Valmiki while the hill on which he imagined his epic was probably strewn with rocks.

Monkeys having black faces and long chins are called Hanuman monkeys and found aroun Chitrakuta. !lowever the actual recognition of Hanuman as a deity is a recent phenomenon and occured only four hundred years ago. The place could have been called Chitrakuta, because of cave-paintings here, but mostly because Chitrakuta is the place where Valmiki got the inspiration to con- sive and write his epic.

The Ramayana is a Purana, an imagined story; it is a Purana, but it is a Purana which has educative value. It teaches moral values and inspires people to follow Dharma. Although Rama, Hita, Hanuman, Ravana, and Lanka, a land surrounded by water where the approaching road is made of rocks which floated on water, are all products of Valmiki's imagination. They have inspired and enthralled generations of readers.
Medininagar (Daltongonj) March 31, 1984

Baba came to Medininagar from Allahabad. During His ataya here Baba visited Betala, a forest reserve for wild animals, where He talked about the eco-biological background of Magadh. First, Baba made the following observations about the animal life in the region.
Indian elephants are of three varieties-south of Nagpur variety, Chotanagpur variety and Bengal-Assam variety. While lions sometimes eat bamboos, elephants do not eat hard wood. Royal Bengal tigers can live in this region. Wild bore and small deer are the favourite food of tigers. Rhinoceroses can not lie around Betala because there is no mud for them to wallow in. Pan- thers and elephants of east and south Indian varieties all live here. The average rainfall of Betala is higher than the regional average.
The mammoths existed here some two millon years ago, and four present varieties of elephants are their direct descendants. First there is an African variety from just south of the Sahara

fi
which possesses a small head, and has Hitle intelligence- it cannot be tamed. Second in the fadian varisly found in Orissa, West Bengal, North Bengal and Assam. It has a big head and the male has tusk, but it is smaller than the Afiean variety. In Sanskrit the big fadian elephant was known as nera'vata. Third is the North-east fudian variety found in Tripura, Nagaland, As- sam and Burma. It is three quarters of the size of the big Indian variety and is of ash colour. It is very intelligent but cannot be tamed. Sometimes it might walk on rail tracks during the night and obstruct trains in hilly areas. The south variety is found in Burma and Thailand and is whitish in colour but rarely found. People worship this variety of clephants: One hundred and fifty years ago, such elephants were found in Tirhuta. In the past large numbers of chinos and elephants were found around Medini- nagar because of the high rainfall in the region, but deforestation had adversely affected the rainfall and the region has practically become a desert. If the rainfall increases, rhinos, elephants and even crocodiles will be able to live here.
Indian crocodiles are of three varieties, those that eat small fishes, Bangalites which live in non saline water and sometimes eat people (in the local language they are known as magaramach); and Bangalites Gangelites which are found near Sundervana and Gangasagar are the most dangerous variety.
In the past Betala had plenty of rainfall; cane was grown here (cane means Beta in Sanskrit), and the place was known as Betrala. Presently it is known as Betala. Deforestation caused the rainfall to decrease and cane production also diminished. Reforestation will increase the rainfall in the region and Medininagar (Daltonganj) and the Koyal dam will have water throughout the year. A constant supply of water apart from re-forestation, is inappropriate because they are too costly. There are several varieties of animals of the cat group but the Royal Bengal tiger is the biggest animal in the group. It conists of two types-those that eat people and those that don't. The second type of animal in the cat group is the leopard, known as Citra-vyaghra in Sanskrit. Third is the panther, known as Gulbagha, since it contains the print of a 'gulab' or rose in its coat. Fourth is the Jaguar which is found in South America.

Topographically, Palamu is the highest place in Magadh, while the lowest is Mokama. The Sona and Kena rivers meet near Halands, the Sons river flows from the west and enters the Kana river from the eastern side. The Nairanjana and Mohana rivers meet and merge in the Phalgu river near Gaya, while the Phalgu river Rows from the southwest to the northeast. The Puspon river au passes through Magadh.

Magahi has got four dialects which are spoken in Jammui, Haisir, Barh and Gaya. Rajgiri dialect should be taken as the standard dialect for the region. In the Aurangabad and Palamu districts of Magadh the influence of Bhojpuri is evident. Words like 'rauan' for respectfulness, and 'unkhal' for sugar cane are Emmonly used.
Medninagar, 1 April, 1984
Today Baba visited the fruit research centre at Chiyent While walking He made the following observations.
The soil in Magadha belongs to old Gondwanaland # laterite soil and contains plenty of calcium. It is ideal for ing roses, papayas, grapes, and white roses. Without using fertiliser, citrus, pumpkins, berries and guavas of medium this (guavas do not need much laterite soil) can readily grow in lastRE soil with only a little fertiliser. However laterite soil is ret for grafted mangoes.
Lemons can be grown well here but not oranges, which mostly in northeast India, including Assam. Oranges are to peel than lemons, but oranges cannot be given to a dial patient while lemons can be. Custard apples, which were brought to India by the Portugese about 450 years ago, can also be grown in Magadha. Small and large-sized grapes with seeds can b grown in sixteen or more kilometers from the Ganga, en sides of the river. Digha-variety of Langra' mango, which i small and sweet can also be grown here. The langra-mangha got five varieties which belong to Maldah, Bhagalpur, Luckn Monghyr and Digha. Roses are of two main varieties-occident and oriental. The former is a large rose but has little while the latter produces many strongly scented flowers in the winter. Liichis and bananas can be grown where the lit laterite. Composite fertiliser is the best nourishment for banana If plantation does not have proper irrigation, seeds grow in the fruit.
Afedininagar, April 2, 1963
Medaninagar is one of the famous towns of Magadha eivilisation, and is situated in Bihar, near, Ranchi. Magadha represents the river valley civilisation enriched by Phalgu, Niran- jana Sone, Kena and Ganga rivers.
In the ancient past, it was the seat of Buddhism and being Ron-vaedic, it was known as Magadha ]
Today Baba visited a Shiva temple at Rajawadiha near Medi- ninagar. The deity of the temple is Siddheshvara Shiva, and the Mehanta or priest of the temple belongs to the Dasnami section. of Shankaracarya sect. The Mahamandaleshvar of the sect lives in Varanasi. There is a perennial flow of water near the deity. Baba explained that the water level of Rajawadiha is high, providing a a continuous flow for a fountain near the deity. According to the priest the deity is known as Narvadeshvara Joytirlinga How- ever, Dhyana mantra of Shiva is used during worship at the temple. The original Shiva-linga was stolen and a new one brought from Jaipur and established here.
Magadhi Prakrta became extinct two thousand years ago but eastern or oriental demi-Magadhi and western or occidental demi-Magadhi emerged as its two offshoots. As said earlier about 1,200 years ago, Assamia, Bengali, Oriya, Angika and Mae- thili developed from the oriental branch and Magahii, Bhojpuri, Nagpuria and Chattisgarhi evolved from the occidental one. In the oriental offshoots 'cha' is used for the present tense and 'la and 'ba' for the past and future tenses; in the occidental off- shoots 'cha' is not used for the present tense but 'la' and 'ba' are still used for the past and the future tenses.

Tatanagar, 4 April, 1984


[ Tatanagar is the industrial town of Bihar, but more singni- cant is the fact that it is a place around which the civilisation of Rárh flourished. Rarh is a rich valley civilisation comprising of five-valley-civilisations. Herein one can visualize the advent and blending of Shacvism, Jainism, Buddhism, Pauranicism and Gauriya Vaeshnavism. It is a rich and glorious land of deve- loped civilisaction which is the vicinity of Tatanagar, previously known as Ka'limati.

Rarh dipicts the presence of Bone Age and also where farm- ing or sowing of seeds was invented, before which humans were hunters and food-gatherers. Nature and humans had made this civilisation of Rach a glorious panorama of human history]
Baba came to Tatanagar from Medininagar. During His stay at Tatanagar, Bab visited a place called Jayada on the banks of the Suvarnarcha river, about 32 kilometers from Tata. He went to a Shiva temple which had a large Shiva linga as its deity. Baba made some inquiries among the local villagers and was told that people with the title 'Garain', Barak, Das and Majhi live here. They are vegetarians, wear a Kanthi, a garland, made of round pieces of tulsi-wood around the neck. People with the title of Kurmi-Mahato also live here. The title of the priest is Pandey. Baba observed, Gauriya and Utkat Brahmans do not act as Purohits in social and religious functions. The script found here was rectangular in shape. Two famous kings of the Varaha- bhum Rajya were Adivaraha, and Keshavaraha. To the west of this kingdom was Ranchi, to the east Manbhum. The entire area within this boundary was known as Varahabhum and its capital was Varahbajar. Purulia, Chandil, Muri, Deogarh, Patamda, Arsa and Nimdi were included in Varahabhum rajya.

The original population of Bengal consisted of people with titles like Mahato, Kurmi-mahato, Mahiaya, Sadgope, Rajvanshi and Chakma. The titles Garain which was derived from Garh- Kiirti, was also prevalent in the original population. The Gara- ins adopted Jainism as their religion. Other tribes like the Kheria-Munda, Singh munda, Khangar munda, Cussia munda, Kusmete munda also existed in Bengal. The fathers of poeple with these titles were Bengalis while the mothers belong to the Munda

kir'ti, are also treated as low caste people. Water touched by them is not used by higher castes. Garh means place of famous learning, while Garhakiirti means a person who looked after Garh. After the decay of Jainism, Hindus began to look down on Garains. Julahas who had previously been Buddhist or Jains also met the same fate. The socio-religious dogma and discrimination caused by such caste sentiments has a divis sive impact on Indian society.

The influence of Maha'prabhu was very great in Tripura: A clan from Burma came to Tripura a little before Pathan rule commenced. The Pathan king Mu-chang-fa embraced Vaeshnavism, and became known as Viir Bikram Bhahadur Under Maha'prabhu's influence, the Digamvar Jains of Rarh alsa embraced Gauriiya Vaeshnavism. Although Jain influence was dominant in Midnapore after Maha'prabhu visitd the region the entire area came under the inflence of Vaeshnavism.

The religio-cultural history of Rarh has been influenced by several religions, the impact of Digambara Jainism and Vaisnavism, for example, is quite evident in the Suvarnarekha valley civilization and at places there is a blending of Digambar Jainism and Mahayani Buddhism.
Buddhism believs in Dukkhvada or the theory of sorrow and it is basically a negative philosophy. It has four noble truths or Catura'jya saccam-Duhkha, that pain is the eternal truth Duhkhasya Karanam, that there must be a reason for sorrow of pain: Duhkhanivritti, that there is liberation from pain and Dukkhanivrttiupaya, that there is a path to liberation from pain. Buddhism as Buddha taught was neither nihilism no cynicism. Later however a blending emerged and Atisukhavada, the opposite of Duhkhavada, was propounded. Buddhism was divided into two schools-Mahayana and Hinayana. In India Mahayana was dominant while Lamaism was dominant in Tibet. At Boudh Gaya, a blending of Mahayana and Hinayana took place. A blending of Jainism. Buddhism and Pauranicism has also taken place in India, and is evident by the acceptance of the same deities by these faiths.


Nudism is the special characteristic of Digambara Jainism, although it was not encouraged by either Buddhism or Pauranicism. The nude Kali idol can be found at several places the banks of rivers near Tatanagar. 

Kalii was originally a Jain deity but later Buddhism and Hinduism accepted Kalii as a daily, Bajra Tara and Niil Tara were Buddhist deities which were alan accepted by Hindus. The white Saraswati was derived from the Hill Tara of Hinduism. A blending of Jainism and non- Jainism is evident in the acceptance of deities like Shitala and Manasa.
A blending of deities is an indication of blending of cultures and civilisations. This is especially evident in Rarh which has composite culture and a rich history. Despite this tradition, same monarchs. notably King Shasanka of Rarh, were fanatic Bhaevas King Shasanka was responsible for destroying and disfiguring several non-Shaeva Jain and Bhuddhist deities in Horthern and eastern India.
Even today Jainism continues to influence the culture of Bath For example, the Brahmans of Utkal and Rarh do not perform the duties of priests in the social and religious functions of several original Bengali castes and tribes. Pandeys who are Jain Brahmans, are accepted by these tribes as their priests. In the religious function of Casu Mahato, Brahmans do not act as priests And this is another example of the influence of Jainism on the traditions of Rarh.
The worship of Tusu Devi, and the observance of Tusu Parva is a unique phenomenon in Rarh. Bhadumani and Tusu- mani were the daughters of the King of Manbhum who lived about thirteen hundred years ago. The worship of Tusudevi is an honour to Tusumani although Brahmans have no role in this Feligious festival.
The language of ancient Rarh was Sanskrit and Rarhii Ben- gali is full of Tadbhava or Sanskrit words. However Austric in- fluence on the language is also evident, especially on the dialects of Kheriya Munda, Singh Munda, Bhumij and Bauri. Early seripts found in Rarh were rectangular and were used between the second and twelfth centuries A. D. A similar script has been found on Susunia hill in the District of Bankura and is a transmu- ted form of Sri Harsha script. This dialect is known as Kera Bam'la from Angara to Mednipur (Sadar) and Gopiballabhpur.



122

Bamla crint has also been discovered at Jayada where it was the script of Macthili, Chiya and Anamiese about 2,000 years ago.
Varahabhum or Varabhum and Patamda' are situated in the Suvarnarekha valley, and Bhavalbhum is located at the junction of the Khadga and Ruvarnarekha rivers. Raja Dhaval Deo was the King. 'Cha' dance was invented by him at Bag- mundi: 'Che' means 'behaviour and character'; 'cho' dance has three styles (a) hanbhum style where a mask is used; (b) Dhavalbhum style where a mask may or may not be usd, and (c) Mayurabhanja style where a mask is not used.

Dhavalbhu'm was also known as Porahat rajya. Two bro- thers of the Rajya fought on the bank of the river Sanjaya. As a result the Rajya was divided; the northern portion became known. as Kharawan and the southern portion was called Saraikela'. To the south of Saraikela' is Adityapur, where Aditya Narain Singh Deo ruled. Further south is Famadia' which was ruled by Tamadia' Raja about 450 years ago but he was conquered by the king of Ratu who belonged to the Kheria munda' tribe.

To the west of Tamadia is Barh and to the west of Rarh is Chotanagpur. Sadani is the language spoken by the people of Tamadia. The Hod' language of the Ora'on tribe was influe- nced by the Dravidians while the Hu'ra language of the Mura'ja tribe is similar to the Santha'i language. The people of the Muraj tribe ace short and have curly hair and a black complexion.

This area has immense horticultural potential-grapes, pears, citrus, papayas, guavas, pumpkins, long potatoes, Kudaris and Poppy seeds can be grown well here. Kudari keeps the body cool but does not have any food value.

The history of culture and civilisation of this area is rich and versatile. Almost 2,500 years ago, people were educated and advanced in different aspects of civilisation but today they have been made backward.


fday Haba visited a village called Bhulagram in the Man kham danket of Varahabhum. Baba said that the area of Varahathum included the Ayodhya Hill and Sonahatu in the north. Fatalitomar in the west, Manbajar in the north-east. Kigar and Handwan in the southwest and Chandil in the south.
the hundred years ago, people started giving up Jainism to embrace Gulya Varshavaism. The Vaeshnava poet Jaideva was alive then and Ballat Ben was the ruler of the region. Da'ksa- yant Het was the established deity of the Pallab Rajya and Daks- Avant meant Burga'devi. In those days, this region was a forest and the first inhabitants were from the Singhmunda' tribe. Bujar was a sub group of the Singhmunda' tribe who spoke Ham The and group of inhabitants who lived in this region anged to the Bauri tribe and spoke Ra'rhi Bamla'. Ringhimandat cutablished their kingdom over Vara'hbhum and

Varahabhum had a natural boundary on the northern side was the Kumari River; in the can side was the Kasali river, where the Kumari and Ram on the south was the Chandil river upto

Dam, and is very near Purulia. At present there is no Manbhum district, the capital has been shifted to Purulia.
About forty years ago, Baba had visited the Bhulagram when it was in Manbhum district. He has also composed a a song about the region, (Na'cher ta'le egiye cale, manbhum mati). Baba further observed:
About 850-900 years ago the followers of Digamvara Jain were found in Manbhum but under the influence of Mala prabhu they slowly embraced Gauriya Vaeshnavism. Nuds statues of gods can still be found on the banks of the rivers in ods can still be found on the this area.
Forty years ago people holding the title Garhakiirti were common in this region. Old temples constructed with a special type of bricks which were thin but large, can still be found.
A nude Kali idol, popularly known as Shmashana Kali Kali of the cremation ground-is still standing in Bhulagram Baba said that it is a Jain diety. Other deities are Kalika and Ambika. Ducks were sacrificed at the Kali temple rather than asses or goats since the Vahana or vehicle of Jain devi was
duck.

Local people said that the ruins of a temple can be found in an adjacent village called Pavanpur A small river, called the Sona River flows near Pavanpur. It meets the Kumari river which in turn meets the Kansali river near Mukutmanipur,
Utkal and Rarhi Brahmans did not worship at Jain shrines. When Mahatos and Garains gave up their Jain faith and em braced Vaeshnavism they did not take the services of the Brah mans. According to a prevalent supersitition, if a Rarhii of Utkal Brahman solemnises a marriage, the bride will not live long. Mahotos, Bauriis and Saraks can be found in village near Bhulagram, although there are a few Bauris and Sarak living there.
The idols found around Bhulagram are of Jain deities, apsara (the dancing statue) is also found here. The hooded snake god is a Jain deity. The priest named it Manasa Devi and encou raged people to worship it. Later breasts were added to the deity to make it look like the goddess Manasa. Naked idols are

Ball Jain deities, while statues which have lotus petals facing downwards denote Jain and Bhuddist Tantra.
Pavanpura was a shrine of the Jains. Pavanpura and Pavan pur means the land that purifies. The Ganga river is also called The Pavanii Ganga, or the Ganga that purifies. The idol of Varaha sisted here was originally the idol of Vajra Varahi, a deity of Jain Tantra. Later Shankha or a conch shell, a wheel, a club and a lotus were put in the four hands of the idol to denote the Gnd Varaha. Temples with sixty four deities are situated at fabbalpur and one of these temples has Vajravarahi, as the deity. these different idols and statues belong only to this area.
About two thousand years ago the people living around Rarh were cultured and educated. Three generations ago Rarhi Brah- mans came to this region from Huda police station, near Chandan Keyari. Eighteen hundred years ago, there was only one Brahman family here enjoying tax-free land, but they died heirless. The king of Barabajar had established catuspathi, an educational ins- Hitution for teaching Sanskrit here.
The script found in this region is demi-Sri Harsh script; before that Shri Harsh script was in vogue, and before that the prevalent script was Brahmi. Brahmi script is about 2000 years old. Dhyana mantra, a mantra relating to meditation, was most probably carved on stone in this script.
Sixty four kilometers west of Bhulagram lies the old Jhar khand and 320 kilometers north is Magadh. Rarh extends up to Paras Nath. The land in this region is over 300 million years old when the Himalaya, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the entire northern There was part of India including Punjab were beneath the sea.
no Coromondel but Rarh was above the sea. The soil here is laterite and good for growing grapes, pears, sweet citrus (minoso Indica), Guavas and papayas.
The language spoken here is Rarhi Bengali with varying dia- lects on the northern side. People say 'Ami nai pairbo' while on the southern side they say 'Ami lairbo' but both expressions mean 'I cannot do'.
Tantra is older than Mahabir, and Jainism had to adjust with



126

Tantra. Since Jainism could not exist without Tantra, Jain Tantra emerged.


April 6, 1984
Today Baba visited Krishnapur a village about 150 years old. There is a Hari Mandir of temple here and the cul- ture in the area has been greatly influened by Mahaprabhu. The Kharakaya river flows at a short distance from the village. Local people do not know of any temples or old rock paintings in the vicinity or idols along the rocks of the Kharkaya river. South east of the Kharkaya river is Saraikela where Aditya Pratap Narain Deva once ruled. The prines Shubhendu Narain Singha deva was an expert in 'Cho' dance. Saraikela is so named be cause kela or plantain grows here.
The Sanjaya river meets the Kharakaya river which flows into the Suvarnarekha river. The Dulang river meets the Suvarna- rekha river at Citaligarh, which was once the capital of Dhavala bhum. People of the Dakra seet used to live on the banks of the Suvarnarekha river and took out gold. Nowadays gold is extrac- ted from the local mine.
Ho-mundas live nearby and Majhis or Santhals also live in the region and use the titles like Hembrum, Murmu and Tudu. Majhis came to Tatanagar 250 years ago. The titles Marang and Murmu are also used by the people living around Tatanagar.
To the south of Saraikela as far as Mayurbhanja, there used to be a dense forest. The Krishnapura variety of deer once lived to the east of Krishnapur while to its south a few horned deer were once found. When the forest in the region was des- troyed, these animals became extinct.
Meghasini is a high hill and in front of Krishnapur there is at small hill where Satpathi Brahmans reside.
The soil of Rarh is laterite soil, but black soil is also found in places like Kalimati. Rarh is famous for rhythm while Magadh is famous for music,

land of Bhaerava Tantra. Later Jainism had to adjust with it and Jain Tantra was the result, although Shiva was still accepted as the controlling deity. The Jain Shiva linga and Gauri-piitha are large. Shaeva Tantra was dominant throughout the region upto 3,000 years ago. Later the external form of Shaeva Tantra was given up by the people and gradually Jain Tantra was a cepted, indicating that Jainism had spread throughout the area. Tatanagar became a hot bed of Jain Tantra although Shashank destroyed the Jain Shiva lingas and also disfigured lingas and idols at Boudh Gaya.
The capital of Shashanka was situated near Naihati and Bhadrapur in the district of Birbhum. Later it was called Rangamati. Later still Harshvardhan renovated the temples in the area. During the days of the Pal dynasty, Shiva was the main deity worshipped by the people, although Daksayanil Devi, that is. the daughter of Daksa meaning Durga was given the status of a state deity, meaning the deity of the kingdom. The Shiva-linga here is broken, but the Gauri piitha remained intact.
The priests here are neither Utkal Brahmans nor Rarhi Brah mans. They are Pandeys who became Brahmans during the heydey of Jainism. They were originally not Bra'hmans. Pandeys are culturally Bengalis, but they have adopted the culture of the Tatanagar locality. Pandeys are the priests of Kurmi-Mahatos, and no other class of Brahmans act as such. The wealthy Mundas (Singh mund'a', Kheria-munda', Ho-munda', Khangar' mund's) called themselves Ksattriyas. They speak in Mundari language at home and Bengali while outside their homes.
The language spoken in the northern side of the Sanjaya river is Rarhi Bengali, and towards the south it is Kera Bengali. The latter is a blending of Bengali and Oriya, and is spoken mostly by Utkal Brahmans like Panigrahi', Hota, and Sarangi. The word 'Kare' is commonly used in their vocabulary exemplified by 'Soa'kare Chila' Go'. The majority of famous people in the region are Mahatos.
The Amyaya river originated in the western side of the Vindhya mountains. The Vindhya' Ranges were divided into three parts: the Ramgarh area which includes Jayachandil,

The area
Kelo and Susuniia extending as far as Bankura. towards Chakradharpur extending in the north from Ra'jmahal to Nahebaganj and the hill track in Ra'rh known as Dalma and Megha'sini and Mayurbhanja. The Meghasini got its name because the Kharakaya and Sanjay rivers originate in the Vindhya mountains where Megha or clouds continuously drift from the sky.
As already mentioned, the Porahat rajya was divided into two parts about 700 years ago during the Pathan period, due to a fight between two princes. Saraikela and Kharswan were the (wo kingdoms that emerged from this conflct. The king of Sarai- kela made Oriya the official language, but the people spoke Bengali. The language spoken in Mayurbhanja was Kera-Ba'mla' and it was known as Mayurbhanj since the Mayur or peacock was Carved in the ornaments of the women of the royal family. The land of north Saraikela is more fertile than the land of the sou- thern region.
In the past the Sanjaya river was a large river, but the Kharkaya river was still large and contained many ripples. The Kumari river comes from the Ayodhya hills, it is a slow, meandering river of the Rarh plain.
The Dakra community near Suvarnarekha used to extract gold from these rivers but a day's labour only earned them one rupee. As a result, they found other employment.
Bengali has got twelve dialects and the centres of Ra'rhi dialect are Tata, Dhanbad, Dumka, Deoghar, Bardhaman and Sindhri.
The Aryan colonization of Bengal took place over a long period of time. The cultural transformation of Bengal was very slow as the indigenous cultural heritage was rich and deep. Well written folk songs in Bamla' can be readily found, but there has ben very little Vaedic influence in Bengal. Vaedic thought had been represented by later philosophers. Buddhist and Jain
influence was very deep in Bengal, which was also deeply influe- nced by Shaeva cult. Though Ramayan was translated into Ba'm'la during the reign of Hussain Shah. about 550 years ago, Rama cult had little influence. Rather, Ram has been criticized



130
for sending Sita into exile and killing Ball. Of course, the influe- nce of Vrindavana and Krishna is evident in Bengal, although Shiva is the cultural hub of Indian civilization. (Haba had already mentioned in the article Tantra and Indo-Aryan Civilization that Shiva is the father of Indian civilization).

Tatanagar, April 8, 1984

Today Baba visited a village named Bangurda, thirty-five. kilometers from Tatanagar. It is an ancient village with an ancient cultural heritage. Baba made the following observations about the area.
About two to three miles from the village, the river makes a sharp turn producing a fast and dangerous undercurrent which is known as 'Daha' in Ba'm'la. Consequently the village is called Bangurdah in old Ba'm'la, but presently it is known as Bang- urda. Near the Pattamada the river also makes a sharp turn. Pattam means a large rock; hence, a village situated near Pattam beside a river taking a sharp turn was named Pattamdah in old Ba'm'la, Later it became known as Patamda. The soil around the village is mixed with stones.
The Jambuni and Sona rivers flow near Bangurda. The Sona river flows from the southwest to the northeast. The Jam- buni river flows from the southwest to the northeast and meets the Sona river two kilometers northeast of Ba'ngurda. The con- fluence of these two rivers is known as the Dhalkishor river. Further down the Gandheshvari river flows from Susunja hills and meets the Dhalkishor river near Bankura and there after it is called the Dwarakeshvara river. The latter flows through Visnupur and Aramabag where it meets the Silavati. river. Further down the river the Silávati meets the Jayacandi river and the confluence of these two rivers is known as the Rupanarain river, which flows into the Hoogli (Ganga') near Tamluk in the district of Midnapore. The land around the How- rah-Hooghli represents the Rupanarain Valley Civilization. The


Kanaval Valley civilization also has a significant place in the history of Hach and the civilization.
In the ions Ag people lived in eaves in hilly country near river. They covered the entrance to their caves with rocks for protection aim wild animals. Primitive people were hunters and food gathers but they had no knowledge of bronze and iron. The Hans Age smired after the Stone Age; in the Bone Age people ward hunes as well as rocks as implements and weapons. The people living in the Hangorda area were more civilized than the people of other ass and experienced both the Stone Age and Bane Ass Hitary makes virtually no mention of the Bone Age but in this ancient village, the remnants of both the ages can be ound. Weapons made of both stone and bone have been found by the villages on the banks of the river near the village.


The surrounding of Bangurda is gradually becoming flat and and for agriculture. Towards the northeast, the land is more fetite. Throughout its histry Hangurda has been a cultured, civi- Heed and proper village. Patamda had also been a cultured And commumically developed village, and remnants of the Stone Age, Hons Age and Bronze Age can also be found near Patamda.
Four toes hundred years ago the tribal people of this area learned in premals dead bodies from the Aryans. Before that they hurted the dead and a tribal graveyard can be found near Bangurds. The oily tillagers were very superstitious and believed that the cremated dead would become ghosts and return to haunt and torture that who burnt their bodies. To avoid this fate, the village kipit the tones of the dead in an earthen pot which they buried in the und Graves of this kind can be found mear river in the freton Eater the bones from these graves
During the Bongs Age the people in this region invented agriculture: They murd bong bronze rods to dig up the soft soil on the river bank and then put seeds into the soil. Those who invented seculture were called Mahatmas, great personalities and later beam on at Mahatos. Many Mahatos can be found around Hangurds because this area has an ancient tradi- tion of culture The Mahato belt includes the following areas

(raii) can also be grown by scattering them in the fields three weeks before harvesting the paddy, when the fields are still muddy. Red mustard is ready for harvesting in five months, and should be harvested in the month of Phalguna. At this time the soil is still soft and after ploughing it is suitable for growing soyabeans or sunflowers. Soyabeans ripen in ninety days and sunflowers in eighty days Oil can be extracted from sunflowers and if oil is extracted after removing the black cover from the seed, the remaing sheath can be used for preparing bread. Black oil cake can be used as a food for animals or as a fertilizer. The powdered-down cover of the paddy can be mixed with limestone to produce cement. A cement industry could also be established in this area. Milk, butter and cheese could be made out of soyabeans. Grape, papaya, pears, fig can also be grown in laterite soil while in the fertile lowlands four crops can be easily grown annually.
Bangurda has a rich cultural heritage. It was once the holy place of Jainism and the place where agriculture was first in- vented. Remnants of an ancient lines can still be found here- Chattopadhyaya, Ganguli, Bandopadhyaya, Mukhopadhyaya and Ghosal are Rarhii Brahmans. The Kiattriyas of Rarh were using Verman title like Chandraketu Verman.
Late in the afternoon, we were privileged to hear from Baba comments on special characteristics of the Rarh river valley civilization. He said I
Rivers in Magadh flow from south to north because the southern portion of Magadh is highland and the northern portion is lowland. The area from the natural park of Hazaribag to the Reserve Forest of Palamu is the water barrier of Magadh. The Ganga valley lies to the north of the water barrier and the Koyal Valley lies to the south. The Sona and Phalgu rivers flow into The the Ganga while the Koyal River flows towards Orissa. dialects of these two river valley civilizations differ from each other,
With the exception of Rarh, Bengal is plain land comprised of black soil from the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers. The soil is up to three million years old, although the soil at Gapalgainj

and Madanpur of Faridpur district. Noakhali, is only half a million years old. At places, fire breaks out in the soil itself. The sull in Bengal except Harh, Uttar Pradesh except Garhwal, Kumayun and Mirzapur and northern India other than Gond- Avána land is made by rivers which originate in the Himalayas. These places, including the Himalayas, were once under the sea.
The rivers in Rach Row from the northwest to the southeast. The Kantavati river flows in the northernmost part of Rarha and passes through Bankura, Murshidabad, Jangipur and merges into the Gangs The Brahmani River flows from the east to the sou- theast, with its direction tending more and more southeasterly. The Ajaya river flows from the Chakai hills to Khairasula, Gala- pur and moves southwards and merges in the river Ganga. Damo- dar river coming out from Ramgarh hills moves towards Santhal Parganas and it moves southeast to Asansol, Maithan, Bara- kar, Raniganj and Durgapur. It then moves still further south east and meets the Ganga near Amta in the district of Howrah. The Roopnarain river flows southeast from Purulia, passing through Vishnupur, Arambag and Medinipur, and meets the Gangs near Tamluk. The Gandeshvari river comes from the Shushunia hills and merges with the Roopnarain. The Dhaval- kishore also merges in the Roopnarain. The Kansavati river starts from the Filabani hill in the district of Manbhum and con- tinues to Row southeast. The Damodar river also flows south-
Hear Purulia city the Damodar and Kansavati rivers move apart from each other and create their own valleys with their own specife characteristics. In certain portions of Ranchi and Hazaribag they speak Panch pargnia and Nagpuria. A blending of Magahi and Karki Bengali is evident in the district of Ranchi, but further northwest people speak pure Magahi.
The people living in the precincts of Bokaro, Ramgarh and Petarwad speak Rarhi Bam'la' while Golabari Bam'la' is spoken by the people living to the north of the Damodar river And to the south of the Ramgarh river. Golabani Bam'la is an offshoot of Rarhi Bam'la'. The people of some Pancha- yats speak Hagpuria and those of thirteen Panchayats speak


Rarhi Bam'la About 300 million years ago Rarh had a big snow-covered mountain. Gradually it became smaller and now snow-covered mountain is not found in the region. In the past this area was full of dense forests. The Santhals, who came to Rarh about 250 years ago, cut the forests down. After a famine befell Chattisgarh the Santhals moved east. Aboriginal tribes other than the Santhals are the local inhabitants of the area. These tribes deified the Ayodhya Hills. However the Santhal population is the highest population of any group in the Some between south Manabhu'ın and Mayurbhanj. Santhals have also settled around Purulia, Dumka and Hod' is their mother tongue and not Bengali. People began to call the Santhals Hadda, although Santhals speak Bengali with people outside their tribe. They use 'Tu' for you and 'Apa' for your; addressing someone with respect does not exist in their vocabulary.
area
The Kansa'vati river starts from Ka'smar, and passes through Medinipur via Jhargram. The Kaliaghai river meets. the Kansavati river at Jinshahar, where a famous Jain temple. stands. The Kumari river meets the Kansavati river and they merge with the Ganga. The Haldi river is also so-called because its water is of haldi or turmeric colour, also meets Ganga. The Suvarnarekha river starts from the Ranchi hills, passes through Namkum and Muri, and then flows southeast to Singh bhum and reaches Kalimati (Tatanagar). The Kharkaya and and Sanjaya rivers meet the Suvarnarekha river which then flow southeast and pass through Medinipur and Jhargram. The Dulang river comes from Chitligarh, the capital of Dhavala bhum, and merges with the Suvararekha river. The land around Dhavalbhum is elevated and the Bombay Mail takes three hours to pass through this area. The Suvarnarekha river also passes through Nayagram. Datan (in Medinipur) crosses the border of Bengal and Orissa and then enters into the the sea near Kaksa.
Usually the water from one river valley does not enter di rectly into the water of another valley. Kashipur is the water, barrier between the Damodar and Roopnarain valleys, while

Patamda is the water barrier between the Suvarnarekha and Kansavati valleys. The water to the west of Patamda flows into the Survanarekha river while the water to the east of it flows into Kansavati river. The water from the east of Patamda can- not flow into the Suvarnarekha and Roopnarain rivers, while the water from Bangurda cannot flow into the Suvarnarekha river,
The Rarh river valley civilization was a highly developed and accomplished river valley civilization. Murshidabad, Nadia, Khulna and the 24 Parganas are all part of the Ganga Valley civi- lization. The valleys of the Icchamati, Bhagirathi, Madhumati and Jalangi rivers constitute part of the Ganga Valley civiliza- tion. The Brahmaputra flows through Meymansingh and meets Ganga near Gwalanda. Previously it met the Ganga near Chand- pur. This entire area covered by the Ganga-Brahmaputra valleys, is part of the Ganga-Brahmaputra river valley civilization. In the ancient past the Ganga valley was under the sea, while Rarh was above the sea, so Rarh is a natural reserve of flora and fauna from ancient rimes.
The people of Rarh are a blending of the Austrico-Negroid and Mongol races, although Mongolian influence is less signi- ficant. Mongolian influence was dominant in the Brahmaputra valley and the people of southeastern part of Rarh have fair com- plexions and flat noses, while Austrico-Negroid influence was dominant throughout Rarh and the people are dark in colour with high noses. Originally the people of Rarh belonged to the Austrico-Negroid race. but when the Ganga-Brahmaputra valley rose above the sea, people migrated from the west to the east and the Austrico-Negroids gradually blended with the Mongo- loids.


The people of Kansavati valley are fairer than the people of the Suvarnarekha valley. There are also marked differences be- tween the complexions of 
the people of Bangurda on the one hand. and those of Bhula, Pavanpur, Tata and Jharagram villa ges on the other. The local culture and tradition of the people also differs in different valleys. The people of Bangurda have more cultural affinity with the people of Manbajar, Bank ra, Mednipur and Patamda, and have a close affinity with the Kan-

savati valley civilization, while the people of Bhula, Pavanpur, Tata and Jharagrama have a cultural affinity with the people of the Suvarnarekha valley civilization, in the Kansavati valley people say 'Ami nai paribo', meaning. I can't do', while the people of the middle Suvarnarekha sivilization say 'Ami lairbo', when saying the same thing.
Because the entire population of Rarh has undergone exten- sive racial blending, it would be correct to say that Rarh com- prises one race, that is, the Austrice-Negro-Mongoloid race with local variations. Brahmans, Kayasthas and Kurmi Mohatos have similar nasal features while Bauris differ. The nasal index differs with the difference in the race. Santhals and Mundas are pure Austrik, Uraons are Austrico-Negroid.
Throughout India many differences exist. For example, the people of Gujrat are round headed and Caucasian Aryan, while the people of Maharashira exhibit a Scythian influence. Al- though there is much racial diversity in the world from the view point of fundamental human values, humanity is one and indi visible.
Rarh civilization has a very rich history and exhibits the rem- nants of the Stone, Bone, and Bronze Ages. A museum should be established at some central place in Harh to make the people aware of their cultural heritage. Bankura is the cultural place. If the people in this region become conscious of their rich his- tory, it will help them break free of the psychic, economic and psycho-economic bondages,

Baha made the following observations. He was walking at night at the place where He was staying in Tatanagar.
The Chattisgarh and Kaushal civilizations are located in the upper part of the Mahanadi river valley, while the Utkala civilization is located in the lower part of the Mahanadi river Valley, Because of the close proximity of these two civilizations, the Oriya of Sambhalpur and Chattisgarhi have similarity. People have a common cultural heritage. For example, the women of both the regions wear the sarees in a similar style, a style having similarity with the style of Bengal. The intonation and pro- nunciation of Rengli and Chattisgarhi are also similar, while the Halvil dialect is a blending of Chattisgarhi and Bengali
The people from Rarh migrated to this area during the 12th century. A blending of races, cultures and languages occured which led to the emergence of the Halavi dialect. In Bastar people speak Gaudi dialect, which is a blending of Chattisgarhi, Oriya and Telugu. The influence of Oriya on the Modia caste, who speak Gaudi dialect, is more significant than the influence of Telugu and Chattisgarhi. The Halvi-speaking people are a bit more cultured than Modis.
Halvi speaking people originally lived in Rarh, hence their facial features resemble those of Bengali people. Halvi-speaking people do not like to live at places over 1500 feet high because of their food habits. Attempts to rehabilitate Bengalis at Dandaka- ranya failed miserably because of this peculiar characteristic of the Bengall ancial psychology. The Bengalees live at Siliguri, but not near the ten gardens which are located at a height of 1700 feet. Lepas and Bhutias live at this height, but not Bengalees. Bhumila Bengalis live at an elevation of less than 1500 feet, while Ranthal tribals can live above 1500 feet. Santhals were the original inhabitants of the Champu valley of Chattisgarh, and migrated to Harh about 250 years ago. Arrangement for reloca- tion and settling people should always be made according to their social psychology and food habits.

Shrii P. R. Sarkar
Baba visited today Dalma hill, which is situated 35 kilo- meters from Tata. A Shiva temple with Shiva linga made of stone is situated here and several Brahmans reside in the nearby village. Water is offered to this deity during the month of Shravana (August) but the priest is quite ignorant of the rituals observed in the temple. The temple is not an ancient cons- truction, thus nothing historical can be found in the temple.
Lying below a banyan tree we found a small nude idol with five faces in the form of a person sitting in cross-legged posture. The idol had caps on its heads and long ears, but there were no ornaments on its body. A type of Shiva-linga and a correspon- ding Gauri Pittha were also found nearby. Baba observed:
The small nude idol was an idol of Panchaphana Tirthankara. a Jain deity. The idol could not have been a Kartika deity be- eause they are six-faced deities. It could not be Hindu-Shiva because the five-faced Hindu-Shiva has three eyes, wears a tiger skin and is never depicted nude. Hindu Shiva is also accom panied by an idol of Parvati. If Parvati is not present the idol could be of Ardha Narishvara Shiva, half male and half female idol. None of the characteristics were in the small nude idol of Panchaphana Tirthankar. The presence of a large Shiva linga and Gauri Pitha in the viscinity confirms that it was a Jain deity and that the region had a long period of Jain influence.
There was no a sacred thread around the idol which indi- cated that it was against Vedaism, and is further evidence that it was a Jain deity of Panchaphan Tirthankara.
People belonging to the Singh munda (Bhaumika), Majhii (Santhal), Mahato, Sudu (Mundle) Naga (Kayastha) Saraka and and Garaih communities live in this region. People of the Doma caste also live here and make things from bamboo. They some times act as priests and call themselves Kalindis, Kalindis are Jains and Buddhists who still worship at Jain and Buddhist tem ples and hold the title 'pundita'.
At some places breasts have been put on the Panchaphana idol and people started worshipping it as Manasa devi (goddess).

However, Shankaracarya converted Joytirlinga or Jain Shiva into a Hindu-Shiva and named the twelve lingas or Dvadasha liunga, as in Somnatha, Mallikanatha, Mandales har, Vishvanatha, Tarake shwara and Rameshvara, who were all Jain Jyotilinga.
The civilization around the place dates back 2500 years and old Kali temple should be located somewhere in the near vici nity. The Singh munda tribe speaks Bengali while other tribes speak their own tribal dialects.
448 The staple food here is horse gram and cooked rice. Horse "gram is a valuable food and is good for the liver and kidneys. There are three varieties of horse gram-while, black and red The red one is the most nutritious. Harsh gram does not dissolve tf it is cooked into pulse, and sometimes it is cooked with rice.

Tea contains tanic acid, which is static and bad for the mind and body. Family persons may drink in small quantities. How ever if it ia taken in larger quanlity it is detrimental for medi tation. Cannabis Indica or Ganja also adversely affects the mind because it creates a disturbing stir in the brain.

The same night (9-4-84) whili walking at the place where He was staying, Baba made the following comments:
Tribals live in different parts of India, like Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Meghalaya and other northeastern areas gions. and have distinct, ethnological and linguistic characteri- tics. Many tribals know their own dialect and language spoken most widely in their region. The people living in the Rohtas district of the Bhojapuri area belong to the Austric tribe. They speak their own dialect but they also speak Bhojpuri as their second mother tongue. Tharus, who reside in [the Bhojpur area of Nepal speak a non Aryan dialect and Bhojpuri. In Bengal the Munda, Homunda and Uraon speak Bengali as their second mother tongue. In Tripura and Mizoram the people of Jamatia and Chakma tribe speak Bengali as their second mother tongue. The use of a second mother tongue changes from tribe to tribc and varies according to the language spoken in the region in which the tribe lives.
