## Delhi, February, 26, 1984

Baba visited Nehru park today. 

While walking around the park He observed that small hills have been a feature of Delhi's Rogaphy since the time of the Mahabharata, while today several large ponds decorate the capital.

Baba also commented that French influence on the English people has been very great.

Even 'London' has been derived from the French word 'Londres'. 

In the past, the British royal family and aristocracy proudly spoke French while the commoners spoke English.

Long before the partition of India, ordinary people in Lahore spoke Urdu.

The Sikhs used Gurumukhi script in personal tranactions while the language spoken in court was Urdu, written in Persian script. 

Gurumukhi is not a historical script. 

It was invented and implemented by Arjun Dev, a guru of the Sikhs. 

in the northwest of Allahabad, which included west U.P., Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Duggar-desh (Jammu) and Kashmir, Afghanistan, and southern Russia, Sarada was the original script. 

Even today, the pundits of Kashmir prepare horoscopes in Sarada script. 

Modified Sarada is the script of Dogri while old businessmen in Punjab use Landaii script. 

To the east of Allahabad, Kutila or Shri Harsa script was in vogue; to the southwest of Allahabad, in west Madhya Pradesh, Mahar- ashtra and Gujrat, Nagri script prevailed. 

Maurhii is a changed form of Nagri. It had three forms- Curuwali Maurhii, Gujrati Maurhii, and Marathi Maurhii. 

For the last 80 years, only Devanagri has been used in Marathi. In Gujrati Maurhii, there is no upper line over the words. Marwari businessmen still write their cash books in Curuwali Maurhii while Gurumukhi script is only read by 'Gianis' (priests) of the Sikh community.

The Punjabi language had no grammatical structure. 

It had 3 dialects:

1. The dialect around Amritsar
2. The dialect of Sialkot
3. Multani dialect, a blended form of Dogri, which has been influenced by Sindhi. 

Guru Granth Sahib contains the devotional songs of Miira Bai. 

Miira spoke a mixture of Marwari, her father's language, Mewari, her father-in-law's language and Braja, the language of the place where she lived during her old

For example, the Dasheri mango of Lucknow is less sweet if it is grown in Bengal, while the Langra mangoes of Lucknow, Varanasi, and Hazipur also differ with changes in the environ ment. 

People also change with environmental changes. 

In a dry climate people tend to be laborious while those in a wet climate are more lethargic. 

The capacity for physical labour de Ereases with increasing wetness. 

For example, the people of West Punjab are more laborious than those of East Punjab and the people of East Punjab are more laborious than those of Haryana.

The pattern continues across India, up to Bengal, Assam and Orissa, Refugees from West Punjab, for instance, can migrate to other places in India and experience little hardship in adjusting to physical work. 

The opposite may also apply. 

If an Assamese bay is brought up in Punjab, he will gradually develop the capa eity for more physical labour. 

In the Bhojpuri area, the people of Arrah are more laborious than those of Gorakhpur, since the climate in Gorakhpur is wetter due to the Himalayan Tarai. 

People from Arrah go to Gorakhpur to perform manual labour. Baba has termed this phenomenon the East-Wet Theory.

While looking at a structure near the road, Baba said that stone used in the construction has no stability which indicates that the building would probably have been constructed about 300 years ago.

Nemitic architecture influenced the monuments of the Pathan Berled since the Pathans came to India from semitic lands. 

The Moghuls came from Turkistan and outer Mongolia and were Turkish-speaking people while the Pathans spoke Persian. Urdu is a mixture of Turkish, Persian, and the Hariyanavi of Delhi. Many Turkish words like 'hava' (air), 'cammaca' (spoon), 'kita' (Hoor), 'kursi' (chair) and 'mez' (table), are popular in Hindi,

During the time of Yayati Keshari and Ananta Keshari, the Area of Orissa stretched from the Suvarnarekha river to the Godavari river. By 1912 Orissa was a small state consis- ting of five districts-Balasore, Cuttock, Sambalpur, Mayur- bhan) and Puri. 

The languages of north and south Orissa are In Berhampur, the spoken dialect very similar to Telugu.
a mixture of Oriya and Telugu although in some portions of

<!-- 65 -->

Berhampur district people speak Telugu' the way it is spoken in the Cirear area of Andhra Pradesh. 

By 1937, Ganjam and Koraput were added to Orissa after the findings of the Odonel Commi- ssion. Some portions of Balasore were under French domination. A separate Sindh was created under the Montague Chelmsford Report and before that, it was a part of Punjab.

An examination of international relations reveals that politi- cal boundaries continuously change; only a few decades before Burma was separated from India. 

In India, there was no sepa- Fate state of Orissa between 1757 and 1912. Rather it was in- eluded in Bengal presidency and once Chauth or tax in Orissa was realised by the Bhonsles of Nagpur.

The construction of tombs was a rare phenomenon during the Pathan period. Art and architecture then were still in their developmental stage and had not attained a degree of subtleity or sophistication.

Delhi, Feb. 28, 1984

Today Baba visited Suraj-Kund, a tourist resort. It has:
- round-shaped pond
- ancient relics 

<!-- Baba examined the surroundings and made the following observations. -->


{{< l a="Baba" >}}
The history of this place is older than Pathan rule in India. 

The Tomar Dynasty is a branch of Jastika Ksattriyas. They ruled from the west of Delhi to Sirhind. 

Sirhind used to be the water barrier of northern India. The Pandavas were Jastika Ksattriyas, while Krishna was a Vrsnika Ksattriya. 

The Pandavas moved throughout northern India.

Raja Surajmal constructed this pond and it was named after him.

Ponds with a round shape are called "kunda" while those with a rectangular shape are called Sansvapii.

If the shape is oval, the pond is called "tadaga" in Sanskrit.
{{< /l >}}


*Surajkunda is a place in Hariyana about 40 kilometres north west of Delhi.


The pond and buildings were constructed entirely of long, thin stone slabs. 

Local people explained that on the bank of the pond there used to be a sun-temple, which was destroyed. 

The sun was the deity of Shakaldwipi Brahmans who came to India from Sacdonia, South Russia. 

The deity was dressed in pyjama, long coat and a fez, Muslim style cap. Hindu gods were never depicted in this manner. 

If the temple had contained the deity Gomateshvar, it would have demonstrated Swetamvara Jain's in- fluence. And if it was a sun-temple, the purohit or priest must have belonged to the Shakaldwipii section of Brahmans. 

In that case, Shakaldwipiis who are fair and tall would be found in the nearby villages. A survey of the place would reveal such facts.

The Aryans started their journey to India from the Caucasian area of south Russia. 

First, they went to Aryana Braja (Persia) and long ago they visited it.

'Braj' means enjoyment synchronised with movement.

The Aryans liked the Persian countryside very much and so they called it Aryanya Braja.

Later, the word Aryanya Braja was transformed into Iran bej, which later became Iran. 

From Aryana Braja the Aryans went to Gandhara, then to Sapta Sindhu, and then Harita dhanya or Hariyana, which included this area as well.

'Sar' means 'head'. Those who work with mind or head are known as 'Sarkar'.

Accordingly, 'Sardar' means 'leader'. 

The medieval English term for 'sir' was 'sire' as the term for 'father' was 'frere'.

Sarasvat Brahmans live on the west of Delhi, Gauriya Brahmans reside towards the southeast of Delhi in Rajasthan.

Joshi Brahmans live towards the north of Delhi while Kanyakubja Brahmans live towards the east, in west U.P.

The Kaoravas ruled on the north of Delhi and the Pandavas on the south. 

Panchals were rulers in the northeast of Delhi up to Himachal border while the kinnaors lived in the area from the borders of Panchala to the borders of Tibet.

<!-- 67 -->

The Kinnaors were an extremely attractive race which caused others to ask, Kim narah asti ? (Are they humans?)

In Sanskrit 'Kinnaor' was derived from 'Kimnarah'. 

Polyandry amongst the women was the custom in those days. 

For example, Draupadi had 5 husbands.

Even today, the system of polyandry continues in Kinnaor. 

Beautiful people are also found between Philippines and Hawaii.

While looking at the Palash flower, Baba said that it is called 'Kinshuka' in Sanskrit, while in Paeshachi Prakrta and Shaoraseni Prakrta it is called 'tesu'.

In Punjab, tesu was used for colouring sweets. 

On the occasion of Hola, a festival observed the day after Holi, the people of Punjab would dance and sing. 

"Ai basantide bahara, amba mole, tesu mole, mola rahii kachnar, which means "The verdant beauty of spring has come, tesu and kacanara flowers have blossomed."

A thorough study of the history of Delhi will also reveal the history of north Rajasthan, as both places are closely connected. 

Popular folk songs will also tell a lot about the history of this area. In Rajasthan, a blending of Scythian Bhiils including Shaks, Huns, and Kushans, and Aryans took palce, and the leading people became Rajputs. 

The culture of Rajputana is a blending of Aryan and Bhiil cultures. There are several places where Bhills were the dominant race; for example, in Bhiilawada. 

Wada means locality. Kota was named after the brave leader, Kotia Bhill From Mount Abu to Gujrat, the Sirohiis were dominant and to the south of Rajasthan, the Nagars were dominant. In Rajasthan, different tribes have their own group characteristics. 

In Mewar, one finds extremely warlike people while Hadas are fighters as well as farmers and the Marwaris are mostly commercial-minded people.

Although this place is negleced today, it is an ancient part of India's civilisation. Unfortunately, people have forgotten their historical legacy. 

To illustrate this point Baba told an instructive story regarding Rama. It is said that Rama forgot that he was Parama Purusa. 

The gods quite recognised this and deputed some representatives to remind Rama every now and then, that he was Parama Purusa. 

Through constant reminding Rama became conscious of his true self. should be made conscious of their glorious history. 

<!-- Although Similarly, people vested interests are always trying to keep people ignorant and apathetic, a strong social consciousness must be generated in the minds of the people. -->
