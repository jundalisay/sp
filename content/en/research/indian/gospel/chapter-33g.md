Sri Ramakrishna now addressed Mahimacharan, who was a householder.


MASTER: "What need is there of renouncing the world altogether? It is enough if you can
rid yourself of attachment. But you must have sādhanā you have to fight the sense-
organs.

"It is a great advantage to fight from inside a fort. You get much help from the fort. The
world is the place for enjoyment. After enjoying different things, you should give them
up one by one. Once I had a desire to put a gold chain around my waist. I obtained one
at last and put it on, but I had to take it off immediately.

"Once I ate some onion. While eating it I discriminated, 'O mind, this is onion.' Then I
moved it to different places in my mouth and at last spat it out."

A musician was expected. He was to sing with his party. Sri Ramakrishna asked the
devotees every now and then, "Where is the musician?"

MAHIMA: "We are quite all right as we are."

MASTER: "No, sir. You get this all through the year."

A devotee outside the room said, "The musician has come."

Sri Ramakrishna was filled with joy and said, "Ah! Has he?"

Mats were spread on the floor of the long verandah northeast of the Master's room. Sri
Ramakrishna said: "Sprinkle a little Ganges water on the mats. Many worldly people
have sat on them."

The ladies of Pyari Babu's family, from Bali, had come to visit the temples. They wanted
to listen to the kirtan. A devotee said to Sri Ramakrishna: "These ladies have been
inquiring whether there would be any place in the room for them. Can they have seats?"

The kirtan had already begun. The Master said, "No, no! Where is any room here?"
Master and Narayan

Narayan arrived and saluted Sri Ramakrishna. The latter said tenderly: "Why have you
come? Your people at home have beaten you so much!" He signed to Baburam to give
Narayan something to eat. Narayan entered the Master's room. Suddenly Sri
Ramakrishna followed him. He wanted to feed Narayan with his own hands. Afterwards
he returned to the verandah.
720Many devotees were present, including Vijay, Mahimacharan, Narayan, M., and the
younger Gopal. Soon Narayan came back to the verandah and took his seat by the
Master.
About three o'clock Adhar arrived. At the sight of him Sri Ramakrishna appeared excited.
The devotee saluted the Master and sat on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna beckoned to him
to come nearer.
When the music was over the gathering of devotees broke up. Some began to stroll in
the garden and some went to the temples to watch the evening service.
In the evening arrangements were made for kirtan inside the Master's room. Sri
Ramakrishna eagerly asked a devotee to have an extra lamp. The two lamps lit the room
brightly.
Sri Ramakrishna said to Vijay: "Why are you sitting there? Come nearer to me." This
time the kirtan created an intense atmosphere. The Master danced in an ecstasy of joy;
the devotees also danced encircling him. While Vijay was dancing his cloth dropped. He
was unconscious.
When the music was over, Vijay began to look for his key, which had fallen somewhere.
The Master said to him with a laugh, "Why bother about it any more?"
He meant that Vijay should have nothing more to do with boxes and keys.
Kishori saluted Sri Ramakrishna and was about to take his leave. The Master blessed
him, touching his chest tenderly, and bade him good-bye. His words were full of love. M.
and Gopal saluted the Master. They too were about to take their leave. He said to them
with the same affection: "Couldn't you go tomorrow morning? You may catch cold at
night."
M. and Gopal decided to spend the night with Sri Ramakrishna. They sat on the floor
with a few other devotees.
Sri Ramakrishna had had no rest the whole day: the devotees had been with him all the
time. He went out for a few minutes. Returning to the room he saw M. taking down a
song from Ramlal.
MASTER: "What are you doing?"
M. said that he was writing down a song. On being told what the song was, the Master
remarked that it was a rather long song. M. wrote a line or two and then stopped
writing.
A little later Sri Ramakrishna took his supper of farina pudding and one or two luchis. A
lighted lamp stood on a stand by his side. M. sat near him. The Master asked if there
were any sweets in the room. M. had brought some sandesh which he had put on the
721shelf. Sri Ramakrishna asked M. to give him a sweet. M. searched for the sweets but
could not find them. He was embarrassed. They had been given to the devotees.
After finishing his supper, Sri Ramakrishna sat on the small couch and M. seated himself
on the foot-rug. The Master, talking about Narayan, was overcome with emotion.
MASTER: "I saw Naran today."
M: "Yes, sir. His eyes were moist. When I looked at his face I felt like weeping."
MASTER: 'The sight of him arouses a mother's love in me, as it were. His relatives beat
him at home because he comes here. There is none to defend him."M : 'The other day
he left his books at Haripada's house and fled to you.
MASTER: "It was not good for him to do that."
Sri Ramakrishna was silent. After a few minutes he continued.
MASTER: "You see, he has much substance in him. Otherwise, how could I be attracted
to him even though I was listening to the kirtan at the time? I had to leave the music
and go into the room. That never happened before."
Again Sri Ramakrishna fell silent. A few minutes later he began to talk.
MASTER: "In an ecstatic state I asked him how he was feeling. He just said he was
happy. (To M.) Feed him now and then-as parents do their child."
Sri Ramakrishna then spoke about Tejchandra.
MASTER (to M.): "Please ask him what he thinks of me. Does he thinkof me as a Jnāni?
Or what does he say about me? I understand that he is very reticent. (To Gopal) Ask
Tejchandra to come here Saturdays and Tuesdays. (To M.) Suppose I go to your school
and look for-"
M. thought that Sri Ramakrishna wanted to go to his school to see Narayan. He said to
the Master, "You might as well wait at our house."
MASTER: "No, I have something else in mind. I should like to see whetherthere are other
worth-while boys in the school."
M: "Of course you can go. Other visitors come to the school. You cancome too."
Sri Ramakrishna was smoking. M. and Gopal finished their supper. They decided to sleep
in the nahabat. M. again sat on the floor near Sri Ramakrishna.
MASTER (to M.): 'There may be some pots and pans in the nahabat.Why not sleep here
in this room?"
722M: "Very well, sir."
It was ten or eleven o'clock at night. Sri Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch,
resting against a pillow. M. sat on the floor. The Master was conversing with him. A lamp
burnt on a stand near the wall. The Master felt great compassion for his devotees. He
wanted to bless M. by accepting his personal service.
MASTER: "My feet ache. Please rub them gently."
M. seated himself on the small couch and took the Master's feet on his lap. He stroked
them. Now and then Sri Ramakrishna would ask his disciple a question.
MASTER (smiling): "How did you like today's conversation?"
M: "Very much indeed."
MASTER (smiling): "How I spoke about the Emperor Akbar!"
M: "It was very good."
MASTER: "Repeat it to me."
M: "A fakir came to visit Akbar. The Emperor was saying his prayers. In his prayers he
was asking God to give him wealth and riches. Thereupon the fakir was about to leave
the room quietly. Later, when the Emperor asked him about it, the fakir said, 'If I must
beg, why should I beg of a beggar?'"
MASTER: "What else did we talk about?"
M: "You told us a great deal about saving up for the future."
MASTER (smiling): "What did I say?"
M: "As long as a man feels that he must try, he should make an effort. How well you told
us about it at Sinthi!"
MASTER: "What did I say?"
M: "God takes upon Himself complete responsibility for one who totally depends upon
Him. It is like a guardian taking charge of a minor. You also told us that at a feast a child
cannot by himself find a place to eat his meal; someone finds a place for him."
MASTER: "No, that is not quite to the point. I said that the child doesn't fall if the father
leads him and holds his hand."
M: "You also described the three classes of sādhus. The best sādhu does not move about
to get his food; he lives in one place and gets his food there, You told us about that
723young sādhu who said, when he saw the breasts of a young girl, 'Why has she those
abscesses?' You told us many other things."
MASTER (smiling): "What else?"
M: "About the crow of Pampa Lake. He repeated the name of Rāma day and night. That
is why he couldn't drink the water though he went to its edge. And about the holy man
in whose book was written only 'Om Rāma'. And what Hanuman said to Rāma."
MASTER: "What did he say?"
M: "Hanuman said to Rāma: 'I saw Sita in Ceylon; but it was only her body. Her mind
and soul were lying at Your feet.'
"And about the chatak bird. He will not drink anything but rain-water. And about
jnanayoga and bhaktiyoga."
MASTER: "What did I say about them?"
M: "As long as one is conscious of the 'jar', the ego will certainly remain. As long as one
is conscious of 'I', one cannot get rid of the idea, 'I am the devotee and Thou art God'."
MASTER: "No, it is not that; the 'jar' doesn't disappear whether one is conscious of it or
not. One cannot get rid of the 'I'. You may reason a thousand times; still it will not go."
M. remained silent a few moments.
M: "You had that talk with Ishan Mukherji in the Kāli temple. We were very lucky to be
there."
MASTER (smiling): "Yes, yes. Tell me, what did I say?"
M: "You said that work is only the first step. You told us that you said to Sambhu Mallick,
'If God appears before you, will you ask Him for a number of hospitals and dispensaries?'
"You said another thing: God does not reveal Himself to a person as long as he is
attached to work. You said that to Keshab Sen."
MASTER: "What did I say?"
M: "As long as the baby plays with the toy and forgets everything else, its mother looks
after her cooking and other household duties; but when the baby throws away the toy
and cries, then the mother puts down the rice-pot and comes to the baby.
"You said another thing that day: Lakshmana asked Rāma where one could find God;
after a great deal of explanation, Rāma said to him, 'Brother, I dwell in the man in whom
you find ecstatic love-a love which makes him laugh and weep and dance and sing.' "
724MASTER: "Ah me! Ah me!"
Sri Ramakrishna sat in silence a few minutes.
M: "That day you spoke only words of renunciation to Ishan. Since then many of us have
come to our senses. Now we are eager to reduce our duties. You said that day, 'Ravana
died in Ceylon and Behula wept bitterly for him.'"
Sri Ramakrishna laughed aloud.
M. (humbly): "Sir, isn't it desirable to reduce the number of one's duties and
entanglements?"
MASTER: "Yes. But it is a different thing if you happen to come across a sādhu or a poor
man. Then you should serve him."
M: "And. that day you spoke very rightly to Ishan about flatterers. They are like vultures
on a carcass. You once said that to Padmalochan also."
MASTER: "No, to Vamandas of Ulo."
After a while M. sat on the floor near the small couch. Sri Ramakrishna felt sleepy; he
said to M.: "Go to sleep. Where is Gopal? Please shut the door."
Next morning Sri Ramakrishna left his bed very early. As usual, he chanted the holy
names of the different gods and goddesses. Now and then he looked at the sacred river.
The morning worship began in the temples of Radhakanta and Mother Kāli. M. had spent
the night on the floor of the Master's room. He left his bed and watched the worship in.
the different temples.
Sri Ramakrishna finished his bath and went with M. to the Kāli temple. He asked the
disciple to lock the door of his room.
In the temple he took the seat in front of the image of Kāli and offered flowers,
sometimes at Her feet and sometimes on his own head. He fanned the Deity. Then he
returned to his room and asked M. to unlock the door. Entering the room, he sat on the
small couch. He was completely overwhelmed with divine fervour and began to chant the
name of God. M. sat alone on the floor. Sri Ramakrishna began to sing about the Divine
Mother:
Who is there that can understand what Mother Kāli is?
Even the six darsanas are powerless to reveal Her.
It is She, the scriptures say, that is the Inner Self
Of the yogi, who in Self discovers all his joy;
She that, of Her own sweet will, inhabits every living thing. .
Then he sang:
All creation is the sport of my mad Mother Kāli;
By Her māyā the three worlds are bewitched. . . .
725He continued:
O Kāli, who can know Thee? Numberless are Thy forms. . .
Again he sang:
O Mother, redeem me speedily!
From terror of the King of Death I am about to die.
M. said to himself, "I wish he would sing:
Mother, Thou canst not trick me any more,
For I have seen Thy crimson Lotus Feet."
Strangely enough, no sooner had the thought passed through M.'s mind than Sri
Ramakrishna sang the song. A few minutes later he said to M., "What do you think of the
present state of my mind?"
M. (smiling): "It is your simple and natural state."
Sri Ramakrishna sang to himself the following refrain of a song:
Unless a man is simple, he cannot recognize God, the Simple
One.
