There was a big plot of wooded land to the west of the monastery compound. M. was seated alone under a tree, when suddenly Prasanna appeared. It was about 3pm

{{< l a="M" >}}
Where have you been all these days? Everyone has been so worried about you. Have you seen the brothers? When did you arrive?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
Just now. Yes, I have seen them.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="M" >}}
You left a note saying that you were going to Vrindāvan. We were terribly worried about you. How far did you go?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
Only as far as Konnagar.
{{< /r >}}

Both of them laughed.

{{< l a="M" >}}
Sit down. Tell me all about it. Where did you stop first?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
At the Dakshineswar temple garden. I spent one night there.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="M" >}}
(smiling): "What is Hazra's present mood?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
Hazra asked me, 'What do you think of me?'
{{< /r >}}

Both laughed.

{{< l a="M" >}}
(smiling): "What did you say?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
I said nothing.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="M" >}}
Then?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
Then he asked me whether I had brought tobacco for him.
{{< /r >}}

Both laughed.

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
He wanted me to wait on him.
{{< /r >}}


(Laughter.)


{{< l a="M" >}}
Where did you go next?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
By degrees I got to Konnagar. I spent the night in the open. I intended to proceed farther and asked some gentlemen whether I could procure enough money there for a railway ticket to the up-country.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="M" >}}
What did they say?
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
They said, 'You may get a rupee or so; but who will give you the whole fare?'
{{< /r >}}

Both laughed.

{{< l a="M" >}}
What did you take with you?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Prasanna" >}}
Oh, one or two pieces of cloth and a picture of the Master. I didn't show the picture to anybody.

Śaśi Śaśi's father came to the Math. He wanted to take his son home. During Sri Ramakrishna's illness Śaśi had nursed the Master for nine months with unswerving zeal.

He had won a scholarship in the Entrance Examination for his academic ability and had
studied up to the B.A., but he had not appeared at the examination. His father, a poor
brahmin, was a devout Hindu and spent much of his time in spiritual practice. Śaśi was
his eldest son. His parents had hoped that, after completing his education, he would
earn money and remove the family's financial difficulties.

But Śaśi had renounced the
world for the realization of God. Whenever he thought of his father and mother he felt
great anguish of heart. Many a time he said to his friends, with tears in his eyes: 

{{< r a="Sasi" >}}
"I am at a loss as to my duty. 

I could not serve my parents; I could not be of any use to them. What great hope they placed in me! On account of our poverty my mother did not have any jewelry. 

I cherished the desire to buy some for her. But now all my hopes are frustrated; it is impossible for me to return home. My Master asked me to renounce 'woman and gold'. I simply cannot return home.

After Sri Ramakrishna's passing away Śaśi's father had hoped that his son would come back to his family. The boy had spent a few days at home, but immediately after the establishment of the new monastery he had begun to frequent it and, after a few days, had decided to remain there as one of the members. Every now and then his father came to the monastery to persuade him to come home; but he had not succeeded. This day, on learning that his father had come, Śaśi fled the monastery by another door. He did not want to meet him.

Śaśi's father knew M. They paced the upper verandah together and talked.

{{< r a="Father of Sasi" >}}
Who is in charge of this place? Narendra alone is the cause of all the mischief. For a while all these young men returned home and devoted themselves to their studies.
{{< /r >}}


M: "There is no master here. They are all equals. What can Narendra do? Can a man renounce home against his own will? Have we householders, for instance, been able to give up our homes altogether?"


{{< r a="Father of Sasi" >}}
You are doing the right thing. You are serving both the world and God. Can't one practise religion after your method? That is exactly what we want Śaśi to do. Let him live at home and come here too. You have no idea how much his mother weeps
for him.
{{< /r >}}


M. became sad and said nothing.

{{< r a="Father of Sasi" >}}
If you speak of searching for holy men, I know where to find a good one. Let Śaśi go to him.
{{< /r >}}
