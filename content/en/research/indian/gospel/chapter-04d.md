When the song was over, the Master walked up and down the northeast verandah, where Hazra was seated with M. 

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
[to a devotee] Do you ever have dreams?
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Devotee" >}}
Yes, sir. The other day I dreamt a strange dream. I saw the whole world enveloped in water. There was water on all sides. A few boats were visible, but suddenly huge waves appeared and sank them. I was about to board a ship with a few others, when we saw a brahmin walking over that expanse of water. 

I asked him, 'How can you walk over the deep?' 
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Brahmin" >}}
(smiling): 'Oh, there is no difficulty about that. There is a bridge under the water. I am going to Bhawanipur, the city of the Divine Mother
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Devotee" >}}
Wait! I shall accompany you.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Oh. I am thrilled to hear the story!"
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Brahmin" >}}
I am in a hurry. It will take you some time to get out of the boat. Good-bye. Remember this path and come after me.
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
My hair is standing on end! Please be initiated by a guru as soon as possible.
{{< /l >}}


Shortly before midnight Narendra and the other devotees lay down on a bed made on the floor of the Master's room.

At dawn some of the devotees were up. They saw the Master, naked as a child, pacing up and down the room, repeating the names of the various gods and goddesses. 

<!-- His voice was sweet as nectar. Now he would look at the Ganges, now stop in front of the pictures hanging on the wall and bow down before them, chanting all the while the holy names in his sweet voice. He chanted:  -->

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Veda, Purana, Tantra; Gita, Gayatri; Bhagavata, Bhakta, Bhagavan
{{< /l >}}


Referring to the Gita, he repeated many times, "Tagi, tagi, tagi."

Now and then he would say: 

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
O Mother, you are verily Brahman and Śakti. You are Purusha and Prakriti. You are Virat. You are the Absolute, and You manifest Yourself as the Relative. You are verily the 24 cosmic principles.
{{< /l >}}


In the mean time the morning service had begun in the temples of Kāli and Radhakanta.

Sounds of conch-shells and cymbals were carried on the air. The devotees came outside the room and saw the priests and servants gathering flowers in the garden for the divine service in the temples. 

From the nahabat floated the sweet melody of musical instruments, befitting the morning hours.

Narendra and the other devotees finished their morning duties and came to the Master.

With a sweet smile on his lips Sri Ramakrishna was standing on the northeast verandah, close to his own room.

{{< r a="Narendra" >}}
We noticed several sannyasis belonging to the sect of Nanak in the Panchavati.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Yes, they arrived here yesterday. (To Narendra) I'd like to see you all sitting together on the mat."
{{< /l >}}


As they sat there the Master looked at them with evident delight. He then began to talk with them. Narendra asked about spiritual discipline. 

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Bhakti, love of God, is the essence of all spiritual discipline. Through love one acquires renunciation and discrimination naturally.
{{< /l >}}


## Disciplines of Tantra

{{< r a="Narendra" >}}
Isn't it true that the Tantra prescribes spiritual discipline in the company of woman?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
That is not desirable. It is a very difficult path and often causes the aspirant's downfall. There are three such kinds of discipline. One may regard woman as one's mistress or look on oneself as her handmaid or as her child. I look on woman as my mother. To look on oneself as her handmaid is also good; but it is extremely difficult to practise spiritual discipline looking on woman as one's mistress. To regard oneself as her child is a very pure attitude.

The sannyasis belonging to the sect of Nanak entered the room and greeted the Master, saying, "Namo Narayanaya." Sri Ramakrishna asked them to sit down.


## All is possible with God

{{< l a="Ramakrishna" >}}
Nothing is impossible for God. Nobody can describe His nature in words. Everything is possible for Him. 

There were 2 yogis practising spiritual discipline. The sage Narada was passing that way one day. Realizing who he was, one of the yogis said:
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Yogi" >}}
You have just come from God. What is He doing now?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Narada" >}}
I saw Him making camels and elephants pass and repass through the eye of a needle.
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Yogi" >}}
Is that anything to wonder at? Everything is possible for God.
{{< /r >}}

{{< r a="Other Yogi" >}}
What? Making elephants pass through the eye of a needle - is that ever possible? You have never been to the Lord's dwelling-place.
{{< /r >}}
