To attain God a man must have certain favourable conditions: the company of holy men, discrimination, and the blessings of a real teacher. Perhaps his elder brother takes
the responsibility for the family; perhaps his wife has spiritual qualities and is very
virtuous; perhaps he is not married at all or entangled in worldly life. He succeeds when
conditions like these are fulfilled.

"In a certain family a man lay seriously ill. He was at the point of death. Someone said:
'Here is a remedy: First it must rain when the star Svati is in the ascendant; then some
of that rain-water must collect in a human skull; then a frog must come there and a
snake must chase it; and as the frog is about to be bitten by the snake, it must jump
away and the poison of the snake must drop into the skull. You must prepare a medicine
from this poison and give it to the patient. Then he will live.' The head of the family
consulted the almanac about the star and set out at the right moment. With great
longing of heart he began to search for the different ingredients. He prayed to God, 'O
Lord, I shall succeed only if You bring together all the ingredients.' As he was roaming
about he actually saw a skull lying on the ground. Presently there came a shower of
rain. Then the man exclaimed: 'O gracious Lord, I have got the rain-water under Svati,
and the skull too. What is more, some of the rain has fallen into the skull. Now be kind
enough to bring together the other ingredients.' He was reflecting with a yearning heart
when he saw a poisonous snake approaching. His joy knew no bounds. He became so
excited that he could feel the thumping of his own heart. 'O God,' he prayed, 'now the
snake has come too. I have procured most of the ingredients. Please be gracious and
give me the remaining ones.' No sooner did he pray thus than a frog hopped up. The
snake pursued it. As they came near the skull and the snake was about to bite the frog,
the frog jumped over the skull and the snake's poison fell into it. The man began to
dance, clapping his hands for joy. So I say that one gets everything through yearning.
705"A man cannot realize God unless he renounces everything mentally. A sādhu cannot lay
things up. 'Birds and wandering monks do not make provision for the morrow.' Such is
the state of my mind that I cannot carry even clay in my hand. Once, when Hriday
tormented me, I thought of leaving this place and going to Benares. I thought of taking
some clothes with me. But how could I take money? So I could not go to Benares. 

(All laugh.)



(To Mahima) "You are a householder. Therefore you should hold both to 'this' and to 'that'-both to the world and to God."
MAHlMA: "Sir, can one who holds to 'that' also hold to 'this'?"
MASTER: "Once, sitting on the bank of the Ganges neat the Panchavati, holding a rupee
in one hand and clay in the other, I discriminated, 'The rupee is the clay-the clay is verily
the rupee, and the rupee is verily the clay', and then threw the rupee into the river. But
I was a little frightened. 'How foolish of me to offend the goddess of fortune!' I thought.
'What shall I do if she doesn't provide me with food any more?' Then, like Hazra, I
sought help in a ruse. I said to the goddess, 'Mother, may you dwell in my heart.' Once
the Divine Mother was pleased with a man's austerities and said to him, 'You may ask a
favour of Me.' 'O Mother,' said he, 'if You are so pleased. with me, then grant that I may
eat from a gold plate with my grandchildren.' Now, in one boon the man got everything:
grandchildren, wealth, and gold plate. 

(All laugh.)

"When the mind is freed from 'woman and gold', it can be directed to God and become
absorbed in Him. It is the bound alone who can be freed.
The moment the mind 'turns away from God, it is bound. When does the lower needle of
a pair of scales move away from the upper one? When one pan is pressed down by a
weight. 'Woman and gold' is the weight.
"Why does a child cry on coming out of its mother's womb? With its cry it says, as it
were: 'Just see where I am now! In my mother's womb I was meditating on the Lotus
Feet of God; but see where I am now!'

(To Mahima) "You should renounce mentally. Live the life of a house holder in a spirit of
detachment."

MAHIMA: "Can a man live in the world if his mind is once directed to God?"
See God in the world

MASTER: "Why not? Where will he go away from the world? I realize that wherever I live
I am always in the Ayodhya of Rāma. This whole world is Rāma's Ayodhya. After
receiving instruction from His teacher, Rāma said that He would renounce the world.
Daśaratha sent the sage Vasishtha to Rāma to dissuade Him. Vasishtha found Him filled
with intense renunciation. He said to Rāma: 'First of all, reason with me, Rāma; then You
may leave the world. May I ask You if this world is outside, God? If that is so, then You
may give it up.' Rāma found that it is God alone who has become the universe and all its
706living beings. Everything in the world appears real on account of God's reality behind it.
Thereupon Rāma became silent.

"In the world a man must fight against passions like lust and anger, against many
desires, against attachment. It is convenient to fight from inside a fort-from his own
home. At home he gets his food and other help from his wife. In the Kaliyuga the life of
a man depends entirely on food. It is better to get food at one place than to knock at
seven doors for it. Living at home is like facing the battle from a fort.
"Live in the world like a cast-off leaf in a gale. Such a leaf is sometimes blown inside a
house and sometimes to a rubbish heap. The leaf goes wherever the wind blows-
sometimes to a good place and sometimes to a bad. Now God has put you in the world.
That is good. Stay here. Again, when He lifts you from here and puts you in a better
place, that will be time enough to think about what to do then.
"God has put you in the world. What can you do about it? Resign everything to Him.
Surrender yourself at His feet. Then there will be no more confusion. Then you will
realize that it is God who does everything. All depends on 'the will of Rāma'."


### The will of Rāma

A Devotee: "What is that story about 'the will of Rāma'?"

MASTER: "In a certain village there lived a weaver. He was a very pious soul. Everyone
trusted him and loved him. He used to sell his goods in the market-place. When a
customer asked him the price of a piece of cloth, the weaver would say: 'By the will of
Rāma the price of the yarn is one rupee and the labour four ānnās ; by the will of Rāma
the profit is two ānnās . The price of the cloth, by the will of Rāma, is one rupee and six
ānnās .' Such was the people's faith in the weaver that the customer would at once pay
the price and take the cloth. The weaver was a real devotee of God. After finishing his
supper in the evening, he would spend long hours' in the worship hall meditating on God
and chanting His name and glories. Now, late one night the weaver couldn't get to sleep.
He was sitting in the worship hall, smoking now and then, when a band of robbers
happened to pass that way. They wanted a man to carry their goods and said to the
weaver, 'Come with us.' So saying, they led him off by the hand. After committing a
robbery in a house, they put a load of things on the weaver's head, commanding him to
carry them. Suddenly the police arrived and the robbers ran away. But the weaver, with
his load, was arrested. He was kept in the lock-up for the night. Next day he was
brought before the magistrate for trial. The villagers learnt what had happened and
came to court. They said to the magistrate, 'Your Honour, this man could never commit
a robbery.' Thereupon the magistrate asked the weaver to make his statement.

'The weaver said: 'Your Honour, by the will of Rāma I finished my meal at night. Then by
the will of Rāma I was sitting in the worship hall. It was quite late at night by the will of
Rāma. By the will of Rāma I had been thinking of God and chanting His name and
glories, when by the will of Rāma a band of robbers passed that way. By the will of Rāma
they dragged me with them; by the will of Rāma they committed a robbery in a house;
707and by the will of Rāma they put a load on my head. Just then, by the will of Rāma the
police arrived, and by the will of Rāma I was arrested. Then by the will of Rāma the
police kept me in the lock-up for the night, and this morning by the will of Rāma I have
been brought before Your Honour.' The magistrate realized that the weaver was a pious
man and ordered his release. On his way home the weaver said to his friends, 'By the
will of Rāma I have been released.'

"Whether a man should be a householder or a monk depends on the will of Rāma.
Surrender everything to God and do your duties in the world. What else can you do? A
clerk was once sent to prison. After the prison term was over he was released. Now,
what do you think he did? Cut capers or do his old clerical work?
"If the householder becomes a jivanmukta, then he can easily live in the world if he
likes. A man who has attained Knowledge does not differentiate between 'this place' and
'that place'. All places are the same to him. He who thinks of 'that place' also thinks of
'this place'.
