<sup>54</sup> O Kṛṣṇa, what are the symptoms of one who has attained samadhi? How does he speak, sit, and walk?

<sup>55</sup> When a man gives up all desires that have entered the mind, and finds satisfaction in the atman (soul) alone, then he is said to be in pure transcendental consciousness.

<sup>56</sup> One who is not disturbed in mind even amidst the threefold miseries or elated when there is happiness, and who is free from attachment, fear and anger, is called a sage of steady mind.

<sup>57</sup> In the material world, one who is unaffected by whatever good or evil he may obtain, neither praising it nor despising it, is firmly fixed in perfect knowledge.

<sup>58</sup> One who is able to withdraw his senses from sense objects, as the tortoise draws its limbs within the shell, is firmly fixed in perfect consciousness.

<sup>59</sup> Though the embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness.

<sup>60</sup> The senses are so strong and impetuous, O Arjuna, that they forcibly carry away the mind even of a man of discrimination who is endeavoring to control them.

<sup>61</sup> One who restrains his senses, keeping them under full control, and fixes his consciousness upon Me, is known as a man of steady intelligence.

<sup>62</sup> While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises.

<sup>63</sup> From anger, complete delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost one falls down again into the material pool.

<sup>64</sup> But a person free from all attachment and aversion and able to control his senses through regulative principles of freedom can obtain the complete mercy of the Lord.

<sup>65</sup> For one thus satisfied [in Kṛṣṇa consciousness], the threefold miseries of material existence exist no longer; in such satisfied consciousness, one’s intelligence is soon well established.

<sup>66</sup> One who is not connected with the Supreme [in Kṛṣṇa consciousness] can have neither transcendental intelligence nor a steady mind, without which there is no possibility of peace. And how can there be any happiness without peace?

<sup>67</sup> As a strong wind sweeps away a boat on the water, even one of the roaming senses on which the mind focuses can carry away a man’s intelligence.

<sup>68</sup> Therefore, O mighty-armed, one whose senses are restrained from their objects is certainly of steady intelligence.

<sup>69</sup> What is night for all beings is the time of awakening for the self-controlled; and the time of awakening for all beings is night for the introspective sage.

<sup>70</sup> A person who is not disturbed by the incessant flow of desires – that enter like rivers into the ocean, which is ever being filled but is always still – can alone achieve peace, and not the man who strives to satisfy such desires.

<sup>71</sup> A person who has given up all desires for sense gratification, who lives free from desires, who has given up all sense of proprietorship and is devoid of false ego – he alone can attain real peace.

<sup>72</sup> That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. If one is thus situated even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.
