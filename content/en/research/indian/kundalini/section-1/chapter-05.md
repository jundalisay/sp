According to the tantras, kundalini can be awakened by various methods which can be practiced individually or in combination. However, the first method cannot be practiced, because it is awakening by birth. Of course, it is too late for most of us to take advantage of this particular method, but some of us may be instrumental in producing children who have awakened kundalinis.


### 1. Awakening by birth

By a favourable birth, if your parents were highly evolved, you can have an awakened kundalion. It is also possible to be born with an awakened sushumna, ida or pingala nadi. This means that from the time of birth your higher faculties will be operating either partially or fully. If a child comes with partial awakening, he is called a saint, and if he comes with full illumination, he is known as an incarnation, avatara or son of God.

If one is born with an awakened kundalini, his experiences are very much under control. They take place in him right from the beginning in a natural way, so he never feels that something extraordinary is happening to him. A child with an awakened kundalini has clarity of vision, a high quality of thinking and a sublime philosophy. His attitude of life is somewhat unusual as he has total detachment. To him, his parents were only his means of creation, and therefore he is unable to accept the normal social relationship with them. Although he may live with them, he feels as if he were just a guest.

Such a child exhibits a very matured behaviour and he does not react emotionally with anything in life. As he grows he becomes aware of his mission and purpose in life. Many of us may wish to give birth to a yogi or an enlightened child but it is not such a simple matter. Every marriage or union of parents cannot produce a yogi, even if the man and woman practice yoga morning and night. It is only under certain circumstances that a higher being can be produced. In order to usher a highly evolved soul into this world, one has first to transform one's gross desires into spiritual aspirations.

It is very difficult to convince people of the west that a child can be born in an
enlightened state, because they have the moral attitudes of a particular religion deeply
ingrained in their minds and their faith. For them, the union between a man and a woman
is sin. If you explain to them that a yogi can be produced as a result of the sexual union,
they say, "No! How can a yogi be born out of sin?"


It is possible that у new generation of supermen will be produced in this way.
Through the practices of yoga you can transform the quality of your genes. If genes can
produce artists, scientists, inventors and intellectual geniuses, then why not awakened
kundalinis? You have to transform the quality of your sperm or ova by firstly
transforming your whole consciousness. Neitheк drugs nor diet will transform your
genes, but if you change your consciousness, you can then effect the elements of the body
and ultimately change the quality of the sperm and ova. Then you will have children with
awakened kundalinis. They will become the yogis and spiritual masters of the house who
set things right for you. They will say, "Mummy, you are not the physical body." "Pара,
drinking is no good."
Those of you who enter married life should go into it keeping in mind that the
purpose is not just pleasure, or to produce offspring, but to create a genius. All over the
world, people who marry for progeny should try for higher quality children.


### 2. Mantra

The steady regular practice of mantra is a very powerful, smooth and risk-free method.

It is a
sadhana which requires time and a lot of patience. First you need to get a suitable mantra
from a guru who knows yoga and tantra, and who can guide you through your sadhana.
When you practise the mantra incessantly, it develops in you the vision of a higher force
and enables you to live amidst the sensualities of life with indifference to them.

When you throw a pebble into a still lake, it produces circular ripples. In the same
way, when you repeat a mantra over and over again, the sound force gathers momentum
and creates vibrations in the ocean of the mind. When you repeat the mantra millions and
billions of times, it permeates every part of your brain and purifies your whole physical,
mental and emotional body.

The mantra must be chanted loudly, softly, on the mental plane and on the psychic
plane. By practising it at these four levels, kundalini awakens methodically and
systematically. You can also use the mantra by repeating it mentally in coordination with
the breath or you can sing it aloud in the form of kirtan. This creates a great potential in
mooladhara and awakening takes place.

Closely related to mantra yoga is the awakening through sound or music - nada yoga.
Here the sounds are the bija mantras and the music consists of particular melodies
corresponding to particular chakras. This is a most tender and absorbing way of
awakening.


### 3. Tapasya

This is the performance of austerities.

Tapasya is a means of purification, a burning or setting on fire so that a process of elimination is created, not in the physical body, but in the mental and emotional bodies. 

Through this process, the mind, the emotions and the whole personality are cleansed of all the dirt, complexes and patterns of behavior that cause pain and suffering. Tapasya is an act of purification. 

It should not be misunderstood to involve standing naked in cold water or snow, or observing foolish and meaningless austerities. 

When you want to eliminate a bad habit, the more you want to get rid of it, the more powerful it becomes. When you abandon it in the waking state, it appears in dreams, and when you stop those dreams, it expresses itself in your behavior or manifests in disease. This particular habit must be destroyed at its psychic root, not only at the conscious level.

The samskara and vasana must be eliminated by some form of tapasya.

Tapasya is a psychological or psycho-emotional process through which the aspirant tries to set in motion a process of metabolism that will eradicate the habits that create weakness and obstruct the awakening of willpower. 'I must do this but I can't.' 

Why does this difference between resolution and implementation arise in the mind of the aspirant? Why is it so great? It is due to a deficiency of will; and that weakness, that distance or barrier between resolution and execution can be removed through regular and repeated practice of tapasya. Then the willpower makes a decision once and the matter is finished.

This strength of will is the fruit of tapasya.

The psychology of austerity plays a very important part in the awakening of man's latent power. It is not well understood by modern man who has unfortunately accepted that man lives for 'the pleasure principle', as propounded by Freud and his disciples. 

The psychology of austerity is very sound and certainly not abnormal. When the senses are satisfied by the objective pleasures, by the comforts and luxuries, the brain and nervous system become weak and the consciousness and energy undergo a process of regression.

It is in this situation that the method of austerity is one of the most powerful and
sometimes explosive methods of awakening.

Here the manifestations are tremendous and the aspirant has to face his lower instincts in the beginning. He confronts a lot of temptations and the assaults of the satanic and tamasic forces. All the evil or negative samskaras or karmas of many, many incarnations rise to the surface. 

Sometimes fear manifests very powerfully or attachment to the world comes with a great force. In some people, sexual fantasies haunt the mind for days together, while others become lean and thin, or even sick. At this juncture, siddhis can appear. One develops extrasensory perceptions, he can read the minds of others, he can suppress others by a thought, or his own thoughts materialize. In the beginning, black forces manifest and all these siddhis are negative or of a lower quality. Tapasya is a very, very powerful method of awakening which everybody cannot handle.
