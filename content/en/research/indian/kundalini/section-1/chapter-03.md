Kundalini or the serpent power does not belong to the physical body, though it is
connected to it. 

Nor can it be discovered in the mental body or even the astral body. 

Its abode is actually in the causal body, where the concepts of time, space and object are
completely lost.

How and where is the concept of kundalini related to the supreme consciousness?

The serpent power is considered to arise from the unconscious state in mooladhara. This
unconscious awareness of man then has to pass through different phases and becomes
one with the cosmic awareness in the highest realm of existence. 

The supreme awareness or Shiva is considered to be seated in sahasrara, the superconscious or transcendental
body at the crown of the head. 

In the Vedas, as well as the Tantras, this supreme seat is
called hiranyagarbha, the womb of consciousness. It corresponds to the pituitary body,
the master gland situated within the brain.

Immediately below this center of supreme consciousness, there is another psychic
center - "the third eye" or ajna chakra, which corresponds to the pineal gland. 

This is the
seat of intuitive knowledge. This center lies on top of the spinal column, at the level of
bhrumadhya, the eyebrow center. Ajna chakra is important because it is simultaneously
connected with the seat of supreme consciousness in sahasrara and with mooladhara, the
seat of the unconscious, at the base of the spine, via sushumna, the psychic passage
within the spinal column. 

Therefore, it is the connecting link between the lowest
unconscious seat of power and the highest center of illumination within the individual.


Kundalini yoga is not abstract. It considers this very physical body as the basis. For a
kundalini yogi, the supreme consciousness represents the highest possible manifestation
of physical matter in this body.

The matter of this physical body is being transformed into
subtle forces - such as feeling, thinking, reasoning, remembering, postulating and
doubting, in the gradual process of evolution.

This psychic, suprasensory or
transcendental power in man is the ultimate point of human evolution.


### The chakras


The literal meaning of the word chakra is 'wheel or circle', but in the yogic context a
better translation of the Sanskrit word is 'vortex or whirlpool'. 

The chakras are vortices of
psychic energy and they are visualized and experienced as circular movements of energy
at particular rates of vibration.

In each person there are myriads of chakras, but in the practices of tantra and yoga,
only a few principal ones are utilized. These chakras span the full spectrum of man's
being from the gross to the subtle.

The chakras are physiological as well as psychic centers whose structures correspond
more or less with the traditional descriptions. These nerve centers are not situated inside
the spinal cord itself, but lie like junctions on the interior walls of the spinal column. 

If you cut the spinal cord transversely at different levels you can see that the grey matter in
the cross section resembles the lotus shape and the ascending and descending tracts of
nerve fibers correspond to the nadis. 

These communicating nerve fibers control the
different physiological functions of that portion of the body. Many books state that the
chakras are reservoirs of power, but this is not true.

A chakra is like a centrally placed electricity pole from which electrical wires are run
to different places, houses and street lights in the vicinity. This arrangement is the same
for each of the chakras. The nadis which emerge from each chakra carry prana in both
directions. There is a forward and backward pranic motion in the nadis, analogous to the
flow of alternating current in electrical wires. The outgoing communication and the
incoming reaction enter and leave the chakra in the form of this pranic flow in the
corresponding nadis.

There are six chakras in the human body which are directly connected with the higher
unillumined centers of the brain. The first chakra is mooladhara. It is situated in the
pelvic floor and corresponds to the coccygeal plexus of nerves. In the masculine body it
lies between the urinary and excretory openings, in the form of a small dormant gland
termed the perineal body. In the feminine body it is situated inside the posterior surface
of the cervix.

Mooladhara is the first chakra in the spiritual evolution of man, where one goes
beyond animal consciousness and starts to be a real human being. It is also the last chakra
in the completion of animal evolution. It is said that from mooladhara chakra right down
to the heels there are other lower chakras which are responsible for the development of
the animal and human qualities of instinct and intellect. From mooladhara chakra
upwards lie the chakras which are concerned with illumination and evolution of the
higher man or super man. Mooladhara chakra has control over the entire range of
excretory and sexual functions in man.
The second chakra is swadhisthana, located at the lowest point or termination of the
spinal cord. It corresponds to the sacral plexus of nerves and controls the unconscious in
man.

The third chakra is manipura, situated in the spinal column exactly at the level of the
navel. It corresponds to the solar plexus and controls the entire processes of digestion,
assimilation and temperature regulation in the body.

The fourth chakra is anahata, and it lies in the vertebral column behind the base of
the heart, at the level of the depression in the sternum. It corresponds to the cardiac
plexus of nerves, and controls the functions of the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm and
other organs in this region of the body.

The fifth chakra is vishuddhi, which lies at the level of the throat pit in the vertebral
column. This chakra corresponds to the cervical plexus of nerves and controls the thyroid
complex and also some systems of articulation, the upper palate and the epiglottis.
Ajna, the sixth and most important chakra, corresponds to the pineal gland, lying in
the midline of the brain directly above the spinal column. This chakra controls the
muscles and the onset of sexual activity in man. Tantra and yoga maintain that ajna
chakra, the command center, has complete control over all the functions of the disciple's
life.

These six chakras serve as switches for turning on different parts of the brain. The
awakening which is brought about in the chakras is conducted to the higher centers in the
brain via the nadis.

There are also two higher centers in the brain which are commonly referred to in
kundalini yoga: bindu and sahasrara. Bindu is located at the top back of the head, where
Hindu brahmins keep a tuft of hair. This is the point where oneness first divides itself into
many. Bindu feeds the whole optic system and is also the seat of nectar or amrit.

Sahasrara is supreme; it is the final culmination of kundalini shakti. It is the seat of
higher awareness. Sahasrara is situated at the top of the head and is physically correlated
to the pituitary gland, which controls each and every gland and system of the body.
