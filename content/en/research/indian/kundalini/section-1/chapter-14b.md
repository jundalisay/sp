In the female body, the point of concentration is at mooladhara chakra, which is
situated at the cervix, just behind the opening of the uterus. This is the point where space
and time unite and explode in the form of an experience. That experience is known as
orgasm in ordinary language, but in the language of tantra it is called an awakening. In
order to maintain the continuity of that experience, it is necessary for a buildup of energy
to take place at that particular bindu or point. Usually this does not happen, because the
explosion of energy dissipates throughout the body through the sexual medium. In order
to avoid this, the woman must be able to hold her mind in absolute concentration on that
particular point. For this, the practice is known as sahajoli.

Actually, sahajoli is concentration on the bindu, but this is very difficult. Therefore,
the practice of sahajoli, which is the contraction of the vaginal as well as the uterine
muscles, should be practised over a long period of time.

If girls are taught uddiyana bandha at an early age, they will perfect sahajoli quite
naturally with time. Uddiyana bandha is always practised with external retention. It is
important to be able to perform this in any position. Usually it is practised in siddhayoni
asana, but one should be able to do it in vajrasana or the crow posture as well. When you
practise uddiyana bandha, the other two bandhas - jalandhara and moola bandha occur
spontaneously.

Years of this practice will create a keen sense of concentration on the correct point in
the body. This concentration is more mental in nature, but at the same time, since it is not
possible to do it mentally, one has to start from some physical point. If a woman is able to
concentrate and maintain the continuity of the experience, she can awaken her energy to a
high level.

According to tantra, there are two different areas of orgasm. One is in the nervous
zone, which is the common experience for most women, and the other is in mooladhara
chakra. When sahajoli is practised during maithuna (the act of sexual union), mooladhara
chakra wakes up and the spiritual or tantric orgasm takes place.

When the female yogi is able to practise sahajoli for say 5 to 15 minutes, she can
retain the tantric orgasm for the same period of time. By retaining this experience, the
flow of energy is reversed. Circulation of blood and sympathetic/parasympathetic forces
move upward. At this point, she transcends normal consciousness and sees the light. That
is how she enters the deep state of dhyana. Unless the woman is able to practise sahajoli,
she will not be able to retain the impulses necessary for the tantric orgasm, and
consequently she will have the nervous orgasm, which is short-lived and followed by
dissatisfaction and exhaustion. This is often the cause of a woman's hysteria and
depression.

So, sahajoli is an extremely important practice for women. In uddiyana, nauli,
naukasana, vajrasana and siddha yoni asana, sahajoli comes naturally.
The practice of amaroli is also very important for married women. The word amaroli
means 'immortal' and by this practice one is freed of many diseases. The practice of
amaroli over a prolonged period also produces an important hormone known as
prostaglandin which destroys the ova and prevents conception.

Tantric guru

Just as in the scheme of creation, Shakti is the creator and Shiva the witness of the
whole game, in tantra the woman has the status of guru and the man of disciple. The
tantric tradition is actually passed on from the woman to the man. In the tantric practice,
it is the woman who initiates.

It is only by her power that the act of maithuna takes place. All preliminaries are done
by her. She puts the mark on the man's forehead and tells him where to meditate. In
ordinary interaction, the man takes the aggressive role and the woman participates. But in
tantra, they switch roles. The woman becomes the operator and the man her medium. She
has to be able to arouse him. Then, at the right moment, she must create the bindu so he
can practise vajroli. If the man loses his bindu, it means that the woman has failed to
carry out her functions properly.

In tantra it is said that Shiva is incapable without Shakti. Shakti is the priestess.
Therefore, when vama marga is practised, the man must have an absolutely tantric
attitude towards the woman. He cannot behave with her as men generally do with other
women. Ordinarily, when a man looks at a woman he becomes passionate, but during
maithuna he should not. He should see her as the divine mother, Devi, and approach her
with an attitude of devotion and surrender, not with lust.
According to the tantric concept, women are more endowed with spiritual qualities
and it would be a wise thing if they were allowed to assume higher positions in social
affairs. Then there would be greater beauty, compassion, love and understanding in all
spheres of life. What we are discussing here is not patriarchal society versus matriarchal
society, but tantra, particularly left hand tantra.

Path of yogis not bhogis

In tantra, the practice of maithuna is said to be the easiest way to awaken sushumna,
because it involves an act which most people are already accustomed to. But, frankly
speaking, very few are prepared for this path. Ordinary sexual interaction is not maithuna.
The physical act may be the same, but the background is totally different.
In the relationship between husband and wife, for example, there is dependency and
ownership, but in tantra each partner is independent, one unto himself. Another difficult
thing in tantric sadhana is cultivating the attitude of passionlessness. The man has to
virtually become brahmacharya in order to free the mind and emotions of sexual thoughts
and passion which normally arise in the presence of a woman.

Both partners must be absolutely purified and controlled internally and externally
before they practise maithuna. This is hard for the ordinary person to comprehend
because for most people, sexual interaction is the result of passion and physical or
emotional attraction, either for progeny or pleasure. It is only when you are purified that
these instinctive urges are absent. This is why, according to tradition, the path of
dakshina marga must be followed for many years before the path of vama marga can be
entered. Then the interaction of maithuna does not take place for physical gratification.
The purpose is very clear - awakening of sushumna, raising the kundalmi energy from
mooladhara chakra, and exploding the unconscious areas of the brain.

If this is not clear when you practise the kriyas and sushumna becomes active, you
will not be able to face the awakening. Your head will get hot and you will not be able to
control the passion and excitement, because you have not tranquilized your brain.
Therefore, in my opinion, only those who are adepts in yoga qualify for vama marga.
This path is not to be used indiscriminately as a pretext for self-indulgence. It is meant
for mature and serious minded householder sadhakas, who are evolved, who have been
practising sadhana to awaken the energy potential and to attain samadhi. They must
utilize this path as a vehicle of awakening, otherwise it becomes a path of downfall.
