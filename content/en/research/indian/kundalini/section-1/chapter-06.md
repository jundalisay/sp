Without a guru you can practise any form of yoga, but not kundalini. 

This is an
extremely powerful system. Kundalini yoga does not start suddenly or with fits. 

You
don't have to make any substantial changes in your way of life, but you must begin to
practise. Do not start with advanced practices; for some time you should train and prepare
the physical body, then go to the mind and gradually explore the deeper levels. 

Before
commencing the practices which bring about the actual awakening of kundalini, you must
prepare yourself step by step on the physical, mental and emotional planes. If you are
patient and prepare correctly, awakening of kundalini will definitely take place.

Adequate preparation is necessary to ensure that one has the strength to bear the
impact of full awakening of the mighty potential force within. Most of us do not even
have control over our physical manifestations and behaviors. Supposing you were given a
sleep inducing injection, you would become drowsy whether you wanted to or not. 

This
is because you have no control over the processes and actions of your brain and you do
not know how to control sleep. Similarly, if you have a headache, you are unable to exert
control over it. When physical manifestations such as sleep and pain are not under your
control, what would happen if other manifestations began to occur in your brain? You
wouldn't be able to control them. Therefore, before kundalini awakens, it is important
that you are able to manage the mind.

If you can maintain a balanced mind in the face of mental and emotional conflicts and
you can endure anger, worry, love and passion, disappointment, jealousy, hatred,
memories of the past, sufferings and sorrows, you are ready for the awakening. If you can
still feel joy when the scales are heavily loaded against you, you are an aspirant for
kundalini yoga. Before you bring into use a generator of five megawatts, you must have a
factory ready to utilize the energy. In the same way, before you awaken kundalini shakti,
you must be able to merge yourself with the higher spirit and you must know how to
utilize the creative energy of kundalini.

Therefore, if you want to follow the path of kundalini yoga, it is absolutely essential
to have a guru with whom you feel intimate. Many people say the guru is within, but are
they able to communicate with him, understand him and follow his intricate instructions?

If so, it is possible to proceed with this internal guidance, but few people have such a
relationship with the inner guru. They need an external guru first. He will connect them
with the inner guru. If you have a guru he will help you to prepare for kundalini
awakening, he will be there if you need any advice and he will guide you through the
crisis of awakening.

Usually, because we are religious minded people, our relationship with guru is based
on a sort of formality. To us he is worshipful, respectable, superior and supreme, but at
the time of awakening, all these attitudes to guru must be set aside. At this time you must
evolve a more intimate attitude, as if your relationship was based on love, not merely
devotion and worship. When you serve your mother you do so with an attitude of love,
not respect and veneration. With this same attitude you should serve the guru, then his
direct influence is upon you. Then, if there is excitement in any chakra, the relationship
with guru will balance it.

The relationship between guru and disciple is the most intimate of relationships; it is
neither a religious nor a legal relationship. Guru and disciple live like an object and its
shadow. The guru is the best thing in spiritual life, and if you have a guru you are very
fortunate. However, it is sometimes difficult to find a guru. If you haven't a guru, you can
cultivate a mental picture of him, try to feel his guidance and continue practising
faithfully. You will surely succeed.


### The time factor

Preparation is not the job of one lifetime. Man strives spiritually life after life. In fact,
this body is given to you only for that purpose. For eating, sleeping and sexual interaction
a human body is not necessary, so in our lower stages of evolution we had an animal
body. 

However, even with this human body, we still have animal in us, so these natural
urges follow us. Let them, but remember, this body is not for their fulfillment alone. In
this human body the consciousness is the most important point. Man is aware of his
awareness and he does not only think, he knows that he thinks. The evolution of his
awareness has been going on life after life. And what you have been practising for your
spiritual life in the last five to ten years is in addition to what you have already done.
Supposing your children are studying in primary school and you are transferred to
another city. Where will your children begin their education in the new city? Right from
the beginning? No, from the point where they left their studies. The same thing happens
in reincarnation. That is why, even though you may have brothers and sisters born of the
same mother and father, they will be different from you. In your previous incarnation
your preferences were different from theirs. May be after a few incarnations they may
come to the point where you are now. So we can't say how long preparation takes,
because this life is one of those milestones and you have left behind many, many milestones.

However, if you are eager to awaken kundalini and the chakras, you should not be in
a hurry. Set apart twelve years of your life for this purpose. This is not to say that the
awakening cannot be brought about within one, two or three years - it can be. Total
awakening can even take place in a month, or the guru can give you awakening in one
day, but you will be unable to hold and sustain the awakening. When one is in possession
of a weak mind which cannot sustain even a little bit of cheerfulness or excitement, or
bear the death of a spouse or separation from a loved one, how can he sustain the
tremendous force of an awakened kundalini? Therefore, the twelve years are not for the
actual awakening, but for preparation so you can hold and sustain the awakening.
Where to begin

The practices of kundalini yoga are intended to create the awareness, not necessarily
to awaken kundalini. First of all we have to decide whether kundalini is already
awakened. It may already be on the way and you are opening the garage and there is no
car because it is already on the highway. When you go to satsang, do some kirtan or lead
a yogic lifestyle, you begin to have experiences and you realize something is happening
to you. Then, when you discuss kundalini and the chakras with a guru you start to
understand.

The practices that you do develop your awareness and help you to remember your
connection with your past evolution. They remove the veil which separates this current
incarnation from the previous one. I'll give you a very gross example.

There was a boy who was the only son of a very rich man. The boy went crazy and
was sent to a mental hospital. He ran away and used to go from house to house begging
for food. He did not know that his parents had died and he had inherited a large estate,
cars and shops and a lot of money in fixed deposits. One day his uncle found him and had
him treated properly. The boy recovered from his mental illness and remembered
everything about his heritage. Similarly, there is a process of remembering, and when it
takes place, you know exactly where you stand.

So, practices are necessary to remove the veil in front of the consciousness which
separates the two lives. Once you know that your kundalini is already in the process of
transition, then practices are of no real use. If you are practising, it is because you are
forced to, and if you are not practising, it is because you are forced not to. During the
period of transition of kundalini the practices are not useless, but your efforts to practise
them are of no use. However, if there is no awakening, if kundalini is in mooladhara or
swadhisthana or in between the two, then that's the time for the practices which are
enjoined in the books.

It is very important that you awaken sushumna before kundalini. This essential point
has not been stressed clearly in any books, but Swami Sivananda hinted at it in his
writings. If sushumna is not opened, where will the shakti go ? It will pass through either
ida or pingala and complications will arise.

You must also undergo purification of the tattwas or elements and purification of the
chakras and nadis. Otherwise, when kundalini awakens there will be a traffic jam.
Asanas, pranayama and the hatha yoga shatkarmas provide the best means of purification.
Surya namaskara and surya bheda pranayama purify pindala nadi and the shatkarmas and
pranayama will purify and awaken sushumna. There are specific asanas that are very
important for purifying the nadis and inducing a mild awakening in the chakras. So, start
with purification of the tattwas by the hatha yoga cleansing techniques. Take up asanas
next and then pranayama. Later you can practice mudras and bandhas and then begin
kriya yoga.
