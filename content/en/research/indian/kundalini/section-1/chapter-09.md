Many individuals who experience the awakening of kundalini behave in a peculiar way; they think in a different style or pattern. 

They may see auras and visions, feel peculiar in the body, hear strange sounds and talk all sorts of nonsense. In society our brains are structured in a certain way; there is discipline and control which inhibit us from expressing ourselves freely. When the awakening of kundalini takes place, this conditioning is withdrawn and the lid is completely lifted from the mind. 

That is why the actions and words of those people who are undergoing kundalini awakening appear so nonsensical, deviant and oftentimes mad to the ordinary man.

During kundalini awakening and madness, people may manifest the same symptoms,
but on closer examination a difference can be detected. Similarly, if you film a man
laughing out of madness and a man laughing with his friends, they will look almost the
same, but they are different. Most of us have probably read stories about the avadhoots
and fakirs of India and the Sufi and Christian mystics. Externally, these God-intoxicated
ones looked crazy, but if you were with them, they would have appeared and proved to be
very clear. The inner consciousness of such people is absolutely lucid, organized and
disciplined.


### A great misunderstanding

Mystics throughout the ages have been persecuted for their experiences, which to the
normal mundane consciousness are insanity, yet to the sage are ecstasy. Socrates was
poisoned because he did not behave normally. 

Christ was crucified on the cross because
his teachings were not understood. Al-Hallaj, the Sufi saint, was skinned alive because he
spoke the truth without fear of the society, Joan of Arc and the witches of Salem were
burned at the stake, as were many others. All have been persecuted and harassed by the
mundane populace for their vision, which arose as a result of inner work. Due to this lack
of understanding, many of the esoteric doctrines were hidden from the majority of
people.

<!-- Of course, this was long ago. We live in a more enlightened world today, far from the
barbarous atrocities of the past, or do we?  -->

War and poverty still exist, as do insanity and madness. 

People who are shown to be crazy, relative to the norms of our society, are
locked up until they are 'better'. 

Yet, by what criteria are they judged insane? How do we
know the difference between insanity and the ecstasy of enlightenment? Is it by the
superficial external appearances that we sense with our limited sensory apparatus, or is it
by some deeper inner fear that we are motivated to judge others insane because they do
not behave like the majority? 

Some of the people in the west who are locked up as insane
would be recognized in the east as having undergone higher spiritual experiences.


Therefore, it is now up to science to determine some definite, concrete and reliable ways
to differentiate between the broken, insane mind and the opening, enlightened mind.


### Spiritual experiences in the east and west

Knowledge of the spiritual experience has been lost in the west. 

During the last few centuries, many unfortunate people whose kundalini had awakened were sent to mental hospitals and given drugs, electric shocks and other inappropriate treatments. 

The scientists and doctors believed that the awakening was an abnormal kind of behavior, and no one was able to accept or handle it, not even the person's immediate family or closest friends.

That is why, in the last two hundred years, there have been so few great personalities in the west; they have all been committed to mental hospitals or they have remained quiet to avoid that fate.

In India the situation is quite different. 

There, when an individual expresses some
abnormal symptoms, makes some very peculiar gestures or speaks of extraordinary
dreams, it is understood that he is experiencing events beyond the mind. The Hindu belief
is that the consciousness is not the finished product of nature, but is subject to evolution,
and between one state of being and the next, there is a crisis. 

When strange symptoms occur in someone, they believe he is experiencing that crisis and that his
consciousness is undergoing evolution. If a child's total personality is devoted to God and
he can experience things beyond the mind, then his whole family is purified and such a
child is universally respected.


### A spiritual awakening or madness?

Though the process of spiritual awakening usually occurs without incident or
interruption, it may happen that blockages and impurities in the body create symptoms
which mimic various neurological and psychiatric conditions. These problems necessitate
careful diagnosis to differentiate kundalini arousal and pathology.

It is actually very simple to distinguish between a mental or psychic phenomenon and
a mental sickness, however much the symptoms may overlap: mental illness never
develops in people who are free from conflict. If a person is undergoing a problem in his
personal life, perhaps due to a death, loss of property or emotional breakdown, psychotic
behavior can develop. 

Fantasies can take form and one's own psychological volition can
manifest in the form of psychic energy. On the other hand, if there are no conflicts,
anxieties or strong crosscurrents in a person's life, he cannot possibly have any mental
disease. Suppose you have no apparent problems, no personal or social difficulties, but
still you are having some strange suprasensual experiences. In a case like this, there
should be no doubt about what is taking place.

A mad person doesn't have a constant and consistent flow of experience and his
awareness is very dissipated. He is both disorganized externally and completely blinded
internally. On the other hand, the awareness of a person who is awakened is constant and
consistent. Whereas a person with an awakened consciousness can make accurate
decisions and judgements, a crazy person cannot. Madness and spiritual awakening may
both be characterized by a certain lack of control, but the spiritually awakened person is
guided by a higher consciousness while the mad person is not.

When some suprasensual experience is taking place, it is important to consult an
experienced person who has knowledge of illumination and also knows about madness. A
guru can make the correct judgement and determine whether the brain has begun a
process of regression or is actually progressing along transcendental lines. 

If there is
some organic damage in the brain, it can be treated, but if the symptoms are spiritual, the
person is initiated and given something to practise so his behavior is streamlined. He will
not be forced into married life or any other social roles which are unsuitable for him.
Instead, he will be exposed to saintly personalities and teachings.

If this type of guidance and support for the experience is not obtained, it is very easy
to end up in a mental hospital, or even a prison. However, scientists are now broadening
their description of the spectrum of human behavior and they are discovering that
behavior can be psychic or spiritual in origin as well as psychological or physical.
Everybody should understand one very important point. Awakening of kundalini should
never be equated with abnormal psychological behavior because awakening of kundalini
is a process of jumping out of the mind.
