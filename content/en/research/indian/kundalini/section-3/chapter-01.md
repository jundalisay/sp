The aspirant who earnestly wishes to follow the path of kundalini yoga has to
approach the path of kundalini yoga with a different attitude. His whole life must become
a sadhana and he must be totally devoted to his practices and his goal. He will need to
live a life of moderation and higher awareness in the midst of his daily responsibilities.
He or she has to be a warrior in life and must seek the guidance of a competent guru who
can point the way for the spiritual quest ahead. The kundalini yogi has to be ardent and
faithful to his practice and his guru's instructions. He will need to devote more time each
morning to perfect the practices given in this book.
Whatever your personal aim in life, and whatever your commitments and
responsibilities, kundalini yoga can definitely help you to become more efficient, more
peaceful and more aware. Seek the instructions of a sannyasin or a qualified yoga teacher,
learn the techniques in this book, and practise them systematically according to the
amount of time you are able to spare each day. In this way, your life will be transformed
into the most exciting adventure ever - the journey to inner experience and unitive life.



The following rules and regulations apply to both the specific chakra practices and to
the kriya yoga techniques. They should be followed as closely as possible.

## Diet

Most people who are ready for kundalini yoga will be leading a well regulated life
and taking a balanced vegetarian diet. If you are still keeping late hours, drinking alcohol
and eating large quantities of meat, we strongly suggest that you slowly reduce these and
do some of the hatha yoga shatkarmas, such as shankhaprakshalana. In fact, we request
you not to start the practices given in this book until you have become pure vegetarian.
Eat vegetarian food that is fresh, clean and easily digestible, and eat in moderation.
Kundalini yoga is a system which purifies the whole body; if there are excessive toxins in
your body then there may be a drastic purging process. The consumption of too much
food will also make it difficult to do most of the techniques properly, especially
pranayama and those which involve uddiyana bandha. You should use your
discrimination in choosing the food that you eat. Remember, all kundalini yoga courses
given in our ashrams are accompanied by compulsory food restrictions, therefore, you
should adopt similar restrictions. But please do not starve yourself or become a food
faddist; only try to adopt sensible eating habits.

Illness

If you suffer from any physical illness, we advise you not to start the kundalini
techniques given in this book. First of all you should take steps to cure your illness by
any suitable means, possibly hatha yoga. If necessary, write to this ashram, to any of our
branch ashrams, or contact any competent yoga teacher for guidance.
If you suffer from any serious mental or emotional problems you should not, at
present, start the practices of kundalini yoga. Practise other types of yoga to bring
harmony into your life and mind, then start kundalini yoga. The kundalini techniques are
very powerful, and if you do not have some degree of mental stability, they may worsen
your condition. If in doubt, contact us.
Sound health is the basic requirement for kundalini yoga practice.

Yogic preparation

Before commencing the kundalini techniques given in this book, you should have
practised other systems of yoga, especially hatha and raja yoga, for at least a few years.
In particular, you should be proficient in the following techniques: pawanmuktasana
(anti-rheumatic and anti-gastric), shakti bandha asanas, surya namaskara, major asanas
such as sarvangasana, dhanurasana, shalabhasana, bhujangasana, matsyasana,
paschimottanasana and ardha matsjendrasana, as well as the shatkarmas and the basic
practices of pranayama, such as nadi shodhana.
All of these techniques are fully described in the Bihar School of Yoga publication
Asana Pranayama Mudra Bandha. However, to master these techniques you will need to
have the regular guidance of a qualified yoga teacher.

Time

The best time of day to do your sadhana (practice) is early in the morning, within the
two hours before dawn. This is known as brahmamuhurta in Sanskrit, 'the time divine'.
At this time spiritual energy is high and there are likely to be fewer disturbances, both
external and internal, than at any other period of the day. However, if you are unable to
practise during brahmamuhurta, choose some other time when the stomach is not loaded.

Place of practice

Try to practise in the same place every day. This will gradually build up a positive
atmosphere which will be helpful for your sadhana.
Your place of practice should be clean, peaceful and well ventilated. It should be dry
and neither too hot nor too cold. Do not practise on the bare floor; place a blanket or mat
beneath you. If necessary, wrap a blanket or sheet around you. Try to avoid the use of
fans, unless absolutely necessary.

Clothing

Clothing will depend on the prevailing climate, but it should be as light, loose and
comfortable as possible.

Regularity

Try to practise daily at a fixed time, without fail, following the step-by-step program
that we have given in this book.
On certain days, the mind may give justification for not practising, or it may be upset,
disturbed or restless. Providing there is no illness, you should endeavor to do your
practice as normal.

Preliminary practices

Before starting the kundalini yoga practices, try to empty the bowels and take a cold
shower. If you live in a cold climate, then at least wash the face with cold water. This is
essential in order to remove sleepiness.

It is a good idea to do a few asanas before commencing the kundalini practices. If
time does not permit, then at least do 5 to 10 rounds of surya namaskara, starting slowly
and then accelerating the pace. This should be followed by a short rest period in
shavasana until the breathing rate returns to normal.

Awareness

If the mind flits here and there like a wild monkey, do not worry. Let thoughts and
emotions arise without suppression. Watch them with the attitude of a witness and
continue your practice. Gradually the mind will become one-pointed. Whatever happens,
your practice should continue. This attitude of witnessing the mind without interfering,
can be defined as awareness.
