Most of the practices for specific chakras and the kundalini kriyas are done in a
sitting position, or meditative asana. The best sitting asana is siddhasana (for males) and
siddha yoni asana (for females). Not only do these two asanas apply direct pressure on
mooladhara chakra, but this pressure, when applied correctly, brings about an awakening
and redirection of nervous energy and blood circulation upwards from the pelvic and
abdominal regions to the brain. This extra energy is important in kundalini sadhana, since
it keeps the voltage of prana shakti at a high level. The perineal pressure awakens the
source of energy and actively distributes prana upwards to the higher centers.
Padmasana is also utilized for certain kundalini techniques such as tadan kriya.
Though siddhasana is generally preferred in most of the other techniques, padmasana can
also be used as an alternative. The disadvantage is that padmasana does not apply a direct
pressure on mooladhara chakra.

Those who cannot sit comfortably in siddhasana can do utthanpadasana instead,
though it is difficult to maintain for an extended period of time. In the kriya yoga
practices of maha mudra and maha bheda mudra, utthan padasana can be done instead of
siddhasana, and is by tradition accepted as its equal.
Another asana, bhadrasana, also applies a good pressure on mooladhara chakra and
can be substituted for siddhasana in many of the practices. It is also the required sitting
position for manduki mudra, one of the techniques of kriya yoga.
In the descriptions of the kundalini practices, we have stated the best asana for each
practice. Only use one of the alternative asanas if the recommended asana is not suitable.


### Practice 1: Siddhasana

The accomplished pose (for men)

Sit with the legs extended in front of the body. Fold the right leg and place the sole of
the foot flat against the left thigh with the heel pressing the perineum, the area of
mooladhara chakra, between the genitals and the anus. Fold the left leg and place the foot
on top of the right calf. The heel should press against the pelvic bone directly above the
genitals.

Push the toes and the outer edge of this foot into the space between the right calf and thigh muscles. It may be necessary to move and replace the right kg for this. Grasp the
right toes, either from above or below the left calf and move them upward into the space
between the left thigh and calf.
The legs should now be locked with the knees on the ground and the left heel directly
above the right heel. Make the spine steady, straight and erect, as though it were planted
in the ground.

Note: Siddhasana can be practised with either leg upward. It should not be practised
by persons with sciatica or sacral infections.
Other classical asanas such as ardha padrnasana and sukhasana can also be used, but
not as effectively. Therefore, dedicate yourself initially to the perfection of siddhasana. In
the beginning it is recommended that a folded blanket or small cushion be used to raise
the buttocks slightly. This will enable you to rest the knees on the ground and to achieve
a balanced posture. However, the blanket or cushion should not be too thick. One or two
inches in height should be enough. There must be a sustained but comfortable awareness
of pressure on the perineal trigger point.

Practice 2: Siddha yoni asana
The accomplished pose (for women)
Instead of siddhasana, ladies should do siddha yoni asana.
The position is exactly the same as siddhasana, except that after folding the right leg
and placing the sole of its foot against the left thigh, the lower heel is placed just inside
the entrance to the vagina. The left heel presses against the clitoris.
Everything else is as described for siddhasana.
Practice 3: Padmasana

The lotus pose
Sit with the legs extended in front of the body. Fold the leg and place its foot on top of
the opposite thigh. The sole of the foot must be upward, with the heel facing or touching
the pelvis.Fold the other leg and place its foot on top of the other thigh.The spine should
be straight, the neck, head and shoulders should be relaxed and the body should be
steady.

Practice 4 : Utthan padasana
The raised heel pose
Sit on the floor with both legs extended in front of the body.Fold the right leg under the
body so that you arc sitting on the right foot. The right heel should press the perineum (or
the entrance to the vagina). The left foot remains outstretched. This asana may also be
performed with the left leg folded into the perineum and the right leg outstretched.

Practice 5: Bhadrasana
The gentleman's pose
Sit in vajrasana. Separate the knees as far as possible and bring the big toes together so
they are touching each other. Allow the buttocks to rest on the ground (if necessary a
blanket can be placed under the buttocks) so that mooladhara chakra is firmly pressed.
Place the hands on the knees, palms down, and make the back straight.

Note

If the hips, knees and ankles are not flexible enough to assume and maintain
siddhasana, padmasana, bhadrasana, etc., we suggest that you practise the
pawanmuktasana series of exercises daily, especially crow walking, ankle exercises, knee
rotation, half and full butterfly. Utthanasana should also be practised. To improve the
overall health of the body, other asanas can also be done, including surya namaskara.
Practices of pranayama, such as nadi shodhana, should also be performed to develop
control over inhalation, exhalation, and inner and outer retention, so necessary for
perfecting many of the kundalini techniques.
These practices can be done daily, side-by-side with the monthly practices that are
given for the specific chakras.
