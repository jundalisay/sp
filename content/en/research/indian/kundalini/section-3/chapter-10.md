Month 7

The bindu visarga trigger point is considered to be a tiny point at the top of the back
of the head, but this point cannot be located physically. It can only be found when the
nada or sound of bindu has been discovered and traced to its source. Through the practice
of moorchha pranayama and vajroli mudra awareness of the nada can be developed.
Then, through practices such as bhramari pranayama and yoni mudra, the nada can be
traced to its source.

It is not intended that you practise all the nada yoga techniques at one time. You
should adopt the practice which you can perform without difficulty. It does not matter
which practice you commence with, because all the techniques lead to awareness of the
same subtle inner sounds.

There is a very close relationship between swadhisthana chakra and bindu visarga.
This is because bindu is the point where the primal sound of creation first manifests. It is
the point of origin of individuality, and swadhisthana is the source of the impetus towards
reproduction and sexual function. This is the material expression of the desire to reunite
with the infinite consciousness beyond bindu. Sperm and menses are the material
distillates of the drop of ambrosial nectar which emerges from bindu visarga.
Note: There is no kshetram corresponding to bindu.

## Practice 1: Moorchha pranayama

The fainting breath attitude

This practice requires a steady and firm asana - siddhasana is the best. Hold the spine
and head upright and relax the whole body. Perform khechari mudra. Inhale through the
nostrils with ujjayi pranayama while simultaneously bending the head backward and
assuming shambhavi mudra. The inhalation should be slow and deep. At the end of
inhalation, your head should lean backward, but not completely. The position of the head
is as shown in the diagram. Retain the breath inside for as long as is comfortable,
maintaining shambhavi mudra, but keeping the attention at bindu. Keep the arms straight
by locking the elbows and pressing the knees with the hands. Fix your whole awareness
on bindu. Then bend the arms and slowly exhale with ujjayi pranayama as you bend the
head forward. Slowly lower and close the eyes. At the end of exhalation your head should
face forward and the eyes should be completely closed. Relax the whole body for a short
time, keeping the eyes closed. Release khechari mudra and breathe normally. Become
aware of the lightness and calmness pervading the whole mind. This is one round. After
some time, commence the second round. Practice 10 or more rounds, or until a fainting
sensation is experienced. Perform each round for as long as possible, but without strain.
Note: Not for sufferers of high blood pressure, vertigo, high intracranial pressure or
brain hemorrhage.
* You should practise until a state of semi-fainting is induced. If you go beyond this
sensation you may become unconscious.
* This practice is very powerful in inducing pratyahara and rendering the mind free
from thoughts, especially when kumbhaka is prolonged.
Practice 2: Vajroli mudra with awareness of bindu
Sit in siddhasana or siddha yoni asana. Close the eyes and relax. Try to draw the
sexual organs upward by pulling and tensing the lower abdomen and contracting the
urinary system. This contraction is similar to that which is made when the urge to urinate
is controlled. Contract for 10 seconds, release for 10 seconds, and continue this
alternately.
Each time you attain full contraction of the urinary and reproductive systems, bring
your awareness to swadhisthana chakra in the spinai column, at the level of the coccyx.
Repeat,'swadhisthana, swadhisthana, swadhisthana', mentally. Then draw your awareness
up through sushumna passage to bindu visarga, uniting the sexual and reproductive
energy with its source in bindu. Mentally repeat, "bindu, bindu, bindu". Then return to
swadhisthana and release vajroli mudra. This is one round. Continue this alternately for
several minutes, practising up to 25 rounds.
Note: This practice should be performed immediately after moorchha pranayarna, as
both these practices awaken the awareness of bindu.
Practice 3: Perception of subtle inner sound
This practice should be preceded by bhramari pranayama. In this stage no loud
humming sound is produced, you only listen attentively to the inner sound. You should
keep your eyes closed and your fingers in your ears; this is necessary to block out
external disturbances. Listen for any subtle sounds within your head. At first you may
find this difficult, but keep trying. As soon as you become aware of a sound, any sound,
try to fix your awareness on it to the exclusion of other sounds. Go on listening. After
some days or weeks of practice, you should find that one sound is very distinct, and it
will become louder and louder. Be totally aware of that sound. This is your vehicle of
awareness - let your awareness flow towards this sound, leaving all other sounds and
thoughts. Gradually, through practice, your sensitivity will increase. Eventually you will
hear another sound, a faint sound in the background; it will be almost obliterated by the
main, louder sound that you are hearing, but you will hear it nevertheless. You should
now listen to the new faint sound. Leave the other louder sound and continue to listen to
this new sound. It will become more and more distinct. This will become the new, more
subtle vehicle of your awareness. Let this sound occupy your whole attention. This will
further increase your sensitivity of perception. Eventually you will hear another faint
sound emerging from behind this louder sound. Fix your awareness on this new sound,
discarding the other sound. Continue in the same manner, allowing the new sound to
occupy your whole awareness. When it becomes loud, try to perceive a more subtle
underlying sound and fix your awareness on it. In this manner your perception will
become progressively more sensitive, allowing you to dive deep into your being.
Note: It requires practice over a period of weeks and months to perceive these
progressively more subtle sounds. For many weeks you may be unable to hear even the
first sound.
* This is a very simple but powerful technique that will bring results if you persevere.
All that is necessary is time and effort. Try to practise for as long as you have time. In the
beginning, devote 15 minutes or more to bhramari and this practice together.
Practice 4: Yoni mudra
Yoni mudra is also known as shanmukhi mudra,which means,'the closing of the seven
gates'. It is so called because the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and the mouth arc
closed during the practice. These are the seven doors of outer perception. It is via these
doorways that one receives the sense data from the outside world. When these doors are
closed, we facilitate the direction of the awareness internally; that is, into the mind.
Yoni mudra is amore advanced practice than bhramari. It is slightly more difficult as it
is not preceded by a vocalized humming sound, and it is combined with retention of the
breath. Yoni mudra is more suitable for those who have a reasonably harmonized mind
and are not beset by distractions.
The invocation of the source
Sit in any comfortable meditative asana, preferably siddhasana. Completely relax the
body and mind. Bring the hands in front of the face, with the elbows pointing sideways.
Hold the spine atid head upright. Close the ears with the thumbs, the eyes with the index
fingers, the nostrils with the middle fingers and the mouth with the ring and small fingers
placed above and below the lips respectively. The fingers should gently but firmly close
the seven doors. Throughout the practice, the middle fingers should release the nostrils
during inhalation and exhalation. Now inhale deeply and slowly. At the end of inhalation,
close the nostrils with the middle fingers and retain the breath. Try to hear sounds
emanating from bindu at the back of the head, from the middle of the head, or perhaps the
right ear.
At first you will either hear many sounds or none - it does not matter. Just continue
listening. Hold your breath for as long as it is comfortable. Then release the pressure of
the middle fingers and slowly breathe out. This is one round. Inhale once more, close the
nostrils, and retain the breath. Listen to the inner sounds. After a comfortable length of
time, release the nostrils and breathe out. Continue in this way for the duration of the
practice. During the period of breath retention, your full awareness should be directed to
the perception of inner nada. At first there may be a confused jumble of sounds, but
gradually you will hear a specific sound. This may take a few days or weeks, but it will
be perceived. When you hear a distinct sound, be totally aware of it. It will become
clearer and clearer. Keep your awareness fixed on the sound. Listen very carefully. If
your sensitivity is sufficiently developed, you will hear another sound in the background.
It may be faint, but perceptible. Leave the first sound and transfer your awareness to the
perception of the fainter sound. In this way you will transcend the first sound. Eventually
this second sound will overwhelm your whole attention. Again, with practice and
enhanced sensitivity, you will hear a further sound start to emerge. It will be faintly
perceptible behind the louder second sound. Direct your awareness to this new sound.
Carry on in this way - perceive a sound and then discard it when you can hear a more
subtle sound. The more subtle the sound you perceive, the deeper you will delve into the
depth of your being. Continue this practice for a few minutes. Do not expect to hear
subtle sounds on your first attempt. Practice is necessary. Eventually you will be able to
readily transcend the gross external sounds and then the progressively more subtle
sounds. Do not dwell on any of the sounds for too long. This is not the purpose of the
practice. The aim is to leave behind each sound you discover and to go deeper. Do not get
lost or distracted by the beautiful sounds which will manifest on your journey.
Breath retention: This technique is more effective if you can retain your breath for
extended periods of time. Those aspirants who have been practising nadi shodhana
pranayama regularly for some months beforehand, will find yoni mudra an easy and
effective means of introspection.
Awareness: The point of awareness during the practice should be fixed at the back of
the head in the bindu region. However, if you hear a distinct sound in any other area, such
as the right ear or the middle of the head, then your awareness should be fixed there.
Some people may find it easier to listen to the nada in the region of the heart space
(anahata chakra), especially those of a devotional nature. The important thing is not so
much the point of awareness, but that the awareness remains fixed on progressively more
subtle sounds. Total absorption on the nada can lead to dhyana or the meditative state of
awareness.
Practise
Practise the techniques for bindu visarga for one month. Then begin the techniques
given in the next chapter for integrated chakra awareness. The selected techniques for
ajna, mooladhara, swadhisthana, manipura and anahata chakras can also be done daily, as
given in the "Practise" section of the previous chapter. For vishuddhi chakra, jalandhara
bandha, vishuddhi chakra purification and vipareeta karani asana can be done. Khechari
mudra and ujjayi pranayama need not be done separately, since they are both
incorporated into techniques given in this section.
