## Month 6

Vishuddhi chakra can be directly awakened through the practices of jalandhara
bandha, vipareeta karani asana and ujjayi pranayama, all of which are essential for
eventual mastery of kriya yoga.
A minor chakra which is closely related to vishuddhi is called lalana chakra, which is
located at the back of the roof of the mouth, at the soft palate, and it directly helps to
awaken vishuddhi. For this reason, one of the kundalini kriyas, called amrit pan, is
concerned with its direct stimulation. A simpler practice for awakening lalana is khechari
mudra, which is described in this chapter.
Preparatory practices
Many asanas can be utilized for purifying vishuddhi chakra. The most important are:
bhujangasana, sirshasana, matsyasana, supta vajrasana and sarvangasana.

### Practice 1: Jalandhara bandha

Sit in any meditative pose which allows the knees to firmly touch the floor. Those who
cannot sit like this can practise Jalandhara bandha standing. Place the palms of the hands
pn the knees

The chin lock

Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Inhale deeply, retain the breath inside and
bend the head forward, pressing the chin tightly against the chest (particularly the
sternum). Straighten the arms and lock them into position. Simultaneously hunch the
shoulders upward and forward - this will ensure that the elbows remain locked. The
palms should remain on the knees. Stay in the final pose for as long as you are
comfortably able to retain the breath. Then relax the shoulders, bend the arms, slowly
release the lock, raise the head and exhale. Repeat when the respiration returns to normal.
Practise 5 times.

Note: The whole practice can also be performed with the breath retained outside.
* Never inhale or exhale until the chin lock has been released and the head is upright.
* Persons with high intracranial or blood pressure, or with heart ailments, should not
practise without expert guidance.

### Practice 2: Khechari mudra

Close the mouth and roll the tongue backward so that the normally lower surface
touches the upper palate. Try to bring the tip of the tongue as far back as possible without
strain. Keep it there for as long as it is comfortable. If you experience discomfort, relax
the tongue for a few seconds and repeat. Alter some practice the tongue may be able to
extend beyond the palate and up into the nasopharynx, where it will stimulate many vital
nerve centers.
Breath: Breathe normally during this practice unless ujjayi is used.
Over a period of a few months, however, it is usual to reduce the breathing rate to 7 or
8 breaths per minute. With careful practice, preferably under expert guidance, the
respiration rate can be further reduced.
Note: Advanced practitioners sometimes erode or slowly divide the frenulum
membrane beneath the tongue. This is not recommended here, and should only be
attempted under direct guidance from a guru.
Practice 3: Ujjayi pranayama
Practise khechari rnudra. Contract the glottis in the throat. When you breathe under
these circumstances, a very soft snoring sound should automatically come from the throat
region. It is like the sound of a sleeping baby. Feel that you are breathing through the
throat and not the nose. Try to make the breaths long and relaxed. Practise for 2 minutes
initially, then you can gradually extend the time.
Practice 4: Chakra and kshetram location and purification
Sit or stand in front of a mirror. Place a finger of one hand on the glottis (the lump at
the front of the throat). This is the location point of vishuddhi kshetram. Then place a
finger of the other hand on the spine, directly behind the kshetram. This point in the spine
is called vishuddhi chakra. Press the spine for one minute in order to feel a sensation at
the chakra area. Then lower your hands. Concentrate on the sensation at the chakra and
repeat mentally, 'vishuddhi, vishuddhi, vishuddhi'.
Sit in a comfortable position with the back straight. Close the eyes and become aware
of the breath. Fold your tongue back into khechari mudra and practise ujjayi
pranayama. For a minute or so, be aware of the sound of the breath at the throat, and let
your breathing become slower and deeper. Then with inhalation, imagine that the breath
is being drawn in through vishuddhi kshetram at the front of the throat. Feel that the
breath passes through the kshetram and eventually pierces vishuddhi chakra in the spine.
With exhalation, feel the breath move from vishuddhi chakra, forward through the
kshetram and eventually out, in front of the body. This is one round. Continue for a few
minutes. Daily practice in this manner will gradually develop your sensitivity to
vishuddhi chakra and kshetram.


### Practice 5: Vipareeta karani asana

The inverted attitude

Lie flat on the floor with the feet together, the arms by the sides and the palms flat on
the floor. Breathe in deeply. Using the arms as support, raise the legs over the head,
keeping them straight. Bend the arms and place the hands under the hips to support the
body. Raise the legs to the vertical position. Breathe deeply, fixing your attention on the
breath. Eyes should be closed.
Note: Vipareeta karani asana is similar to sarvangasana, except that the chin is not
pressed against the chest and the trunk is held at a 45 degree angle to the ground instead
of at right angles.

* Shavasana is the counterpose and should be done for a few minutes on completion
of vipareeta karani asana.
* Advanced practitioners can hold the posture for 15 minutes or even more; beginners
should practise for a few seconds and add a few seconds daily.
* This asana should not be done by sufferers of thyroid, liver or spleen enlargement,
high blood pressure or heart ailments.
* Vipareeta karani asana is widely used in kundalini yoga since it helps to redirect the
energies of the body from the lower to the higher chakras. It is an integral part of the first
of the kundalini kriyas called vipareeta karani mudra.


### Practise

Perfect these vishuddhi chakra practices over a period of one month and then start the
practices for bindu visarga. The sadhana for the other chakras can also be continued with
a few selected techniques from each chakra as follows:

ajna - trataka and shambhavi mudra
mooladhara - moola bandha and nasikagra mudra
swadhisthana - chakra and ksbetram location, vajroli (or sahajoli)
manipura - chakra and kshetram location, uddiyana bandha and nauli
anahata - chakra and kshetram location, ajapa japa.
