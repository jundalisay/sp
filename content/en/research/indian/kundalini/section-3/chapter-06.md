## Month 3

The sadhana for awakening swadhisthana chakra is solely concerned with the uro-
genital systems of the body - the prostate gland and testes in the male, and the genito-
ovarian system in the female. 

There are 2 very powerful practices which rechannel
sexual energy and help bring about the awakening of swadhisthana. These are vajroli and
sahajoli mudras. 

Vajroli is practised by males and sahajoli by females. There are simple
forms of vajroli and also more difficult techniques which require the direct guidance of a
guru. However, the practice given here can be performed by anyone who is thoroughly
familiar whith shalabhasana, dhanurasana and uddiyana bandha. When these practices
are performed, vajroli and sahajoli can be perfected with reasonable ease.

Note: See the section entitled, 'Difference between moola bandha, vajroli and ashwini
mudras', given in Chapter 5 of this section.


## Preparatory practices

A large number of asanas have a direct effect on swadhisthana chakra and help to
bring about initial purification and sensitization. We suggest that you practise shakti
bandha series, bhujangasana, shashankasana, dhanurasana and shashank-
bhujangasana.


### Practice 1: Swadhisthana chakra location

Sit in a comfortable position. Move one finger down to the lowest end of the spine
and feel the coccyx, the tailbone. Then move the finger up about one inch, along the
sacral portion of the pelvis, and press hard for one minute. When you take the finger
away, you will experience a residual sensation. About half an inch deep into that
sensation is the location of swadhisthana chakra. Concentrate on it for 2 minutes or so
repeating mentally, 'swadhisthana, swadhisthana, swadhisthana'.

### Practice 2: Kshetram location

If you feel down to the lower end of the abdomen, you will come to a bony portion at
the front part of the pelvis. This is called the pubis, and is the anatomical location of
swadhisthana kshetram. Press hard on this area for about one minute. Then remove the
finger and concentrate on the point where your finger was and repeat mentally,
'swadhisthana, swadhisthana, swadhisthana'.

### Practice 3: Ashwini mudra

Sit in any meditative posture. Relax the whole body, close the eyes and breathe
normally. Contract the sphincter muscles of the anus for half a second, relax them for half
a second, then contract them again and continue like this. Try to feel the waves spreading
up to hit swadhisthana chakra. Focus your whole attention on the lower end of the spine
and feel the pressure waves. Continue this for a few minutes.

### Practice 4: Vajroli mudra (for men)

Sit comfortably in siddhasana, preferably with a thin cushion or a folded blanket
beneath the buttocks. Close the eyes and relax. Try to draw the sexual organ upward by
pulling and tensing the lower abdomen and contracting the urinary system. This
contraction is similar to that which is made when the urge to urinate is controlled. Try not
to perform moola bandha or ashwini mudra at the same time. Contract for 10 seconds,
release for ÑŽ seconds and continue this alternately. Concentrate on the kshetram at the
pubis all the time, repeating mentally, 'swadhisthana, swadhisthana, swadhisthana'.

Continue for a few minutes.

### Practice 4: Sahajoli (for women)

Sit comfortably in siddha yoni asana, preferably with a thin cushion or folded blanket
beneath the buttocks. Make sure your foot is perfectly clean before you place the heel
inside the vaginal entrance. Close your eyes and relax. Contract the muscles of the vagina
and then relax them several times in succession. Gradually increase the contraction until
it becomes more intense and deep. Hold the contraction for 10 seconds, release for 10
seconds and continue like this, mentally repeating, 'swadhisthana, swadhisthana,
swadhisthana'. Continue for a few minutes.

Note: This practice is also known as ohji mudra.


## Practise

The sadhana (practices 1-4) for awakening swadhisthana chakra, should be perfected
over a period of one month. It should be kept in mind that swadhisthana is the switch for
bindu visarga, and therefore, the sadhana for swadhisthana also brings about a
simultaneous effect on and awakening of bindu.You can also continue the sadhana for
ajna and mooladhara chakras.
