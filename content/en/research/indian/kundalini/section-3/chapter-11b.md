Here is a practice that combines breathing, mantra and chakra awareness. Although it
is not widely taught, it is a powerful technique that is both a pranayama and a meditation.
Ghaturtha pranayama means, 'pranayama of the fourth state', or a transcendental state
where words and definitions fail to reach. This practice will lead to deeper awareness and
knowledge of the chakras. It is also a preparatory technique for kriya yoga as it develops
sensitivity to both the psychic spinal passage and the chakras.

Technique

Sit in any comfortable meditative posture. Hold the spine erect and close the eyes.
Breathe deeply. Let the breath become deeper and more subtle. Fix your awareness on the
rhythmical flow of the breath. Continue for a number of rounds. Mentally synchronize
the mantra Оm with the breath. The sound "O" should arise with inhalation. The sound
'm-m-m-m-m' should arise with exhalation. This sound should only be mental. Breathe
through the nose, keeping the mouth closed. Continue in this manner with awareness of
the flow of breath and the mantra. Now fix your attention at the eyebrow center. Feel
that you are breathing in through that center with the mental sound "O". Feel you are
breathing out through that center, mentally chanting 'm-m-m-m-m'. Continue with
awareness of the breath, mantra and psychic center.
Focus your attention on mooladhara. With inhalation and the sound "O-o-o-o-o", feel
the breath passing up through the spine, piercing all the chakras - mooladhara,
swadhisthana, manipura, anahata, vishuddhi, ajna, sahasrara.
With exhalation and the sound "m-m-m-m-m", feel the breath and sound moving
down the spine, piercing all the chakras - sahasrara, ajna, vishuddhi, anahata, manipura,
swadhisthana, mooladhara.

Continue for a number of rounds. Again fix your attention at the eyebrow center.
Continue the mental repetition of Оm synchronized with the breath, but do not be aware
of the breath. Only be aware of the mantra and the psychic center. Feel the "O" and the
"m-m-m-m-m" sound. Continue in this manner for as long as possible.

Practice 4: Chakra yoga nidra

Yoga nidra can be used very effectively to develop your awareness of the chakras.
Here is an example of a yoga nidra/relaxation session which includes visualization and
rotation of awareness through the psychic centers. Teachers can adopt this practice
directly for their classes. For personal use, someone can lead you through the practice, or
you can put the instructions onto a tape.
Stage 1: Preparation
Place a folded blanket on the floor and lie on it in shavasana. Loosen your clothing so
you feel perfectly comfortable. If necessary, cover yourself with a blanket to keep warm,
or put a sheet over you to keep insects away. The mouth and eyes should remain closed
throughout the practice. Make sure that the spinal column is straight, in line with the head
and neck, and that the hips and shoulders are fully relaxed. Keep the feet and legs slightly
apart. The arms should be beside your body but not touching, and the palms should be
facing up. Adjust your position so that you feel perfectly comfortable. Tell yourself
firmly that you will not move your body throughout the practice.
Stage 2: Sinking of the body
Look at the space in front of your closed eyes. Imagine that the space surrounds your
whole body. Your body is immersed in that space. Simultaneously be aware of your
body. It feels very light, as light as a leaf falling from a tree. Imagine that your body is
slowly sinking into the space that you see in front of your closed eyes, like a falling
leaf. Your body is slowly sinking into the infinite space. Be aware of this
feeling. Continue in this manner for a few minutes.
Stage 3: Rhythmical breath awareness
Become aware of your breathing. Awareness of the rise and fall of the navel with
each breath. As you breathe in, imagine that you are sucking in air through the navel. As
you breathe out, imagine that you are pushing air out from the navel. It is a rhythmical
process. Do not alter the natural breath in any way, just become aware of it.

Stage 4: Sankalpa

Repeat your sankalpa in a short positive sentence. It should be the crystallization of
your spiritual aspiration and you should not change it. Repeat it with feeling, from the
heart, not the lips. Repeat your sankalpa at least 3 times.

Stage 5: Visualization - body awareness

Try to visualize your own body. Imagine that you are viewing it from
outside. Feel that your perception is outside and your body is an object of study. You may
find visualization difficult - do not worry, just do your best. If you wish, you can imagine
that there is a large mirror suspended over your body and that your body is reflected in
it. Look at your own reflection. See your whole body: feet, knees, thighs, abdomen, chest,
both hands, arms, shoulders, neck, head, mouth, nose, ears, eyes, eyebrow center, your
whole face and your whole body. Combine your rotation of awareness with visualization
of that part. Continue in this manner for a few minutes.

Stage 6: Psychic centers - rotation of awareness

You have to discover the location of the chakras. You have to develop awareness
of each psychic center in the body. Start from the base of the spine and move your
awareness upward. First become aware of mooladhara. In the male body it is situated in
the perineum, between the anus and genitals, and in the female body it is located at the
cervix - the mouth of the womb. Try to feel the sensation at mooladhara. It is a very
specific point which you are trying to isolate. When you have found it, repeat mentally,
'mooladhara, mooladhara, mooladhara'.
Now move on to the second chakra, swadhisthana. It is located at the base of the
spine, in the coccyx. Be aware of the sensation at that point and repeat mentally,
'swadhisthana, swadhisthana, swadhisthana'. The third chakra is manipura. It is located in
the spine in line with the navel. Feel this point and mentally repeat, 'manipura, manipura,
manipura'. Then become aware of anahata chakra, located in the spine, directly behind
the center of the chest. Try to locate that point exactly and mentally repeat, 'anahata,
anahata, anahata'. Now bring your awareness to vishuddhi chakra, situated in the spine,
directly behind the throat pit. Feel the sensations arising at that point and mentally repeat,
'vishuddhi, vishuddhi, vishuddhi'. The next chakra is ajna. It is located at the very top of
the spine in the region of the pineal gland, directly behind the eyebrow center. Fix your
awareness on that area and mentally repeat, 'ajna, ajna, ajna'. Now bring your awareness
to bindu, at the top back portion of the head. Feel that tiny point as precisely as possible,
and repeat mentally, 'bindu, bindu, bindu'. Finally, become aware of sahasrara, at the
crown of the head, and repeat mentally, 'sahasrara, sahasrara, sahasrara'. Now repeat this
process, slowly descending through the chakras in reverse order: sahasrara, bindu, ajna,
vishuddhi, anahata, manipura, swadhisthana and mooladhara. This is one complete round
of chakra rotation.

Start a second round: mooladhara, swadhisthana, manipura, anahata, vishuddhi, ajna,
bindu, sahasrara; sahasrara, bindu, ajna, vishuddhi, anahata, manipura, swadhisthana,
mooladhara. This completes the second round. Begin a third round, this time a little
faster. As you fix your attention at each point, try to feel a slight vibration there, a tiny
pulsation. If you wish, you can chant Оm mentally as you locate each point in
turn. Practise at least 5 rounds and as many more as time permits.

### Stage 7: Psychic centers - visualization

Now try to visualize the symbols of each chakra. This is not easy, but try. You can
use your own personal system of psychic symbols or the traditional chakra symbols as
follows. As each chakra is named, try to feel that point being lightly pressed by the
thumb, and simultaneously visualize the symbol. The psychic symbol for mooladhara is a
deep red, four-petalled totus. Inside there is a smoky lingam around which a snake is
coiled three and a half times with its head facing upward.Try to visualize this symbol to
the best of your ability and associate it with that particular location in the body.Then
proceed to swadhisthana chakra. The symbol is a six-petalled vermilion lotus, within
which is depicted a starry night above the sea. The main focal point is the crescent
moon. 

Try to visualize this symbol. Move to manipura chakra. It is symbolized by a ten-
petalled yellow lotus, and in the center is a blazing fire. Visualize this symbol, imagining
that the lotus is actually growing from manipura chakra. Proceed to anahata chakra,
represented by a twelve-petalled blue lotus. In the center is a solitary flame burning in the
darkness. Try to visualize this symbol while feeling the exact position in the body. Move
to vishuddhi chakra, symbolized by a sixteen-petalled purple lotus. In the middle there is
a pure white drop of nectar. Visualize this location in the body. Then proceed to ajna
chakra which is symbolized by a two-petalled silver-grey lotus. On the left hand petal is
the full moon and on the right hand petal, a glowing sun. In the center is a black lingarn
and an Оm sign. Create a mental image of this symbol and its exact location. Move on to
bindu. It is symbolized by a tiny white drop of nectar. Visualize this symbol at the top
back of the head. Finally, move to sahasrara, the fountainhead of all the chakras. It is
represented by a thousand-petalied lotus. In the center is a white lingam. Visualize this
symbol at the crown of the head. Now visualize all these symbols in the reverse order:
sahasrara, bindu, ajna, vishuddhi, anahata, manipura, swadhisthana and mooladhara. This
is the end of one round. Spend a few seconds visualizing each center. Do a few more
rounds according to the amount of time available.
Stage 8: Eyebrow center awareness
Fix your attention at the eyebrow center. Feel your pulse at this point. Become aware
of its continuous rhythmical beat. Mentally synchronize repetition of the mantra Оm with
this pulse. Continue for a few minutes.
Stage 9: Sankalpa and close
Repeat your sankalpa 3 times with full emphasis and feeling. Become aware of your
natural breath. Become aware of your whole physical body. Become aware of the outer
sense perceptions. Slowly begin to move your body. When you are fully retuned to the
external world, slowly sit up and open your eyes.


### Practice 5 : Unmani mudra

The word unmani means, 'no mind' or 'thoughtlessness', and refers to the state which
arises during meditation. Therefore, unmani mudra means, 'the gesture of
thoughtlessness'.

Unmani mudra is an excellent practice for developing awareness of the chakras in the
spine, from bindu down to mooladhara. lt is also an integral part of many of the kriya
yoga practices (nada, pawan and shabda sanchalana, maha mudra and maha bheda
mudra), and therefore it should be mastered before attempting to learn and practise these
techniques.

Unmani mudra is easy to learn, but not so easy to perfect. The technique is as follows:
Sit in any comfortable pose, with the back straight. Open the eyes wide, without
focusing on anything external. First of all, fix your awareness at bindu. Breathe in
deeply. Then as you breathe out, imagine your breath going down the
spine. Simultaneously, let your awareness descend the spine, passing through all the
chakras : ajna, vishuddhi, atiahata, manipura, swadhisthana, mooladhara, one after the
other. At the same time, the eyes should close slowly synchronized with the breath and
the descent of awareness. Though your eyes are open during the practice, your attention
should be internalized on the chakras and breath; that is, the eyes are open, but you are
looking inside. The eyes should have closed at the end of exhalation and by the time your
awareness reaches mooladhara chakra. This is one round. Breathe in and start the second
round. Do 11 rounds.
Note: While practising, you should not try too hard. Let it happen spontaneously. The
practice is more mental than physical. Though the eyelids are slowly closed, the
important thing is to feel the process mentally, and when the eyes are open, you should
not perceive anything outside.
Practice 6: Bija mantra sanchalana
The word bija means "seed", mantra means "mystic sound" and sanchalana means
"conduction". Therefore, this practice can be called "the conduction of the seed sound". It
is one of the techniques of kriya yoga, but is not normally one of the twenty kriyas that
we teach.
The practice is concerned with mentally repeating the bija mantra of each kshetram
and chakra, one after the other, whilst simultaneously moving the awareness through
each.

Psychic passages

In the following kriya, bija mantra sanchalana, as well as in a number of practices of
kriya yoga, you will be required to move your awareness through two psychic passages
called arohan and awarohan. The path of these passages is as follows :
Arohan, the ascending passage, goes from mooladhara chakra, forward to
swadhisthana kshetram in the pubic area, then follows the curve of the belly to manipura
kshetram, upward to anahata kshetram and vishuddhi kshetram in the front of the throat,
then in a straight line to bindu at the top back of the head.
There is also another pathway for the arohan psychic passage that has been taught by
tradition throughout the ages. On the ascent from mooladhara, swadhisthana kshetram
and onwards, the awareness is taken from vishuddhi kshetram to lalana chakra in the
palate, then to the nosetip, to the eyebrow center, and following the curvature of the skull
through sahasrara at the top of the head, to bindu at the back of the crown, where there is
a little whorl of hair. In this book we will refer to the arohan passage as connecting
vishuddhi kshetram directly to bindu, however, you can experiment with both passages
and use whichever one suits you best.

Awarohan is the descending passage which starts at bindu, travels forward to ajna
chakra, then down through sushumna in the spine, passing through all the chakras in turn
to finally terminate at mooladhara.
In the following practice you will have to familiarize yourself with these two psychic
passages, and this will also be useful as a preparation for the kundalini kriyas.

## Bija mantras

The bija mantras for each kshetram and chakra are as follows:
mooladhara lam
swadhisthana vam
mianipura ram
anahata yam
vishuddhi ham
ajna оm
bindu оm
Technique

Sit in any comfortable position, preferably siddhasana. Keep your back straight and
eyes closed. Throughout the practice there is no physical movement; the kriya is done
mentally. Bring your attention to mooladhara chakra. Repeat the mantra lam mentally,
once, and try to feel the vibration at mooladhara chakra. Then ascend through arohan. Let
your attention jump to swadhisthana kshetram and repeat the mantra vam, feeling the
vibration at that point. Jump to manipura kshetram and repeat the mantra ram. At anahata
kshetram, yam. At vishuddhi kshetram, ham. At bindu, Оm. Then descend through
awarohan. Repeat Оm at ajna, in the center of the head. Repeat ham at vishuddhi chakra
in the spine. At anahata chakra, yam. At manipura chakra, ram. At swadhisthana,
vam. Then return to the starting point, mooladhara, and begin the next round by repeating
the mantra lam.Your awareness should jump from one center to the next. Do 9 rounds, or
more if you have time.

Note: This is an excellent preparatory practice for kriya yoga sadhana. You may also
practise by spending some time (e.g. 5 minutes) at each kshetram or chakra, chanting the
mantra aloud on a low key and feeling it vibrating at the chakra.


### Practice 7: Drawing the chakras

Drawing of mandalas, such as the chakras, is an important part of tantra. Many of the
practices require that the correct mandalas be constructed first of all. The creation of a
chakra diagram should be done with absolute awareness and concentration, and its
measurements and dimensions must be exact. You should try to ensure that you will be
undisturbed for at least an hour, and approach the exercise as you do meditation. In some
Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, mandalas are drawn and painted as part of the daily
sadhana, as is the practice in several Greek Orthodox monasteries, where icons are
painted in minute detail as daily meditation.

Make sure you have all the necessary materials; pencils, pens, rubbers, ruler, compass,
colors or paints, so that you will not have to disturb your concentration once you have
started. If you have a sadhana room, then that is the best place to create your mandalas.A
good size for drawing the chakras on art paper is about 9" square, as this size is most
useful for visual display and concentration practices. Larger and smaller sized chakras
can be made for other purposes.

By first using only a black pen, one can plainly see the simple yet subtle lines and
formations, and discover the hidden symbology as it becomes visually clearer in the
mind. The next step is to color it, according to the traditional colors described in the text.
In this way, mandalas of each of the seven chakras can be completed over seven or more
sessions.

This practice is very relaxing and enjoyable. You may like to create more subjective
and artistic impressions of the chakras, with your own colors and symbols, as you come
to understand them in a personal way. This expands your awareness to the many
possibilities of experiencing not only the chakras, but life itself.
The chakras should not be interpreted on just one or two levels, but in many
dimensions. After drawing and painting the chakras successfully, you can then take the
next step and create the chakras in a three-dimensional form. For this you can use any
number of materials such as clay, plasticine, wire, fiberglass, copper or stone.
You must remember, however, that the traditional drawings are as subjective as your
feelings and experiences of the chakra. Therefore, use these experiences to express your
deeper and inner spiritual aspects on paper, in clay or stone. Through this you will find a
clarity of vision arising out of what once seemed a confused and blurred picture of life.

## Practise

You will not have time to do all the practices given in this chapter. Therefore we suggest that you practise the following for one month: Chakra meditation, chaturtha pranayama, chakra yoga nidra, immani mudra and bija mantra sanchalana daily. Musical chakra meditation and drawing the chakras, can be done if you have the time and the inclination. They can be omitted without any detriment to arousing kundalini. Practices for each individual chakra can be done as follows:

ajna - shambhavi mudra
mooladhara - moola bandha and nasikagra mudra
swadhisthana - vajroli (or sahajoli)
manipura - uddiyana bandha
anahata - ajapa japa
vishuddhi - jalandhara bandha and vipareeta karani asana
bindu - yoni mudra.

Then after one month you can start to learn kriya yoga, having first of all taken the
advice of an experienced yoga teacher, or by writing to Bihar School of Yoga, Munger,
Bihar, India.
