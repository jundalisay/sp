If maha mudra is practised in utthan padasana, then it must be done as follows:
Place your hands on your bent knee, exhale completely and bend your head forward,
eyes open. Repeat mentally, "mooladhara, mooladhara, mooladhara". Inhale with ujjayi
through the frontal passage from mooladhara to bindu, raising your head while moving
from vishuddhi to bindu. Repeat "bindu, bindu, bindu", and then exhale with ujjayi
through the spinal passage, doing unmani mudra and being aware of the chakras en route.
Hold the breath outside and bend forward to grasp the big toe of your extended foot to
form utthan padasana. Press your chin against the chest to form jalandhara
bandha. Practise moola bandha, uddiyana bandha and nasikagra drishti while still
retaining the breath outside. Repeat mentally, "nasikagra - uddiyana - mool", while
simultaneously placing your awareness at the seats of these practices in turn. Repeat this
cycle of awareness 3 times if you are a beginner, or up to 12 times if you are experienced.
Then release nasikagra drishti, moola bandha and uddiyana bandha. Bring your hands to
your knees and sit up straight. Release jalandhara but keep your head bent down. Bring
your awareness back to mooladhara. Repeat the mantra "mooladhara, mooladhara,
mooladhara", and then ascend the frontal passage with ujjayi inhalation. Practise in this
way for 4 full rounds or breaths with your right leg extended, then practise 4 times with
the left leg extended, and finally 4 times with both legs extended. After the fourth time in
each position, ascend once to bindu with ujjayi inhalation. Repeat the bindu mantra,
descend to mooladhara and repeat its mantra, relax and then change legs.

Note: The rotation of awareness through nasikagra, uddiyana and mool is done with
outside retention of the breath at mooladhara. You are advised to practise only 3 rotations
at first, slowly increasing one rotation per week until you can complete 12 rotations.

* Make sure that all the bandhas are performed correctly and in the right sequence. At
first you will have to pay special attention to this, but with regular practice the bandhas
will lock and tighten automatically, without effort and at the right stages of the kriya.
* Nosetip gazing helps to tighten the lock of the bandhas. Make sure that nasikagra
drishti and the bandhas are practised simultaneously and that you do not omit any of them
while rotating awareness through the centers. Do not strain.
* If you are feeling pain or discomfort in the eyes, stop nasikagra drishti but continue
the bandhas and rotation of awareness. Slowly increase the duration of nasikagra as the
eye muscles adapt to the practice.
* You can repeat the "mooladhara" mantra 3 times before applying the bandhas as
well as repeating 'mooladhara' ли times at the beginning of a new round.
* Also, the names of the chakras and kshetram can be mentally repeated as you ascend
and descend arohan and awarohan.

No. 8: Manduki kriya (the frog attitude)

Sit in bhadrasana, the gentleman's pose. Your eyes should remain open. The area of
your body below mooiadhara chakra must touch the ground. If it doesn't, then use a
cushion to exert pressure on this point. Place your hands on your knees and practise
nasikagra drishti. Become aware of your natural breath flowing in and out of your
nostrils. With inhalation the breath flows through both nostrils and merges at the eyebrow
center. As you exhale the two flows diverge from the eyebrow center and move out
through both nostrils. The breath follows a conical or inverted V-shaped pathway. Feel
this. Simultaneously, be aware of all smells. The point of this kriya is to smell the aroma
of the astral body which has a scent like that of sandalwood. If your eyes become tired,
close them for some time and then resume nasikagra drishti. Practise this kriya until it
becomes intoxicating. Do not carry it so far that you become totally absorbed in it and do
not wish to end the practice.

No. 9: Tadan kriya (beating the kundalini)

Sit in padmasana with the eyes open. Place your palms on the floor at the sides of
your body, next to your hips, with the fingers pointing forward. Tilt your head slightly
backward and practise shambhavi mudra. Inhale through your mouth in audible ujjayi
pranayama. As you inhale, feel the breath travelling downward through a tube connecting
the mouth to mooiadhara chakra. The breath will collect at mooladhara chakra. Hold the
breath, keep your awareness at mooladhara and practise moola bandha. Using your
hands, lift your body off the ground. Then drop your body lightly so that mooladhara is
gently beaten. Repeat this beating a few times. Do not practise this quickly or
harshly. After the third beating, exhale gently through the nose with ujjayi
pranayama.The breath will seem to diffuse in all directions from its storehouse at
mooladhara. Practise this kriya a total of 7 times. The number of beatings practised per
round can be gradually increased from 3 to a maximum of 11.


## DHARANA PRACTICES

No. 10: Naumukhi mudra (closing the nine gates)

Sit in siddhasana, siddha yoni asana or padmasana. Your eyes should remain closed
throughout. If necessary, use a cushion to ensure that mooladhara is compressed. Do
khechari mudra and bend your head slightly forward (not jaiandhara bandha). Repeat
mentally, "mooladhara, mooladhara, mooladhara". Then inhale with ujjayi up the frontal
passage to bindu. Raise your head as you pass from vishuddhi to bindu, practise yoni
mudra by closing your ears with the thumbs, the eyes with both forefingers, the nostrils
with your middle fingers, the upper lip with the ring fingers and your lower lip with the
small fingers (do not apply too much pressure). Practise moola bandha and vajroli
mudra. The nine gates of the body are now closed (eyes, cars, nostrils, mouth, anus and
sexual organ). Become aware of the spinal passage and bindu. Now visualize a shining
copper trident (trishul), rooted in mooladhara with its stem in the spinal cord and the
prongs extending upward from vishuddhi. The prongs are very sharp. The trishul will
slightly rise a number of times of its own accord and it will pierce bindu with its central
prong. As it pierces bindu, repeat the mantra 'bindu bhedan', which means 'bindu
piercing'. After some times release vajroli mudra and moola bandha. Open the upper
gates and bring your hands down to your knees. Exhale with ujjayi through the spinal
passage from bindu to mooladhara.

Mentally repeat "mooladhara" 3 times. Then inhale through the frontal passage up
to bindu to repeat the kriya. Practise 5 full rounds or breaths, and after the fifth round,
end the practice after exhalation.

Note: It is extremely important that the back be held perfectly straight throughout this
kriya. If the spine is not straight, the sensation that follows the piercing of bindu will not
be perceived.

* It is important that vajroli mudra be correctly performed for it also heightens the
sensations experienced during this practice. When vajroli mudra is perfected, the
contraction of vajra nadi can be achieved without contracting the anal sphincter muscles.
The sensation is like an electric current running the full length of vajra nadi to the brain.
Try to sensitize your awareness to the point where you actually feel the piercing of bindu
like an electric shock.

* As you ascend and descend arohan and awarohan, you can mentally repeat the
names of the chakras and kshetram if you want.
No. 11: Shakti chalini (conduction of the thought force)
Sit in siddhasana, siddha yoni asana or padmasana. Your eyes should remain closed
throughout. Practise khechari mudra. Exhale completely and bring your awareness to
mooladhara. Bend your head forward. Repeat mentally, "mooladhara, mooladhara,
mooladhara", and then ascend the frontal passage to bindu with ujjayi inhalation, raising
your head as you approach bindu. Retain the breath inside, and then practise yoni mudra,
closing your ears, eyes, nostrils and lips with the fingers. Allow your consciousness to
rotate in a continuous cycle, descending the spinal passage to mooladhara and rising up
the frontal passage to bindu in an unbroken loop, while you keep the breath retained
inside. Visualize a thin green snake moving through the psychic passageways. The tail of
this serpent is at bindu, and the body extends down through mooladhara and up the
frontal passage. The head is also at bindu, with the mouth biting the end of the tail. If you
watch this snake, it will start to move in a circle in the psychic passages, or it may even
go off this track and follow a new one of its own. Just watch this snake, whatever it
does. When your retention of breath is becoming exhausted, release yoni mudra, return
your hands to the knees and bring your awareness to bindu. Then descend to mooladhara
through the spinal passage with ujjayi exhalation. At mooladhara., lower your head,
repeat 'mooladhara' 3 times, and ascend the frontal passage. Practise this kriya 5 times
without a break, or for the duration of 5 breaths.
Note: Vajroli mudra and moola bandha can also be simultaneously performed with yoni
mudra.

No. 12: Shambhavi (Parvati's lotus)

Sit in siddhasana, siddha yoni asana or padmasana. Close your eyes and practise
khechari mudra. Visualize a lotus flower with a long thin stem extending downward. The
roots of the lotus are white or transparent green. They spread out from mooladhara
chakra. The thin green lotus stem is in your spinal passage. The lotus flower is at
sahasrara, and it is closed like a bud. At the bottom of the bud are a few light green
immature petals. The main petals of the flower are pink with fine red veins. Try to see
this lotus clearly. You visualize it in chidakasha, but you feel it in your body. Exhale and
take your awareness to the root of the lotus at mooladhara. Inhale with ujjayi pranayama
and allow your awareness to rise slowly through the center of the lotus stem, within the
spinal passage. At the end of inhalation, you will reach the closed bud at the top of the
stem. Your ascent will be like that of a caterpillar, climbing up inside the thin stem. Hold
your awareness at sahasrara with the breath retained inside. You are inside the lotus, but
you can also see it from outside. It will begin to open very slowly. As the bud opens out
into a beautiful lotus flower, you will see the yellow pollen-tipped stamens in its
center. Then it will slowly close again, to open again almost immediately. After the lotus
has ceased to open and close, and it remains sealed, then slowly descend through the stem
to mooladhara, drifting down on the wave of your ujjayi exhalation. Remain at
mooladhara for a few seconds, visualizing the roots spreading out in all directions. Then
once again, ascend the stem with ujjayi inhalation. Ascend and descend 11 times and
then end this kriya.
