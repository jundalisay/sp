### Month 2

The process of awakening mooladhara chakra is not very difficult. It can be achieved by thousands of different methods, but the easiest of all is the concentration on the tip of the nose. This is because the part of the sensory cortex which represents mooladhara chakra is connected with the nose. At the same time, mooladhara chakra belongs to the earth element, which is directly related to the sense of smell. Therefore, we shall include nasikagra drishti - the practice of nosetip gazing, in this section, as well as moola bandha, which directly stimulates mooladhara chakra. Remember that mooladhara chakra does not have a kshetram.

Difference between moola bandha, vajroli and ashwini mudras

Often there is confusion between the three practices of moola bandha (used for
awakening mooladhara chakra) and vajroli mudra and ashwini mudra (both used for
awakening swadhisthana chakra). The following diagrams for male and female locations
will help to clarify the difference in the points of contraction.

For women:

Key to location of contraction points:

1. Vajroli or sahajoli mudra (clitoris, lower vaginal muscles and urethra)
2. Moola bandha (cervix)
3. Ashwini mudra (anal muscled/sphincters).

For men:

Key to exact location of contraction points:

1. Vajroli mudra (penis)
2. Moola bandha (between anus and scrotum; perineal body)
3. Ashwini mudra (anal muscles/sphincters).


### Practice 1. Chakra location

For men :

Sit in siddhasana or any asana in which the heel is pressed into the perineum. Close
your eyes, relax completely and become aware of your whole physical body. Move your
awareness to the point of contact between the heel and perineum, midway between the
testes and the anus. Become intensely aware of the distinct pressure exerted on the
perineal body. Center yourself at the pressure point. Now become aware of your breath.
Feel or imagine that you are breathing in and out of this pressure point. Feel the breath
moving through the perineal body, becoming finer and finer, so that it pierces the point
where mooladhara chakra is located. You will feel it as a psychophysical contraction.
Say mentally, "mooladhara, mooladhara, mooladhara". Maintain awareness of the
perineal body and the breath for up to 5 minutes.

For women:

Sit in siddha yoni asana or a suitable alternative. Relax your body completely and
close your eyes. Move your awareness to the lower part of the body and focus your
attention on the contact point between your heel and the opening of the vagina. Become
intensely aware of the slight but distinct pressure at this point. Center yourself at the
pressure point. 

Become aware of your natural breath. Feel or imagine that you are
breathing in and out of the pressure point. Continue this for 10 deep breaths. Now bring
your awareness inside the body. From the point of external pressure, move your
awareness in towards the base of the spine. Follow the natural formation of the vagina,
moving up at a slight angle and back towards the spine until you come to the opening of
the womb. You are at the opening of the womb, about 2 or 3 centimeters inside the body,
just below the base of the spine. Focus your awareness at this point and begin to breathe
in and out from the cervix to the point of outer pressure. Breathe in and bring your
awareness to the opening of the womb. Breathe out and move again to the outer pressure
point. Somewhere in this area you will find your point for mooladhara chakra. Feel it
clearly and distinctly and mentally repeat,'mooladhara, mooladhara, mooladhara.

Maintain unbroken awareness of this point for up to 5 minutes.

Alternative practice: Locating mooladhara chakra by touch
Men should sit in a comfortable position and press one ringer onto the perineum,
midway between the anus and scrotum, then contract the muscles there. The contraction
will be felt. When they can contract those muscles without movement of the anus or
penis, the perineal body has been successfully isolated.

Women should assume a comfortable sitting or lying position and gently insert one
finger into the vagina as far as it will go. Then tighten the muscles so that the walls of the
upper vagina contract and squeeze the finger. If they can do this without contracting the
anus or the front part of the perineum (clitoris and urinary opening), then location of
mooladhara is correct.

Practice 2: Moola bandba (the permeal lock)

Stage I:

Sit in siddhasana or any other posture which applies a firm pressure in the region of
mooladhara chakra. Close the eyes and relax the whole body. Inhale deeply. Hold the
breath and contract the muscles at the mooladhara chakra region. Draw the muscles
upwards as much as you are able without excessive strain. Try to contract only the
mooladhara chakra trigger point, so that the urinary musculature in front and the anal
sphincters behind, remain relaxed. Keep your attention fixed on the exact point of
contraction. Hold this contraction for as long as possible. Then release moola bandha and
breathe normally. Practise for a few minutes daily. Jalandhara bandha (described in
chapter 9 of this section), can also be added to the practice. With breath retention,
perform jalandhara bandha, then moola bandha. Before exhaling, release moola bandha,
then jalandhara bandha.

Stage 2:

Contract and release moola bandha rhythmically. About one contraction per second is
reasonable, or if you wish, you can synchronize the contraction with the heart
beat. Again, ensure that the contraction is focused at the exact trigger point and at the
anus. Direct all your attention to the point of contraction. Practise for a few minutes daily.

Stage 3:

Leave all physical contraction. Try to feel the pulse beat at the trigger point, or try to
contract the point mentally. Direct all your attention to the mooladhara chakra area. The
practice is the same as stage 2, but without physical contraction. Continue for as long as
you have time to spare. With practice, you will be able to locate the trigger point of
mooladhara chakra exactly, merely through thought.

Practice 3: Nasikagra drishti

This practice is also called agochari mudra (the gesture of invisibility).

### Nosetip gazing

Sit in any meditative pose with the spine erect and the head facing forward. Close
your eyes and relax your whole body for some time. Then open your eyes and focus them
on the nosetip. Do not strain your eyes, but try to fix your gaze on the tip of the nose.
Respiration should be normal. When the attention of both eyes is focused on the nosetip,
you will see that the double outlines of the nose merge to become a single solid outline.
You should direct your gaze to the V-shaped point where the two outlines cross each
other at the very tip of the nose. If you do not see a solid V-shaped outline, then both eyes
are not fixed on the nosetip. It is then necessary to focus the eyes on your finger, ÑŽ
inches in front of your face, and hold the fingertip in focus as you slowly bring it to the
nosetip. Eventually, you can discard this method and easily focus the eyes on the nosetip
at will.

At first you may find it difficult to hold your attention on the nosetip for more than a
few seconds. When you feel discomfort, release the position of the eyes for a few seconds
and then repeat the practice. Over a period of weeks, as the eyes become accustomed,
gradually increase the duration of practice. Never strain the eyes. Once you can
comfortably maintain a steady gaze for a minute or more, become aware of your breath as
well as the nosetip. Feel the breath moving in and out through the nose. At the same time,
become aware of the subtle sound the breath makes as it moves through the nasal
passages. Try to become completely absorbed in the practice, to the exclusion of all other
thoughts and external distractions. Be aware of the nosetip, the movement of the breath
and the accompanying sound. Carry on in this manner for up to 5 minutes.

### Practise

This sadhana (practices 1, 2 and 3), for mooladhara chakra, should be done for a
period of one month. You should also continue the practices for awakening ajna chakra.
