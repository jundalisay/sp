Month 5

Anahata chakra can be awakened very simply through the practice of ajapa japa.
Japa means "repetition" and ajapa is the repetition of a mantra until it ultimately becomes
the spontaneous form of your conscious awareness.
Another important practice in anahata awakening is bhramari pranayama. Although it
is called a pranayama, bhramari is actually a meditational practice. It is not directly
related to controlling prana, as are other forms of pranayama. In the scriptures, the heart
center is termed, "the center of unstruck sound" and also "the cave of bees." In bhramari,
the humming sound oi the bees is produced and traced towards its source. This develops
deep mental and emotional relaxation and is extremely effective in cardiac disorders.
Anahata chakra is the center of bhakti or devotion. It is awakened in accordance with
the degree of devotion to guru, God, or personal deity, in whatever form or non-form one
may visualize or understand the spiritual intelligence of the universe. All practices of
yoga, especially when done with the blessings ol the guru, will automatically awaken
devotion in the spiritual heart (anahata chakra). There are many excellent books on bhakti
yoga which will help to inspire the aspirant to follow this path. Any biographies of saints,
yogis and bhaktas will also be useful. An excellent description of the process of bhakti
yoga is given in our publication entitled, A Systematic Course in the Ancient Tantric
Techniques of Toga and Kriya.

Preparatory practices

Asanas that help to purify anahata chakra include: shalabhasana, dhanurasana,
matsyasana, gomukhasana, kandharasana, baddha padmasana, sarpasana, supta
vajrasana and sirshasana.

Practice 1: Chakra and kshetram location

Stand sideways in front of a mirror. Put one linger of one hand on the center of the
chest. Here you will find anahata kshetram. Put one finger of the other hand on the
spine, directly behind the kshetram; this is anahata chakra. Sit down, press both iingers
firmly for one minute, and then remove the fingers. The sensation at the chakra and
kshetram will continue. Concentrate on the sensation at the chakra and mentally repeat,
'anahata, anahata, anahata', for a few minutes.
Practice 2: Anahata purification
Assume a comfortable sitting posture. Hold the back straight but without strain. Keep
the eyes closed. Breathe slowly and deeply, feeling the expansion and contraction of the
chest as you breathe in and out for some minutes. Then become aware of your breath
moving in and out of the anahata region. As the chest expands, feel that the breath flows
in through the center of the chest and back to anahata chakra. As the chest contracts, feel
that the breath flows from anahata chakra in the spine, through the center of the chest and
out of the body. Practise this for some minutes, mentally repeating, 'anahata, anahata,
anahata'.
Practice 3: Bhramari pranayama
The humming breath
Sit in a comfortable meditative pose. Adjust your position and relax fully for some
minutes. Plug the ears with the index fingers. Face forward and hold the spine as straight
as possible. Close the eyes. Relax the whole body. Keep the teeth slightly separated and
the mouth closed throughout the entire practice. This allows the vibration to be
experienced more distinctly in the brain. Breathe in slowly and deeply. Then, while
breathing out, produce a humming sound. The sound should be smooth and continuous
for the full duration of exhalation. The humming need not be loud. The important thing is
that you hear the sound reverberating within your head. The exhalation should be slow
and controlled. At the end of exhalation, stop the humming sound and breathe in. Keep
the eyes closed and the ears plugged. Again repeat the humming sound with the next
exhalation. Try to relax fully during the practice. Do not strain in any way. Continue for 5
or ю minutes.
Practice 4: Ajapa japa meditation
Sit in siddhasana, siddha yoni asana or any posture which feels completely
comfortable. Close your eyes and relax for a few minutes. Now become aware of your
natural breath as it enters and leaves the body. Do not try to control the breath, just
become a witness of the natural breathing process. Now become aware that the sound of
inhalation is so and the sound of exhalation is ham. The natural mantra of the breath is
so-ham. You have only to discover it. Be simultaneously aware of the natural breath,
coupled with the idea of so-ham-so-ham-so-ham. You must be totally relaxed in this
practice. Do not lose awareness of the mantra or your natural breath, even for an instant.
Do not be concerned with the thoughts and feelings that arise. Allow them to come and
go as they will. Remain ever aware of the natural breath and the ongoing mantra. Now
become aware of the psychic breath which is flowing in the front of the body brtween the
navel and the throat, and between the throat and the navel. With inspiration, this psychic
breath rises from the navel to the throat and its mantra is so. With expiration, the psychic
breath descends from the throat back to the navel. Its mantra is ham. Maintain awareness
of the breath passing through the psychic passageway and producing the sound so-ham-
so-ham-so-ham. Continue this practice for ю or 15 minutes more, allowing your
breathing to be totally relaxed.
Note: Ajapa japa can be practised at any time, but it should be done for 5 to ю minutes
per day - either in the morning sadhana session or at night, immediately before sleep. It
should be continued for at least one month.
Practice 5: Meditation - entering the heart space
Sit in siddhasana or any other comfortable posture. Close your eyes and relax yourself
completely for some time. Concentrate your awareness in the throat region. Now become
aware of the breath in the throat. Only be aware of the sensation of the breath in the
throat for some time. Now add the awareness of the ingoing breath from the throat
downwards. You are not concerned with the outgoing breath. Your attention is occupied
only with the ingoing breath in the throat. Become aware of the inflowing breath in the
throat passing within the network of the diaphragm. Be aware of the diaphragm - the
rising and falling muscular floor separating the chest and lungs above from the abdominal
organs below.
With each inspiration, it drops into the abdomen a little, increasing the pressure there
and causing the navel to expand. Simultaneously, the lungs are expanding fully in the
chest. Be aware with expiration that the abdomen contracts, the diaphragm is rising and
the lungs are emptying completely. Develop awareness of the diaphragm for some time.
Now, also become aware of the akasha, the space within which the diaphragm is
operating. With the ingoing breath you feel this space is filling up. Only be aware of the
process of filling up the space. This process of filling up is only a basis for the awareness
of this vast space. The process of feeling the breath is only the basis for experiencing the
heart space. Become aware of the space in the heart; take your awareness directly
there. Feel the space within the heart. It is contracting and expanding with the rhythm of
the natural breath. Breath is only the basis. The process of filling up is only the basis. Go
on to comprehend the whole space. Then you are aware of the space alone. Feel the
contraction and expansion of this vast space. It is taking place on the rhythm of the
natural breath. The breath is natural and spontaneous. Do not alter it in any way. Do not
make it longer or shorter, deeper or more shallow, faster or slower. It has to become a
spontaneous and voluntary movement of breath. In this practice the awareness of the
space in the heart is important. If the awareness of the expansion and contraction of the
heart space is constant and stabilized, after some time, many visions and experiences will
manifest there. You do not have to visualize or imagine anything. The vision will come
by itself when the awareness of the heart space is constant. The vision is of a lake and a
blue lotus. If you are able to feel the space of the heart contracting and expanding, then
maintain your awareness there. If that is not possible, then you have to feel the breath
which is filling up the space. That is the first stage of the practice. The second stage is the
direct feeling of the space and its expansion and contraction on the rhythm of the breath.
The third stage is the awareness of the blue lotus and the still lake. It will come by
itself. Keep yourself ready for that experience. Now become aware of the natural
inflowing and outflowing breath in the throat. Withdraw your awareness from the heart
space and bring it to the natural breath in the throat. Maintain awareness of the inflowing
and outflowing breath in the throat for some time. Practise for 5 or 10 minutes. Chant 0m
3 times. Allow the sound to manifest fully and spontaneously from deep within. For a
few minutes, listen carefully for the inner vibration of the sound. Release your posture
and open your eyes.
Practise
Practise these techniques for awakening anahata chakra for one month and then
proceed to those for awakening vishuddhi chakra. All the practices given for awakening
ajna, mooladhara, swadhisthana and manipura chakras can be done if sufficient time is
available. If not, then we suggest that you do a few selected techniques from each chakra
sadhana as follows:
ajna - trataka and shambhavi mudra
mooladhara - moola bandha and nasikagra
mudra swadhisthana - chakra and kshetram location, vajroli or sahajoli
manipura - chakra and kshetram location, uddiyana bandha and nauli (if possible).
