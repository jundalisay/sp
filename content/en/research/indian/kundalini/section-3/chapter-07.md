Month 4

There are several methods of awakening manipura chakra. According to hatha yoga,
manipura is directly connected with the eyes. Ajna chakra and manipura chakra are very
closely related to one another in the same way that vision and willful action are
interdependent processes. Therefore, the practice of trataka brings about manipura
awakening as well as ajna chakra awakening.

Although tantra is not against any particular diet, when manipura chakra is to be
awakened, the diet has to be very pure, and at certain stages, fasting may be necessary as
well. If manipura is awakened when the diet is faulty, harmful reactions may take place.
Because manipura is the center of the digestive fire, disorders of the gastrointestinal
system are corrected by manipura sadhana.

The major constituents of manipura sadhana are uddiyana bandha and nauli kriya.
Uddiyana bandha is the contraction of the abdomen and the control of the muscles of the
abdominal wall, as well as control over the small and large intestines and the other
digestive and visceral organs. The functions of the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas and
stomach are brought into harmonious and controlled interaction when uddiyana bandha is
perfected. However, agnisar kriya must be mastered before uddiyana is attempted.
Nauli kriya is the control of the rectus abdomini muscles and churning of the whole
abdomen. This is a difficult practice which takes some time to perfect. However, with
mastery of nauli, it is easy to create a union of prana and apana in the navel, so manipura
chakra can be awakened.

Preparatory practices

The following asanas will be found useful in awakening manipura chakra:
pawanmuktasana (anti-gastric series), chakrasana, dhanurasana, marjariasana,
matsyasana, yoga mudra, paschimottanasana and ushtrasana.

Practice 1: Chakra and kshetram location

Stand sideways in front of a mirror. Put one finger of one hand on the navel and one
finger of the other hand on the spine, directly behind. Sit down, press firmly with the
finger on the spine for one minute, then remove the finger. As the pressure sensation
continues, concentrate on the area slightly deeper in from that point. This is the location
of manipura chakra. Mentally repeat the mantra, 'manipura' for a few minutes, while
feeling the sensation at that point. Then fix your attention at the navel itself. This is the
location of manipura kshetram. Whilst feeling the blood pulse at this point, mentally
repeat the mantra, 'manipura' for a few minutes.

Practice 2 : Manipura purification

Assume a comfortable sitting pose. Hold the back straight and keep the eyes closed.
Breathe slowly and deeply, feeling the expansion and contraction of the navel as you
breathe in and out through the navel. Feel the breath expanding and contracting in the
navel area for some minutes. As the navel expands outward, feel that the breath is being
pulled in through the navel, straight back to manipura in the spine. As the navel contracts
inward, feel that the breath flows from manipura chakra in the spine to the navel and out
of the body. Practise this for a few minutes each day while mentally repeating, 'manipura,
manipura, manipura'.

Practice 3: Agnisar kriya

Technique 1: (simple form)
Sit in vajrasana. Keeping the toes together, separate the knees as far as
possible. Keep both hands on the knees, straighten the arms and lean forward
slightly. Open the mouth and extend the tongue outside. Breathe rapidly in and out while
simultaneously expanding and contracting the abdomen. The respiration should be in
harmony with the movement of the abdomen and should resemble the panting of a dog.
Breathe in and out up to 25 times.
Increasing the digestive fire

Technique 2 : (advanced form)

Assume the same pose as technique 1.Exhale as completely as possible. Perform
jalandhara bandha. Rapidly contract and expand the abdominal muscles repeatedly, for as
long as you are able to retain the breath outside. Release jalandhara bandha and inhale
fully. Perform the practice 4 more times, each time waiting until the breath has returned
to normal.

Note: Agnisar kriya should be practised on an empty stomach early in the morning.
The advanced form should not be attempted until the simple form is mastered. Sufferers
of heart disease or peptic ulcer should not practise agnisar kriya, nor should pregnant
women or persons who have undergone abdominal surgery in the last 6 to 9 months.

Practice 4: Uddiyana bandha

The abdominal lock

Sit in a meditative pose in which the knees touch the floor. If this is not possible, then
you can perform uddiyana while standing. Place the palms on the knees, close the eyes
and relax the whole body. Exhale completely and keep the breath outside. Perform
jalandhara bandha.Then contract the abdominal muscles as far as possible inward and
upward. This is a kind of sucking action of the muscles. Hold this lock for as long as the
breath can be retained outside. Concentrate on manipura chakra in the spine and repeat
mentally, 'manipura, manipura, manipura'. Slowly relax the stomach muscles. Release
jalandhara bandha and inhale. When the respiration has returned to normal, the process
may be repeated. Practise a few rounds and gradually increase to 10.
Note: Limitations are the same as for agnisar kriya.
Practice 5: Nauli
Abdominal churning
Stand with the feet separated by about a meter. Place the hands on the knees and bend
the knees slightly. Perform uddiyana bandha in this position.

Stage 1 : Madhyama nauli

Contract the rectus abdomini muscles and isolate them at the center of the
abdomen. After mastering this, proceed to the next stage.

Stage 2 : Varna nauli

Isolate the rectus abdomini muscles at the left side of the abdomen
Left abdominal churning

Stage ли: Dakshina nauli

Isolate the rectus abdomini muscles at the right side of the abdomen.

Stage 4

The practitioner should be able to perform stages 1-3 without the slightest difficulty,
before attempting this stage. Perform uddiyana bandha from the standing position. Isolate
the rectus abdomini muscles, then try to churn or roll them so that they move from the
left, to the center, to the right in one smooth motion, then from the right, to the center, to
the left. Repeat this movement in quick succession as many times as possible while
retaining the breath outside. Then relax the abdominal muscles and breathe in deeply and
fully. When the respiration has returned to normal, repeat the process, this time rolling
the muscles from right to left. Practise each round for as long as you can retain the breath.

Do up to 6 rounds - 3 times from left to right and 3 times from right to left.

Note: Nauli should not be attempted until agnisar kriya and uddiyana bandha have
been perfected. Limitations are the same as for agnisar kriya. Sufferers of high blood
pressure should also avoid this practice.

Practice 6: Union of prana and apana

Sit in siddhasana or siddha yoni asana. Relax the whole body for a few minutes,
bringing it to the point of absolute immobility. Now become aware of the natural
abdominal breath. Center your awareness on the movement of the navel as you inhale and
exhale. Continue for some minutes. Now become aware that there are two forces
travelling to the navel - prana and apana. One force (apana) is ascending from
mooladhara to the navel, while the other (prana), is descending to the navel from above.
They must both reach the navel at the point of full inhalation. When you feel that the two
forces are meeting in the navel, perform kumbhaka, retention of breath, and then develop
mental awareness of the single central point of force in the navel. Do not strain. Release
the breath and continue this practice in your own natural rhythm.The awareness of the
two forces travelling and meeting in the navel center must be simultaneous. Now, as the
two forces are converging in the navel, gradually allow moola bandha to take place. Go
on contracting moola bandha as you heighten your awareness of the force which is
centered in the navel. Hold your breath for as long as you can, while centralizing the
force in the navel and performing moola bandha. As you release the breath, release moola
bandha as well. Do not strain. Go on practising for 3 minutes or more.

Practise

Practise the techniques for awakening manipura chakra for one month and then
proceed to those for anahata chakra. Nauli may be difficult for many people; do not strain
or overexert. It is best not to attempt it until you have mastered agnisar kriya and
uddiyana bandha. The practices for awakening ajna, mooladhara and swadhisthana can
also be continued.
