Swami Satyadharma: So docs pooled energy act to block or can it be used to activate
the chakra? For example, if a person has a lot of pooled energy in mooladhara, would that
be an energy block or could that pooled energy be utilized to activate and awaken a
chakra?

Swami Vivekananda: It can be used to activate if the psychological blockages are
eliminated.

Swami Shankardevananda: I think there is a difference between storage and
blockage. The ability to hold or store energy takes place consciously, whilst having an
unconscious or subconscious blockage leads to repression.
Swami Vivekananda: And repression of a highly energized chakra can produce all
sorts of physical symptoms, such as muscle tension, malfunctioning of internal organs,
etc., as well as emotional problems.

Swami Shankardevananda: What are the psychological effects of mooladhara
awakening?

Swami Vivekananda: As I have already said, renunciation.

Swami Shankardevananda: The feeling of separation, the beginning of your
individual awareness; awakening to the fact that you are separate from something else.

Swami Nischalananda: Primal alienation or something like that.

Swami Shankardevananda: Do you think that the basic energy at mooladhara is
anxiety, fear, or is it insecurity?

Swami Vivekananda: The basic emotion? Well, it depends on the energization of the
circuit. If there is not much energy it will tend to be depression and hopelessness. But if
there is a lot of energy it will then depend upon the evolution of the chakra. If it is little
evolved, then there will be intense insecurity, which is anxiety. If it is highly evolved
there will be a sense of oneness and complete security. Generally rnooladhara is blocked
to some extent in most people and blockages may manifest as muscle tension.
Muscle tensions are manifestations of the circuits of mental blockages, samskaras. It
is the samskaras that keep down the evolution of the quality of consciousness that is
within these chakra circuits. I think that low evolution, muscle spasms and the
maladjustments of the organisms that are supplied by that part of the autonomic nervous
system are due to psychic tensions.

Swami Shankardevananda: These psychic and personality tensions are due to various
events in the environment.

Swami Vivekananda: That is right. The inner unconscious conflicts coming into
conflict with events in the environment. For example, if a man feels very insecure and
someone steals a valuable possession from him, he may go into an absolute frenzy. This
is opposed to the reaction of someone else who does not have the same sort of conflicts
and insecurities.

If a person cannot express the feeling that is involved at mooladhara, that feeling can
express itself in somatic problems such as spasms of the muscles, in autonomic problems,
blood pressure, constipation, and who knows what else, maybe functional urethritis,
cystitis, colitis, rectitis, dysmenorrhea, etc.

PSYCHOSIS

Swami Shankardevananda: Would you associate a highly energized, low evolved
mooladhara problem as the cause of manic depression?
Swami Vivekananda: I think manic depression is an ida/pingala thing. I think we are
in another dimension there, because a manic person will undergo all manifestations of a
very highly energized and controlled chakra. He will be rushing around gambling all his
money away, trying to get more, getting into all sorts of sexual exploits, going round
pushing other people around - the rajasic aspect.
Swami Sambuddhananda: Would you say that schizophrenia and paranoia are related
with ida and pingala imbalance?

Swami Vivekananda: Yes, there are people who are stuck in ida. Ida is very much
overactive. It is interesting that research shows that the taking in of negative aspects of
the environment through the right hemisphere (ida) is paranoia. This is what paranoia is
all about. A lot of people, some of them quite highly evolved people who have
specialized much in ida are a bit paranoid. The ida seems to have a negative aspect about
it. Even if you come into it at a high level of consciousness, it seems to have a bit of a
negative pull. If you are going to activate your chakras you have to make sure your ida
and pingala are balanced.

Swami Shankardevananda: But manic depression, psychosis and other mental
problems relate to either mooladhara or ajna because it is only at these two points that
you have the fusion of ida and pingala. Therefore, psychosis, manic depression and all
these things would seem to relate very much to the mooladhara/ajna circuit. If ida and
pingala are coming out of mooladhara chakra then what would be the mechanism dealing
with psychosis?

Swami Vivekananda: I think that ida and pingala are only related to the activities of
the cerebral hemispheres.

Swami Shankardevananda: But the whole body is controlled by the hemispheres. The
whole body gets the energy. Arteries and veins, sensory and motor nerves, right and left
hemispheres are all reflections of the ida and pingala process.
Swami Vivekananda: I see ida and pingala anatomically up here in the brain, not
crossing down the spine. I believe that ida and pingala crossing each other is a concept
and a symbol of experience.

Swami Satyadharma: I think that awakening of mooladhara is the beginning of
psychic awareness. That is why with mooladhara awakening, people often become
disturbed.

Swami Vivekananda: Yes. They can get caught in the psychic consciousness, which is
the consciousness in which you have hallucinations, etc.
Swami Satyadharma: It is much more powerful than anything they have ever
experienced before.
Swami Vivekananda: We slide in and out of it twice a day anyway, even if we are not
doing any formal closed eye meditation techniques. I think if you hold the awareness at
the psychic level, and you can do it with yoga nidra, you will experience a state in which
there is thought blocking - what is called thought disorder - you know, where one thought
leads on to another one that is unrelated to it and it just goes off into the distance.
Paradoxical thinking - where two paradoxical things can exist together, hallucinations,
voices talking to you, you see things and so forth.
Swami Shankardevananda: So therefore we assume that pingala is blocked and ida is
flowing. All that stuff is coming out through ida from mooladhara; basic subconscious
material.
Swami Vivekananda: At the same time there is psychic withdrawal.
Swami Shankardevananda: Yes, so what does that imply?
Swami Vivekananda: If there is a psychic withdrawal, then even though we appear to
be in communication with the outside, in actual fact we are still inside from the psychic
point of view. Paradoxical thinking, suspicious feelings, voices and all these things, and
not being able to keep your thoughts together on one topic for any more than a couple of
seconds - all these come from a psychic, inner plane.
