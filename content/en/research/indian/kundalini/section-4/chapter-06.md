The chakras can be interpreted from many points of view, for example, the physical,
psychological, behavioral, psychic, symbolic, mythical, religious, scientific, evolutionary,
spiritual and more. They have both a microcosmic aspect within the human framework
and, at the same time, a macrocosmic aspect which totally encompasses our perception
and experience of life. At whatever level we examine them, they represent a hierarchical,
interlocking and interdependent series of mandalas which, when superimposed on one
another, make up a total picture of the human personality.

Each of us stands at a certain point along the line of evolution that ascends the chakras
and this will determine how we see the world. Someone who lives at swadhisthana sees
the world in terms of gratification of his desires, for example, at manipura in terms of
gratification of power instincts, at anahata in terms of compassion and love for all
humanity. The degree of evolution of the chakras depends to a great extent on the activity
within our nervous system and our state of consciousness. Someone at a lower level
cannot understand someone at a higher level whereas the person at a higher level has
been at the lower level before, has a wider range of experience, and more importantly, he
has more circuits awakened or activated for handling life's experiences, for perceiving at
different levels, and for interpreting and acting on the demands of life.

Even within the same chakra there are different levels of evolution, balance and
activity, so that someone living at manipura might be more aware than someone else at
manipura, their center being more balanced and awakened, so that, for example, they use
their power drives constructively to help people rather than destructively and for their
own personal ego gratification. An adult generally has a more evolved manipura chakra
than a child, protecting the child from danger while the child pulls the wings off
butterflies or gaily stamps on ants and insects. Of course, this is relative and varies from
individual to individual.

Each level in the chakra system is the sum total of various physical, emotional,
mental, psychic and spiritual elements. Each chakra has its own neurological plexus and
endocrine gland and these link up to various organs and systems in the body. They in turn
are connected to the controlling mechanisms of the brain, each of which has emotional,
mental and psychic components. The chakra is like a transducer, a linking point between
the various levels of our being and it converts and channels energy either up or down to
the various levels.

In trying to understand the chakras, therefore, we can think of each level in the spinal
cord as controlling a different segment of the body, and at the same time, representing a
level of functioning in the nervous system and mind. Ajna chakra, for example, is a much
more complex center than mooladhara, or any chakra for that matter, controlling as it
does the intuitive and higher mental faculties related to the most evolved circuits in the
cerebral cortex. Ajna chakra has as its symbol the two-petalled lotus, and we can think of
this as representing the two hemispheres of the brain with the pineal gland as its main
focusing central point. Mooladhara, on the other hand, controls very deep, powerful,
primitive, animalistic, unconscious urges and instincts which are related to very simple
and primitive neurological circuits at the bottom of the brain common to all animals,
reptiles and even birds.
The chakras within the brain
Recent discoveries in neuroscience, precipitated by fantastic advances in technology,
measuring capacity, surgical technique and pure pioneering perspicacity, promise to
revolutionize our concept of man and propel us into new and better techniques in
medicine, psychology and living in general. Like Einstein's discovery of relativity, the
ramifications of these discoveries take time to percolate down into common usage.
The brain is one of the hardest of all areas to research because of the inaccessibility
and delicacy of the area to be studied. There is also an inherent and almost insoluble
problem in studying the brain. Man is using his brain to study and understand his own
brain. This is like trying to understand the mind with the mind, or grasp the hand with the
same hand, or see the eye with the same eye. We cannot know ourselves objectively as
we can an external object or person, for we are the knowledge itself. Besides this, few
people are keen to let doctors open their skulls and look inside.
Neurosurgeons and yogis share common ground because both aim to know the truth
and reality of themselves. It is the approach which differs. While scientific researchers
have approached the brain objectively and have attacked and dissected it with knives,
probed it with electrodes, photographed and X-rayed it, stimulated and drugged it in
order to mechanically and externally manipulate its circuits into giving up their secrets,
yogis decided to scientifically discover the secrets of the brain by experiencing it directly
through meditation. Their findings agree with those of modern science.
Yogis discovered through meditation that within their bodies were circuits and centers
with both physical and psychic components that they called nadis and chakras. Though
we take this for granted now, we must remember that these studies were made thousands
of years ago without the aid of modern microscopes. Not only did yogis achieve a
wonderfully complete and practical system of techniques, but way back then they also
based their techniques on solid scientific research, the discovery that there are six major
primary centers in the body, the chakras, in a hierarchical, interconnected network within
the spinal cord. They also saw that each chakra had its own definite physical,
psychological and behavioral characteristics, connected to the brain by a network of
energy flows, all of which did not necessarily correspond to purely physical structures.
They also discovered many secondary centers which were subsidiary to the primary ones.
The chakras in the spinal cord were found to be points manipulated by focusing
attention, mental and psychic energy, breath and body postures, so as to derive certain
physical and psychic experiences. The techniques allow us to learn to control the most
basic and vital instincts and needs of body, emotions, mind, psyche and spirit. Recent
discoveries from neurophysiology and anatomy show that vital nerve plexes and
endocrine organs exist within the body, spine and brain and correspond to the levels
described by yogis. These findings support the claims of yogis that their system is more
than just mere exercises and relaxation. It is a method supplying the tools to control our
body, mind, metabolism and personality.
The triune brain
Dr. Paul MacLean, neurophysiologist and head of the Laboratory of Brain Evolution
and Behavior at the National Institute of Mental Health, USA, has demonstrated that the
brain of man is functionally divided into three main areas, three interconnected biological
computers, each with its own special intelligence, subjectivity, sense of time and space,
memory, motor and other functions. (1) Each brain corresponds to a separate
evolutionary step and is distinguished neuroanatomicalty and functionally, containing
strikingly different distributions of the main neuro chemicals in the brain, dopamine and
serotonin. If we look carefully into these levels and compare descriptions of
neuroscientists and yogis we see that both were saying the same thing.

The three levels are called the reptilian, mammalian and human levels: 

1. The reptilian complex includes the very topmost spinal cord and the lower areas of
the brain, including the medulla oblongata and part of the reticular activating system, that
part responsible for our waking, conscious state. This area contains the basic neural
machinery for self-preservation and reproduction, including regulation of the heart, blood
circulation and respiration. It controls mating, social hierarchies, insistence on routine,
obedience to precedent and ritual, and slavish imitation of fads and fashions.
According to MacLean, the R-complex plays an important role in aggressive
behavior, territoriality, ritual and the establishment of social hierarchies. This area
corresponds to the description of the mooladhara and swadhisthana chakras, because
yogis have told us these centers maintain our most basic and primitive, animalistic
drives and instincts; basic living, eating, sleeping and procreating within a dark and
primitive, monotonous and repetitious existence, minus joy, love and self-awareness.
They are related to our deepest unconscious and subconscious mind.
MacLean and his co-workers have found that this area dominates the lives of most
people, which agrees with the statement by yogis that most people live in mooladhara and
swadhisthana, though their function is modified by the higher centers. We spend most of
our time controlled by and stimulating the lower chakras within the blinding limitations
of our daily rituals.
MacLean has also shown that this is true neurologically. Removing the cerebral cortex
from hamsters a day or two after birth and leaving only the R-complex and limbic
system, MacLean found that the hamsters grew up normally, gave birth and displayed
every form of behavior normal for hamsters. They could even see without a visual cortex.
Leaving only the R-complex in birds, he found that they could function normally and
carry on most kinds of communication and day-to-day routines.This research indicates
that our day-to-day functions are controlled by these primitive areas and that we do not
really need much more of our brain to handle the basic problems and demands of a neatly
ordered, socially accepted lifestyle. We rarely stimulate our higher centers, and in fact
find it hard to cope with any demands out of the ordinary. This is why yogis tell us to
practise yoga so as to develop our inner unused capacity, some nine-tenths of the brain or
more, and to stimulate the growth and development of our higher centers.
Psychology also tells us that beneath the sane facade of any human being there lurks a
primitive creature, instinctive and irrational, a Mr. Hyde composite of all that is
animalistic and forbidden. Freud called this the id, an unconscious area from which arises
our desires, passions and the energy underlying our emotions and sense of who we are.
Yogis call this mooladhara and swadhisthana and tell us that the unconscious and
subconscious areas have two centers controlling them, one located in the perineum and
the other in the spine behind the pubic bone controlling sexuality and all its related
behavior. Both psychologists and yogis tell us that most of us spend most of our time
trying to gratify and fulfil these basic urges for food (survival) and pleasure. Much of our
time, for example, is organized for making our daily "bread", a slang term for money, by
which we can buy food, shelter, clothing and pleasure. Few of us realize that there is
much more to life than this.
By practising yoga we learn to balance and control these centers physically and also at
the level of their instincts and drives, freeing their energy from primitive, compulsive
ritual and rechannelling it up sushumna to the higher centers for the awakening of higher
consciousness.
2. The mammalian structures are under the control of the limbic system, which
controls emotion, memory and other behavior which is less ritualistic and more
spontaneous. It is also thought to control playful behavior, exhilaration, awe and wonder
and the subtler, more human emotions such as love. MacLean has found that damage to
areas of this part of the brain results in deficits in maternal behavior and absence of play.
Within the limbic system are the behavioral centers for rage, fright, fear, feelings of
punishment, anxiety, hunger, desire, pleasure, pain, sex, joy and love. This area is thus
related to manipura and anahata functioning. If we stimulate the areas of the spinal cord
behind the navel and heart associated with the chakras, we will send energy into the brain
to turn on the various components at the physical, mental and behavioral levels associated
with the chakras.
3. The human side of the brain is the most recently evolved neocortex, the seat of
intelligence and many of the characteristic human cognitive functions. It is here that, with
amazing speed and precision, the various faculties are integrated and synchronized. The
cortex makes possible: thinking, calculation, analysis, discrimination, intuition, creativity,
use of symbols, planning, anticipation of the future, artistic and scientific expression, and
myriad other highly evolved and purely human faculties.
We know that the frontal lobes of the brain are especially important, being the most
recently evolved part of the brain. Some researchers think that this part of the brain, in
connection with the other sections, is responsible for the very human capacity of self-
awareness and knowledge of this self-awareness; we know that we know, and we know
that too.
We know that patients with severe frontal lobe damage or who have had frontal
lobotomies, operations which sever the frontal lobes from the rest of the brain, are
incapable of planning for the future and lack a continuous sense of self. They cannot see
what effect a certain action will have on the future. Such people become dull, slow, cease
to care for themselves or others, or about what they say or do. They are friendly,
cooperative vegetables with a serious lack of imagination and loss of interest in life. They
may be suffering from intense pain and not even care about the fact.
The frontal lobes are therefore said to be responsible for planning and discrimination,
for anticipation of tho future and, therefore, for the purely human emotion of anxiety.
This differs from fear which is related to an actual event. Anxiety is a mental event,
related to some future occurrence. It is valuable for our survival and evolution as
individuals and as a species, for caring for the family unit and for society; for our
compassion. More than this it is the force responsible for motivating the formulation of
laws and economic and political systems, for motivating the development of the arts and
sciences, for religions and a system of ethics, for all philosophies, and for the
development of materially and spiritually secure cultures. As we developed the capacity
to plan, the frontal lobes freed our hands for the manipulation of tools, drawing, writing
and other bases for human cultural development.
Knowledge of death and the anxiety it engenders spurs us on to make the most of life
and to develop religious or spiritual systems which help us to cope with the thought of
death. It has also led to the yogic sciences which liberate us from death and take us to
immortality.
David Loye believes that not only are the frontal lobes involved in anticipation, but
are actually involved in seeing into the future. (2) He states that when, for example, a car
is rapidly approaching us, the frontal brain alerts both right and left hemisphere
components to process all the information from the rest of the brain, agreements and
disagreements, so that we can discriminate and decide what will most likely happen. He
found in two separate studies that people who tended to use both sides of the brain were
better able to predict the outcome of events than either right or left-brain dominant
people. This supports the yogic view that both sides of our nature must be balanced for
proper function, fuller living and the development of our inner potential.
Ajna chakra
All of these intellectual, intuitive, creative and expressive functions are said by yogis
to be characteristic of ajna and vishuddhi chakras. We know that, yogic techniques are
especially aiming at stimulation of ajna chakra, which lies at the pineal gland, midway
between the hemispheres.
Yogis state that ajna chakra and the pineal gland as its physical center, is the master
control chakra, the guru chakra. We know from physiology that just in front of the pineal
gland lies the thalamus, at the top of the limbic system. The thalamus has been found to
be one of the main centers regulating the interaction of our senses and motor activity (ida
and pingala), the pre-frontal cortex, which includes the right and left sides of the brain
(ida and pingala), the hypothalamus, which integrates and expresses emotion and
regulates the ANS and the endocrine glands, and the cerebellum, which helps to control
movement. It therefore integrates senses, thought, emotion and action. It is also important
in the recognition of pain and other sensory modalities, such as variations in the degree of
temperature and touch, the size, shape and quality of objects contacting the sense organs.
An interesting fact is that it is involved in the control of movement and especially the
degree of squeezing and contracting of muscles and joints,
We see, therefore, that the pineal/thalamic area fits the description for ajna chakra, the
area where senses and emotion, both ida functions, and motor and intellect, both pingala
functions, meet. Yogis tell us that fusion of ida and pingala at ajna is one of the
definitions of yoga. It leads to an explosion within the nervous system which somehow
fuels and activates a much larger number of circuits within both hemispheres and the
limbic system than would normally occur. It is as though our nervous system suddenly
becomes charged with a high tension electric line, which yogis called sushumna.
Yogis also tell us that ajna is involved in intuition and perception of the subtle and
psychic. If the thalamic area handles degrees of perception and motor activity, making it
possible for us to experience the subtle things of life, then yogic techniques may allow us
to develop our sensitivity in this area so as to be able to expand and extend our normal
capacities in order to sense the psychic quality of matter, an "extra" sense or common
sense, occurring at the meeting point of all the senses, the thalamus.


## The chakras in perspective

Yogis tell us that the chakras lie along the spinal cord, that mooladhara lies in the
perineum and the other chakras move upward towards sahasrara at the apex of man's
evolution and consciousness. Ajna chakra is the highest center in which man feels that he
exists separate from the universe. Union or cosmic consciousness takes place in
sahasrara. Ajna is the controlling chakra, the guru center where commands are heard.
Neurophysiology points out that there are centers in the brain, stretching upward from
the medulla oblongata to the pineal/thalamic area which correspond to the classical
description of the chakras as told by yogis. We can say that within the brain all these fall
under the control of ajna, that they are layers of evolution within ajna, and as each chakra
awakens in the spine, it affects the level of conscious awakening and activity in ajna. The
pineal/thalamic area would represent that part of the brain which is most awakened and
fully activated by total ajna chakra awakening, while the medulla oblongata area is that
part which corresponds to the mooladhara chakra area. This would explain the close link
between mooladhara and ajna; that the awakening of one consequentially awakens the
other.

In most people, ajna chakra, the thalamic/pineal area is dormant. Living in
mooladhara and swadhisthana for most of the time would mean that ajna chakra functions
mainly from the medulla oblongata, the reptilian brain. Only when we stimulate and
awaken the centers by yoga do we jump levels in our nervous system and consciously
awaken the higher, pineal/thalamic areas and their concomitant levels of consciousness.
When ida and pingala fuse in ajna, energy flows from mooladhara up to ajna, from the
medulla oblongata to the pineal/thai arnic area.

There are many techniques which can work on ajna chakra, such as shambhavi mudra,
trataka, mantra japa, nadi shodhana and bhramari pranayama, to name a few. When we
say these techniques are stimulating ajna chakra we are really stating that somehow they
stimulate the integrating and centrally located pmeal/thalamic area and thereby awaken
our normally dormant, higher intellectual/emotional, logical/intuitive functions. They
stimulate the higher elements of ajna and raise our consciousness up out of the lower,
reptilian medulla oblongata. The techniques balance the functioning of our total
brain/mind complex, ida and pingala, by focusing on the central, stimulating area and set
the stage for the awakening of kundalini.
