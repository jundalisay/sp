Can you discuss the nerve complexes associated with mooladhara and swadhisthana chakras?
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Vivekananda" >}}
Well, for all of these segments there are somatic nerves, which deal with the sensory input and the voluntary motor output, and also there are the autonomic nerves, divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic. And usually there is an appropriate endocrine gland for each segment, like the pineal, pituitary and thyroid. The exception is muladhara, and to date, medical science has not found an endocrine gland associated with it. This of course does not mean that one will not be discovered in the future.

Let us try to work out the psychophysiological aspects of mooladhara. In the male it is
actually associated with the base of the penis and with the female, the cervix. So it has a
very deep-rooted sexual link.

If you repeat a mooladhara chakra mantra and you concentrate in that area
somewhere, you will feel a certain vibration occurring. Now what is the mantra doing? Is
it stimulating some physiological organ, or is it some sort of occult stimulation? Is it
stimulating a physical organ or is it activating a lot of energy which seems to appear in a
certain place which we call a chakra? I think it is perhaps the last one of these.

The mooladhara trigger point and the place
of actual experience may be different, but the general location of mooladhara chakra is
certainly in the perineum; it is clearly felt in that area. If it is felt higher, then it is not
mooladhara chakra it is swadhisthana. Either the mantra is wrong or the vibration is
stimulating something else which is more receptive and reactive.
{{< /r >}}

Swami Vivekananda: Is there a physiological basis for this? It is quite possible that the
repetition of a mantra is stimulating the spinal cord. You can certainly feel it in the area
being stimulated and it is not only there, because all the fibers that are coming out from
the body are stimulated. So no matter at what level you stimulate your spiral cord, no
matter what chakra is stimulated, you are going to collect the fibers from so-called
mooladhara chakra. At swadhisthana you will also get the mooladhara chakra fibers; at
manipura you get the mooladhara fibers back to swadhisthana and manipura as well - and
all the way up. Mooladhara chakra is always there in the act because its fibers come from
the lowest part.

Swami Shankardevananda: Gould we consider the sexual energy of mooladhara and
its possible transmutation?


{{< l a="Vivekananda" >}}
This basic sexual energy that Gopi Krishna has written about is
actually the sattvic or subtle essence which can be perceived when the consciousness
becomes very sensitive. This is the essence of the kundalini experience, the sublimation
of sexual energy, the basic life force which is the source of all generation, regeneration
and reproduction. Gopi Krishna felt that what he was seeing was semen being converted
into energy and distributing itself throughout the body. I feel that what he was perceiving
was a clairvoyant view of energy given off by the simple nerve fibers in those organs he
was talking about. But he identified it as semen because that is what is written in the
scriptures. I do not know what women are supposed to have, he did not mention that and
I do not think the scriptures do either. I sometimes have a funny feeling that women did
not exist until about 20 years ago.
{{< /l >}}


Swami Nischalananda: The Hatha Toga Pradipika and certain tantric texts do talk
about women, however, generally that side has been neglected. According to yoga the
sexual energy in men and women is sublimated and transmuted into the ascent of the
kundalini. The starting point, the trigger, is mooladhara. For some reason, the Buddhists
say that the ascent commences at manipura, not mooladhara. How is it that the
enlightened Buddha completely bypassed the two lower chakras? Actually the whole
concept of where kundalini lies is a matter of experience. I don't think that Buddha
actually said that kundalini starts in manipura; more likely he stated that real spiritual
evolution starts from manipura. Swamiji has said many times that only when the
kundalini reaches manipura is it stabilized. It starts in mooladhara but stabilizes in
manipura.

I think this apparent discrepancy comes because of the philosophy of Buddha who
was a gyani, and he didn't get much into kundalini yoga. Vajrayana, on the other hand,
which was an offshoot of Buddhism at a later date, is very much concerned with
mooladhara. But let us get back to the functioning of mooladhara.
Swami Shankardevananda: Mooladhara chakra has two basic modes of function, one
is energy depleted and the other is energy activated. Within that system there is a sick and
a healthy mooladhara. What are the symptoms of these different states of mooladhara
chakra? It is simple - you are either sick or healthy, balanced or unbalanced. If you are
unbalanced you are going to have ida over or under active or pingala over or under
active. You are going to have physical and mental symptoms, fear, insecurity and all
those things. Freud said that everyone who denies mooladhara becomes constipated and
hoards money. Every miser is constipated. These symptoms may be mild or very
extreme. In the fully awakened state they are either going to rip you to pieces or take you
to a higher awareness. So what is the basic quality of a well functioning mooladhara
chakra?

{{< l a="Vivekananda" >}}
Renunciation.
{{< /l >}}

Swami Shankardevananda: We can say that security and renunciation are
interchangeable in the mooladhara system. We can say that in this chakra basic security is
the key. Renunciation obviously implies security and if you are secure within yourself
you don't need any external security.

Swami Satyadharma: When awakening of mooladhara takes place then there is no
such problem as insecurity.


{{< l a="Vivekananda" >}}
This is the state of consciousness of an awakened
mooladhara. A low energized mooladhara chakra generally means low vitality, emotional
insecurity, fear of the future. I also think low self-esteem is involved in this. It almost
forms the syndrome of depression, although you don't necessarily have to get the
joylessness of the low energized swadhisthana chakra. If there is low evolution and high
drive in mooladhara, then you get the ambitious person out to collect as much as he can.
He can be a multimillionaire and still accumulate stuff because he still feels insecure. The
security is a state of consciousness, not a physical reality. As mooladhara chakra starts to
evolve the person attains security, which is totally unrelated to circumstances.
You can see varying degrees of renunciation not only between sannyasins and the
community, but within the community of sannyasins as well.

Swami Satyadharma: When energies pool at mooladhara, do they stimulate or
aggravate the chakras? What is the difference between stagnation of energy and
activation of the chakra?


{{< l a="Vivekananda" >}}
I see that the mooladhara circuit in some people is
sometimes poorly energized; the whole circuit itself has low energization. This varies
between people and varies within people, depending upon cosmic events, the position of
planets, the weather and all sorts of things, including psychological factors such as
disappointments, hurts and threats to one's security. It varies with each of us. Some
people are very much in mooladbara; hooked on the basic sexual aspect of mooladhara in
which case they are very much involved in money and possessions. If they are low
energized, they will still think about these things but they will not do anything about it.
I think you need a certain amount of energization to produce the drive that is inherent
in each chakra; the basic sexual hunting drive in swadhisthana chakra, the territorial and
dominance drive in manipura and the nurturing drive in anahata chakra. Remember, there
are two parameters, the amount of energization of each chakra and the degree of
evolution.

It seems that yoga practices balance the energy inherent within each of the chakra
circuits, and by virtue of eliminating the blockages (samskaras), evolve the quality of the
chakras at the same time. And of course, if you have the grace of the guru you are on the
express line.
