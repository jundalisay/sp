Introduction

This section is a compilation of various pieces of research that have been collected
and correlated at the IYFM Research Coordinating Center at Munger, Bihar, India. Over
the last few years, under the guidance of our guru, Swami Satyananda Saraswati, we have
seen time and again that the words and teachings of many of the yogis, saints and sages
from all ages have been recently verified by modern science. It has been our function to
fit together the bits and pieces of researches and to point out:

1. the overlap between what modern science and yogis have been saying,
2. how the various pieces fit together to give us an expanded concept of man,
3. what directions research can take in order to design and analyze research in the
light of yogic psychophysiology.

One of the great traps in attempting to research yoga is to design experiments without
a thorough knowledge of yoga itself. This is like looking at only a small part of the
whole, just as the six blind "wise" men who each examined a different part of an elephant
and pronounced their judgements based on these limitations, could never understand the
whole elephant and how it looked. Yogic training requires many years and the skilled
guidance of a master to discover its basic principles, its mode of application, and to
prepare oneself for the experiences which arise from this training.


## The totality of man

Perhaps the outstanding feature of yoga is its ability to give us a more total picture of
who we are, to put the various elements into a simpler and at the same time more
sophisticated and more expanded perspective. Yoga also teaches us that within us all
there is a vital power, a basic essence, whose thread can be seen running through all of
life, unmeasurable by even the most sophisticated machines, but palpable and motivating
our living, breathing, thinking, body and mind. We can see its effects and measure the
various forms and changes of this subtle energy as it enters and interacts with the
physical domain, in the nerves, in the chemical and intracellular processes and in the
flows and pressures of the body. However, the energy itself is still undefined
scientifically.

Through yogic sadhana we can experience the subtle energy which underlies all
matter, called prana or kundalini. This is a transformative experience which makes the
subtle more tangible and real than the material and so-called solid, physical universe. It
shifts our perspective, broadens our awareness and awakens our consciousness, our
higher and greater self. It awakens us to the fact that within us is an immortal and eternal
essence, full of knowledge, bliss and truth.

The very fact that such an experience exists alters our direction and purpose. We see
that we are here not only for sensual and mundane satisfaction, but for a higher and
greater destiny. This ultimate goal of yoga must always be remembered when we are
researching yoga, for we know that yoga can give us relaxation, alter our brain waves and
hormonal secretions, endow us with health, induce concentration and better memory, help
us to develop better human interrelationships and to enjoy everything we do, to have fun
and fulfil ourselves in a balanced healthy way. However, we must see that these things,
though they are all worthy and good in themselves, are not the ultimate goal of yoga, but
are side-effects of our pursuit of higher awareness and deeper knowJedge of the truth of
our existence. To pursue these things in themselves is another trap, a trick of the mind.
For they do not exist by themselves but are the outcome of a complete process of living.
The yogic process of total development of body, mind and spirit, ida, pingala and
sushumna, is the most systematic way to attain these things and more.
Yoga is not a science of healing and does not need to look into the negative side of
existence. The teachings tell us to practise and emphasize the good, positive and healthy
in us and automatically we will be healthy and happy. There is nothing difficult to
understand in this. If we emphasize exercise, moderation, good lifestyle, relaxation,
meditation and self-discipline, then we are sure to achieve something worthwhile in life.
Research into relaxation, meditation, asana and pranayama, continue to demonstrate that
yoga exerts real changes in the body and mind, that it can only be a worthwhile addition
to our lives if performed under guidance and done correctly. However, we must
remember that it is much more than that, and that all our achievements are ultimately, and
in the last analysis, useless if we do not transform the quality of our awareness.
Yoga tells us to awaken our minds, to develop the energy within ourselves so that we
can attain a much greater, fuller and more total existence. Evidence is piling up to show
that there is a psychic side to our lives, that the mental and intangible is far from
imaginary, but is powered by an energy, a subtle force which can be tapped and
developed and which can totally change and transform the more physical side of our
lives. There is also evidence that awareness and consciousness can be independent from
the body and this is coming from studies into physics and the nature of energy in our
universe.

Purpose of this section

In this section we arc more concerned with delineating the research into energy than
into consciousness. We are concerned with the research into kundalini rather than with
the awareness side of things. We must take it for granted that awareness exists. Research
into the energy side of yoga shows us that there is a physically based energy in the body
which also has a psychic dimension. This fits the yogic description of prana, whose
ultimate and maximum form is that of kundalini.

Many times we have been amazed to hear the stories of yogis and saints and have
been awed by reading the ancient and universal teachings of yoga, to realize that they are
applicable even today. Often we have wondered how yogis developed this science in the
first place. Obviously it has come from a profound and unusual experience, beyond the
capacity of normal man to achieve or even understand without yoga practice.
Swamiji is one of those who has reached transcendental heights and come back to tell
us about kundalini in scientific terms. Many times Swamiji has spoken about the
kundalini phenomenon and has laid down the fundamentals of kundalini yoga in a
succinct, precise, profound and yet easily understandable and systematic manner, as has
been done in this book. In the past few years he has told us many things about the
functions of the body, for example, that the right nostril connects to the left brain, and the
left nostril to the right brain, which have been beyond our understanding at first and
which have only recently, in 1983, been verified by researchers at the Salk Institute in
America (see chapter entitled "Controlling the Nadis and the Brain"). Through his own
internal experiences he has seen that most of us do net use our potential and that within
the brain there are unused areas of potential energy, psychic awareness and total
knowledge. It is actually possible to experience the brain from inside. The source is
within us, however, we have not connected the various centers and circuits to the main
switches and the main generator. The way to do this, Swamiji tells us, is through
kundalini yoga.
Often Swamiji has referred to the works of researchers as a means of validating and
expressing the kundalini experience in easily understandable scientific terms and to show
that there are many people working on this most important aspect of life. Many of their
researches are outlined here in simple terms. These researches represent pioneering
efforts to delineate the broader function of man. No doubt, in the future, new machines
and methods will have to be developed, for we are seeing only the bare beginnings of
yogic research at this time. However, the efforts of these researchers will be remembered
and will set the course for more sophisticated, scientifically acceptable research.
One thing is sure, science and yoga have been running parallel and in the same
direction and are now beginning to converge towards a meeting point which promises to
transform society. The concept of kundalini and the higher sciences is becoming more
widely known and respected and more and more people are taking up its practice. This
book and this section are an offering to help you to see kundalini in a more total and
easily understood manner, to give researchers guidelines and perspective, and to help you
achieve kundalini as a reality in your own life.
