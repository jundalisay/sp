Kundalini is a transcendental phenomena, one which lies outside of time and space.

We cannot understand how powerful the experience of kundalini awakening really is, but
we can see its effects on our lives and the effect that awakening has had in terms of
changes and functioning of society and various cultures. For example, the effect of
kundalini awakening is said by many researchers and yogis to be at the basis of the
experiences had by Christ, Buddha, Krishna, Rama and other great religious and spiritual
figures from history.

While researchers continue to scientifically probe the phenomena itself, its
components, its related events and ramifications and its ability to affect machines,
another type of researcher is examining the phenomena in its social setting and
anthropologically. As a universal phenomena we can see kundalini everywhere, in every
culture and at all times. John White states:
"Although the word kundalini comes from the yogic tradition nearly all the world's
major religions, spiritual paths and genuine occult traditions see something akin to the
kundalini experience as having significance in divinizing a person. The word itself may
not appear in the traditions, but the concept is there nevertheless, wearing a different
name yet recognizable as a key to attaining a God-like stature." (1)


## Altered states

Kundalini induces an altered state of consciousness (ASC), that is, it takes us to
realms of inner experience beyond those normally accessible to modern man. Arnold M.
Ludwig writes, "Beneath man's thin veneer of consciousness lies a relatively uncharted
realm of mental activity, the nature and function of which have been neither
systematically explored or adequately conceptualized." (2)
Ludwig and other ASC researchers cite daydreaming, sleep and dreams, hypnosis,
sensory deprivation, psychosis, hysterical states of dissociation and depersonalization,
pharmacologically induced mental aberrations, sleeplessness, fasting and meditation as
examples of ASCs. Anything can induce an ASC, any place or event can trigger a change
in consciousness, however, usually we have to manoeuvre ourselves or use some agent to
bypass the so-called "normal" functioning of the brain. We can say that our normal state
of consciousness is the one in which we spend most of our waking lives.
There are many people, however, who believe that the state of consciousness most
people exist in is very limited and fixed, itself a retarded, degenerate and unhealthy state
which induces fear of change, neurosis and disease. In terms of our inner experiences we
are like retarded dwarfs, like the flea kept under a glass who, after hitting its head on
the glass a number of times, ceases to jump hundreds of times its own height but rather,
even when the glass is removed, continues to hop at a reduced capacity far below its
innate potential. Yogis claim that we are like the flea, pathetic shadows of our former
selves and far less than our potential, confined by vague fears and illusions, ghosts
and memories in the mind. We are much more than we think we are.
The kundaiini experience is at the peak of human evolution. It is the absolute and final
state attainable by man, the experience in which he realises and merges with his pristine
glory; the ultimate ASC. All other experiences fall short of this and are mere stepping-
stones on the way, making up the repertoire of our lesser human lives. The real yogi or
swami is the master of all realms of consciousness and can move into and out of any state
he wants at will, depending on the degree of his skill and mastery. Various cultures have
developed ways and means to attain these different realms of consciousness, each varying
in its capacity to do so.

According to Erica Bourguignon, an anthropologist at Ohio State University, 90% of
human societies practise some kind of institutionalized ritual to achieve altered states of
consciousness. (3) For example, there is the solitary-vision quest of Sioux warriors, the
hallucinogen-powered flights of South American shaman, the dream oracles of the Senoi
people of Malaysia, the tribal dances of the Samo people of New Guinea, and the
whirling dances of the Sufi dervish, to name but a few of the better known societies.
In the west we use alcohol and drugs, revival meetings, rock concerts and
discotheques with their mind and logic numbing, trance-inducing, mega-decibel music
and "tribal" dance. Are we so far from "primitive" societies? Bourguignon wonders. "The
fact that they are nearly universal must mean that such states are very important to human
beings." The need for attaining higher states of consciousness seems to be as basic as
the need for eating or sleeping.

Somehow we have forgotten at our conscious, normal level of consciousness, that we
have immense potential and that we can achieve bliss, knowledge and inner experiences
which are more satisfying than the monotonous, humdrum existence we lead at present.
Somewhere in our subconscious minds, at another level of consciousness, we know that
something is missing and this knowledge nags at us. We want to get away from it all, to
have a holiday (from the root for Holy day). From this there arises an instinctive and
irrepressible urge and drive to fulfil ourselves and to attain higher and better states and
experiences, though we may often fail to achieve them or real inner satisfaction. The
alcohol ritual is one example of a self-defeating and destructive attempt to achieve true
joy and inner bliss.

It appears that our methods are incorrect for attaining inner fulfillment, satisfaction
and security. We have lost the keys and can no longer gain access to the higher and
transcendental. We have been thrown out of the garden of Eden. It is for this reason that
so many people have turned to yoga, meditation and the transcendental sciences for the
means and techniques to enlarge their repertoire of experience and to attain insight into
themselves and reality.


## Kundalini, a universal phenomenon

Reports have come from all over the world indicating that there is a
psychophysiological phenomenon which exists outside of the barriers of social, cultural,
religious, geographical and temporal boundaries and which resembles the phenomenon
called kundalini by the yogis and sages of India.
In Northwest Botswana, Africa, the !Kung people of the Kalahari desert dance for
many hours to heat up the n|um so that the !kia state can be obtained. This state of
transcendence resembles that in many yogic texts on kundalini in which states of
consciousness beyond the ordinary and participation in eternity are described. One
tribesman reports that, "You dance, dance, dance, dance. Then the n|um lifts you in your
belly and lifts you in your back, and then you start to shiver... it's hot. Your eyes are open
but you don't look around; you hold your eyes still and look straight ahead. But when you
get into !kia you're looking around because you see everything..." (4)
Judith Cooper writes about the !Kung: "In one of the darker corners of the Dark
Continent the !Kung people of the Kalahari keep in touch with the gods. Two or three
nights a week the men dance around a fire, graceful as leopards, to the sonorous drone of
the women's chants. Soon the mood turns solemn, and the night air swells with unseen
presences. Sweat rolls down the dancers' bodies like sweet rain, as the n|um, the healing
power, starts to boil. The moment of transcendence is painful. When the inner fire shoots
from their bellies up their spines, the dancers shiver and tremble, fall to the ground or go
rigid as stone. Some of them dance into the fire and out again, perfect as gods, their feet
unburned. They can see into the essence of things now, even into the insides of other
people, where malignant ghosts feed on diseased livers or prevent the conception of sons.
Laying their healing hands on the sick, they bid the n|um to drive out the forces of
darkness." (5)

In the Chinese Taoist tradition it is said that when prana or chi, the vital principle, has
accumulated in the lower belly, it bursts out and begins to flow in the main psychic
channels causing involuntary movements and sensations such as pain, itching, coldness,
warmth, weightlessness, heaviness, roughness, smoothness, internal lights and sound and
the feeling of inner movement. It may cause the body to brighten and even illuminate a
dark room. Yin Shih Tsu reported that he felt heat travel from the base of the spine to the
top of the head and then down over his face and throat to his stomach. (6)
These kinds of reports tally exactly with the experiences of yogis who describe
kundalini as travelling up the spine with heat and light or with the surging energy of a
snake preparing to strike. A classical description of kundalini from the yogic tradition
comes from Swami Narayananda:

"There is a burning up the back and over the whole body. Kundalini's entrance into
sushumna occurs with pain in the back... One feels a creeping sensation from the toes and
sometimes it shakes the whole body. The rising is felt like that of an ant creeping up
slowly over the body towards the head. Its ascent is felt like the wiggling of a snake or a
bird hopping from place to place." (7) This also sounds very much like the description of
the so-called "primitive" people of the !Kung tribe in the Kalahari desert in Africa.
In medieval Spain, St. Theresa of Avila described her experience, which yogis call the
awakening of nada, the manifestation of transcendental consciousness as sound. "The
noises in my head are so loud that I am beginning to wonder what is going on in it... My
head sounds just as if it were full of brimming rivers... and a host of little birds seem to be
whistling, not in the ears, but in the upper part of the head, where the higher part of the
soul is said to be; I have held this view for a long time, for the spirit seems to move
upward with great velocity." (8)


## Conclusion

All of the above are classical kundalini type experiences, but they have occurred in different geographical locations and different times in history, because kundalini is not dependent on time and space. However, few cultures have documented the kundalini experience so well or consistently as the sages in India. The Indian culture seems to have been ripe to allow the yogic sciences to be preserved, cultivated and revered. As a result, a sublime philosophy has emerged and has been recorded in many books, a few of which have come down to us through the ravages of time and history. Books such as the Bhagavad Gita, the yogic texts such as Yoga Vashishta and Hatha Toga Pradipika, and the sublime beauty of the books of the Upanishads and Vedanta, which have inspired many of the great men and women of history from all over the world, are testaments to the existence of a once great culture. Sophisticated maps of consciousness, charts to allow us to enter the sublime bliss of altered states of consciousness and meditative experience, myriad techniques and processes and untold words and books for guidance have emerged and have been handed down over thousands of years. Nowhere else has the kundalini experience been so well, richly or scientifically recorded in all its sublimity and variation.

Swami Vivekananda sums up the whole question of kundalini as a universal
phenomena when he states, "When by the power of long internal meditation, the vast
mass of energy stored up, travels along the sushumna and strikes the chakras, the reaction
is immensely more intense than any reaction of sense perception. Wherever there was any
manifestation of what is ordinarily called supernatural power or wisdom, there a little
current of kundalini must have found its way into the sushumna."
We see then that an experience exists which is one but which has had a vast impact on
society and culture wherever it has occurred. The experience is one but the names are
many. Yogis call this the awakening of Shakti or kundalini and have developed a vast,
intricate, systematic and progressive science by which they can awaken this power which
lies dormant in each of us and one which can evolve ourselves and society to new and
undreamed of heights of experience and achievement.
