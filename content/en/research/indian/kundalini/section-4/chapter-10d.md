Swami Shankardevananda: What about physical disease associated with mooladhara
chakra problems? We have already talked about constipation; this of course brings about
things like hemorrhoids.

Swami Vivekananda: There are a lot of other types of constipation involved too - of
energy, emotions, of information - yes, all inherent in mooladhara chakra as hoarding of
any type.

Swami Gaurishankar: What about disease ?

Swami Vivekananda: Statistics involved in diseases in this area also tend to relate to
the manipura and anahata areas, and the diseases of hypertension, heart problems, peptic
ulcers and all that sort of thing. I would assume all sorts of diseases of the lower
excretory and reproductive organs are associated with a malfunctioning mooladhara.

Swami Shankardevananda: Cancer?

Swami Vivekananda: Yes, of the rectum and bladder.

Swami Shankardevananda: The helplessness associated with it too?

Swami Vivekananda: I don't know if it is all cancers we are talking about now. I don't
know if they would be segmental or what. Hypertension, for instance, appears to be a
generalized condition. It is mainly related to the manipura chakra circuits. Cancer may
well be a generalized condition that is related to one of the chakras, perhaps mooladhara.

Swami Paramananda: How far can you take the relationship between the chakras and
the physical organs like the heart? If the heart is not functioning well and it affects the
anahata chakra which is love, can that also mean that there is a lack of love going through
that person and physically it comes out in anahata chakra and the heart as disease?

Swami Vivekananda: Yes, it can be in both. If a person has a need for love coming
from outside and it is not coming, and/or that person has imbalanced constructions of
love, then anahata problems can arise in the form of cardiac problems such as angina,
palpitations, etc.

Swami Paramananda: Do you think that applies to all the chakras? If you find a
particular organ not functioning in a sick person, does it mean there is a deficiency of the
qualities of the chakra related to that part of the body?
Swami Vivekananda: As a general rule, yes, but you can get other problems as well.
For instance, you can get an activation of manipura chakra, which activates the
sympathetic nervous system which produces restriction of the coronary artery.
There is interreaction between the different chakras, and this is the beauty of a well
taught yoga class - it balances all these qualities, and balance is the key to the whole
thing. Rather than trying to work on one area, which is a more specific medical style,
yoga therapy works on the whole human structure.
Swami Muktibodhananda: How do the physical organs relate to the chakras and
spiritual evolution?
Swami Vivekananda: Consider hysterectomy. Let us assume the wrong woman is
wheeled into the operating theater and she has a hysterectomy. This will then cut off the
end organ for a lot of nerve fibers and the atrophy will run up the nerves and eliminate
the brain centers involved in that. That is an example of a deficiency in the organ
producing changes in the centers involved, the circuit. Does that make it any more
difficult for her to realize higher aspects of swadhisthana chakra?
Swami Shankardevananda: Depends how much of the centers is lost. If she just loses
the uterus and not the ovaries, for example, all the hormonal secretions will be
maintained. Anyway, after the age of forty most women have a natural hysterectomy.
Swami Vivekananda: Yes, but they don't lose the nerve endings. When the uterus is
removed, because the nerve endings are useless, they atrophy. Does this affect the
associated chakras?
Swami Nischalananda: Swamiji says it does not make any difference if there is a
vasectomy, because it is only the physical body. I think, as regards swadhisthana for
example, that if they are already on the spiritual path and have developed some psychic
awareness, then that operation would definitely not affect them much, if at all. If they had
no background of yogic practice, then probably the destruction of that organ would
slightly hamper progress, because initially you depend upon those organs to stimulate
something, especially in the practices of hatha and kriya yoga. If you follow the path of
bhakti or gyana yoga, of course, it makes no difference.
Swami Shankardevananda: If you lose one center or two centers physically I think it
does not hinder you because a lot of other centers are left. There are tons of potential left
within the brain.
Swami Vivekananda: To sum up, we function on physical, emotional, mental, psychic
and spiritual levels. The chakras span all these levels. The purpose of yoga and tantra is
to stimulate the chakras at all these levels. Then, and only then, can we become healthy
human beings.
