Kundalini yoga teaches us techniques to influence our nervous system and mind so as
to bring about total balance and reintegration at every level of our being. It is an
expanded concept of man, a method of developing creative awareness and, more than
this, of putting the knowledge gained to use via a system of experiential techniques. It
helps us to develop a new outlook on life and ourselves. The chakras and their interaction
within the totality of our personality, stretched between ida and pingala, balanced in
sushumna, open up new dimensions for our mind and understanding to explore and
develop.

The techniques of kundalini involve kriyas, combinations of asana, pranayama,
mudra and bandha, rotation of breath and consciousness through psychic passages
and subtle spaces, repetition of mantra and the piercing of psychic centers in order to
heat up the psychic and physical energies of man and to activate and awaken the chakras
to our conscious level of experience and control. The techniques are also designed to
bring about balanced purification and activation of all the chakras, but with the gentle
accentuation of one or two important centers. Certain techniques, such as ajapa japa,
achieve this, creating a psychic friction which ignites the spark of higher consciousness.
When conditions for ignition reach the required temperature and pressure, energy is
liberated within the body and mind, transforming our total personality. This energy must
be real and actual; though perhaps as yet undefined and not qualified. It is measurable at
both the physical and psychic levels if we have the correct conditions, equipment and
understanding of the phenomena. In this regard, several researchers have begun to
pioneer exploration into the uncharted depths of the human psyche and are devising
techniques and equipment to assess, measure and scientifically prove the existence of the
chakras as the primary controlling points for different levels of our being.


## Measuring the chakras

One man who has helped to pioneer scientific research into yoga and the phenomena
of kundalini and chakras is Dr. Hiroshi Motoyama. He states, "Fascinated... I too began
physiological experiments about fifteen years ago to try to determine if chakras actually
exist and their relationship to the autonomic nervous system and internal organs...
Through various examinations we have been able to determine that there are significant
differences in the physiological function of the organ associated with the chakra that the
individual subjects claimed to have awakened. Therefore, this research has led to the
conclusion that chakras do, in fact, exist." (1)
In his search for the existence of chakras, Motoyama has developed his own
machinery. One of these is the 'chakra instrument' which is designed to detect the
electromagnetic field of the body and any changes which take place in it due to chakra
stimulation and activation. Looking like a telephone booth and enclosed in a light-proof,
lead-shielded room, the machine was designed to detect energy generated in the body and
then emitted from it in terms of various physical variables such as electrical, magnetic
and optical energy changes. Copper electrodes are positioned at the top and bottom of the
cage and a sliding, square panel with electrodes on all four sides (left, right, front, back),
is free to traverse up and down the frame structure so as to be positioned at any part of
the subject's body. An electromagnetic field is set up between the electrodes and any vital
energy ejected from the body affects this very sensitive field.

A copper electrode and a photo-electric cell are positioned 12 and 20 centimeters in
front of the subject, level with the classical position for a given chakra. The location is
monitored for changes as the individual concentrates his mental energy at the chakra
point, and measurements are made for 3 to 5 minutes before, during and after
concentration on the chakra. Because of its powerful pre-amplifier (impedance near
infinity), even the most subtle energy ejection can be picked up and recorded.
Information recorded is sent to various amplifiers, computerized analyzers and
oscilloscopes and is recorded on a highly sensitive chart recorder. Other equipment is
also used: to monitor respiration, autonomic nervous system (galvanic skin resistance),
changes in blood flow (plethysmograph), heart (electrocardiograph), subtle vibrations in
the skin (micro-tremor), so as to measure other effects of chakra stimulation on the body
and to make comparisons and interpretations.

Motoyama has used his equipment extensively to determine diseases in the body. (2)
In one case he measured a woman who was to have a uterine tumor removed a week
later. Measurements on his AMI machine (refer to the chapter entitled "Evidence for the
Existence of Nadis") showed imbalance in the related meridians. The pattern of energy
measured by the 'chakra instrument' in front of the uterus (swadhisthana chakra) was
much greater and quite different than normal. Motoyama's research indicates that there is
a definite correspondence between physical disease and disturbance in the energy of the chakra traditionally said by yogis to control that part of the physical body.

## Activity in the chakras

Motoyama has also measured chakra activity in normal subjects and recorded and
compared readings in subjects practising yoga versus untrained, control subjects. (3) ะะต
found that in an untrained subject concentrating on ajna chakra there was no change
recorded by the electrodes. The lines on the recording paper remained flat before, during
and after concentration.

A subject who had been practising stimulation of swadhisthana chakra for some time
showed a great deal of activation of that center, and much greater than in the control
subject who showed none at all. Large amplitude waves were seen before, during and
after concentration, indicating activation, however, there was no change during the period
for concentration, indicating lack of control over the center. This compares with another
subject who had been practising yoga for five years and who evidenced a marked rise in
electrical activity from ajna chakra but only during the time of concentration. The results
indicate that he had developed control over his ajna chakra.
'Chakra instrument' studies have been made with several yogis. (4) Dr. A.K. Tebecis,
a former professor of Canberra University, Australia, who had studied yoga throughout
Asia and who claims to have experienced astral projection due to the awakening of
kundalini, was tested on the 'chakra instrument'. Dr. Tebecis concentrates on anahata
chakra during meditation and also has a chronic digestive disorder. The AMI revealed
instability in the nadis involved in digestion, manipura chakra, and also in those related to
the swadhisthana area. When the 'chakra instrument' was used to measure manipura and
anahata, no change was found at manipura. Anahata concentration revealed considerable
intensification of energy during the period of concentration.
Two unusual findings have also been reported by Motoyama. In one case, not only did
the subject develop a more intense electrical reading during concentration on manipura,
but also had the subjective experience that psychic energy was being ejected from
manipura. During this time the positive electrical potential vanished, but only during the
time of her subjective sensation, and would reappear again as soon as the feeling of
emission vanished. Motoyama states:

"One might surmise that the psi energy generated a negative electrical potential which
neutralized the positive electrical charge. However, it is also possible to postulate the
creation of a new physical energy. In fact, it is my opinion that the psi energy emitted
from R.B.'s manipura chakra actually extinguished the surrounding physical energy. I
take this stand because the positive potential was precisely neutralized and because there
was never any appearance of a negative potential." (5)

The second case involves a subject who concentrated on anahata chakra. As the
subject relaxed, the chakra area was seen to be activated. She was then asked to
concentrate on the anahata area and it was arranged that any time she had the subjective
experience of psi energy emission she was to press a button which caused a mark to be
made on the chart. It was found that when this mark appeared the photoelectric cell
signalled the presence of a weak light being generated in the light-proof room. Her
chakra monitor also detected electrical energy of high potential and frequency.
Motoyama states that these findings imply that psychic energy working in anahata
chakra may be able to create energy in the physical dimension (light, electricity, etc.). It
appears that whatever energy is being produced in a developed and refined chakra circuit
is capable of extinguishing or creating energy in the physical dimension, which supports
the yogic view of chakras as transducers, converting psychic energy into physical
energy and back. Motoyama feels that if further research substantiates his findings, then
the Law of Conservation of Energy, as one of the basic foundation stones of modern
physics, will have to be revised.

The verification of an energy at the psychic plane which, though of unknown source
and substance, can influence matter, has been long claimed by yogis. It is also thought to
be the basis of healing and of all sciences in which mind is used to control matter. Yogis
even state that the world is a manifestation of mind, a view which is now being
supported more and more by physicists, especially those working with the subatomic
particles that make up all of matter and which lie midway between matter and pure
energy (prana).

Motoyama states, "I feel that the continuation of research into the nature of psi
energies, by many others as well as myself, will lead to considerable change in our views
of matter, of mind and body, of human beings, and of the world itself." (6)
