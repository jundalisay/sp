Objective evidence for the existence of the chakras also appears to have been found
by kinesiologist Valerie Hunt aad her associates at UCLA in America. (7) Assisted by
Rosalyn Bruyere, a psychic "aura reader", Hunt used a number of measurements in order
to study the body's field emission when it is being stimulated by deep muscle massage
(Rolfing). This was prompted by an earlier observation that after Rolfing and meditation
there was an increase in the electromyographic baseline.

Hunt and associates utilized electromyographic equipment (EMG) which measures
the steady, low voltage of muscular activity plus several other instruments. Electrodes
were attached to eight sites, including chakra locations such as the crown (sahasrara),
eyebrow center (ajna), throat (vishuddhi), heart (anahata), base of the spine and
acupuncture points on the foot and knee. The sites for the electrodes were in places where
muscle activity was minimal and, therefore, electrical readings would indicate energy
from a different source. The electrodes were placed on the body in consultation with the
"aura reader".

The individual being experimented on was given Rolfing (deep muscle massage),
designed to liberate deeper subconscious tension, and, therefore, theoretically able to
affect chakra activity. As the massage progressed the EMG readings were recorded on
one track of a two-tracked tape recorder. Simultaneously, while isolated in another room
and oblivious to the EMG and subject's reports, Bruyere recorded on the second track her
observations of psychic activity in terms of color change at the various centers. Hunt was
able to question the aura reader via a separate audio system so that no clue as to what the
subject was experiencing or what was going on at the EMG level could be detected by the
psychic.

At the same time the subject related his experience which was tape recorded using a
second microphone, and any similarity between his experience, the symptoms of chakra
activation and the EMG recording were noted.
It was quickly evident in the central monitoring room where Hunt was sitting, that the
EMG changes and the distinctive wave forms being recorded correlated with the colors
reported by the sensitive, as did the experience of the subject. Later analysis, whether by
wave form, Fourier-frequency analysis or sonogram, produced consistently the same
pattern of results.

Hunt acknowledged that the possible interpretations of this data are staggering. The
radiations were taken directly from the body surface, quantatively measured in a natural
state and were isolated by scientifically accepted data resolution procedures. The study
concluded that there had been direct correspondence in every instance throughout all
recordings between the distinctive wave form and the psychic's description of the color
err amanating from the chakra. For example, every time a medium-large, sharp deflection
with single or double peaks at the top occurred, the psychic reported the color blue, while
red corresponded to large, sharp clumps of regular and irregular spikes of short duration
interspersed with plateaux. Yellow was a broad, smooth wave resembling an uneven sine
wave.

The relationship between the emotional states and the colors was also accurate.
Emotions, imagery, interpersonal relations and the state of resiliency and plasticity of the
connective tissue are related to the color, and the state of the aura as seen by the psychic.
It is an interesting fact that in early Rolfing sessions the chakras appeared to be
uneven, small, low in frequency and amplitude and with indiscriminate or dark primary
colors. As the technique continued the chakras became large, even in size, and of lighter
color, while the wave forms were of higher amplitude and frequency. Some chakras
which had been closed, opened, producing kaleidoscopic color effects, such as dark blue,
yellow, red-orange and olive green. By the fifth hour of Rolfing all subjects had a clear
blue aura. By the seventh and eighth hours the colors were predominantly light and
blended, for example, peach, pink, ice blue and cream. Higher frequencies were
associated with pleasant experiences.
Developing our psyche
Hunt's research is important at several levels. It firstly supports the claims of yogis
and psychics that other levels of perception, more subtle and yet intimately connected
with the physical body, do in fact exist. Though it has been called extrasensory
perception it appears rather to be an extension of the normal range of perception of
physical events into the more subtle.
According to yogis, development of ajna chakra and the pineal/thalamic area of the
brain, plus relaxed concentration of mind, allows us to see things which most of us miss
because of gross physical and mental tensions and a dissipated, distracted state of mind.
There is nothing miraculous, abnormal or supernormal about psychic phenomena. Most
of us just do not look at things long enough to allow the subtle to register in our
brains. We see something and are immediately distracted, thinking that there is nothing
else to see or learn from a situation. But if we take our time we can learn, much more.
We know that vision is our major information processing system and therefore tied
into many other neurological systems. Defects in the visual system are now linked to
other problems such as allergies, anxiety, insomnia, postural problems, and a whole range
of physical and psychological problems. (8) Connecticut optometrist Albert Shankman is
quoted as saying "The skill of seeing relationships is a principal object of visual training.
Visual training is essentially brain training." (9) Shankman and others have observed that
visual flow and flexibility are associated with a more flexible, creative thought style.
Yoga follows the same principle, for example in trataka, an essential component of
kundalini yoga. Trataka teaches us to gaze at things without preconceptions and to allow
the information to impinge on our brains, to allow the connections time to come together
and the inner knowledge, the processed information within the brain, time to formulate
itself fully and rise up to the conscious plane. This is what yogis mean when they say that
yoga balances the external and the internal, the right and left sides of the brain, ida and
pingala, and awakens faculties that lie dormant within us all but which we do not know
exist and which we do not develop.

Psychic vision, a side-effect of kundalini yoga and part of the awakening of intuition,
inner vision and inner knowledge, is one of these capacities. All it means is that we are
relaxed and we take our time to look at things without preconception. Hunt's research
verifies that this faculty is not a myth and not confined just to yogis practising sadhana
for years in isolation in the Himalayas, but is also verifiable within the confines of a
laboratory.
Verifying the chakras
The work of Motoyama and Hunt points to the fact that within the physical body
there are locations which, though they may not have any obvious physical or structural
demarcation, have definite functional characteristics which differentiate from other parts
of the body. It verifies the fact that the yogic descriptions of these points correspond to
physical emanations in the case of Motoyama's research and psychic emanations in the
case of Hunt's research.
We see then that the chakra locations have both a physical component and a psychic
component. This scientific description fits the yogic definition of chakras as vortices of
energy, the interacting points of the most powerful psychic and physical forces which
control our total human existence. The studies also confirm that the traditional chakra
locations, when activated, are related to emanations of light and color, and to emotions
and experiences which are subtle and usually stored in the subconscious mind, beyond
our usual conscious capacity. When we concentrate and focus psychic energy, chitta
shakti, on the chakra, or if we manipulate the areas of the body under its control, by asana
or massage, for example, we can stimulate activity at both the physical and psychic levels
of that center.

What lies at the basis of these energy emanations at the neurological and mental
levels, how these forces interact to control our psychophysiology, behavior and
experience, still requires much more research. What we do know is that the concept of
chakras has a definite psychophysiological foundation, that they affect our body,
emotions and mind, and that they produce both physical and psychic energy which can be
measured and quantified. There is something within the body of man, which yogis called
chakra, awaiting our discovery and awakening.
