Without a guru you can practise any form of yoga, but not kundalini. This is an
extremely powerful system. Kundalini yoga does not start suddenly or with fits. You
don't have to make any substantial changes in your way of life, but you must begin to
practise. Do not start with advanced practices; for some time you should train and prepare
the physical body, then go to the mind and gradually explore the deeper levels. Before
commencing the practices which bring about the actual awakening of kundalini, you must
prepare yourself step by step on the physical, mental and emotional planes. If you are
patient and prepare correctly, awakening of kundalini will definitely take place.
Adequate preparation is necessary to ensure that one has the strength to bear the
impact of full awakening of the mighty potential force within. Most of us do not even
have control over our physical manifestations and behaviors. Supposing you were given a
sleep inducing injection, you would become drowsy whether you wanted to or not. This
is because you have no control over the processes and actions of your brain and you do
not know how to control sleep. Similarly, if you have a headache, you are unable to exert
control over it. When physical manifestations such as sleep and pain are not under your
control, what would happen if other manifestations began to occur in your brain? You
wouldn't be able to control them. Therefore, before kundalini awakens, it is important
that you are able to manage the mind.

If you can maintain a balanced mind in the face of mental and emotional conflicts and
you can endure anger, worry, love and passion, disappointment, jealousy, hatred,
memories of the past, sufferings and sorrows, you are ready for the awakening. If you can
still feel joy when the scales are heavily loaded against you, you are an aspirant for
kundalini yoga. Before you bring into use a generator of five megawatts, you must have a
factory ready to utilize the energy. In the same way, before you awaken kundalini shakti,
you must be able to merge yourself with the higher spirit and you must know how to
utilize the creative energy of kundalini.

Therefore, if you want to follow the path of kundalini yoga, it is absolutely essential
to have a guru with whom you feel intimate. Many people say the guru is within, but are
they able to communicate with him, understand him and follow his intricate instructions?
If so, it is possible to proceed with this internal guidance, but few people have such a
relationship with the inner guru. They need an external guru first. He will connect them
with the inner guru. If you have a guru he will help you to prepare for kundalini
awakening, he will be there if you need any advice and he will guide you through the
crisis of awakening.

Usually, because we are religious minded people, our relationship with guru is based
on a sort of formality. To us he is worshipful, respectable, superior and supreme, but at
the time of awakening, all these attitudes to guru must be set aside. At this time you must
evolve a more intimate attitude, as if your relationship was based on love, not merely
devotion and worship. When you serve your mother you do so with an attitude of love,
not respect and veneration. With this same attitude you should serve the guru, then his
direct influence is upon you. Then, if there is excitement in any chakra, the relationship
with guru will balance it.

The relationship between guru and disciple is the most intimate of relationships; it is
neither a religious nor a legal relationship. Guru and disciple live like an object and its
shadow. The guru is the best thing in spiritual life, and if you have a guru you are very
fortunate. However, it is sometimes difficult to find a guru. If you haven't a guru, you can
cultivate a mental picture of him, try to feel his guidance and continue practising
faithfully. You will surely succeed.

The time factor

Preparation is not the job of one lifetime. Man strives spiritually life after life. In fact,
this body is given to you only for that purpose. For eating, sleeping and sexual interaction
a human body is not necessary, so in our lower stages of evolution we had an animal
body. However, even with this human body, we still have animal in us, so these natural
urges follow us. Let them, but remember, this body is not for their fulfillment alone. In
this human body the consciousness is the most important point. Man is aware of his
awareness and he does not only think, he knows that he thinks. The evolution of his
awareness has been going on life after life. And what you have been practising for your
spiritual life in the last five to ten years is in addition to what you have already done.
Supposing your children are studying in primary school and you are transferred to
another city. Where will your children begin their education in the new city? Right from
the beginning? No, from the point where they left their studies. The same thing happens
in reincarnation. That is why, even though you may have brothers and sisters born of the
same mother and father, they will be different from you. In your previous incarnation
your preferences were different from theirs. May be after a few incarnations they may
come to the point where you are now. So we can't say how long preparation takes,
because this life is one of those milestones and you have left behind many, many milestones.

However, if you are eager to awaken kundalini and the chakras, you should not be in
a hurry. Set apart twelve years of your life for this purpose. This is not to say that the
awakening cannot be brought about within one, two or three years - it can be. Total
awakening can even take place in a month, or the guru can give you awakening in one
day, but you will be unable to hold and sustain the awakening. When one is in possession
of a weak mind which cannot sustain even a little bit of cheerfulness or excitement, or
bear the death of a spouse or separation from a loved one, how can he sustain the
tremendous force of an awakened kundalini? Therefore, the twelve years are not for the
actual awakening, but for preparation so you can hold and sustain the awakening.
Where to begin

The practices of kundalini yoga are intended to create the awareness, not necessarily
to awaken kundalini. First of all we have to decide whether kundalini is already
awakened. It may already be on the way and you are opening the garage and there is no
car because it is already on the highway. When you go to satsang, do some kirtan or lead
a yogic lifestyle, you begin to have experiences and you realize something is happening
to you. Then, when you discuss kundalini and the chakras with a guru you start to
understand.

The practices that you do develop your awareness and help you to remember your
connection with your past evolution. They remove the veil which separates this current
incarnation from the previous one. I'll give you a very gross example.
There was a boy who was the only son of a very rich man. The boy went crazy and
was sent to a mental hospital. He ran away and used to go from house to house begging
for food. He did not know that his parents had died and he had inherited a large estate,
cars and shops and a lot of money in fixed deposits. One day his uncle found him and had
him treated properly. The boy recovered from his mental illness and remembered
everything about his heritage. Similarly, there is a process of remembering, and when it
takes place, you know exactly where you stand.
So, practices are necessary to remove the veil in front of the consciousness which
separates the two lives. Once you know that your kundalini is already in the process of
transition, then practices are of no real use. If you are practising, it is because you are
forced to, and if you are not practising, it is because you are forced not to. During the
period of transition of kundalini the practices are not useless, but your efforts to practise
them are of no use. However, if there is no awakening, if kundalini is in mooladhara or
swadhisthana or in between the two, then that's the time for the practices which are
enjoined in the books.
It is very important that you awaken sushumna before kundalini. This essential point
has not been stressed clearly in any books, but Swami Sivananda hinted at it in his
writings. If sushumna is not opened, where will the shakti go ? It will pass through either
ida or pingala and complications will arise.
You must also undergo purification of the tattwas or elements and purification of the
chakras and nadis. Otherwise, when kundalini awakens there will be a traffic jam.
Asanas, pranayama and the hatha yoga shatkarmas provide the best means of purification.
Surya namaskara and surya bheda pranayama purify pindala nadi and the shatkarmas and
pranayama will purify and awaken sushumna. There are specific asanas that are very
important for purifying the nadis and inducing a mild awakening in the chakras. So, start
with purification of the tattwas by the hatha yoga cleansing techniques. Take up asanas
next and then pranayama. Later you can practice mudras and bandhas and then begin
kriya yoga.

Awakening before preparation

If experience commence before you are properly prepared, you should immediately
start to prepare yourself. The first thing to do is start fasting or switch to a light diet. You
should also live quietly and avoid social interactions, reading books and magazines. Of
course, during this period you must not take any drugs or medicines and you must guard
against introducing any chemicals into the body.
If you minimize your interactions with the world outside, the experiences will
subside after five or six days and you can resume your normal life. You should then start
searching for someone who can give you further guidance.

Proceed to an ashram

When you know that kundalini is arousing, as soon as you can, you should retire to a
congenial place. As far as I know, the only congenial place is an ashram, where you can
be with a guru and like-minded people. An ashram is a community where the inmates
have plenty of work, no attachments, no hatred or prejudices, a simple life, little to eat, no
comforts nor luxuries, only the bare essentials. There are no social expectations and
pressures in an ashram, there's no fashion, no show and no useless conversations and
gossip. People don't interfere with each other.

If you live in an ashram the awakening of kundalini can be streamlined and if a
mental crisis occurs, you are free to experience whatever happens. If you don't want to
eat, it's o'key; if you can't sleep and you just want to sit, it's alright; if you have emotional
problems or no emotions at all, people will understand and leave you alone.
If you stay with your family during the crisis period, they may send you off to a
mental hospital. If you don't feel like eating they'll say, 'Not eating today?' And when
they see you haven't eaten for a few days, they'll say, 'Something is wrong with him', and
they'll try to get you to see a doctor. Or of you are married, when your behaviour seems a
little strange, your partner might be ready to divorce you. So it is much better to get out
of these places. That is why there are so many monasteries and ashrams all over the
world.

What to practise in the ashram

In the ashram you should practise purification of the physical body through the
shatkarmas, to balance the acid, wind and mucus in the body. Physical and mental
purification will also take place on account of the pure and simple ashram diet. The
physical body must be kept very, very light and made sattvic and entirely free of toxins.
If you are a bhakta by temperament, spend your time in prayer, kirtan or bhajan. If
you are an intellectual, then read books, talk minimum, practise hatha yoga and fast from
time to time. If you are a very active person, work hard and dedicate yourself to karma
yoga.

It is also necessary to perfect the sitting posture, as you must be able to sit
comfortably in one of the three postures: siddhasana/siddha yoni asana, padmasana or
vajrasana. The best and most powerful of these is siddhasana/siddha yoni asana.
Some people think they should practise a lot of meditation or pranayama when
kundalini is ascending so it will go straight to sushumna. However, I don't think
meditation is necessary anymore, because when kundalini is in the process of transition,
you can do nothing with your mind. If it is quiet, it is quiet, nothing can disturb it. If your
mind is agitated, you can do nothing about it because that is the effect of the awakening
of kundalini. It is not the effect of your practice.

The movement of consciousness during the transition of kundalini is spontaneous,
whether it is depression, a state of trance, an experience or visions a feeling or sensation
in the body; you can't alter any of them. They will continue because they are forced on
you, they are evolving in you because you are passing through that stage. But if you live
in the non-agitating ashram environment and partake of ashram food and share in the
karma yoga, there will not be disturbances in your experiences.
Regarding pranayama or kriyas, when the experience is moving onwards, pranayama
happens by itself, you don't have to think what to do. Sometimes kevala kumbhaka takes
place, or you automatically begin to practise bhastrika or ujjayi. Moola bandha or vajroli
happen by themselves, or you begin to do asanas spontaneously. So you don't have to
worry, just follow the flow of experience and take care of your environment and food,
and make sure nobody disturbs you.

The role of karma yoga

Karma yoga is a very important part of spiritual life. Even if you practise austerity or
mantra, use herbs, practise pranayama, undergo tantric initiation or get shaktipat, or are
born with awakened kundalini, if you do not follow the path of karma yoga, your
evolution will definitely be retarded at some point.

If you have a good, strong automobile but the road is bumpy and covered in rocks,
pebbles and marsh, try to accelerate and see what happens. It is very important that the
mind is prepared and the personality is rendered ready. Samskaras, positive and negative,
must be exhausted, awareness must be extended to every level, dedication or consecration
must be perfected, your attachments, illusions and infatuations must be spotted,
scrutinized and analyzed. All that is not possible without doing karma yoga.
Karma yoga is not directly responsible for the awakening of kundalini, but without its
practice, kundalini cannot budge even one centimeter. Therefore, you can understand
how important karma yoga is in the life of a disciple. You must read a lot about karma
yoga in the Bhagavad Gita. Perhaps that is the only philosophical and yogic explanation
of karma yoga.

The need of discipline

Some people who have awakened kundalini look quite abnormal, and they behave in a peculiar way. They are very disorganized, unsystematic and totally confused, and you
can't understand what they are doing. Therefore, in yoga you are advised to discipline
yourself right from the beginning, so that when kundalini wakes up you remain
disciplined. Otherwise you might go out to the street and just lie down there in a heap.
Sometimes I used to feel like this. When I was living in Rishikesh with my guru, I
decided to visit the Ganga each morning and cross it five times, swimming through the
icy cold water. One day Swami Sivananda called me and said: "Are you going to
continue your swimming or am I going to put you out of this ashram?" This brought me
back to my senses.
Life has to be disciplined, so that when kundalini awakens you can remain
unconfused. You have to go to the office, bank, shops, and drive a car as well. Everybody
cannot become a swami or stay in an ashram.

Specific recommendations

If the awakening of kundalini takes place through birth, pranayama, tantric initiation
or shaktipat, you don't have to know anything. In these situations everything is beyond
control; whether things go right or wrong; you are helpless. But when awakening takes
place through the other methods, there are certain steps to take.
Except in tantric initiation, the sexual obligations have to be kept at bay. Food should
be minimum, light and pure. One must have a guru and seek his guidance. Isolation from
people is also very important.
Often when kundalini awakens in a person, he develops some sort of power. Some
aspirants can materialize things, see clairvoyantly, hear clairaudiently Or read the minds
of others. And when you are amongst many people, it becomes a great temptation to
exercise these powers. This can be dangerous. Whereas some people will not care if you
can read their mind, others will feel it is a great impingement on their privacy and they
may even want to shoot you. You see, people get scared at the exhibition of siddhis, so if
you are facing any psychic manifestations, you will have to control them by force.
You know the great Tibeten yogi, Milarepa? He learned certain forms of magic and
when he developed powers, he took revenge on his uncle and relatives. He created
hailstorms that destroyed crops, huts and even lives, because he was then an ordinary
man with love and hatred, friends and enemies. As long as you have likes and dislikes,
you must not know what psychic powers you have. Milarepa had to perform penance for
his misdeeds and suffer a lot at the hands of his guru.
Awakening by mantra and the need for seclusion
When awakening takes place by mantra, you will have to adjust your diet and retire
from sexual obligations, not permanently, just for a while. From time to time it is also
beneficial if you enter total seclusion. Twice a year is sufficient. In the beginning, start
with one complete day. Then increase to three days, and when you are used to it, extend
to a maximum period of nine days. It is preferable if you practise seclusion when it is
neither too hot nor too cold.
During your first day of seclusion, observe silence and take only very light food and
very little. Do not meditate or try to concentrate. From morning until evening, with a few
breaks here and there, only practise your mantra on a mala. Don't do it with exertion or
strain, and if you become introverted, stop it. Maintain your mental concept with the
external experiences; do not aspire for an introverted meditative state. If introversion
forces itself, keep your eyes open. Practise this for twelve hours, but not in one stretch.
And for the last hour you must sit in meditation.
Next time you enter seclusion, go for three to nine days. During this period, devote as
much time as possible to the repetition, resolution and reflection of the mantra. On the
last day, at the end of the process, sit quietly for one hour of meditation.
Seclusion is actually recommended for all who are undergoing awakening of
kundalini. At that time it is best to retire from active life and family environments for at
least 45 days. Unless you are in semi-seclusion from the world at the time of awakening,
as well as having strange experiences and hallucinations, you may have peculiar doubts,
fears, anger and strong passions.

Sadhus live in seclusion because when there are interactions with people, so many
thought currents move in the mind. Mixing with people, talking and gossiping create
crosscurrents of love, hatred, infatuation, likes and dislikes, restlessness, worry and
anxiety, desires and passions. Therefore, if you are practising a lot of sadhana or you are
facing the awakening of kundalini, do not have very much interaction with people. Then
you will be spared a lot of mental turmoil.
