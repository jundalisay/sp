According to the tantras, kundalini can be awakened by various methods which can
be practiced individually or in combination. However, the first method cannot be
practiced, because it is awakening by birth. Of course, it is too late for most of us to take
advantage of this particular method, but some of us may be instrumental in producing
children who have awakened kundalinis.

Awakening by birth

By a favourable birth, if your parents were highly evolved, you can have an
awakened kundalion. It is also possible to be born with an awakened sushumna, ida or
pingala nadi. This means that from the time of birth your higher faculties will be
operating either partially or fully. If a child comes with partial awakening, he is called a
saint, and if he comes with full illumination, he is known as an incarnation, avatara or son
of God.

If one is born with an awakened kundalini, his experiences are very much under
control. They take place in him right from the beginning in a natural way, so he never
feels that something extraordinary is happening to him. A child with an awakened
kundalini has clarity of vision, a high quality of thinking and a sublime philosophy. His
attitude of life is somewhat unusual as he has total detachment. To him, his parents were
only his means of creation, and therefore he is unable to accept the normal social
relationship with them. Although he may live with them, he feels as if he were just a
guest. Such a child exhibits a very matured behaviour and he does not react emotionally
with anything in life. As he grows he becomes aware of his mission and purpose in life.
Many of us may wish to give birth to a yogi or an enlightened child but it is not such
a simple matter. Every marriage or union of parents cannot produce a yogi, even if the
man and woman practice yoga morning and night. It is only under certain circumstances
that a higher being can be produced. In order to usher a highly evolved soul into this
world, one has first to transform one's gross desires into spiritual aspirations.
It is very difficult to convince people of the west that a child can be born in an
enlightened state, because they have the moral attitudes of a particular religion deeply
ingrained in their minds and their faith. For them, the union between a man and a woman
is sin. If you explain to them that a yogi can be produced as a result of the sexual union,
they say, "No! How can a yogi be born out of sin?"


It is possible that у new generation of supermen will be produced in this way.
Through the practices of yoga you can transform the quality of your genes. If genes can
produce artists, scientists, inventors and intellectual geniuses, then why not awakened
kundalinis? You have to transform the quality of your sperm or ova by firstly
transforming your whole consciousness. Neitheк drugs nor diet will transform your
genes, but if you change your consciousness, you can then effect the elements of the body
and ultimately change the quality of the sperm and ova. Then you will have children with
awakened kundalinis. They will become the yogis and spiritual masters of the house who
set things right for you. They will say, "Mummy, you are not the physical body." "Pара,
drinking is no good."
Those of you who enter married life should go into it keeping in mind that the
purpose is not just pleasure, or to produce offspring, but to create a genius. All over the
world, people who marry for progeny should try for higher quality children.
Mantra
The second method of awakening kundalini is through steady regular practice of
mantra. This is a very powerful, smooth and risk-free method, but of course it is a
sadhana which requires time and a lot of patience. First you need to get a suitable mantra
from a guru who knows yoga and tantra, and who can guide you through your sadhana.
When you practise the mantra incessantly, it develops in you the vision of a higher force
and enables you to live amidst the sensualities of life with indifference to them.
When you throw a pebble into a still lake, it produces circular ripples. In the same
way, when you repeat a mantra over and over again, the sound force gathers momentum
and creates vibrations in the ocean of the mind. When you repeat the mantra millions and
billions of times, it permeates every part of your brain and purifies your whole physical,
mental and emotional body.
The mantra must be chanted loudly, softly, on the mental plane and on the psychic
plane. By practising it at these four levels, kundalini awakens methodically and
systematically. You can also use the mantra by repeating it mentally in coordination with
the breath or you can sing it aloud in the form of kirtan. This creates a great potential in
mooladhara and awakening takes place.
Closely related to mantra yoga is the awakening through sound or music - nada yoga.
Here the sounds are the bija mantras and the music consists of particular melodies
corresponding to particular chakras. This is a most tender and absorbing way of
awakening.

Tapasya

The third method of awakening is tapasya, which means the performance of
austerities. Tapasya is a means of purification, a burning or setting on fire so that a
process of elimination is created, not in the physical body, but in the mental and
emotional bodies. Through this process the mind, the emotions and the whole personality
are cleansed of all the dirt, complexes and patterns of behavior that cause pain and
suffering. Tapasya is an act of purification. It should not be misunderstood to involve
standing naked in cold water or snow, or observing foolish and meaningless austerities.
When you want to eliminate a bad habit, the more you want to get rid of it, the more
powerful it becomes. When you abandon it in the waking state, it appears in dreams, and
when you stop those dreams, it expresses itself in your behavior or manifests in disease.
This particular habit must be destroyed at its psychic root, not only at the conscious level.
The samskara and vasana must be eliminated by some form of tapasya.
Tapasya is a psychological or psycho-emotional process through which the aspirant
tries to set in motion a process of metabolism that will eradicate the habits that create
weakness and obstruct the awakening of willpower. 'I must do this but I can't.' Why does
this difference between resolution and implementation arise in the mind of the aspirant?
Why is it so great? It is due to a deficiency of will; and that weakness, that distance or
barrier between resolution and execution can be removed through regular and repeated
practice of tapasya. Then the willpower makes a decision once and the matter is finished.
This strength of will is the fruit of tapasya.
The psychology of austerity plays a very important part in the awakening of man's
latent power. It is not well understood by modern man who has unfortunately accepted
that man lives for 'the pleasure principle', as propounded by Freud and his disciples. The
psychology of austerity is very sound and certainly not abnormal. When the senses are
satisfied by the objective pleasures, by the comforts and luxuries, the brain and nervous
system become weak and the consciousness and energy undergo a process of regression.
It is in this situation that the method of austerity is one of the most powerful and
sometimes explosive methods of awakening.
Here the manifestations are tremendous and the aspirant has to face his lower
instincts in the beginning. He confronts a lot of temptations and the assaults of the satanic
and tamasic forces. All the evil or negative samskaras or karmas of many, many
incarnations rise to the surface. Sometimes fear manifests very powerfully or attachment
to the world comes with a great force. In some people, sexual fantasies haunt the mind for
days together, while others become lean and thin, or even sick. At this juncture, siddhis
can appear. One develops extrasensory perceptions, he can read the minds of others, he
can suppress others by a thought, or his own thoughts materialize. In the beginning, black
forces manifest and all these siddhis are negative or of a lower quality. Tapasya is a very,
very powerful method of awakening which everybody cannot handle.
Awakening through herbs
The fourth method of awakening is through the use of specific herbs. In Sanskrit this
is called aushadhi, and it should not be interpreted as meaning drugs like marijuana,
LSD, etc. Aushadhi is the most powerful and rapid method of awakening but it is not for
all and very few people know about it. There are herbs which can transform the nature of
the body and its elements and bring about either partial or full awakening, but they should
never be used without a guru or qualified guide. This is because certain herbs selectively
awaken ida or pingala and others can suppress both these nadis and quickly lead one to
the mental asylum. For this reason, aushadhi is a very risky and unreliable method.
In the ancient vedic texts of India, there are references to a substance called soma.
Soma was a juice extracted from a creeper which was picked on special days of the dark
lunar fortnight. It was placed in an earthen pitcher and buried underground until the full
moon. Then it was removed and the juice was extracted and taken. This induced visions,
experiences and an awakening of higher consciousness.
The Persians knew another drink, homa, which may have been the same as soma. In
Brazil and some of the African countries, people used hallucinogenic mushrooms and in
the Himalayan regions marijuana or hashish were taken with the thought that they might
provide a shortcut in arousing spiritual awakening. From time to time, in different parts
of the world, other things were also discovered and used, some being very mild in effect
and others being very concentrated.

With the help of the correct herbs, purified aspirants were able to visualize divine
beings, holy rivers, mountains, sacred places, holy men and so on. When the effects of
the herbs were more concentrated, they could separate the self from the body and travel
astrally. Of course it was often illusory, but sometimes it was a real experience as well.
People were able to enter a state of samadhi and awaken their kundalini. In this particular
field of awakening, the sexual instinct was completely eliminated. Therefore, many
aspirants preferred this method and have been trying to discover the appropriate herbs for
many centuries.
With aushadhi awakening the body becomes still and quiet, the metabolism slows
and the temperature drops. As a result of this, the nerve reflexes function differently and
in most cases the aushadhi awakening is a permanent one. However, the aushadhi method
of awakening is no longer practiced because it was misused by the ordinary people who
were neither prepared, competent nor qualified. As a result, knowledge of the herbs was
withdrawn and today it is a closely guarded secret.
Everyone is craving kundalini awakening, but few people have the discipline and
mental, emotional, physical and nervious preparation required to avoid damage to the
brain and tissues. So, although no one is teaching the aushadhi method of awakening
today, its knowledge has been transmitted from generation to generation through the
guru/disciple tradition. Perhaps some day, when the nature of man changes and we find
better intellectual, physical and mental responses, the science may again be revealed.
Raja yoga
The fifth method of inducing awakening is through raja yoga and the development of
an equipoised mind. This is the total merging of individual consciousness with
superconsciousness. It occurs by a sequental process of concentration, meditation and
communion; experience of union with the absolute or supreme.
All the practices of raja yoga, preceded by hatha yoga, bring about very durable
experiences, but they can lead to a state of complete depression, in which you do not feel
like doing anything. The raja yoga method is very difficult for most people as it requires
time, patience, discipline and perseverance. Concentration of mind is one of the most
difficult things for modern man to achieve. It cannot be undertaken before the mind has
been stabilized, the karmas deactivated and the emotions purified through karma and
bhakti yogas. It is the nature of the mind to remain active all the time, and this constitutes
a very real danger for the people of our time, because when we try to concentrate the
mind we create a split. Therefore, most of us should only practice concentration up to a
certain point.

Following the awakening through raja yoga, changes take place in the aspirant. He
may transcend hunger and all his addictions or habits. The sensualities of life are no
longer appealing, hunger and the sexual urge diminish and detachment develops
spontaneously. Raja yoga brings about a slow transformation of consciousness.

Pranayama

The sixth method of awakening kundalini is through pranayama. When a sufficiently
prepared aspirant practises pranayama in a calm, cool and quiet environment, preferably
at a high altitude, with a diet only sufficient to maintain life, the awakening of kundalini
takes place like an explosition. In fact, the awakening is so rapid that kundalini ascends to
sahasrara immediately.

Pranayama is not only a breathing exercise or a means to increase prana in the body;
it is a powerful method of creating yogic fire to heat the kundalini and awaken it.
However, if it is practiced without sufficient preparation, this will not occur because the
generated heat will not be directed to the proper centers. Therefore, jalandhara, uddiyana
and moola bandhas are practiced to lock the prana in and force it up to the frontal brain.
When pranayama is practised correctly, the mind is automatically conquered.
However, the effects of pranayama are not that simple to manage. It creates extra heat in
the body, it awakens some of the centers in the brain and it can hinder the production of
sperm and testosterone. Pranayama may also lower the temperature of the inner body and
even bring down the rate of respiration and alter the brain waves. Unless you have
practised the shatkarmas first and purified the body to a degree, when these changes take
place, you may not be able to handle them.
There are two important ways of awakening kundalini - one is the direct method and
the other is the indirect. Pranayama is the direct method. The experiences it brings about
are explosive and results are attained very quickly. Expansion is rapid and the mind
attains quick metamorphosis. However, this form of kundalini awakening is always
accompanied by certain experiences, and for one who is not sufficiently prepared
mentally, philosophically, physically and emotionally, these experiences can be
terrifying. Therefore, although the path of pranayama is a jetset method, it is drastic and
is considered to be a very difficult one that everybody cannot manage.

Kriya yoga

The seventh method of inducing awakening is kriya yoga. It is the most simple and
practical way for modern day man as it does not require confrontation with the mind.
Sattvic people may be able to awaken kundalini through raja yoga, but those who have a
tumultuous, noisy, rajasic mind will not succeed this way. They will only develop more
tensions, guilt and complexes, and may even become schizophrenic. For such people
kriya yoga is by far the best and most effective system.
When you practise kriya yoga, kundalini doesn't wake up with force, nor does it
awaken like a satellite or as a vision or experience. It wakes up like a noble queen. Before
getting up she will open her eyes, then close them again for a while. Then she'll open her
eyes again, look here and there, turn to the right and left, then pull the sheet up over her
head and doze. After some time she will again stretch her body and open her eyes, then
doze for a while. Each time she stretches and looks around she says, 'Hmmm'. This is
what happens in kriya yoga awakening.

Sometimes you feel very grand and sometimes you don't feel quite right. Sometimes you pay too much attention to the things of life and sometimes you think everything is
useless. Sometimes you eat extravagantly and sometimes you don't eat for days together.
Sometimes you have sleepless nights and at other times you do nothing but sleep and
sleep. All these signs of awakening and reversion, awakening and reversion keep coming
every now and then. Kriya yoga does not create an explosive awakening. However, it can
bring visions and other very mild and controllable experiences.

Tantric initiation

This eighth method of awakening kundalini through tantric initiation is a very secret
topic. Only those people who have transcended passions, and who understand the two
principles of nature, Shiva and Shakti, are entitled to this initiation. It is not meant for
those who have urges lurking within them or for those who have a need for physical
contact. With the guidance of a guru, this is the quickest possible way to awaken
kundalini.

There are no extraordinary experiences or feelings and there's no neurosis; everything
seems quite normal, but at the same time, without your knowledge, awakening is taking
place. Transformation takes place and your awareness expands, but you don't know it. In
this particular system, awakening and arriving at sahasrara are the same event. It takes
just three seconds. However, who is qualified for this path? Few people in this world
have completely transcended the sexual urge and overcome their passions.

Shaktipat

The ninth method of awakening is performed by the guru. It is called shaktipat. The
awakening is instant, but it is only a glimpse, not a permanent event. When the guru
creates this awakening you experience samadhi. You can practise all forms of pranayama
and all asanas, mudras and bandhas without having learned them or prepared for them.
All the mantras are revealed to you and you know the scriptures from within. Changes
take place in the physical body in an instant. The skin becomes very soft, the eyes glow
and the body emits a particular aroma which is neither agreeable nor disagreeable.
This shaktipat is conducted in the physical presence or from a distance. It can be
transmitted by touch, by a handkerchief, a mala, a flower, a fruit or anything edible,
depending on the system the guru has mastered. It can even be transmitted by letter,
telegram or telephone.

It is very difficult to say who is qualified for this awakening. You may have lived the
life of a renunciate for fifty years, but still you may not get it. You may be just an
ordinary person, living a non-spiritual life, eating all kinds of rubbish foods, but the guru
may give you shaktipat. Your eligibility for shaktipat does not depend on your social or
immediate conduct, but on the point of evolution you have reached. There is a point in
evolution beyond which shaktipat becomes effective, but this evolution is not intellectual,
emotional, social or religious. It is a spiritual evolution which has nothing to do with the
way you live, eat, behave or think, because generally we do these things, not because of
our evolvement, but according to the way we have been brought up and educated.

Self-surrender

We have discussed the nine established methods of awakening kundalini, but there is
a tenth way - don't aspire for awakening. Let it happen if it happens: "I am not
responsible for the awakening, nature is accomplishing everything. I accept what comes
to me." This is known as the path of self-surrender, and in this path, if you have a strong
enough belief that your kundalini will indeed awaken, twenty thousand years can pass in
the twinkling of an eye and kundalini will awaken instantly.
Effects of the different methods of awakening

When the awakening of kundalini takes place, scientific observations have revealed
different effects. Those who have awakened kundafini from birth do not register any
emotional changes. They are like blocks of wood. Those who have awakened kundalini
through pranayama have a great quantum of electrical charges in the spinal column and
throughout the body, and momentarily they could manifest schizophrenically.
Karma yoga and bhakti yoga are considered comparatively safe and mild methods of
awakening, but the tantric methods are more scientific than the non-tantric methods,
because in tantra there is no scope for suppression or dispersion of energy. In non-tantric
methods there is antagonism - one mind wants it and the same mind is saying no. You
suppress your thoughts, you want to enjoy, but at the same time you think "No, it is bad."
I am not criticizing non-tantric methods. They are the mild methods which do not
bring you any trouble. They are just like beer - you drink a little bit and nothing happens,
drink four to ten glasses and not much will happen. But tantric methods are like LSD, you
have a little and it takes you right out. If something is wrong, it is wrong; if something is
right, it is right.
