Everybody talks about the ascent of kundalini, but few ever discuss the descent.
When the descent of kundalini occurs, it means the lower mental plane of the human
being is no longer influenced by the ordinary mind, the supermind takes over instead.
This higher form of consciousness rules the body, mind and senses and directs your life,
thoughts and emotions. Kundalini is henceforth the ruler of your life. That is the concept
of descent.

The whole process after union

When Shiva and Shakti unite in sahasrara, one experiences samadhi, illumination
occurs in the brain and the silent areas begin to function. Shiva and Shakti remain merged
together for some time, and during this period there is a total loss of consciousness
pertaining to each other. At that time a bindu evolves. Bindu means a point, a drop, and
that bindu is the substratum of the whole cosmos. Within that bindu is the seat of human
intelligence and the seat of the total creation. Then the bindu splits into two and Shiva
and Shakti manifest again in duality. When ascension took place it was only the ascent of
Shakti, but now, when descension takes place, Shiva and Shakti both descend to the gross
plane and there is again knowledge of duality.

Those who have studied quantum physics will have a better understanding of this as
it is difficult for everyone to understand from the philosophical point of view. After total
union there is a process of corning down the same pathway you ascended. The gross
consciousness which became fine, again becomes gross. That is the concept of divine
incarnation or avatara.


### The non-dual experience of samadhi

When one attains the highest pinnacles of samadhi, purusha and prakriti, or Shiva and
Shakti are in total union and only adwaita exists, non-dual experience. At this time, when
there is no subject/object plus distinction, it is very difficult for one to differentiate. He
may look like an idiot and not know it, or he may appear to be a great scholar and not be
aware of that. Whether he is talking to a man or a woman he does not know, he sees no
difference. He may even be associating with spiritual or divine people without being
aware of that, because at this point of time his consciousness is reduced to a level of
innocence just like a baby.
So, in the state of samadhi you are a baby. A baby can't tell the difference between a
man and a woman because he has no physical or sexual distinction. He can't distinguish a
scholar from an idiot and he may not even see any difference between a snake and a rope.
He can hold a snake just as he holds a rope. This only happens when union is taking
place.

When Shiva and Shakti descend to the gross plane, that is mooladhara chakra, they
separate and live as two entities. There is duality in mooladhara chakra. There is duality
in the mind and senses and in the world of names and forms, but there is no duality in
samadhi. There is no seer or experiencer in the state of samadhi. There is nobody to say
what samadhi is like because it is a non-dual experience.
Why Shiva and Shakti both descend
It is very difficult to understand why Shiva and Shakti both descend to the gross
plane after having attained the highest union. What is the use of destroying the world and
then creating it again? What is the point of transcending the consciousness if you have to
come back to it again? Why bother to awaken kundalini and unite with Shiva in sahasrara
if you have to come down to mooladhara again? This is something very mysterious and
we can well ask, 'Why awaken kundalini at all?'
Why build a mansion if you know you will have to burn it down when it is
completed? We actually create a lot of things that are ultimately going to be destroyed.
So why do it at all? It seems so crazy! We do so much sadhana to transcend the chakras
and ascend from earth to heaven. Then, when we reach paradise and become one with
that great reality, we suddenly decide to come back down. And not all alone, we bring the
great one with us. It would be easier to understand if Shakti came back alone and Shiva
remained in heaven. Maybe when Shakti is about to leave, Shiva says, 'Wait, I'm coming
with you.

### A new existence on the gross plane

When kundalini descends, you come down to the gross plane with a totally
transformed consciousness. You live a normal life, associating with everybody and
discharging your worldly obligations like other people do. Maybe you even play the
game of desires, passions, cravings and such things. Maybe you play the game of victory
and defeat, attachments and infatuations, but you just play a game. You know it; you do
everything as an actor. You are not involved in it life and soul.
It is at this time the genius or the transformed consciousness manifests through you.
You don't have to think or plan how to perform miracles. You have to remember that you
have come down as a transformed quality of consciousness. You must remember that you
are now connected with those areas of the brain which were previously silent. And you
must also remember that you are linked with those reservoirs of knowledge, power and
wisdom which belong to the realm of the higher cosmos.
Until the descent is complete, such a man lives a very simple life, unnoticed and
unattended. Once the descent is complete he begins to play the game and people
recognize him as a divine incarnation. They see he is something special compared to
everybody else and they call him a guru. Such a person is actually a junior god.


### Dealing with the issues of reality

When Shiva and Shakti descend to the gross level of awareness there is again duality.
That is why the self-realized man is able to understand pain and all the mundane affairs
of life. He understands the whole drama of duality, multiplicity and diversity. Sometimes
we ordinary mortals are at a fix to understand how this man with the highest attainment is
able to cope with the hopeless dualities of life.
When I was about thirteen, I was also puzzled by this. There was a great lady saint
who was supposed to have attained the very highest state and I used to visit her with my
elders. I used to hear her discussing all the mundane and ordinary things of life - "How
are you? How is your child? Is he sick? Are you giving him medicines ? Why do you
fight with your wife?" I used to think, "If she is an enlightened lady she shouldn't talk
about duality. How can she understand duality if she is in unity?"

I never got an answer, but every man has his moments of experience in life and I
have not been an exception to that. I came to understand that Shiva and Shakti live on
both planes and this gross plane of duality is an expression and manifestation of the
correlation of Shiva and Shakti. This is precisely the reason why the great saints and
mahatmas talk about charity, compassion, love, etc. However, there is a period when they
don't understand these things and they don't care what happens to the world. They don't
even know what is going on, who is happy and who is suffering. But finally there is a
great transformation. Shakti rules the matter and Shiva rules the consciousness, and when
they descend to the gross plane, Shakti continues to rule the matter and Shiva, being
consciousness, gives an understanding to the whole world.
Therefore, if ever we see a self-realized person discussing the trivialities of life and
dealing with the issues of reality, we should not be surprised.
