Уе Man, Tame the Kundalini

When I was six years old I had a spontaneous spiritual experience during which I
became completely unaware of my body for quite a long time. Again, when I was ten, the
same thing happened, but this time I was old enough to think and rationalize, and I told
my father about it. At first he did not understand what had happened and he wanted to
take me to a doctor, but fortunately there were no doctors in our area at that time. Had
there been, perhaps I would have ended up in a mental hospital, but things being what
they were, I did not have to undergo treatment and was left unattended.
My father had great regard for the Vedas and for his guru. One day this guru
happened to visit my native town, so my father took me to him and asked his advice
about me. The sage told him that I had had a spiritual experience and therefore should be
instructed to lead a spiritual life. My father obeyed his guru and arranged for me to be
trained accordingly. Thus at an early age I was dedicated to the spiritual quest.
My family was Hindu, and in Hinduism there are two traditions: one believes in the
worship of idols, and the other that God is formless. My family belonged to the latter, but
still I often looked at the pictures of all the different deities and wondered at them. Durga
was mounted on a lion; Saraswati on a swan; Vishnu lay sleeping on a huge cobra; Kali
was completely naked, standing on the body of Shiva; Таrа too was naked and Shiva was
drinking milk from her breast. I could not understand what it all meant. Why did Shiva
ride upon a bull and have so many snakes wrapped around him; how could the Ganga
flow from his hair; why was Ganesha, with his enormous elephantine head and pot belly,
riding on a small rat? I thought that there must be some symbolic meaning behind all this,
but I only began to understand it through kundalini yoga, which I started practising at the
age of fifteen, while still at school.

Around this time I had another experience. I was sitting quietly when suddenly,
without any effort, my mind turned inwards. I immediately saw the whole earth with its
oceans, continents, mountains and cities, crack into pieces. I did not understand this
vision until a few days later when the second world war broke out. This really made me
begin to wonder. How could I have seen this future event symbolically in meditation
when living in a remote area? I had neither heard nor read about it previously, nor had I
any way of knowing that it was coming.

A new life begins

By the time I was seventeen, I was asking questions which nobody could answer. I
wondered about things like the difference between perception and experience. I talked a
lot about such topics with my maternal uncle and my younger sister, but this did not
quench my thirst and I knew I had to go out and discover the answers for myself. I
postponed my departure from home until one day my father pushed me out with ninety
rupees in my pocket. Thus my wandering life began.
During my travels I met a very old swami who invited me to stay in his ashram. He
had a wonderful knowledge of tantra and taught me many things. Though I knew I would
never forget him, he was not my guru and after nine months I left his ashram and
continued wandering. Soon after this I reached Rishikesh, where I heard about Swami
Sivananda. I went to him and asked how to experience the highest consciousness. He told
me to stay in his ashram and he would guide me. So I followed monastic life, but still, for
a long time I was puzzled about the purpose of my existence. I felt that man was a seeker,
yet I really did not know what I was seeking and was often left with the terrifying
question that man asks himself regarding death.
The awakening of my kundalini
Sometime later I had another experience while sitting on the banks of the Ganga. I
was thinking of some mundane things when my mind spontaneously started going in and
in. Suddenly I felt as if the earth was slipping from under me and the sky was expanding
and receding. A moment later I experienced a terrible force springing from the base of
my body like an atomic explosion. I felt that I was vibrating very fast, the light currents
were terrific. I experienced the supreme bliss, like the climax of a man's desire, and it
continued for a long time. My whole body was contracting until the feeling of pleasure
became quite unbearable and I lost complete awareness of my body. This was the third
time it had happened.
After returning to consciousness I was listless for many days. I could not eat, sleep or
move, even to go to the toilet. I saw everything but nothing registered. The bliss was a
living thing within me and I knew that if I moved, this wonderful feeling would cease; I
would lose the intensity of it all. How could I move when bells were ringing inside? This
was the awakening of my kundalini.
After a week or so I returned to normal and then I started to study tantra and yoga
very seriously. At first I was still a bit weak and sick, so I practised hatha yoga to purify
my whole system. Then I began to explore the fantastic science of kundalini yoga. What
is this power which awakens in mooladhara chakra? My interest was aroused and I put
much effort into trying to understand this marvellous force.
With the awakening of kundalini, the greater intelligence is aroused from its sleep
and you can give birth to a new range of creativity. When kundalini awakens, not only
are you blessed with visions and psychic experiences, you could become a prophet, saint,
inspired artist or musician, a brilliant writer or poet, a clairvoyant or messiah. Or you
could become an outstanding leader, prime minister, governor or president. The
awakening of kundalini affects the whole area of the human mind and behavior.
Kundalini is not a myth or an illusion. It is not a hypothesis or a hypnotic suggestion.
Kundalini is a biological substance that exists within the framework of the body. Its
awakening generates electrical impulses throughout the whole body and these impulses
can be detected by modern scientific instruments and machines. Therefore, each of us
should consider the importance and the benefits of awakening kundalini, and we should
make a resolve to awaken this great shakti.
