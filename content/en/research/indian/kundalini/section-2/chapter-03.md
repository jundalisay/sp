Our reflection on the psychic centers begins from ajna chakra. According to tradition,
mooJadhara is generally designated as the first chakra since it is the seat of kundalini
shakti. However, there is another system in which consideration and study of the chakras
commences from ajna.

Ajna chakra is the point of confluence where the three main nadis or forces - ida,
pingala and sushumna merge into one stream of consciousness and flow up to sahasrara,
the crown center. In mythology, these three nadis are represented by three great rivers -
Ganga (ida), Jamuna (pingala) and Saraswati (a subterranean current which represents
sushumna). They converge at a place called Prayag or Triveni, which is near present day
Allahabad. Hindus believe that every twelve years, when the sun is in Aquarius, if one
takes a dip at the point of confluence, he or she will be purified—é This place of
confluence corresponds symbolically to ajna chakra.

When the mind is concentrated at this conjunction, transformation of individual
consciousness is brought about by the merging of the three great forces. Individual
consciousness is mainly comprised of ego, and it is on account of ego that we are aware
of dualities. As long as there is duality there cannot be samadhi; as long as you remember
yourself you cannot get out of yourself.

Although there are experiences of trance in other chakras, there is no merger of the
individual ego with the cosmic ego. All throughout you find you are trying to assert
yourself behind all the experiences you are having, but when ida and pingala unite with
sushumna in ajna chakra, you lose yourself completely. I don't mean that you become
unconscious. Your awareness expands and becomes homogeneous. Then individual
awareness falls flat and you completely transcend the realm of duality. Thus ajna chakra
is a very important center, which you must experience in order to bring about purification
of the mind. Once the mind is purified the experience and awakening of the other chakras
can proceed.

There is a certain problem with the awakening of the other chakras. Each one
contains a store of karmas or samskara, both good and bad, positive and negative, painful
and pleasant. The awakening of any chakra will definitely bring to the surface an
explosion or expression of these karmas, and of course, not everybody is prepared or
ready to face them. Only those who have reason and understanding are able to cope.
Therefore it is said that before you start awakening and manifesting the great force, it is
best to purify the mind at the point of confluence. Then, with a purified mind, you can
awaken the other chakras. For this reason we begin our exposition of the chakras with
ajna.

The center of command

The word ajna comes from the Sanskrit root which means 'to know, to obey or to
follow'. Literally, ajna means 'command' or 'the monitoring center'. In astrology ajna is
the center of Jupiter, which symbolizes the guru or preceptor. Amongst the deities,
Jupiter is represented by Brihaspati, the guru of the devas and preceptor of the gods.
Therefore, this center is also known as 'the guru chakra'.
Ajna is the bridge which links the guru with his disciples. It represents the level at
which it is possible for direct mind to mind communication to take place between two
people. It is in this chakra that communication with the external guru, the teacher or
preceptor takes place. And it is here that the directions of the inner guru are heard in the
deepest state of meditation, when all the sense modalities are withdrawn and one enters
the state of shoonya or void.
This is a state of absolute nothingness, where the empirical experiences of name and
form, subject and object, do not penetrate. In this completely static state, the light of the
mind is extinguished; the consciousness ceases to function, and no ego awareness
remains. This void state is the same as the death experience, and in order to traverse it the
voice or command of the guru must be heard in ajna chakra.
Of course if you are new to spiritual life you won't be facing this problem yet, but
when it comes you will find it very difficult to manage. At the moment your problems are
just mental - dispersion of mind, worries, anxiety, restlessness, etc., but when the night is
dark and you have gone very deep in meditation, losing your individual awareness, the
only thing that can guide you at this point is the instructions or command of your guru
heard through ajna chakra.
It has also been called 'the eye of intuition', and it is the doorway through which the
individual enters the astral and psychic dimension of consciousness. Perhaps the most
common name for this chakra is 'the third eye', and the mystical traditions of every age
and culture make abundant references to it. It is portrayed as a psychic eye located
midway between the two physical eyes and it looks inward instead of outward.
In India, ajna chakra is called divya chakshu (the divine eye), gyana chakshu or
gyana netra (the eye of knowledge) because it is the channel through which the spiritual
aspirant receives revelation and insight into the underlying nature of existence. It is also
called 'the eye of Shiva', for Shiva is the epitome of meditation, which is directly
associated with the awakening of ajna chakra.
It is interesting to note that ajna chakra is more active in females than it is in males.
Women are more sensitive, psychic and perceptive and they are often able to predict
coming events. However, in most people this inner eye remains closed, and though they
see the events of the outside world, knowledge and understanding of truth cannot be
gained. In this sense, we are blind to the real possibilities of the world, unable to view the
deeper levels of human existence.

The location point

Ajna chakra is located in the brain directly behind the eyebrow center. It is at the very
top of the spinal cord, at the medulla oblongata. Initially it is very hard to feel the exact
location point of ajna, so we concentrate on ajna kshetram, at the mid-eyebrow center,
bhrumadhya. These two centers are directly connected. That is why it has always been an
Indian custom to place tilaka, chandan, sindur or kumkum on the mid-eyebrow center.
Sindur contains mercury, and when it is applied to the eyebrow center a constant pressure
is exerted on the nerve which runs from bhrumadhya to the medulla oblongata. Maybe
the original purpose for applying these substances has been forgotten by most people
today, but it is not a religious mark or even a beauty spot. It is a means by which you can
maintain constant conscious and unconscious awareness of ajna chakra.
It should also be mentioned here that ajna chakra and the pineal gland are one and the
same thing. The pituitary gland is sahasrara, and just as the pituitary and pineal glands are
intimately connected, so are ajna and sahasrara. We could say that ajna is the gateway to
sahasrara chakra. If ajna is awakened and functioning properly, all the experiences
happening in sahasrara can be managed well.
The pineal gland acts as a lock on the pituitary. As long as the pineal gland is healthy,
the functions of the pituitary are controlled. However, in most of us, the pineal gland
started to degenerate when we reached the age of 8, 9 or 10. Then the pituitary began to
function and to secrete various hormones which instigated our sexual consciousness, our
sensuality and worldly personality. At this time we began to lose touch with our spiritual
heritage. However, through various yogic techniques, such as trataka and shambhavi
mudra, it is possible to regenerate or maintain the health of the pineal gland.
