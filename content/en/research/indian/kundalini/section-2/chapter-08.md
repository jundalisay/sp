Vishuddhi chakra is known as the 'purification center'. The Sanskrit word shuddhi
means (to purify), and in this chakra the purifying and harmonizing of all opposites takes
place. Vishuddhi is also known as the 'nectar and poison center'. Here, the nectar which
drips down from bindu is said to be split into the pure form and the poison. The poison is
discarded and the pure nectar then nourishes the body, ensuring excellent health and
longevity.

Vishuddhi represents a state of openness in which life is regarded as the provider of
experiences that lead to greater understanding. One ceases to continually avoid the
unpleasant aspects of life and seek the pleasant. Instead there is a flowing with life,
allowing things to happen in the way that they must. Both poison and nectar are
consumed in vishuddhi chakra, and they are understood to be but parts of a greater
cosmic whole. Proper understanding and true discrimination dawn out of this equal
acceptance of the dualities and polarities of life.

The more abstract aspect of vishuddhi is the faculty of higher discrimination. Hence
any communication received telepathic ally can be tested here for its correctness and
accuracy. Similarly, vishuddhi allows us to differentiate between realization coming into
our consciousness from the higher levels of knowledge, and the mere babblings of our
unconscious mind and wishful thinking.

Vishuddhi chakra is often treated as an insignificant chakra in the scheme of
kundalini yoga. People are more concerned with mooladhara, anahata and ajna, and
therefore the significance of vishuddhi is easily disregarded. In fact, the reverse attitude
may even be more appropriate.

The location point

Vishuddhi chakra is in the cervical plexus directly behind the throat pit. Its kshetram
is in the front of the neck, at the throat pit or thyroid gland. The physiological
concomitants of vishuddhi are the pharyngeal and laryngeal nerve plexi.

Traditional symbology

Some tantric texts say vishuddhi chakra is represented by a dark grey colored lotus,
however, it seems to be more commonly perceived as a purple lotus of sixteen petals.
These sixteen petals correspond to the number of nadis associated with this center. On
each petal one of the Sanskrit vowels is inscribed in crimson - am, aam, im, eem, um,
ооm, rim, reem, lrim, lreem, em, aim, om, aum, am, ah. In the pericarp of this lotus is a
circle which is white like the full moon, representing the element of ether or akasha. This
ethereal region is the gateway to liberation for one whose senses are pure and controlled.
Within this moon shape is a snow white elephant, also symbolic of the akasha element.
This is considered as the vehicle of consciousness of this plane, and the aspirant may
picture himself upon its back. The bija mantra is ham, also pure white, which is the seed
sound or vibration of the etheric element.
The presiding deity of vishuddhi is Sadashiva, who is snow white, three-eyed and
five-faced, with ten arms and clothed in a tiger's skin. The goddess is Sakini who is purer
than the ocean of nectar that flows down from the moon region. Her raiment is yellow
and in her four hands she holds the bow, the arrow, the noose and the goad.
Vishuddhi belongs to the fifth loka, the plane of janaha. Its vayu is udana which lasts
till the end of life and rises upwards, and along with ajna chakra, vishuddhi forms the
basis for vigyanamaya kosha which initiates psychic development. The tanmatra or sense
is hearing and the gyanendriya or organ of knowledge is the ears. The karmendriya or
organ of action is the vocal chords.
In nada yoga, the branch of kundalini yoga concerned with sound vibration,
vishuddhi and mooladhara are considered to be the two basic centers of vibration. In nada
yoga the ascent of consciousness through the chakras is integrated with the musical scale.
Each note of the scale corresponds to the vibratory level of consciousness of one of the
chakras. This scale, often chanted in the form of mantras, bhajans and kirtans, is a very
powerful means of awakening kundalini in the different chakras.
Mooladhara is the first and vishuddhi is the fifth level of vibration in the scale. They
produce the basic sounds or vowels around which the music of the chakras is constructed.
These vowel sounds, pictured on the sixteen petals of the yantra, are the primal sounds.
They originate from vishuddhi chakra and are directly connected to the brain.
By meditation on vishuddhi chakra, the mind becomes pure like the akasha. One
becomes a great sage, eloquent and wise and enjoys uninterrupted peace of mind. Amrit
can be felt as a cold fluid flowing into the chakra and the aspirant becomes free from
disease and sorrow, he is compassionate, full of bliss and long lived.

Nectar and poison

In the tantric scriptures it is said that within bindu at the back of the head, the moon is
secreting a vital fluid or essence known as nectar. This transcendental fluid drips down
into the individual consciousness from bindu visarga. Bindu can be regarded in this
context as the center or passage through which the individuality emerges from cosmic
consciousness in sahasrara.

This divine fluid has many different names. In English it can be termed ambrosia -
the nectar of the gods. It is also known as amrit - the nectar of immortality. In the Vedas
it is known as soma and in the tantras it is referred to as madya (divine wine). Many of
the great Sufi poets refer to the sweet wine which brings instant intoxication. The same
symbolism is contained in the Christian rituals where wine is consecrated and
sacramentally imbibed. In fact, every religious system and mystical tradition concerned
with awakening man's higher consciousness has its own symbolism for the unspeakable
and indescribable feeling of bliss.
Between bindu and vishuddhi chakras there is another smaller psychic center known
as lalana chakra or talumula, and it is closely related to vishuddhi chakra. When the
nectar trickles down from bindu it is stored in lalana. This center is like a glandular
reservoir, situated in the back of the nasopharynx, the inner cavity above and beyond the
soft palate into which the nasal passages open. When you perform khechari mudra you
are attempting to turn the tongue up and backwards into this cavity to stimulate the flow
of nectar.
Although this fluid is known as ambrosia, it actually has a dual nature which can act
as poison as well as nectar. When it is produced in bindu and stored in lalana it remains
undifferentiated, neither poison nor nectar. As long as vishuddhi chakra remains inactive,
this fluid runs downward unimpeded, to be consumed in the fire of manipura, resulting in
the processes of decay, degeneration and finally death in the body's tissues.
However, by certain practices such as khechari mudra, the ambrosia is secreted from
lalana and passes to vishuddhi chakra, the purifying and refining center. When vishuddhi
is awakened the divine fluid is retained and utilized, becoming the nectar of immortality.
The secret of youth and regeneration of the body lies in the awakening of vishuddhi
chakra.
There is a wonderful story from the mythology of India which concerns the nectar
and poison of vishuddhi. It is said that in the primordial past, the devas and the rakshasas,
symbolizing the forces of good and evil, were continually fighting each other. Each was
seeking to dominate and destroy the other. Eventually Vishnu attempted to resolve the
conflict. He suggested they stir up the primordial ocean (representing the world and the
mind), and said they could divide the contents equally between them.
This seemed a fair solution and Vishnu's plan was agreed upon. The ocean was
churned and many things came to the surface for sharing and distribution between the
devas and rakshasas. In all, fourteen things arose, including the nectar of immortality side
by side with the worst poison. Of course both the devas and the rakshasas wanted the
nectar, but nobody wanted anything to do with the poison. Ultimately only the devas got
the nectar, because if it had been given to the vicious rakshasas they would have become
immortal. The poison could not even be discarded, for wherever it was thrown it would
cause harm. A great dilemma arose and eventually Vishnu took the poison to Shiva to ask
his advice. Shiva swallowed the poison in a single gulp. From that time onwards, one of
the names of Lord Shiva has been Nilakantha, the blue-throated one, and he is often
depicted in this way.
This story signifies that even poison can be readily digested when vishuddhi chakra is
awakened. It means that at higher levels of awareness, at the level of vishuddhi and
above, even the poisonous and negative aspects of existence become integrated into the
total scheme of being. They are rendered powerless as concepts of good and bad fall
away. At this state of awareness the poisonous aspects and experiences of life are
absorbed and transformed into a state of bliss.
In this chakra it is possible that not only internal poisons but also external poisons
can be neutralized and rendered ineffective. This is one of the siddhis associated with
vishuddhi chakra, and many yogis have possessed this power. It depends on the
awakening of the throat center and bindu visarga in the brain, to which it is directly
connected.

The potential of vishuddhi

Vishuddhi is the center responsible for receiving thought vibrations from other
people's minds. This actually occurs through a minor center which is closely connected
with vishuddhi. It acts somewhat like a transistor radio tuning into a radio station,
allowing the yogi to tune into the thoughts and feelings of people both close by and far
away. The thought waves of others are also experienced elsewhere in the body, in other
centers such as manipura, but the actual reception center of thought waves and
transmissions is vishuddhi. From vishuddhi they are relayed to the centers in the brain
associated with the other chakrass and in this way they enter into the individual
awareness.

Associated with vishuddhi is a particular nerve channel known as kurma nadi, the
tortoise nadi. When it is awakened, the practitioner is able to completely overcome the
desire and necessity for food and drink. This capability has been demonstrated by many
yogis in the past.

Vishuddhi is actually the legendary 'fountain of youth'. It is said that when kundalini
is in vishuddhi one enjoys eternal youth. When it awakens by the practices of hatha yoga,
kundalini yoga or tantra, then a spontaneous physical rejuvenation begins to take place.
There is a point in life, usually in the second or third decade, when the rate of
degeneration of the cells of the body surpasses the rate of regeneration. It is from that
point that decay, old age, disease and death come to man. In certain disease states such as
some forms of leukemia, the degenerative and destructive forces develop even more
rapidly. The rejuvenation effected by vishuddhi chakra on the tissues, organs and systems
of the body is in contradistinction to this ongoing ageing process, which is man's normal
condition.

The powers attained through awakening vishuddhi include imperishability, full
knowledge of the scriptures and also the knowledge of the past, present and future. The
sense of hearing becomes very sharp, but through the mind and not the ears. One
frequently experiences shoonyata, the void, and he overcomes all fear and attachment. He
is then able to work freely in the world without being attached to the fruits of his actions.
