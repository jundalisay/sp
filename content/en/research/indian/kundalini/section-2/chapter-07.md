In kundalini yoga, anahata chakra is a center of great importance. This is because
although awakening from manipura is constant, kundalini has to remain in anahata for
quite a long time.

It is said that in this present age the consciousness of mankind is passing through a
phase of anahata. It means that in many people anahata chakra has started to function, but
there is a difference between functioning and awakening. In most people, anahata is not
completely active, but it functions slightly. Mooladhara on the other hand is very active
and almost awake in the majority of people today.
The word anahata actually means 'unstruck or unbeaten'. And this center is known as
such because of its relationship with the heart, which throbs, beats or vibrates to a
constant unbroken rhythm. It is said in many of the scriptures that there is a sound which
is non-physical and non-empirical, which is transcendental in nature, and this sound is
endless and unbroken in the same way that the heart beats faithfully and continuously
from before birth up until death.

The location point

Anahata chakra is situated in the spinal column on the inner wall, directly behind the
center of the chest. The kshetram is at the heart, and although anahata is known as the
heart center, this should not be misinterpreted to mean the biological heart, the muscular
pump within the chest. Although its physiological component is the cardiac plexus of
nerves, the nature of this center is far beyond the physiological dimension.
In yoga the heart center is also known as hriday-akasha, which means 'the space
within the heart where purity resides'. This chakra is a very delicate center, for it is
directly connected with that part of the brain which is responsible for all the creative
sciences and fine arts such as painting, dance, music, poetry, etc.

Traditional symbology

Although most of the tantric texts say anahata is a shining crimson color, like that of
the bandhuka flower, my experience is that it is blue in color. It has twelve petals and on
each a letter is inscribed in vermilion: kam, kham, gam, gham, anga, cham, chham, jam,
jham, nyam, tam and tham.

The inner region is hexagonal in shape, representing the air element, vayu tattva. It is
made up of two interlaced triangles, symbolizing the union of Shiva and Shakti. The
inverted triangle is the symbol of creativity, Shakti; and the upright triangle represents
consciousness or Shiva. The vehicle, located within the hexagon, is a black antelope,
which is known for its alertness and fleetness of foot. Above it is situated the bija mantra
yam, which is dark grey in color. Within the bindu of this mantra is the presiding deva,
Isha (Lord in an all-pervading form), who is lustrous like the sun. With him is the devi
Kakini (benefactress of all), who is yellow in color, three-eyed, four-armed, auspicious
and exhilarated.
In the center of the pericarp of the lotus is an inverted triangle, within which burns
the akhanda jyotir, unflickering eternal flame, representing the jivatma or individual soul.
Some of the tantric texts say there is a shivalinga inside the triangle. It is called the bana
linga and is like shining gold.
Below the main lotus of anahata is a subsidiary lotus with red petals, which contain
the kalpa taru or wish fulfilling tree. Many saints have recommended visualization of the
kalpa taru or of a still lake within the anahata hexagon. Upon this lake there is a beautiful
blue lotus. You may have seen this symbol because several ashrams and spiritual
missions utilize it.
Anahata belongs to maha loka, the first of the immortal planes. Its vayu is prana,
which passes through the nose and mouth, and its tanmatra is feeling or touch. The
gyanendriya is the skin and the karmendriya is the hands. Anahata chakra represents
manomaya kosha, controlling the mind and emotions.
Vishnu granthi, the second psychic knot, is located at this heart center. It represents
the bondage of emotional attachment, the tendency to live one's life making decisions on
the strength of the emotions and feelings rather than in the light of the spiritual quest.
Vishnu granthi is untied as the emotions harmonize and enhance, rather than oppose the
spiritual awakening.
It is said that he who meditates on the heart lotus is foremost among yogis and adored
by women. He is preeminently wise and full of noble deeds. His senses are completely
under control and his mind can be engrossed in intense concentration. His speech is
inspired and he has the ability to enter another's body at will.

Fate and freewill

In the tantric scriptures it is said that anahata chakra is where the thoughts and desires
of the individual are materialized and fulfilled. There are basically two ways of thinking -
dependently or independently. Up to manipura chakra the first approach holds true, but
once the shakti pierces anahata, the second approach takes precedence.
This means that as long as the consciousness is centered in the lower chakras, you
will remain completely dependent on what is already enjoined for you, your fate or
destiny. This is called prarabdha karma. Even the awakening of the lower chakras does
not make much difference. Once the consciousness ascends through manipura chakra,
you become master over some of the situations of life, but you are still influenced and
bound by your prarabdha karma. You know that you can escape it, but you don't know
how.

The lower chakras belong to the empirical world of body, mind and senses. People
who accept their fate as inevitable have not yet transcended rnooladhara and
swadhisthana chakras. Manipura is still considered earthly, although it lies at the
boundary between mortal and immortal planes. Those who actively shape their own
destiny through strength of will channelled in a positive direction, which leads to
realization and achievement, are in the realm of manipura.
Anahata chakra is almost completely beyond these empirical dimensions. Here, one
realizes that fate is of course real, but still one can go totally beyond its dictates. It is like
throwing something into the sky. If you are able to hurl that object right out of the
gravitational field, then it will no longer be pulled down by the earth's magnetic forces.
Just as a rocket is launched at tremendous speed in order to go beyond the gravitational
pull of the earth, so the consciousness is accelerated in anahatato the speed of freewill in
order to transcend the pull of latent samskaras.
It is only when you reach anahata chakra that you become a yogi. Up until then,
whether you are in mooladhara, swadhisthana or manipura, you are a yoga practitioner. In
anahata you become a yogi because you are completely established in yogic
consciousness and you depend solely upon the power of your own consciousness rather
than on anything that is external or concerning faith.
Wish fulfillment
In anahata chakra, the freedom to escape from a preordained fate and to determine
one's own destiny becomes a reality. According to the tantras, at the root of anahata there
is a wish fulfilling tree known as the kalpa taru or kalpa vriksha. When this tree starts to
fructify, whatever you think or wish comes true.
Ordinarily, we have so many wishes but they rarely assume more than the air of a
daydream. However, if they were all to become realities, we would quickly start to
question whether we want our wishes fulfilled at all. Most people prefer to depend on fate
rather than take responsibility for creating their own destiny, and well they should. There
is a fine story which is often told to illustrate this:
Once a traveller was sitting underneath a tree. He was feeling very tired and wanted
to have a drink. So he thought of a clear stream, and immediately he heard the trickle of
water flowing beside him. After drinking some water, he thought he would like to have a
little food to satisfy his hunger, and that appeared beside him also. Then, as he was
feeling tired and thought he would like to rest, there appeared before him a nice bed, and
so he went to sleep. The foolish man did not know that he had come to rest beneath the
wish fulfilling tree. In the evening when he awoke, the sun had already set and night had
fallen. He got up and the thought came to his mind: 'Oh, it is terribly dark, perhaps the
tigers will come and eat me', and so they did.
This is what can happen to anyone who awakens the wish fulfilling capacity without
sufficient preparation. If the consciousness awakens in anahata, but you do not know the
powers of your mind, or you possess negative, pessimistic attitudes, dark approaches to
life, apprehensions, fears and many other negative mental tendencies, then you will
immediately fall prey to them. If this happens, you risk the possibility of falling back
from anahata. And if you fall from anahata, there is hardly any chance of making a
second start. To avoid a downfall at this point, it is necessary to always remain as alert as
the antelope, which is sensitive to each and every sound. The antelope is the vehicle of
anahata for this reason; it is not the symbol of restlessness, but of alertness.
When whatever you wish for comes true, this makes you very happy, but at the same
time, it is necessary to constantly analyze your attitude towards yourself and others. You
have to be very careful of doubting thoughts. For example, if you develop a few
palpitations of the heart and think: 'Perhaps I am developing angina pectoris', or a pain in
the abdomen and think: 'Now I have appendicitis or gall bladder disease', such thoughts
may bring many problems and disorders in their wake. You must also guard against
doubts concerning others: 'Maybe that man is my enemy', 'My son is sick, maybe he will
die', 'My friend has not contacted me, he must have had an accident'. It is important to
have a firm and alert control over the mental tendencies and fantasies of the mind.
All sorts of thoughts concerning the body, children, wife, family, monetary, social,
economic or political situations come to us all the time. If kundalini is asleep, these
thoughts have no power, but when kundalini awakens in anahata chakra, all these
thoughts suddenly become realities. Unless we are ever alert at this stage we will place
our own destructive hand on our head.
In the tantric text Saundarya Lahari, this wish fulfilling process is aptly described as
the chintamani, or wish fulfilling gem. Here chinta applies to the 'process of selective
thought' and mani means 'jewel'. Therefore, chintamani means the 'jewel of correct and
positive thinking'. In this text, anahata is described as the garden of the devas. At the
center is a small divine lake inside which is the chintamani. It is not necessary to obtain
this jewel; as long as you can realize your proximity to it that is enough, then whatever
you think comes true.
Develop a new way of thinking
When anahata chakra blooms and awakens, you must have very good sangha,
associations. You should never associate with people who depend on their fate. Rather,
you should always associate with those who depend on faith. You must have unswerving
faith in the power of your own will. Even in the face of tremendous odds, be unflinching.
Then you will succeed. Willpower is never the outcome of suggestion. If you are ill and
you say a hundred times, 'I am well, I am well, I am well...', this is called autosuggestion.
It is not will. Will is something more than this. 'Even if my son is suffering from the
worst disease and medical science has declared that he is about to die, I know he will not.'
This is how you have to think and use your will.
The first preparation, therefore, with regards to awakening anahata is to change your
entire way of thinking. If you are the type of person whose thoughts and wishes often
come true, even when conditions seem to be opposed to that outcome, then it is necessary
to develop a certain amount of caution along with a new way of thinking.
You must become extremely optimistic and positive, always full of hope. You must
never dwell in the negativity of the mind. Physically, mentally and spiritually, you must
be completely at peace with yourself, with people outside and with the whole community
at large. Though the world is full of conflicts, contradictions and deep animosities, you
have to always feel deep peace throughout your being. Never be negative about any
situation in life. Even if you meet a murderer, hopeless gambler or a debaucher, to you he
is a good man. Every situation is a good one for you and the future is always bright. In all
circumstances this must be your attitude. It makes no difference whether you are amidst
poverty, suffering, disease, conflict, divorce, emotional crises and discord. It is all part of
the good, therefore you accept it.
You have to think only one thought resolutely, 'The whole world is in me', or 'I am in
everyone'. When you are able to develop this universal sort of attitude, the kundalini will
shine forth and pierce the fifth chakra - vishuddhi, the center of immortality. This is the
importance and significance of anahata. Perhaps the best mantra for the heart center is
Оm Shanti. 'Om' is the universal cosmic vibration which permeates the whole creation
and 'Shanti' means peace.
Love without expectations
Anahata chakra awakens refined emotion in the brain and its awakening is
characterized by a feeling of universal, unlimited love for all beings. Of course there are
many people in the world who practise kindness and charity, but they have selfishness.
Their charity is not an expression of anahata chakra and spiritual compassion, it is human
compassion. When you have human compassion you open hospitals and feeding centers
or you give clothing, money and medicine in charity, but that is human charity.
How can we tell the difference between human charity and spiritual charity? In
human charity there is always an element of selfishness. If I want to make you a Hindu
by giving you things, this is a manifestation of human charity. Or if I want to make you
my followers I can show you great kindness, but that's human kindness. However, when
anahata awakens all your actions are controlled and ruled by unselfishness and you
develop spiritual compassion. You understand that love does not involve bargaining; it is
free of expectation.
Every form of love is contaminated by selfishness, even the love you have for God,
because you are expecting something from him. Perhaps in this world, the love with
minimum selfishness is a mother's love. Of course it is not totally unselfish, but because a
mother's sacrifices are so great, her love has minimum selfishness.
The qualities of anahata chakra can be awakened by many methods. The symbol of
anahata chakra is a blue lotus, and in the center are two interlaced triangles. This lotus
represents the opening of man's heart. Music, art, sculpture, literature, poetry, all these
are important aids to the development of anahata chakra. And when anahata opens, your
understanding of all beings changes a lot. There is a story about it.
In India there is a traditional pilgrimage in which sadhakas go north to the source of
Ganga, take some water from there and carry it across the continent to South India. Here
they go to a temple and pour the holy water over a shivalingam. The distance they have to
cover in this pilgrimage is almost 3,000 miles.
Once a saint had almost completed this pilgrimage and he was carrying a container
full of Ganga water. As he entered the precincts of the temple where he was to bathe the
shivalingam, he found a donkey which was desperately pining for water. Immediately he
opened his can and gave water to the donkey. His fellow travellers cried out, 'Hey, what
are you doing? You have brought this water from such a long distance to give bath to
Lord Shiva, and here you are giving it to an ordinary animal!' But the saint didn't see it
that way. His mind was working at a different and much higher frequency.
Here is another example: Once Lord Buddha was going for an evening walk. He
came across an old man and he was greatly moved by the sufferings of old age. Next he
saw a dead person, and again he was moved very much. How many times do we see old
men? Are we moved like he was? No, because our minds are different. Awakening of a
chakra alters the frequency of the mind and immediately influences our day to day
relationships with people and our surroundings.
Love overcomes ego
Anahata chakra can be aroused and awakened by the practice of bhakti yoga, in
which there is no place for egotistical consciousness. Your devotion can be for God or
guru. It is easy to practise devotion to God because he does not check your ego, or even if
he does, you don't know it. But when you practise devotion to guru, the first thing he
does is 'egodectomy.' So when you direct your devotion to guru, you have lots of
difficulties. If you only meet your guru from time to time, the problems are invisible, but
if you live with him, the problems are greater. Therefore, many people think it is safer to
have a guru who is no longer living.
Not only is ego an obstacle on the spiritual path, it is also the greatest barrier to
harmony and cordiality in family and social life. Therefore, in order to treat the ego there
are two very important paths. One is karma yoga and the other is bhakti yoga. Ego can
never be removed by intellectual persuasion. It can never be subdued or eliminated unless
you develop the highest form of love. Just as the sun removes darkness, love removes
ego. These two can never coexist.
So, in order to induce anahata awakening we should definitely practise bhakti
yoga.When kundaliniis established in anahata there is absolute devotion and even a
confirmed atheist will change. However, awakening of anahata is not only a way to God
or guru, it is also a way to complete unity and harmony in family life. Therefore, in India,
most Hindu women are initiated into bhakti yoga at a very young age. When they are four
to six years old they are taught to practise devotion to Lord Shiva, Krishna, Rama,
Vishnu, Lakshmi, Durga and so on, because it is easier for women to develop anahata
chakra. For this reason women are also told to use anahata as their center for meditation,
whereas men are generally advised to concentrate on ajna chakra. Anahata is the seat of
human love and the seat of divine love. They are not two things, they are one and the
same.

Psychic propensities of anahata chakra

Prior to the awakening of anahata there may be frequent pain in the chest or irregular
functioning of the heart, such as accelerated pulse. However, rather than feeling ill, one
feels healthy and active and requires little sleep. One obtains complete emotional balance
and the ability to communicate externally as well as internally. Voices or sounds coming
from other realms may be heard, and buzzing or humming sounds and the music of a
flute may be experienced.

The sadhaka may become an inspired poet, artist or singer. He may manifest
clairvoyant/clairaudient or psychokinetic ability, or he may be able to conquer people by
the immensity of love he emits. A person who is in anahata is generally very sensitive to
the feelings of others and his sense of touch is strongly developed. He also has the ability
to heal others, either by touch or by generating his own spiritual energy to other people in
order to effect curative changes. Many people who perform miraculous healings do so
through the agency of anahata chakra.
With anahata awakening one develops non-attachment to worldly things and a
constant feeling of optimism, understanding that good and bad coexist, but there is also a
world beyond this duality. After ridding oneself of attachment, the mind becomes
relaxed, free and peaceful. And with the discovery of true freedom, pleasures of dualistic
life become meaningless.
