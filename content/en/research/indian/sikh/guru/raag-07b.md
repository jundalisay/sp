SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the knife, and the kings are butchers; righteousness has sprouted wings and
flown away. In this dark night of falsehood, the moon of Truth is not visible anywhere. I
have searched in vain, and I am so confused; in this darkness, I cannot find the path.
In egotism, they cry out in pain. Says Nanak, how will they be saved? || 1 || THIRD
MEHL: In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praise has appeared as a
Light in the world. How rare are those few Gurmukhs who swim across to the other
side! The Lord bestows His Glance of Grace; O Nanak, the Gurmukh receives the jewel.
|| 2 || 

PAUREE: Between the Lord‟s devotees and the people of the world, there can
never be any true alliance. The Creator Himself is infallible. He cannot be fooled; no one
can fool Him. He blends His devotees with Himself; they practice Truth, and only Truth.
The Lord Himself leads the people of the world astray; they tell lies, and by telling lies,
they eat poison. They do not recognize the ultimate reality, that we all must go; they
continue to cultivate the poisons of sexual desire and anger. The devotees serve the
Lord; night and day, they meditate on the Naam. Becoming the slaves of the Lord‟s
slaves, they eradicate selfishness and conceit from within. In the Court of their Lord and
Master, their faces are radiant; they are embellished and exalted with the True Word of
the Shabad. || 16 ||


SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Those who praise the Lord in the early
hours of the morning and meditate on Him single-mindedly, are the perfect kings; at
the right time, they die fighting. In the second watch, the focus of the mind is scattered
in all sorts of ways. So many fall into the bottomless pit; they are dragged under, and
they cannot get out again. 

In the third watch, both hunger and thirst bark for attention, and food is put into the
mouth. That which is eaten becomes dust, but they are still attached to eating. In the
fourth watch, they become drowsy. They close their eyes and begin to dream. Rising up
again, they engage in conflicts; they set the stage as if they will live for 100 years. If at
all times, at each and every moment, they live in the fear of God—O Nanak, the Lord
dwells within their minds, and their cleansing bath is true. || 1 ||

SECOND MEHL:
They are the perfect kings, who have found the Perfect Lord. Twenty-four hours a day,
they remain unconcerned, imbued with the Love of the One Lord. Only a few obtain the
Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the Unimaginably Beauteous Lord. Through the perfect
karma of good deeds, one meets the Perfect Guru, whose speech is perfect. O Nanak,
when the Guru makes one perfect, one‟s weight does not decrease. || 2 ||

PAUREE:
When You are with me, what more could I want? I speak only the Truth. Plundered by
the thieves of worldly affairs, she does not obtain the Mansion of His Presence. Being so
stone-hearted, she has lost her chance to serve the Lord. That heart, in which the True
Lord is not found, should be torn down and re-built. How can she be weighed
accurately, upon the scale of perfection? No one will say that her weight has been
shorted, if she rids herself of egotism. The genuine are assayed, and accepted in the
Court of the All-knowing Lord. The genuine merchandise is found only in one shop—it is
obtained from the Perfect Guru. || 17 || 

SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Twenty-four
hours a day, destroy the eight things, and in the ninth place, conquer the body. Within
the body are the nine treasures of the Name of the Lord—seek the depths of these
virtues. Those blessed with the karma of good actions praise the Lord. O Nanak, they
make the Guru their spiritual teacher. In the fourth watch of the early morning hours, a
longing arises in their higher consciousness. They are attuned to the river of life; the
True Name is in their minds and on their lips. The Ambrosial Nectar is distributed, and
those with good karma receive this gift. Their bodies become golden, and take on the
color of spirituality. If the Jeweller casts His Glance of Grace, they are not placed in the
fire again. Throughout the other seven watches of the day, it is good to speak the
Truth, and sit with the spiritually wise. There, vice and virtue are distinguished, and the
capital of falsehood is decreased. There, the counterfeit are cast aside, and the genuine
are cheered. Speech is vain and useless. O Nanak, pain and pleasure are in the power
of our Lord and Master. || 1 || 

SECOND MEHL: Air is the Guru, Water is the Father,
and Earth is the Great Mother of all. Day and night are the two nurses, in whose lap all
the world is at play. Good deeds and bad deeds—the record is read out in the Presence
of the Lord of Dharma. According to their own actions, some are drawn closer, and
some are driven farther away. Those who have meditated on the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, and departed after having worked by the sweat of their brow—O Nanak, their
faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord, and many others are saved along with them!
|| 2 || PAUREE: The True Food is the Love of the Lord; the True Guru has spoken.
With this True Food, I am satisfied, and with the Truth, I am delighted. True are the
cities and the villages, where one abides in the True Home of the self. When the True
Guru is pleased, one receives the Lord‟s Name, and blossoms forth in His Love. No one
enters the Court of the True Lord through falsehood. By uttering falsehood and only
falsehood, the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence is lost. 

No one blocks the way of those who are blessed with the Banner of the True Word of
the Shabad. Hearing, understanding and speaking Truth, one is called to the Mansion of
the Lord‟s Presence. || 18 || 

SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: If I dressed myself in fire, and
built my house of snow, and made iron my food; and if I were to drink in all pain like
water, and drive the entire earth before me; and if I were to place the earth upon a
scale and balance it with a single copper coin; and if I were to become so great that I
could not be contained, and if I were to control and lead all; and if I were to possess so
much power within my mind that I could cause others to do my bidding—so what? As
Great as our Lord and Master is, so great are His gifts. He bestows them according to
His Will. O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, obtain the
glorious greatness of the True Name. || 1 || 

SECOND MEHL: The mouth is not
satisfied by speaking, and the ears are not satisfied by hearing. The eyes are not
satisfied by seeing—each organ seeks out one sensory quality. The hunger of the
hungry is not appeased; by mere words, hunger is not relieved. O Nanak, hunger is
relieved only when one utters the Glorious Praises of the Praiseworthy Lord. || 2 ||
PAUREE: Without the True One, all are false, and all practice falsehood. Without the
True One, the false ones are bound and gagged and driven off. Without the True One,
the body is just ashes, and it mingles again with ashes. Without the True Ome, all food
and clothes are unsatisfying. Without the True One, the false ones do not attain the
Lord‟s Court. Attached to false attachments, the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence is lost.
The whole world is deceived by deception, coming and going in reincarnation. Within
the body is the fire of desire; through the Word of the Shabad, it is quenched. || 19 ||
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, the Guru is the tree of contentment, with flowers of
faith, and fruits of spiritual wisdom. Watered with the Lord‟s Love, it remains forever
green; through the karma of good deeds and meditation, it ripens. Honor is obtained by
eating this tasty dish; of all gifts, this is the greatest gift. || 1 || 


FIRST MEHL: The
Guru is the tree of gold, with leaves of coral, and blossoms of jewels and rubies. The
Words from His Mouth are fruits of jewels. Within His Heart, He beholds the Lord. O
Nanak, He is obtained by those, upon whose faces and foreheads such pre-recorded
destiny is written. The sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage are contained in the
constant worship of the feet of the Exalted Guru. Cruelty, material attachment, greed
and anger are the four rivers of fire. Falling into them, one is burned, O Nanak! One is
saved only by holding tight to good deeds. || 2 || 

PAUREE: While you are alive,
conquer death, and you shall have no regrets in the end. This world is false, but only a
few understand this. People do not enshrine love for the Truth; they chase after worldly
affairs instead. The terrible time of death and annihilation hovers over the heads of the
world. By the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, the Messenger of Death smashes his club
over their heads. The Lord Himself gives His Love, and enshrines it within their minds.
Not a moment or an instant‟s delay is permitted, when one‟s measure of life is full. By
Guru‟s Grace, one comes to know the True One, and is absorbed into Him. || 20 ||
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Bitter melon, swallow-wort, thorn-apple and nim fruit—these
bitter poisons lodge in the minds and mouths of those who do not remember You. O
Nanak, how shall I tell them this? Without the karma of good deeds, they are only
destroying themselves. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: The intellect is a bird; on account of its
actions, it is sometimes high, and sometimes low. 

Sometimes it is perched on the sandalwood tree, and sometimes it is on the branch of
the poisonous swallow-wort. Sometimes, it soars through the heavens. O Nanak, our
Lord and Master leads us on, according to the Hukam of His Command; such is His
Way. || 2 || 

PAUREE: Some speak and expound, and while speaking and lecturing,
they pass away. The Vedas speak and expound on the Lord, but they do not know His
limits. Not by studying, but through understanding, is the Lord‟s Mystery revealed.
There are six pathways in the Shaastras, but how rare are those who merge in the True
Lord through them. The True Lord is Unknowable; through the Word of His Shabad, we
are embellished. One who believes in the Name of the Infinite Lord, attains the Court of
the Lord. I humbly bow to the Creator Lord; I am a minstrel singing His Praises. Nanak
enshrines the Lord within his mind. He is the One, throughout the ages. || 21 ||
SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Those who charm scorpions and handle snakes only brand
themselves with their own hands. By the pre-ordained Order of our Lord and Master,
they are beaten badly, and struck down. If the self-willed manmukhs fight with the
Gurmukh, they are condemned by the Lord, the True Judge. He Himself is the Lord and
Master of both worlds. He beholds all and makes the exact determination. O Nanak,
know this well: everything is in accordance with His Will. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: O
Nanak, if someone judges himself, only then is he known as a real judge. If someone
understands both the disease and the medicine, only then is he a wise physician. Do
not involve yourself in idle business on the way; remember that you are only a guest
here. Speak with those who know the Primal Lord, and renounce your evil ways. That
virtuous person who does not walk in the way of greed, and who abides in Truth, is
accepted and famous. If an arrow is shot at the sky, how can it reach there? The sky
above is unreachable—know this well, O archer! || 2 ||

PAUREE: The soul-bride loves
her Husband Lord; she is embellished with His Love. She worships Him day and night;
she cannot be restrained from doing so. In the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, she has
made her home; she is adorned with the Word of His Shabad. She is humble, and she
offers her true and sincere prayer. She is beautiful in the Company of her Lord and
Master; she walks in the Way of His Will. With her dear friends, she offers her heart-felt
prayers to her Beloved. Cursed is that home, and shameful is that life, which is without
the Name of the Lord. But she who is adorned with the Word of His Shabad, drinks in
the Amrit of His Nectar. || 22 || 

SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: The desert is not satisfied by
rain, and the fire is not quenched by desire. The king is not satisfied with his kingdom,
and the oceans are full, but still they thirst for more. O Nanak, how many times must I
seek and ask for the True Name? || 1 || SECOND MEHL: Life is useless, as long as
one does not know the Lord God. Only a few cross over the world-ocean, by Guru‟s
Grace. The Lord is the All-powerful Cause of causes, says Nanak after deep deliberation.
The creation is subject to the Creator, who sustains it by His Almighty Power. || 2 ||
PAUREE: In the Court of the Lord and Master, His minstrels dwell. Singing the Praises
of their True Lord and Master, the lotuses of their hearts have blossomed forth.
Obtaining their Perfect Lord and Master, their minds are transfixed with ecstasy. Their
enemies have been driven out and subdued, and their friends are very pleased. Those
who serve the Truthful True Guru are shown the True Path. 

Reflecting on the True Word of the Shabad, death is overcome. Speaking the Unspoken
Speech of the Lord, one is adorned with the Word of His Shabad. Nanak holds tight to
the Treasure of Virtue, and meets with the Dear, Beloved Lord. || 23 || SHALOK,
FIRST MEHL: Born because of the karma of their past mistakes, they make more
mistakes, and fall into mistakes. By washing, their pollution is not removed, even
though they may wash hundreds of times. O Nanak, if God forgives, they are forgiven;
otherwise, they are kicked and beaten. || 1 || 

FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, it is absurd to
ask to be spared from pain by begging for comfort. Pleasure and pain are the two
garments given, to be worn in the Court of the Lord. Where you are bound to lose by
speaking, there, you ought to remain silent. || 2 || PAUREE: After looking around in
the four directions, I looked within my own self. There, I saw the True, Invisible Lord
Creator. I was wandering in the wilderness, but now the Guru has shown me the Way.
Hail to the True, True Guru, through whom we merge in the Truth. I have found the
jewel within the home of my own self; the lamp within has been lit. Those who praise
the True Word of the Shabad, abide in the peace of Truth. But those who do not have
the Fear of God, are overtaken by fear. They are destroyed by their own pride. Having
forgotten the Name, the world is roaming around like a wild demon. || 24 || SHALOK,
THIRD MEHL: In fear we are born, and in fear we die. Fear is always present in the
mind. O Nanak, if one dies in the fear of God, his coming into the world is blessed and
approved. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Without the fear of God, you may live very, very
long, and savor the most enjoyable pleasures. O Nanak, if you die without the fear of
God, you will arise and depart with a blackened face. || 2 || 


PAUREE: When the True
Guru is merciful, then your desires will be fulfilled. When the True Guru is merciful, you
will never grieve. When the True Guru is merciful, you will know no pain. When the
True Guru is merciful, you will enjoy the Lord‟s Love. When the True Guru is merciful,
then why should you fear death? When the True Guru is merciful, the body is always at
peace. When the True Guru is merciful, the nine treasures are obtained. When the True
Guru is merciful, you shall be absorbed in the True Lord. || 25 || 

SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: They pluck the hair out of their heads, and drink in filthy water; they beg
endlessly and eat the garbage which others have thrown away. They spread manure,
they suck in rotting smells, and they are afraid of clean water. Their hands are smeared
with ashes, and the hair on their heads is plucked out—they are like sheep! They have
renounced the lifestyle of their mothers and fathers, and their families and relatives cry
out in distress. No one offers the rice dishes at their last rites, and no one lights the
lamps for them. After their death, where will they be sent? The sixty-eight sacred
shrines of pilgrimage give them no place of protection, and no Brahmin will eat their
food. They remain polluted forever, day and night; they do not apply the ceremonial
tilak mark to their foreheads. They sit together in silence, as if in mourning; they do not
go to the Lord‟s Court. With their begging bowls hanging from their waists, and their
fly-brushes in their hands, they walk along in single file. They are not Yogis, and they
are not Jangams, followers of Shiva. 

They are not Qazis or Mullahs. Ruined by the Merciful Lord, they wander around in disgrace, and their entire troop is contaminated. The Lord alone kills and restores to life; no one else can protect anyone from Him. They go without giving alms or any cleansing baths; their shaven heads become covered with dust. The jewel emerged from the water, when the mountain of gold was used to churn it. The gods established the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where the festivals are celebrated and hymns are chanted. After bathing, the Muslims recite their prayers, and after bathing, the Hindus perform their worship services. 

The wise always take cleansing baths. At the time of death, and at the time of birth, they are purified, when water is poured on their heads. O Nanak, the shaven-headed ones are devils. They are not pleased to hear these words. When it rains, there is happiness. Water is the key to all life. When it rains, the corn grows, and the sugar cane, and the cotton, which provides clothing for all. When it rains, the cows always have grass to graze upon, and housewives can churn the milk into butter. With that ghee, sacred feasts and worship services are performed; all these efforts are blessed. The Guru is the ocean, and all His Teachings are the river. Bathing within it, glorious greatness is obtained. O Nanak, if the shavenheaded ones do not bathe, then seven handfuls of ashes are upon their heads. || 1 ||

SECOND MEHL: What can the cold do to the fire? How can the night affect the sun?
What can the darkness do to the moon? What can social status do to air and water?
What are personal possessions to the earth, from which all things are produced? O
Nanak, he alone is known as honorable, whose honor the Lord preserves. || 2 ||

PAUREE: It is of You, O my True and Wondrous Lord, that I sing forever. Yours is the
True Court. All others are subject to coming and going. Those who ask for the gift of
the True Name are like You. Your Command is True; we are adorned with the Word of
Your Shabad. Through faith and trust, we receive spiritual wisdom and meditation from
You. By Your Grace, the banner of honor is obtained. It cannot be taken away or lost.
You are the True Giver; You give continually. Your Gifts continue to increase. Nanak
begs for that gift which is pleasing to You. || 26 || 

SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Those
who have accepted the Guru‟s Teachings, and who have found the path, remain
absorbed in the Praises of the True Lord. What teachings can be imparted to those who
have the Divine Guru Nanak as their Guru? || 1 ||


FIRST MEHL: We understand the Lord only when He Himself inspires us to understand Him. He alone knows everything,
unto whom the Lord Himself gives knowledge. One may talk and preach and give
sermons but still yearn after Maya. The Lord, by the Hukam of His Command, has
created the entire creation. He Himself knows the inner nature of all. O Nanak, He
Himself uttered the Word. Doubt departs from one who receives this gift. || 2 ||
PAUREE: I was a minstrel, out of work, when the Lord took me into His service. To sing
His Praises day and night, He gave me His Order, right from the start. My Lord and
Master has summoned me, His minstrel, to the True Mansion of His Presence. He has
dressed me in the robes of His True Praise and Glory. The Ambrosial Nectar of the True
Name has become my food. Those who follow the Guru‟s Teachings, who eat this food
and are satisfied, find peace. His minstrel spreads His Glory, singing and vibrating the
Word of His Shabad. O Nanak, praising the True Lord, I have obtained His Perfection.
