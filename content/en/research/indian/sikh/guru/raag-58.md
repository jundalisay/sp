|| 8 || 3 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL, DAKHNEE: Ahalyaa was the wife of Gautam the seer.
Seeing her, Indra was enticed. When he received a thousand marks of disgrace on his
body, then he felt regret in his mind. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, no one knowingly
makes mistakes. He alone is mistaken, whom the Lord Himself makes so. He alone
understands, whom the Lord causes to understand. || 1 || Pause || Harichand, the
king and ruler of his land, did not appreciate the value of his pre-ordained destiny. If he
had known that it was a mistake, he would not have made such a show of giving in
charity, and he would not have been sold in the market. || 2 || The Lord took the
form of a dwarf, and asked for some land. If Bal the king has recognized Him, he would
not have been deceived, and sent to the underworld. || 3 || Vyaas taught and warned
the king Janmayjaa not to do three things. But he performed the sacred feast and killed
eighteen Brahmins; the record of one‟s past deeds cannot be erased. || 4 || I do not
try to calculate the account; I accept the Hukam of God‟s Command. I speak with
intuitive love and respect. No matter what happens, I will praise the Lord. It is all Your
Glorious Greatness, O Lord. || 5 || The Gurmukh remains detached; filth never
attaches itself to him. He remains forever in God‟s Sanctuary. The foolish self-willed
manmukh does not think of the future; he is overtaken by pain, and then he regrets. ||
6 || The Creator who created this creation acts, and causes all to act. O Lord,
egotistical pride does not depart from the soul. Falling into egotistical pride, one is
ruined. || 7 || Everyone makes mistakes; only the Creator does not make mistakes. O
Nanak, salvation comes through the True Name. By Guru‟s Grace, one is released. || 8
|| 4 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: To chant and listen to the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, is my Support. Worthless entanglements are ended and gone. The self-willed
manmukh, caught in duality, loses his honor. Except for the Name, I have no other at
all. || 1 || Listen, O blind, foolish, idiotic mind. Aren‟t you ashamed of your comings
and goings in reincarnation? Without the Guru, you shall drown, over and over again.
|| 1 || Pause || This mind is ruined by its attachment to Maya. The Command of the
Primal Lord is pre-ordained. Before whom should I cry? Only a few, as Gurmukh,
understand this. Without the Naam, no one is liberated. || 2 || People wander lost,
staggering and stumbling through 8.4 million incarnations. Without knowing the Guru,
they cannot escape the noose of Death. This mind, from one moment to the next, goes
from the heavens to the underworld. The Gurmukh contemplates the Naam, and is
released. || 3 || When God sends His Summons, there is no time to delay. When one
dies in the Word of the Shabad, he lives in peace. Without the Guru, no one
understands. The Lord Himself acts, and inspires all to act. || 4 || Inner conflict
comes to an end, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Through the Perfect True
Guru, one is intuitively absorbed into the Lord. This wobbling, unsteady mind is
stabilized, and one lives the lifestyle of true actions. || 5 || If someone is false within
his own self, then how can he be pure? How rare are those who wash with the Shabad.
How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, live the Truth. Their comings and goings in
reincarnation are over and done. 

|| 6 || Those who eat and drink the Fear of God, find the most excellent peace.
Associating with the humble servants of the Lord, they are carried across. They speak
the Truth, and lovingly inspire others to speak it as well. The Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad is the most excellent occupation. || 7 || Those who take the Lord‟s Praises as
their karma and Dharma, their honor and worship service — their sexual desire and
anger are burnt off in the fire. They taste the sublime essence of the Lord, and their
minds are drenched with it. Prays Nanak, there is no other at all. || 8 || 5 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: Chant the Lord‟s Name, and worship Him deep within
your being. Contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and no other. || 1 || The
One is pervading all places. I do not see any other; unto whom should I offer worship?
|| 1 || Pause || I place my mind and body in offering before You; I dedicate my soul
to You. As it pleases You, You save me, Lord; this is my prayer. || 2 || True is that
tongue which is delighted by the sublime essence of the Lord. Following the Guru‟s
Teachings, one is saved in the Sanctuary of God. || 3 || My God created religious
rituals. He placed the glory of the Naam above these rituals. || 4 || The four great
blessings are under the control of the True Guru. When the first three are put aside,
one is blessed with the fourth. || 5 || Those whom the True Guru blesses with
liberation and meditation realize the Lord‟s State, and become sublime. || 6 || Their
minds and bodies are cooled and soothed; the Guru imparts this understanding. Who
can estimate the value of those whom God has exalted? || 7 || Says Nanak, the Guru
has imparted this understanding; without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one is
emancipated. || 8 || 6 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: Some are forgiven by the
Primal Lord God; the Perfect Guru makes the true making. Those who are attuned to
the Love of the Lord are imbued with Truth forever; their pains are dispelled, and they
obtain honor. || 1 || False are the clever tricks of the evil-minded. They shall
disappear in no time at all. || 1 || Pause || Pain and suffering afflict the self-willed
manmukh. The pains of the self-willed manmukh shall never depart. The Gurmukh
recognizes the Giver of pleasure and pain. He merges in His Sanctuary. || 2 || The
self-willed manmukhs do not know loving devotional worship; they are insane, rotting
away in their egotism. This mind flies in an instant from the heavens to the underworld,
as long as it does not know the Word of the Shabad. || 3 || The world has become
hungry and thirsty; without the True Guru, it is not satisfied. Merging intuitively in the
Celestial Lord, peace is obtained, and one goes to the Lord‟s Court wearing robes of
honor. || 4 || The Lord in His Court is Himself the Knower and Seer; the Word of the
Guru‟s Bani is Immaculate. He Himself is the Awareness of Truth; He Himself
understands the state of nirvaanaa. || 5 || He made the waves of water, the fire and
the air, and then joined the three together to form the world. He blessed these
elements with such power, that they remain subject to His Command. || 6 || How
rare are those humble beings in this world, whom the Lord tests and places in His
Treasury. They rise above social status and color, and rid themselves of possessiveness
and greed. || 7 || Attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they are like
immaculate sacred shrines; they are rid of the pain and pollution of egotism. 

Nanak washes the feet of those who, as Gurmukh, love the True Lord. || 8 || 7 ||

PRABHAATEE, THIRD MEHL, BIBHAAS:

By Guru‟s Grace, see that the Temple of the Lord is within you. The Temple of the Lord
is found through the Word of the Shabad; contemplate the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || O my
mind, be joyfully attuned to the Shabad. True is devotional worship, and True is the
Temple of the Lord; True is His Manifest Glory. || 1 || Pause || This body is the
Temple of the Lord, in which the jewel of spiritual wisdom is revealed. The self-willed
manmukhs do not know anything at all; they do not believe that the Lord‟s Temple is
within. || 2 || The Dear Lord created the Temple of the Lord; He adorns it by His Will.
All act according to their pre-ordained destiny; no one can erase it. || 3 ||
Contemplating the Shabad, peace is obtained, loving the True Name. The Temple of the
Lord is embellished with the Shabad; it is an Infinite Fortress of God. || 4 || This
world is the Temple of the Lord; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. The
blind and foolish self-willed manmukhs worship in the love of duality. || 5 || One‟s
body and social status do not go along to that place, where all are called to account.
Those who are attuned to Truth are saved; those in the love of duality are miserable.
|| 6 || The treasure of the Naam is within the Temple of the Lord. The idiotic fools do
not realize this. By Guru‟s Grace, I have realized this. I keep the Lord enshrined within
my heart. || 7 || Those who are attuned to the love of the Shabad know the Guru,
through the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. Sacred, pure and immaculate are those humble
beings who are absorbed in the Name of the Lord. || 8 || The Temple of the Lord is
the Lord‟s Shop; He embellishes it with the Word of His Shabad. In that shop is the
merchandise of the One Name; the Gurmukhs adorn themselves with it. || 9 || The
mind is like iron slag, within the Temple of the Lord; it is lured by the love of duality.
Meeting with the Guru, the Philosopher‟s Stone, the mind is transformed into gold. Its
value cannot be described. || 10 || The Lord abides within the Temple of the Lord. He
is pervading in all. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs trade in the merchandise of Truth. || 11 ||
1 || PRABHAATEE, THIRD MEHL: Those who remain awake and aware in the Love
and Fear of God, rid themselves of the filth and pollution of egotism. They remain
awake and aware forever, and protect their homes, by beating and driving out the five
thieves. || 1 || O my mind, as Gurmukh, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. O mind, do only those deeds which will lead you to the Path of the Lord. || 1 ||
Pause || The celestial melody wells up in the Gurmukh, and the pains of egotism are
taken away. The Name of the Lord abides in the mind, as one intuitively sings the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 2 || Those who follow the Guru‟s Teachings — their
faces are radiant and beautiful. They keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts. Here and
hereafter, they find absolute peace; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, they are
carried across to the other shore. 

|| 3 || In egotism, one cannot remain awake and aware, and one‟s devotional worship
of the Lord is not accepted. The self-willed manmukhs find no place in the Court of the
Lord; they do their deeds in the love of duality. || 4 || Cursed is the food, and cursed
are the clothes, of those who are attached to the love of duality. They are like maggots
in manure, sinking into manure. In death and rebirth, they are wasted away to ruin. ||
5 || I am a sacrifice to those who meet with the True Guru. I shall continue to
associate with them; devoted to Truth, I am absorbed in Truth. || 6 || By perfect
destiny, the Guru is found. He cannot be found by any efforts. Through the True Guru,
intuitive wisdom wells up; through the Word of the Shabad, egotism is burnt away. || 7
|| O my mind, hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord; He is Potent to do everything. O
Nanak, never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Whatever He does, comes to
pass. || 8 || 2 || 7 || 2 || 9 ||

BIBHAAS, PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL, ASHTAPADEES:

Mother, father, siblings, children and spouse — involved with them, people eat the food
of bliss. The mind is entangled in sweet emotional attachment. Those who seek God‟s
Glorious Virtues are the support of my breath of life. || 1 || My One Lord is the InnerKnower, the Searcher of hearts. He alone is my Support; He is my only Protection. My
Great Lord and Master is over and above the heads of kings. || 1 || Pause || I have
broken my ties to that deceitful serpent. The Guru has told me that it is false and
fraudulent. Its face is sweet, but it tastes very bitter. My mind remains satisfied with the
Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 2 || I have broken my ties with greed and
emotional attachment. The Merciful Guru has rescued me from them. These cheating
thieves have plundered so many homes. The Merciful Guru has protected and saved
me. || 3 || I have no dealings whatsoever with sexual desire and anger. I listen to the
Guru‟s Teachings. Wherever I look, I see the most horrible goblins. My Guru, the Lord
of the World, has saved me from them. || 4 || I have made widows of the ten
sensory organs. The Guru has told me that these pleasures are the fires of corruption.
Those who associate with them go to hell. The Guru has saved me; I am lovingly
attuned to the Lord. || 5 || I have forsaken the advice of my ego. The Guru has told
me that this is foolish stubbornness. This ego is homeless; it shall never find a home.
The Guru has saved me; I am lovingly attuned to the Lord. || 6 || I have become
alienated from these people. We cannot both live together in one home. Grasping the
hem of the Guru‟s Robe, I have come to God. Please be fair with me, All-knowing Lord
God. || 7 || God smiled at me and spoke, passing judgement. He made all the
demons perform service for me. You are my Lord and Master; all this home belongs to
You. Says Nanak, the Guru has passed judgement. || 8 || 1 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH
MEHL: 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1348 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Within the mind are sexual desire, emotional attachment and egotism. Worship services
are performed with great pomp and ceremony. Ritual cleansing baths are taken, and
sacred marks are applied to the body. But still, the filth and pollution within never
depart. || 1 || No one has ever found God in this way. The sacred mudras —
ritualistic hand gestures — are made, but the mind remains enticed by Maya. || 1 ||
Pause || They commit sins, under the influence of the five thieves. They bathe at
sacred shrines, and claim that everything has been washed off. Then they commit them
again, without fear of the consequences. The sinners are bound and gagged, and
taken to the City of Death. || 2 || The ankle-bells shake and the cymbals vibrate, but
those who have deception within wander lost like demons. By destroying its hole, the
snake is not killed. God, who created you, knows everything. || 3 || You worship fire
and wear saffron colored robes. Stung by your misfortune, you abandon your home.
Leaving your own country, you wander in foreign lands. But you bring the five rejects
with you. || 4 || You have split your ears, and now you steal crumbs. You beg from
door to door, but you fail to be satisfied. You have abandoned your own wife, but now
you sneak glances at other women. God is not found by wearing religious robes; you
are utterly miserable! || 5 || He does not speak; he is on silence. But he is filled with
desire; he is made to wander in reincarnation. Abstaining from food, his body suffers in
pain. He does not realize the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command; he is afflicted by
possessiveness. || 6 || Without the True Guru, no one has attained the supreme
status. Go ahead and ask all the Vedas and the Simritees. The self-willed manmukhs do
useless deeds. They are like a house of sand, which cannot stand. || 7 || One unto
whom the Lord of the Universe becomes Merciful, sews the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad
into his robes. Out of millions, it is rare that such a Saint is seen. O Nanak, with him, we
are carried across. || 8 || If one has such good destiny, then the Blessed Vision of His
Darshan is obtained. He saves himself, and carries across all his family as well. || 1 ||
SECOND PAUSE || 2 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: Meditating in remembrance on
the Naam, all the residues of sinful mistakes are erased. The accounts held by the
Righteous Judge of Dharma are torn up. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, I have found the Sublime Essence of the Lord. The Supreme Lord God has melted
into my heart. || 1 || Dwelling on the Lord, Har, Har, I have found peace. Your slaves
seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. || 1 || Pause || The cycle of reincarnation is
ended, and darkness is dispelled. The Guru has revealed the door of liberation. My mind
and body are forever imbued with loving devotion to the Lord. Now I know God,
because He has made me know Him. || 2 || He is contained in each and every heart.
Without Him, there is no one at all. Hatred, conflict, fear and doubt have been
eliminated. God, the Soul of Pure Goodness, has manifested His Righteousness. || 3 ||
He has rescued me from the most dangerous waves. Separated from Him for countless
lifetimes, I am united with Him once again. Chanting, intense meditation and strict selfdiscipline are the contemplation of the Naam. My Lord and Master has blessed me with
His Glance of Grace. || 4 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1349 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Bliss, peace and salvation are found in that place, where the servants of the Lord of the
World abide. God, the Lord of the World, is pleased and satisfied with me. My
disharmony with Him of so many lifetimes is ended. || 5 || Burnt offerings, sacred
feasts, intense meditations with the body upside-down, worship services and taking
millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage — the merits of all these are
obtained by enshrining the Lord‟s Lotus Feet within the heart, even for an instant.
Meditating on the Lord of the Universe, all one‟s affairs are resolved. || 6 || God‟s
Place is the highest of the high. The Lord‟s humble servants intuitively focus their
meditation on Him. I long for the dust of the slaves of the Lord‟s slaves. My Beloved
Lord is overflowing with all powers. || 7 || My Beloved Lord, my Mother and Father, is
always near. O my Friend and Companion, You are my Trusted Support. God takes His
slaves by the hand, and makes them His Own. Nanak lives by meditating on the Lord,
the Treasure of Virtue. || 8 || 3|| 2 || 7 || 12 ||
BIBHAAS, PRABHAATEE, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE KABEER JEE:

My anxious fears of death and rebirth have been taken away. The Celestial Lord has
shown His Love for me. || 1 || The Divine Light has dawned, and darkness has been
dispelled. Contemplating the Lord, I have obtained the Jewel of His Name. || 1 ||
Pause || Pain runs far away from that place where there is bliss. The jewel of the
mind is focused and attuned to the essence of reality. || 2 || Whatever happens is by
the Pleasure of Your Will. Whoever understands this, is intuitively merged in the Lord.
|| 3 || Says Kabeer, the residues of my sinful mistakes have been obliterated. My mind
has merged into the Lord, the Life of the World. || 4 || 1 || PRABHAATEE: If the Lord
Allah lives only in the mosque, then to whom does the rest of the world belong?
According to the Hindus, the Lord‟s Name abides in the idol, but there is no truth in
either of these claims. || 1 || O Allah, O Raam, I live by Your Name. Please show
mercy to me, O Master. || 1 || Pause || The God of the Hindus lives in the southern
lands, and the God of the Muslims lives in the west. So search in your heart — look
deep into your heart of hearts; this is the home and the place where God lives. || 2 ||
The Brahmins observe twenty-four fasts during the year, and the Muslims fast during
the month of Ramadaan. The Muslims set aside eleven months, and claim that the
treasure is only in the one month. || 3 || What is the use of bathing at Orissa? Why
do the Muslims bow their heads in the mosque? If someone has deception in his heart,
what good is it for him to utter prayers? And what good is it for him to go on pilgrimage
to Mecca? || 4 || You fashioned all these men and women, Lord. All these are Your
Forms. Kabeer is the child of God, Allah, Raam. All the Gurus and prophets are mine. ||
5 || Says Kabeer, listen, O men and women: seek the Sanctuary of the One. Chant the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, O mortals, and you shall surely be carried across. || 6 ||
2 || PRABHAATEE: First, Allah created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He
made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is
good, and who is bad? 

|| 1 || O people, O Siblings of Destiny, do not wander deluded by doubt. The Creation
is in the Creator, and the Creator is in the Creation, totally pervading and permeating all
places. || 1 || Pause || The clay is the same, but the Fashioner has fashioned it in
various ways. There is nothing wrong with the pot of clay — there is nothing wrong
with the Potter. || 2 || The One True Lord abides in all; by His making, everything is
made. Whoever realizes the Hukam of His Command, knows the One Lord. He alone is
said to be the Lord‟s slave. || 3 || The Lord Allah is Unseen; He cannot be seen. The
Guru has blessed me with this sweet molasses. Says Kabeer, my anxiety and fear have
been taken away; I see the Immaculate Lord pervading everywhere. || 4 || 3 ||
PRABHAATEE: Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who
do not contemplate them are false. You say that the One Lord is in all, so why do you
kill chickens? || 1 || O Mullah, tell me: is this God‟s Justice? The doubts of your mind
have not been dispelled. || 1 || Pause || You seize a living creature, and then bring
it home and kill its body; you have killed only the clay. The light of the soul passes into
another form. So tell me, what have you killed? || 2 || And what good are your
purifications? Why do you bother to wash your face? And why do you bother to bow
your head in the mosque? Your heart is full of hypocrisy; what good are your prayers or
your pilgrimage to Mecca? || 3 || You are impure; you do not understand the Pure
Lord. You do not know His Mystery. Says Kabeer, you have missed out on paradise;
your mind is set on hell. || 4 || 4 || PRABHAATEE: Hear my prayer, Lord; You are the
Divine Light of the Divine, the Primal, All-pervading Master. The Siddhas in Samaadhi
have not found Your limits. They hold tight to the Protection of Your Sanctuary. || 1 ||
Worship and adoration of the Pure, Primal Lord comes by worshipping the True Guru, O
Siblings of Destiny. Standing at His Door, Brahma studies the Vedas, but he cannot see
the Unseen Lord. || 1 || Pause || With the oil of knowledge about the essence of
reality, and the wick of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, this lamp illluminates my
body. I have applied the Light of the Lord of the Universe, and lit this lamp. God the
Knower knows. || 2 || The Unstruck Melody of the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal
Sounds, vibrates and resounds. I dwell with the Lord of the World. Kabeer, Your slave,
performs this Aartee, this lamp-lit worship service for You, O Formless Lord of
Nirvaanaa. || 3 || 5 ||
PRABHAATEE, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE NAAM DAYV JEE:

The mind alone knows the state of the mind; I tell it to the Knowing Lord. I chant the
Name of the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts — why should I be afraid?
|| 1 || My mind is pierced through by the love of the Lord of the World. My God is Allpervading everywhere. || 1 || Pause || The mind is the shop, the mind is the town,
and the mind is the shopkeeper. The mind abides in various forms, wandering all across
the world. || 2 || This mind is imbued with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and
duality is easily overcome.


He Himself is the Commander; all are under His Command. The Fearless Lord looks on
all alike. || 3 || That humble being who knows, and meditates on the Supreme Primal
Being — his word becomes eternal. Says Naam Dayv, I have found the Invisible,
Wondrous Lord, the Life of the World, within my heart. || 4 || 1 || PRABHAATEE: He
existed in the beginning, in the primeval age, and all throughout the ages; His limits
cannot be known. The Lord is pervading and permeating amongst all; this is how His
Form can be described. || 1 || The Lord of the Universe appears when the Word of
His Shabad is chanted. My Lord is the Embodiment of Bliss. || 1 || Pause || The
beautiful fragrance of sandalwood emanates from the sandalwood tree, and attaches to
the other trees of the forest. God, the Primal Source of everything, is like the
sandalwood tree; He transforms us woody trees into fragrant sandalwood. || 2 ||
You, O Lord, are the Philosopher‟s Stone, and I am iron; associating with You, I am
transformed into gold. You are Merciful; You are the gem and the jewel. Naam Dayv is
absorbed in the Truth. || 3 || 2 || PRABHAATEE: The Primal Being has no ancestry;
He has staged this play. God is hidden deep within each and every heart. || 1 || No
one knows the Light of the soul. Whatever I do, is known to You, Lord. || 1 || Pause
|| Just as the pitcher is made from clay, everything is made from the Beloved Divine
Creator Himself. || 2 || The mortal‟s actions hold the soul in the bondage of karma.
Whatever he does, he does on his own. || 3 || Prays Naam Dayv, whatever this soul
wants, it obtains. Whoever abides in the Lord, becomes immortal.

 || 4 || 3 ||
PRABHAATEE, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE BAYNEE JEE:

You rub your body with sandalwood oil, and place basil leaves on your forehead. But
you hold a knife in the hand of your heart. You look like a thug; pretending to meditate,
you pose like a crane. You try to look like a Vaishnaav, but the breath of life escapes
through your mouth. || 1 || You pray for hours to God the Beautiful. But your gaze is
evil, and your nights are wasted in conflict. || 1 || Pause || You perform daily
cleansing rituals, wear two loin-cloths, perform religious rituals and put only milk in your
mouth. But in your heart, you have drawn out the sword. You routinely steal the
property of others. || 2 || You worship the stone idol, and paint ceremonial marks of
Ganesha. You remain awake throughout the night, pretending to worship God. You
dance, but your consciousness is filled with evil. You are lewd and depraved — this is
such an unrighteous dance! || 3 || You sit on a deer-skin, and chant on your mala.
You put the sacred mark, the tilak, on your forehead. You wear the rosary beads of
Shiva around your neck, but your heart is filled with falsehood. You are lewd and
depraved — you do not chant God‟s Name. || 4 || Whoever does not realize the
essence of the soul — all his religious actions are hollow and false. Says Baynee, as
Gurmukh, meditate. Without the True Guru, you shall not find the Way. || 5 || 1 ||
