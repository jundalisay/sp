RAAG NAT NAARAAYAN, FOURTH MEHL: IMAGE OF THE UNDYING. BEYOND BIRTH. SELF-EXISTENT.

O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, day and night. Millions and millions of sins and
mistakes, committed through countless lifetimes, shall all be put aside and sent away.
|| 1 || Pause || Those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and worship Him
in adoration, and serve Him with love, are genuine. All their sinful residues and
mistakes are erased, just as water washes off the dirt. || 1 || That being, who sings
the Lord‟s Praises each and every instant, chants with his mouth the Name of the Lord.
In a moment, in an instant, the Lord rids him of the five incurable diseases of the bodyvillage. || 2 || Very fortunate are those who meditate on the Lord‟s Name; they alone are the Lord‟s devotees. I beg for the Sangat, the Congregation; O God, please bless
me with them. I am a fool, and an idiot — please save me! || 3 || Shower me with
Your Mercy and Grace, O Life of the World; save me, I seek Your Sanctuary. Servant
Nanak has entered Your Sanctuary; O Lord, please preserve my honor! || 4 || 1 ||
NAT, FOURTH MEHL: Meditating on the Lord, His humble servants are blended with
the Lord‟s Name. Chanting the Lord‟s Name, following the Guru‟s Teachings, the Lord
showers His Mercy upon them. || 1 || Pause || Our Lord and Master, Har, Har, is
inaccessible and unfathomable. Meditating on Him, His humble servant merges with
Him, like water with water. Meeting with the Lord‟s Saints, I have obtained the sublime
essence of the Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to His humble servants. || 1 || The
Lord‟s humble servant sings the Praises of the Name of the Supreme, Primal Soul, and
all poverty and pain are destroyed. Within the body are the five evil and uncontrollable
passions. The Lord destroys them in an instant. || 2 || The Lord‟s Saint loves the Lord
in his mind, like the lotus flower gazing at the moon. The clouds hang low, the clouds
tremble with thunder, and the mind dances joyfully like the peacock. || 3 || My Lord
and Master has placed this yearning within me; I live by seeing and meeting my Lord.
Servant Nanak is addicted to the intoxication of the Lord; meeting with the Lord, he
finds sublime bliss. || 4 || 2 || NAT, FOURTH MEHL: 

O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, your only Friend. By Guru‟s Grace, I
meditate on the Name of the Lord; I wash the Feet of the True Guru. || 1 || Pause ||
The Exalted Lord of the World, the Master of the Universe, keeps a sinner like me in His
Sanctuary. You are the Greatest Being, Lord, Destroyer of the pains of the meek; You
have placed Your Name in my mouth, Lord. || 1 || I am lowly, but I sing the Lofty
Praises of the Lord, meeting with the Guru, the True Guru, my Friend. Like the bitter
nimm tree, growing near the sandalwood tree, I am permeated with the fragrance of
sandalwood. || 2 || My faults and sins of corruption are countless; over and over
again, I commit them. I am unworthy, I am a heavy stone sinking down; but the Lord
has carried me across, in association with His humble servants. || 3 || Those whom
You save, Lord — all their sins are destroyed. O Merciful God, Lord and Master of
servant Nanak, You have carried across even evil villains like Harnaakhash. || 4 || 3 ||
NAT, FOURTH MEHL: O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with love.
When the Lord of the Universe, Har, Har, granted His Grace, then I fell at the feet of
the humble, and I meditate on the Lord. || 1 || Pause || Mistaken and confused for
so many past lives, I have now come and entered the Sanctuary of God. O my Lord and
Master, You are the Cherisher of those who come to Your Sanctuary. I am such a great
sinner — please save me! || 1 || Associating with You, Lord, who would not be
saved? Only God sanctifies the sinners. Naam Dayv, the calico printer, was driven out
by the evil villains, as he sang Your Glorious Praises; O God, You protected the honor of
Your humble servant. || 2 || Those who sing Your Glorious Praises, O my Lord and
Master — I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to them. Those houses and homes are
sanctified, upon which the dust of the feet of the humble settles. || 3 || I cannot
describe Your Glorious Virtues, God; You are the greatest of the great, O Great Primal
Lord God. Please shower Your Mercy upon servant Nanak, God; I serve at the feet of
Yor humble servants. || 4 || 4 || NAT, FOURTH MEHL: O my mind, believe in and
chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. God, the Master of the Universe, has showered
His Mercy upon me, and through the Guru‟s Teachings, my intellect has been molded
by the Naam. || 1 || Pause || The Lord‟s humble servant sings the Praises of the
Lord, Har, Har, listening to the Guru‟s Teachings. The Lord‟s Name cuts down sinful
residues and mistakes, like the farmer cutting down his crops. || 1 || You alone know
Your Praises, God; I cannot even describe Your Glorious Virtues, Lord. You are what
You are, God; You alone know Your Glorious Virtues, God. || 2 || The mortals are
bound by the many bonds of Maya‟s noose. Meditating on the Lord, the knot is untied,
like the elephant, which was caught in the water by the crococile; it remembered the
Lord, and chanted the Lord‟s Name, and was released. || 3 || O my Lord and Master,
Supreme Lord God, Transcendent Lord, throughout the ages, mortals search for You.
Your extent cannot be estimated or known, O Great God of servant Nanak. || 4 || 5 ||
NAT, FOURTH MEHL: O my mind, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the
Lord‟s Praises is worthy and commendable. 


When the Merciful Lord God shows kindness and compassion, then one falls at the feet
of the True Guru, and meditates on the Lord. || 1 || Pause || O my Lord and Master,
You are great, inaccessible and unfathomable; all meditate on You, O Beautiful Lord.
Those whom You view with Your Great Eye of Grace, meditate on You, Lord, and
become Gurmukh. || 1 || The expanse of this creation is Your work, O God, my Lord
and Master, Life of the entire universe, united with all. Countless waves rise up from
the water, and then they merge into the water again. || 2 || You alone, God, know
whatever You do. O Lord, I do not know. I am Your child; please enshrine Your Praises
within my heart, God, so that I may remember You in meditation. || 3 || You are the
treasure of water, O Lord, the Maansarovar Lake. Whoever serves You receives all
fruitful rewards. Servant Nanak longs for the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har; bless him, Lord,
with Your Mercy. || 4 || 6 ||

NAT NAARAAYAN, FOURTH MEHL, PARTAAL:

O my mind, serve the Lord, and receive the fruits of your rewards. Receive the dust of
the Guru‟s feet. All poverty will be eliminated, and your pains will disappear. The Lord
shall bless you with His Glance of Grace, and you shall be enraptured. || 1 || Pause ||
The Lord Himself embellishes His household. The Lord‟s Mansion of Love is studded
with countless jewels, the jewels of the Beloved Lord. The Lord Himself has granted His
Grace, and He has come into my home.The Guru is my advocate before the Lord.
Gazing upon the Lord, I have become blissful, blissful, blissful. || 1 || From the Guru,
I received news of the Lord‟s arrival. My mind and body became ecstatic and blissful,
hearing of the arrival of the Lord, my Beloved Love, my Lord. Servant Nanak has met
with the Lord, Har, Har; he is intoxicated, enraptured, enraptured. || 2 || 1 || 7 ||
NAT, FOURTH MEHL: O mind, join the Society of the Saints, and become noble and
exalted. Listen to the Unspoken Speech of the peace-giving Lord. All sinful residues and
mistakes will be washed away. Meet with the Lord, according to your pre-ordained
destiny. || 1 || Pause || In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praise
is lofty and exalted. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, the intellect dwells on the sermon
of the Lord. I am a sacrifice to that person who listens and believes. || 1 || One who
tastes the sublime essence of the Unspoken Speech of the Lord — all his hunger is
satisfied. Servant Nanak listens to the sermon of the Lord, and is satisfied; chanting the
Lord‟s Name, Har, Har, Har, he has become like the Lord. || 2 || 2 || 8 || NAT,
FOURTH MEHL: If only someone would come and tell me the Lord‟s sermon. I would
be a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to him. That humble servant of the Lord is the best
of the best. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 978 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Meeting with the Lord, you be enraptured. || 1 || Pause || The Guru, the Saint, has
shown me the Lord‟s Path. The Guru has shown me the way to walk on the Lord‟s Path.
Cast out deception from within yourself, O my Gursikhs, and without deception, serve
the Lord. You shall be enraptured, enraptured, enraptured. || 1 || Those Sikhs of the
Guru, who realize that my Lord God is with them, are pleasing to my Lord God. The
Lord God has blessed servant Nanak with understanding; seeing his Lord hear at hand,
his is enraptured, enraptured, enraptured, enraptured. || 2 || 3 || 9 ||
RAAG NAT NAARAAYAN, FIFTH MEHL:

O Lord, how can I know what pleases You? Within my mind is such a great thirst for the
Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. || 1 || Pause || He alone is a spiritual teacher, and
he alone is Your humble servant, to whom You have given Your approval. He alone
meditates on You forever and ever, O Primal Lord, O Architect of Destiny, unto whom
You grant Your Grace. || 1 || What sort of Yoga, what spiritual wisdom and
meditation, and what virtues please You? He alone is a humble servant, and he alone is
God‟s own devotee, with whom You are in love. || 2 || That alone is intelligence, that
alone is wisdom and cleverness, which inspires one to never forget God, even for an
instant. Joining the Society of the Saints, I have found this peace, singing forever the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 3 || I have seen the Wondrous Lord, the embodiment
of supreme bliss, and now, I see nothing else at all. Says Nanak, the Guru has rubbed
sway the rust; now how could I ever enter the womb of reincarnation again? || 4 || 1
||
RAAG NAT NAARAAYAN, FIFTH MEHL, DU-PADAS:

I don‟t blame anyone else. Whatever You do is sweet to my mind. || 1 || Pause ||
Understanding and obeying Your Order, I have found peace; hearing, listening to Your
Name, I live. Here and hereafter, O Lord, You, only You. The Guru has implanted this
Mantra within me. || 1 || Since I came to realize this, I have been blessed with total
peace and pleasure. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, this has been
revealed to Nanak, and now, there is no other for him at all. || 2 || 1 || 2 ||
