CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED. NO FEAR. NO HATRED.
IMAGE OF THE UNDYING. BEYOND BIRTH. SELF-EXISTENT.
BY GURU‟S GRACE:
RAAG GOND, CHAU-PADAS, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

If, in his conscious mind, he places his hopes in the Lord, then he shall obtain the fruits
of all the many desires of his mind. The Lord knows everything which happens to the
soul. Not even an iota of one‟s effort goes to waste. Place your hopes in the Lord, O my
mind; the Lord and Master is pervading and permeating all. || 1 || O my mind, place
your hopes in the Lord of the World, the Master of the Universe. That hope which is
placed in any other than the Lord — that hope is fruitless, and totally useless. || 1 ||
Pause || That which you can see, Maya, and all attachment to family — don‟t place
your hopes in them, or your life will be wasted and lost. Nothing is in their hands; what
can these poor creatures do? By their actions, nothing can be done. O my mind, place
your hopes in the Lord, your Beloved, who shall carry you across, and save your whole
family as well. || 2 || If you place your hopes in any other, in any friend other than
the Lord, then you shall come to know that it is of no use at all. This hope placed in
other friends comes from the love of duality. In an instant, it is gone; it is totally false.
O my mind, place your hopes in the Lord, your True Beloved, who shall approve and
reward you for all your efforts. || 3 || Hope and desire are all Yours, O my Lord and
Master. 

As You inspire hope, so are the hopes held. Nothing is in the hands of anyone, O my
Lord and Master; such is the understanding the True Guru has given me to understand.
You alone know the hope of servant Nanak, O Lord; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of
the Lord‟s Darshan, he is satisfied. || 4 || 1 || GOND, FOURTH MEHL: Serve such a
Lord, and ever meditate on Him, who in an instant erases all sins and mistakes. If
someone forsakes the Lord and places his hopes in another, then all his service to the
Lord is rendered fruitless. O my mind, serve the Lord, the Giver of peace; serving Him,
all your hunger shall depart. || 1 || O my mind, place your faith in the Lord. Wherever
I go, my Lord and Master is there with me. The Lord saves the honor of His humble
servants and slaves. || 1 || Pause || If you tell your sorrows to another, then he, in
return, will tell you of his greater sorrows. So tell your sorrows to the Lord, your Lord
and Master, who shall instantly dispel your pain. Forsaking such a Lord God, if you tell
your sorrows to another, then you shall die of shame. || 2 || The relatives, friends
and siblings of the world that you see, O my mind, all meet with you for their own
purposes. And that day, when their self-interests are not served, on that day, they shall
not come near you. O my mind, serve your Lord, day and night; He shall help you in
good times and bad. || 3 || Why place your faith in anyone, O my mind, who cannot
come to your rescue at the last instant? Chant the Lord‟s Mantra, take the Guru‟s
Teachings, and meditate on Him. In the end, the Lord saves those who love Him in
their consciousness. Servant Nanak speaks: night and day, chant the Lord‟s Name, O
Saints; this is the only true hope for emancipation. || 4 || 2 || GOND, FOURTH
MEHL: Remembering the Lord in meditation, you shall find bliss and peace forever
deep within, and your mind will become tranquil and cool. It is like the harsh sun of
Maya, with its burning heat; seeing the moon, the Guru, its heat totally vanishes. || 1
|| O my mind, night and day, meditate, and chant the Lord‟s Name. Here and
hereafter, He shall protect you, everywhere; serve such a God forever. || 1 || Pause
|| Meditate on the Lord, who contains all treasures, O my mind; as Gurmukh, search
for the jewel, the Lord. Those who meditate on the Lord, find the Lord, my Lord and
Master; I wash the feet of those slaves of the Lord. || 2 || One who realizes the Word
of the Shabad, obtains the sublime essence of the Lord; such a Saint is lofty and
sublime, the greatest of the great. The Lord Himself magnifies the glory of that humble
servant. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 861 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
No one can lessen or decrease that glory, not even a bit. || 3 || He shall give you
peace, O my mind; meditate forever, every day on Him, with your palms pressed
together. Please bless servant Nanak with this one gift, O Lord, that Your feet may
dwell within my heart forever. || 4 || 3 || GOND, FOURTH MEHL: All the kings,
emperors, nobles, lords and chiefs are false and transitory, engrossed in duality —
know this well. The eternal Lord is permanent and unchanging; meditate on Him, O my
mind, and you shall be approved. || 1 || O my mind, vibrate, and meditate on the
Lord‟s Name, which shall be your defender forever. One who obtains the Mansion of the
Lord‟s Presence, through the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings — no one else‟s power is as
great as his. || 1 || Pause || All the wealthy, high class property owners which you
see, O my mind, shall vanish, like the fading color of the safflower. Serve the True,
Immaculate Lord forever, O my mind, and you shall be honored in the Court of the
Lord. || 2 || There are four castes: Brahmin, Kh‟shaatriya, Soodra and Vaishya, and
there are four stages of life. One who meditates on the Lord, is the most distinguished
and renowned. The poor castor oil plant, growing near the sandalwood tree, becomes
fragrant; in the same way, the sinner, associating with the Saints, becomes acceptable
and approved. || 3 || He, within whose heart the Lord abides, is the highest of all,
and the purest of all. Servant Nanak washes the feet of that humble servant of the
Lord; he may be from a low class family, but he is now the Lord‟s servant. || 4 || 4 ||
GOND, FOURTH MEHL: The Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is allpervading. As the Lord causes them to act, so do they act. So serve forever such a
Lord, O my mind, who will protect you from everything. || 1 || O my mind, meditate
on the Lord, and read about the Lord every day. Other than the Lord, no one can kill
you or save you; so why do you worry, O my mind? || 1 || Pause || The Creator
created the entire universe, and infused His Light into it. The One Lord speaks, and the
One Lord causes all to speak.The Perfect Guru has revealed the One Lord. || 2 || The
Lord is with you, inside and out; tell me, O mind, how can You hide anything from Him?
Serve the Lord open-heartedly, and then, O my mind, you shall find total peace. || 3 ||
Everything is under His control; He is the greatest of all. O my mind, meditate forever
on Him. O Servant Nanak, that Lord is always with you. Meditate forever on your Lord,
and He shall emancipate you. || 4 || 5 || GOND, FOURTH MEHL: My mind yearns so
deeply for the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, like the thirsty man without water.
|| 1 || My mind is pierced through by the arrow of the Lord‟s Love. The Lord God
knows my anguish, and the pain deep within my mind. || 1 || Pause || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 862 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Whoever tells me the Stories of my Beloved Lord is my Sibling of Destiny, and my
friend. || 2 || Come, and join together, O my companions; let‟s sing the Glorious
Praises of my God, and follow the comforting advice of the True Guru.. || 3 || Please
fulfill the hopes of servant Nanak, O Lord; his body finds peace and tranquility in the
Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan. || 4 || 6 || First set of six. ||
RAAG GOND, FIFTH MEHL, CHAU-PADAS, FIRST HOUSE:

He is the Creator of all, He is the Enjoyer of all. || 1 || Pause || The Creator listens,
and the Creator sees. The Creator is unseen, and the Creator is seen. The Creator
forms, and the Creator destroys. The Creator touches, and the Creator is detached. ||
1 || The Creator is the One who speaks, and the Creator is the One who understands.
The Creator comes, and the Creator also goes. The Creator is absolute and without
qualities; the Creator is related, with the most excellent qualities. By Guru‟s Grace,
Nanak looks upon all the same. || 2 || 1 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: You are caught, like
the fish and the monkey; you are entangled in the transitory world. Your foot-steps and
your breaths are numbered; only by singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord will you be
saved. || 1 || O mind, reform yourself, and forsake your aimless wandering. You have
found no place of rest for yourself; so why do you try to teach others? || 1 || Pause ||
Like the elephant, driven by sexual desire, you are attached to your family. People are
like birds that come together, and fly apart again; you shall become stable and steady,
only when you meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, in the Company of the Holy. || 2 ||
Like the fish, which perishes because of its desire to taste, the fool is ruined by his
greed. You have fallen under the power of the five thieves; escape is only possible in
the Sanctuary of the Lord. || 3 || Be Merciful to me, O Destroyer of the pains of the
meek; all beings and creatures belong to You. May I obtain the gift of always seeing the
Blessed Vision of Your Darshan; meeting with You, Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. ||
4 || 2 ||
RAAG GOND, FIFTH MEHL, CHAU-PADAS, SECOND HOUSE:

He fashioned the soul and the breath of life, and infused His Light into the dust; He
exalted you and gave you everything to use, and food to eat and enjoy — how can you
forsake that God, you fool! Where else will you go? || 1 || Commit yourself to the
service of the Transcendent Lord. Through the Guru, one understands the Immaculate,
Divine Lord. || 1 || Pause || He created plays and dramas of all sorts; He creates
and destroys in an instant; His state and condition cannot be described. Meditate
forever on that God, O my mind. || 2 || The unchanging Lord does not come or go.
His Glorious Virtues are infinite; how many of them can I count? 


His treasure is overflowing with the rubies of the Name. He gives Support to all hearts.
|| 3 || The Name is the True Primal Being; millions of sins are washed away in an
instant, singing His Praises. The Lord God is your best friend, your playmate from
earliest childhood. He is the Support of the breath of life; O Nanak, He is love, He is
consciousness. || 4 || 1 || 3 || || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: I trade in the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. The Naam is the Support of the mind. My consciousness takes to the
Shelter of the Naam. Chanting the Naam, millions of sins are erased. || 1 || The Lord
has blessed me with the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the One Lord. The wish of
my mind is to meditate on the Naam, in association with the Guru. || 1 || Pause ||
The Naam is the wealth of my soul. Wherever I go, the Naam is with me. The Naam is
sweet to my mind. In the water, on the land, and everywhere, I see the Naam. || 2 ||
Through the Naam, one‟s face becomes radiant in the Court of the Lord. Through the
Naam, all one‟s generations are saved. Through the Naam, my affairs are resolved. My
mind is accustomed to the Naam. || 3 || Through the Naam, I have become fearless.
Through the Naam, my comings and goings have ceased. The Perfect Guru has united
me with the Lord, the treasure of virtue. Says Nanak, I dwell in celestial peace. || 4 ||
2 || 4 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: He grants honor to the dishonored, and gives gifts to
all the hungry; he protects those in the terrible womb. So humbly bow forever to that
Lord and Master. || 1 || Meditate on such a God in your mind. He shall be your help
and support everywhere, in good times and bad. || 1 || Pause || The beggar and
the king are all the same to Him. He sustains and fulfills both the ant and the elephant.
He does not consult or seek anyone‟s advice. Whatever He does, He does Himself. || 2
|| No one knows His limit. He Himself is the Immaculate Lord. He Himself is formed,
and He Himself is formless. In the heart, in each and every heart, He is the Support of
all hearts. || 3 || Through the Love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the devotees
become His Beloveds. Singing the Praises of the Creator, the Saints are forever in bliss.
Through the Love of the Naam, the Lord‟s humble servants remain satisfied. Nanak falls
at the feet of those humble servants of the Lord. || 4 || 3 || 5 || GOND, FIFTH
MEHL: Associating with them, this mind becomes immaculate and pure. Associating
with them, one meditates in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har. Associating with
them, the residues of sinful mistakes are erased. Associating with them, the heart is
illumined. || 1 || Those Saints of the Lord are my friends. It is their custom to sing
only the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || By their mantra, the Lord,
Har, Har, dwells in the mind. By their teachings, doubt and fear are dispelled. By their
kirtan, they become immaculate and sublime. The world longs for the dust of their feet.
|| 2 || Millions of sinners are saved by associating with them. They have the Support
of the Name of the One Formless Lord. He knows the secrets of all beings; He is the
treasure of mercy, the divine immaculate Lord. || 3 || When the Supreme Lord God
becomes merciful, then one meets the Merciful Holy Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 864 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Day and night, Nanak meditates on the Naam. Through the Lord‟s Name, he is blessed
with peace, poise and bliss. || 4 || 4 || 6 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: Meditate on the
image of the Guru within your mind; let your mind accept the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, and His Mantra. Enshrine the Guru‟s feet within your heart. Bow in humility
forever before the Guru, the Supreme Lord God. || 1 || Let no one wander in doubt in
the world. Without the Guru, no one can cross over. || 1 || Pause || The Guru
shows the Path to those who have wandered off. He leads them to renounce others,
and attaches them to devotional worship of the Lord. He obliterates the fear of birth
and death. The glorious greatness of the Perfect Guru is endless. || 2 || By Guru‟s
Grace, the inverted heart-lotus blossoms forth, and the Light shines forth in the
darkness. Through the Guru, know the One who created you. By the Guru‟s Mercy, the
foolish mind comes to believe. || 3 || The Guru is the Creator; the Guru has the
power to do everything. The Guru is the Transcendent Lord; He is, and always shall be.
Says Nanak, God has inspired me to know this. Without the Guru, liberation is not
obtained, O Siblings of Destiny. || 4 || 5 || 7 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: Chant Guru,
Guru, Guru, O my mind. I have no other than the Guru. I lean upon the Support of the
Guru, day and night. No one can decrease His bounty. || 1 || Know that the Guru and
the Transcendent Lord are One. Whatever pleases Him is acceptable and approved. ||
1 || Pause || One whose mind is attached to the Guru‟s feet — his pains, sufferings
and doubts run away. Serving the Guru, honor is obtained. I am forever a sacrifice to
the Guru. || 2 || Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan, I am exalted.
The work of the Guru‟s servant is perfect. Pain does not afflict the Guru‟s servant. The
Guru‟s servant is famous in the ten directions. || 3 || The Guru‟s glory cannot be
described. The Guru remains absorbed in the Supreme Lord God. Says Nanak, one who
is blessed with perfect destiny — his mind is attached to the Guru‟s feet. || 4 || 6 || 8
|| GOND, FIFTH MEHL: I worship and adore my Guru; the Guru is the Lord of the
Universe. My Guru is the Supreme Lord God; the Guru is the Lord God. My Guru is
divine, invisible and mysterious. I serve at the Guru‟s feet, which are worshipped by all.
|| 1 || Without the Guru, I have no other place at all. Night and day, I chant the Name
of Guru, Guru. || 1 || Pause || The Guru is my spiritual wisdom, the Guru is the
meditation within my heart. The Guru is the Lord of the World, the Primal Being, the
Lord God. With my palms pressed together, I remain in the Guru‟s Sanctuary. Without
the Guru, I have no other at all. || 2 || The Guru is the boat to cross over the
terrifying world-ocean. Serving the Guru, one is released from the Messenger of Death.
In the darkness, the Guru‟s Mantra shines forth. With the Guru, all are saved. || 3 ||
The Perfect Guru is found, by great good fortune. Serving the Guru, pain does not
afflict anyone. No one can erase the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 865 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Nanak is the Guru; Nanak is the Lord Himself. || 4 || 7 || 9 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL:
Deal and trade only with the Lord, Raam, Raam. The Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, is the
Support of the breath of life. Sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord, Raam, Raam,
Raam. The Lord is ever-present, all-pervading. || 1 || Joining the humble Saints,
chant the Lord‟s Name. This is the most immaculate and perfect occupation of all. || 1
|| Pause || Gather the treasure, the wealth of the Lord, Raam, Raam. Let your
sustenance be the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. Never forget the Lord, Raam, Raam. In
His Mercy, the Guru has revealed this to me. || 2 || The Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, is
always our help and support. Embrace love for the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. Through
the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam, I have become immaculate. The sinful residues of
countless incarnations have been taken away. || 3 || Uttering the Lord‟s Name, birth
and death are finished. Repeating the Lord‟s Name, one crosses over the terrifying
world-ocean. The Luminous Lord is the highest of all. Night and day, servant Nanak
meditates on Him. || 4 || 8 || 10 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: My Lord and Master has
held back the five demons. He conquered them, and scared them away from the Lord‟s
slave. They cannot find the mansion of the Lord‟s devotee. Joining together, the Lord‟s
humble servants sing the songs of joy. || 1 || The five demons are the rulers of the
whole world, but they are just water-carriers for the Lord‟s devotee. || 1 || Pause ||
They collect taxes from the world, but they bow in subservience to God‟s devotees.
They plunder and dishonor the faithless cynics, but they massage and wash the feet of
the Holy. || 2 || The One Mother gave birth to the five sons, and began the play of
the created world. With the three qualities joined together, they celebrate. Renouncing
these three qualities, the Lord‟s humble servants rise above them. || 3 || In His
Mercy, He saves His humble servants. They belong to Him, and so He saves them by
driving out the five. Says Nanak, devotion to God is noble and sublime. Without
devotion, all just waste away uselessly. || 4 || 9 || 11 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL:
Suffering and troubles are eradicated by the Lord‟s Name. Pain is dispelled, and peace
takes its place. Meditating, chanting the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, I am
satisfied. By the Grace of the Saints, I have received all fruitful rewards. || 1 ||
Meditating on the Lord, His humble servant is carried across, and the sins of countless
incarnations are taken away. || 1 || Pause || I have enshrined the Guru‟s feet within
my heart, and crossed over the ocean of fire. All the painful diseases of birth and death
have been eradicated. I am attached to God in celestial Samaadhi. || 2 || In all places
and interspaces, the One, our Lord and Master is contained. He is the Inner-knower of
all hearts. One whom the Lord blesses with understanding, chants the Name of God,
twenty-four hours a day. || 3 || Deep within, God Himself abides; within his heart,
the Divine Light shines forth. With loving devotion, sing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises.
Meditate on the Supreme Lord God, O Nanak, and you shall be saved. || 4 || 10 || 12
|| 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 866 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
GOND, FIFTH MEHL: Bow in humility to the lotus feet of the Guru. Eliminate sexual
desire and anger from this body. Be the dust of all, and see the Lord in each and every
heart, in all. || 1 || In this way, dwell upon the Lord of the World, the Lord of the
Universe. My body and wealth belong to God; my soul belongs to God. || 1 || Pause
|| Twenty-four hours a day, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. This is the purpose
of human life. Renounce your egotistical pride, and know that God is with you. By the
Grace of the Holy, let your mind be imbued with the Lord‟s Love. || 2 || Know the
One who created you, and in the world hereafter you shall be honored in the Court of
the Lord. Your mind and body will be immaculate and blissful; chant the Name of the
Lord of the Universe with your tongue. || 3 || Grant Your Kind Mercy, O my Lord,
Merciful to the meek. My mind begs for the dust of the feet of the Holy. Be merciful,
and bless me with this gift, that Nanak may live, chanting God‟s Name. || 4 || 11 || 13
|| GOND, FIFTH MEHL: My incense and lamps are my service to the Lord. Time and
time again, I humbly bow to the Creator. I have renounced everything, and grasped the
Sanctuary of God. By great good fortune, the Guru has become pleased and satisfied
with me. || 1 || Twenty-four hours a day, I sing of the Lord of the Universe. My body
and wealth belong to God; my soul belongs to God. || 1 || Pause || Chanting the
Glorious Praises of the Lord, I am in bliss. The Supreme Lord God is the Perfect
Forgiver. Granting His Mercy, He has linked His humble servants to His service. He has
rid me of the pains of birth and death, and merged me with Himself. || 2 || This is
the essence of karma, righteous conduct and spiritual wisdom, to chant the Lord‟s
Name in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. God‟s Feet are the boat to cross
over the world-ocean. God, the Inner-knower, is the Cause of causes. || 3 ||
Showering His Mercy, He Himself has saved me. The five hideous demons have run
away. Do not lose your life in the gamble. The Creator Lord has taken Nanak‟s side. ||
4 || 12 || 14 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: In His Mercy, He has blessed me with peace
and bliss. The Divine Guru has saved His child. God is kind and compassionate; He is
the Lord of the Universe. He forgives all beings and creatures. || 1 || I seek Your
Sanctuary, O God, O Merciful to the meek. Meditating on the Supreme Lord God, I am
forever in ecstasy. || 1 || Pause || There is no other like the Merciful Lord God. He is
contained deep within each and every heart. He embellishes His slave, here and
hereafter. It is Your nature, God, to purify sinners. || 2 || Meditation on the Lord of
the Universe is the medicine to cure millions of illnesses. My Tantra and Mantra is to
meditate, to vibrate upon the Lord God. Illnesses and pains are dispelled, meditating on
God. The fruits of the mind‟s desires are fulfilled. || 3 || He is the Cause of causes,
the All-powerful Merciful Lord. Contemplating Him is the greatest of all treasures. God
Himself has forgiven Nanak; forever and ever, he chants the Name of the One Lord. ||
4 || 13 || 15 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my
friend. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 867 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Your consciousness shall become immaculate and pure. All the misfortunes of your
mind and body shall be taken away, and all your pain and darkness will be dispelled. ||
1 || Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, cross over the world-ocean. By great
good fortune, one attains the Infinite Lord, the Primal Being. || 1 || Pause || The
Messenger of Death cannot even touch that humble being, who sings the Kirtan of the
Lord‟s Praises. The Gurmukh realizes his Lord and Master; his coming into this world is
approved. || 2 || He sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, by the Grace of the
Saints; his sexual desire, anger and madness are eradicated. He knows the Lord God to
be ever-present. This is the Perfect Teaching of the Perfect Guru. || 3 || He earns the
treasure of the Lord‟s wealth. Meeting with the True Guru, all his affairs are resolved.
He is awake and aware in the Love of the Lord‟s Name; O Nanak, his mind is attached
to the Lord‟s Feet. || 4 || 14 || 16 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord‟s Feet are the
boat to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. Meditating in remembrance on the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, he does not die again. Chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
he does not have to walk on the Path of Death. Contemplating the Supreme Lord, the
five demons are conquered. || 1 || I have entered Your Sanctuary, O Perfect Lord and
Master. Please give Your hand to Your creatures. || 1 || Pause || The Simritees,
Shaastras, Vedas and Puraanas expound upon the Supreme Lord God. The Yogis,
celibates, Vaishnavs and followers of Ram Das cannot find the limits of the Eternal Lord
God. || 2 || Shiva and the gods lament and moan, but they do not understand even a
tiny bit of the unseen and unknown Lord. One whom the Lord Himself blesses with
loving devotional worship, is very rare in this world. || 3 || I am worthless, with
absolutely no virtue at all; all treasures are in Your Glance of Grace. Nanak, the meek,
desires only to serve You. Please be merciful, and grant him this blessing, O Divine
Guru. || 4 || 15 || 17 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: One who is cursed by the Saints, is
thrown down on the ground. The slanderer of the Saints is thrown down from the skies.
I hold the Saints close to my soul. The Saints are saved instantaneously. || 1 || He
alone is a Saint, who is pleasing to the Lord. The Saints, and God, have only one job to
do. || 1 || Pause || God gives His hand to shelter the Saints. He dwells with His
Saints, day and night. With each and every breath, He cherishes His Saints. He takes
the power away from the enemies of the Saints. || 2 || Let no one slander the Saints.
Whoever slanders them, will be destroyed. One who is protected by the Creator Lord,
cannot be harmed, no matter how much the whole world may try. || 3 || I place my
faith in my God. My soul and body all belong to Him. This is the faith which inspires
Nanak: the self-willed manmukhs will fail, while the Gurmukhs will always win. || 4 ||
16 || 18 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: The Name of the Immaculate Lord is the Ambrosial
Water. Chanting it with the tongue, sins are washed away. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 868 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || Pause || The Lord abides in everyone. The Lord illumines each and every
heart. Chanting the Lord‟s Name, one does not fall into hell. Serving the Lord, all fruitful
rewards are obtained. || 1 || Within my mind is the Support of the Lord. The Lord is
the boat to cross over the world-ocean. Chant the Lord‟s Name, and the Messenger of
Death will run away. The Lord breaks the teeth of Maya, the witch. || 2 || The Lord is
forever and ever the Forgiver. The Lord blesses us with peace and bliss. The Lord has
revealed His glory. The Lord is the mother and father of His Saint. || 3 || The Lord,
the Lord, is in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Time and time again, I sing
the Lord‟s Praises. Meeting with the Guru, I have attained the incomprehensible object.
Slave Nanak has grasped the Support of the Lord. || 4 || 17 || 19 || GOND, FIFTH
MEHL: One who is protected by the Protector Lord — the Formless Lord is on his side.
|| 1 || Pause || In the mother‟s womb, the fire does not touch him. Sexual desire,
anger, greed and emotional attachment do not affect him. In the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, he meditates on the Formless Lord. Dust is thrown into the faces
of the slanderers. || 1 || The Lord‟s protective spell is the armor of His slave. The
wicked, evil demons cannot even touch him. Whoever indulges in egotistical pride, shall
waste away to ruin. God is the Sanctuary of His humble slave. || 2 || Whoever enters
the Sanctuary of the Sovereign Lord — He saves that slave, hugging him close in His
embrace. Whoever takes great pride in himself, in an instant, shall be like dust mixing
with dust. || 3 || The True Lord is, and shall always be. Forever and ever, I am a
sacrifice to Him. Granting His Mercy, He saves His slaves. God is the Support of Nanak‟s
breath of life. || 4 || 18 || 20 || GOND, FIFTH MEHL: Wondrous and beautiful is the
description of the beauty of the Supreme Soul, the Supreme Lord God. || 1 || Pause
|| He is not old; He is not young. He is not in pain; He is not caught in Death‟s noose.
He does not die; He does not go away. In the beginning, and throughout the ages, He
is permeating everywhere. || 1 || He is not hot; He is not cold. He has no enemy; He
has no friend. He is not happy; He is not sad. Everything belongs to Him; He can do
anything. || 2 || He has no father; He has no mother. He is beyond the beyond, and
has always been so. He is not affected by virtue or vice. Deep within each and every
heart, He is always awake and aware. || 3 || From the three qualities, the one
mechanism of Maya was produced. The great Maya is only His shadow. He is
undeceivable, impenetrable, unfathomable and merciful. He is merciful to the meek,
forever compassionate. His state and limits cannot ever be known. Nanak is a sacrifice,
a sacrifice to Him. || 4 || 19 || 21 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 869 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
GOND, FIFTH MEHL: I am a sacrifice to the Saints. Associating with the Saints, I sing
the Glorious Praises of the Lord. By the Grace of the Saints, the residues of all sinful
mistakes are taken away. By great good fortune, one finds the Sanctuary of the Saints.
|| 1 || Meditating on the Lord, no obstacles will block your way. By Guru‟s Grace,
meditate on God. || 1 || Pause || When the Supreme Lord God becomes merciful,
he makes me the dust of the feet of the Holy. Sexual desire and anger leave his body,
and the Lord, the jewel, comes to dwell in his mind. || 2 || Fruitful and approved is
the life of one who knows the Supreme Lord God to be close. One who is committed to
loving devotional worship of God, and the Kirtan of His Praises, awakens from the sleep
of countless incarnations. || 3 || The Lord‟s Lotus Feet are the Support of His humble
servant. To chant the Praises of the Lord of the Universe is the true trade. Please fulfill
the hopes of Your humble slave. Nanak finds peace in the dust of the feet of the
humble. || 4 || 20 || 22 || 6 || 28 ||
RAAG GOND, ASHTAPADEES, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

Humbly bow to the Perfect Divine Guru. Fruitful is His image, and fruitful is service to
Him. He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Architect of Destiny. Twentyfour hours a day, he remains imbued with the love of the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
|| 1 || The Guru is the Lord of the Universe, the Guru is the Lord of the World. He is
the Saving Grace of His slaves. || 1 || Pause || He satisfies the kings, emperors and
nobles. He destroys the egotistical villains. He puts illness into the mouths of the
slanderers. All the people celebrate His victory. || 2 || Supreme bliss fills the minds of
the Saints. The Saints meditate on the Divine Guru, the Lord God. The faces of His
companions become radiant and bright. The slanderers lose all places of rest. || 3 ||
With each and every breath, the Lord‟s humble slaves praise Him. The Supreme Lord
God and the Guru are care-free. All fears are eradicated, in His Sanctuary. Smashing all
the slanderers, the Lord knocks them to the ground. || 4 || Let no one slander the
Lord‟s humble servants. Whoever does so, will be miserable. Twenty-four hours a day,
the Lord‟s humble servant meditates on Him alone. The Messenger of Death does not
even approach him. || 5 || The Lord‟s humble servant has no vengeance. The
slanderer is egotistical. The Lord‟s humble servant wishes well, while the slanderer
dwells on evil. The Sikh of the Guru meditates on the True Guru. The Lord‟s humble
servants are saved, while the slanderer is cast into hell. || 6 || Listen, O my beloved
friends and companions: these words shall be true in the Court of the Lord. As you
plant, so shall you harvest. The proud, egotistical person will surely be uprooted. || 7 ||
O True Guru, You are the Support of the unsupported. Be merciful, and save Your
humble servant. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to the Guru; remembering Him in
meditation, my honor has been saved. || 8 || 1 || 29 ||

RAAG GOND, THE WORD OF THE DEVOTEES. KABEER JEE, FIRST
HOUSE:

When you meet a Saint, talk to him and listen. Meeting with an unsaintly person, just
remain silent. || 1 || O father, if I speak, what words should I utter? Speak such
words, by which you may remain absorbed in the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
Speaking with the Saints, one becomes generous. To speak with a fool is to babble
uselessly. || 2 || By speaking and only speaking, corruption only increases. If I do not
speak, what can the poor wretch do? || 3 || Says Kabeer, the empty pitcher makes
noise, but that which is full makes no sound. || 4 || 1 || GOND: When a man dies, he
is of no use to anyone. But when an animal dies, it is used in ten ways. || 1 || What
do I know, about the state of my karma? What do I know, O Baba? || 1 || Pause ||
His bones burn, like a bundle of logs; his hair burns like a bale of hay. || 2 || Says
Kabeer, the man wakes up, only when the Messenger of Death hits him over the head
with his club. || 3 || 2 || GOND: The Celestial Lord is in the Akaashic ethers of the
skies, the Celestial Lord is in the nether regions of the underworld; in the four
directions, the Celestial Lord is pervading. The Supreme Lord God is forever the source
of bliss. When the vessel of the body perishes, the Celestial Lord does not perish. || 1
|| I have become sad, wondering where the soul comes from, and where it goes. || 1
|| Pause || The body is formed from the union of the five tatvas; but where were the
five tatvas created? You say that the soul is tied to its karma, but who gave karma to
the body? || 2 || The body is contained in the Lord, and the Lord is contained in the
body. He is permeating within all. Says Kabeer, I shall not renounce the Lord‟s Name. I
shall accept whatever happens. || 3 || 3 ||
RAAG GOND, THE WORD OF KABEER JEE, SECOND HOUSE:

They tied my arms, bundled me up, and threw me before an elephant. The elephant
driver struck him on the head, and infuriated him. But the elephant ran away,
trumpeting, “I am a sacrifice to this image of the Lord.” || 1 || O my Lord and Master,
You are my strength. The Qazi shouted at the driver to drive the elephant on. || 1 ||
Pause || He yelled out, “O driver, I shall cut you into pieces. Hit him, and drive him
on!” But the elephant did not move; instead, he began to meditate. The Lord God
abides within his mind. || 2 || What sin has this Saint committed, that you have made
him into a bundle and thrown him before the elephant? Lifting up the bundle, the
elephant bows down before it. The Qazi could not understand it; he was blind. || 3 ||
Three times, he tried to do it. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 871 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Even then, his hardened mind was not satisfied. Says Kabeer, such is my Lord and
Master. The soul of His humble servant dwells in the fourth state. || 4 || 1 || 4 ||
GOND: It is not human, and it is not a god. It is not called celibate, or a worshipper of
Shiva. It is not a Yogi, and it is not a hermit. It is not a mother, or anyone‟s son. || 1 ||
Then what is it, which dwells in this temple of the body? No one can find its limits. || 1
|| Pause || It is not a house-holder, and it is not a renouncer of the world. It is not a
king, and it is not a beggar. It has no body, no drop of blood. It is not a Brahmin, and it
is not a Kh‟shaatriya. || 2 || It is not called a man of austere self-discipline, or a
Shaykh. It does not live, and it is not seen to die. If someone cries over its death, that
person loses his honor. || 3 || By Guru‟s Grace, I have found the Path. Birth and
death have both been erased. Says Kabeer, this is formed of the same essence as the
Lord. It is like the ink on the paper which cannot be erased. || 4 || 2 || 5 || GOND:
The threads are broken, and the starch has run out. Bare reeds glisten at the front
door. The poor brushes are scattered in pieces. Death has entered this shaven head. ||
1 || This shaven-headed mendicant has wasted all his wealth. All this coming and
going has irritated him. || 1 || Pause || He has given up all talk of his weaving
equipment. His mind is attuned to the Lord‟s Name. His daughters and sons have
nothing to eat, while the shaven-headed mendicants night and day eat their fill. || 2 ||
One or two are in the house, and one or two more are on the way. We sleep on the
floor, while they sleep in the beds. They rub their bare heads, and carry prayer-books in
their waist-bands. We get dry grains, while they get loaves of bread. || 3 || He will
become one of these shaven-headed mendicants. They are the support of the
drowning. Listen, O blind and unguided Loi: Kabeer has taken shelter with these
shaven-headed mendicants. || 4 || 3 || 6 || GOND: When her husband dies, the
woman does not cry. Someone else becomes her protector. When this protector dies,
he falls into the world of hell hereafter, for the sexual pleasures he enjoyed in this
world. || 1 || The world loves only the one bride, Maya. She is the wife of all beings
and creatures. || 1 || Pause || With her necklace around her neck, this bride looks
beautiful. She is poison to the Saint, but the world is delighted with her. Adorning
herself, she sits like a prostitute. Cursed by the Saints, she wanders around like a
wretch. || 2 || She runs around, chasing after the Saints. She is afraid of being
beaten by those blessed with the Guru‟s Grace. She is the body, the breath of life, of
the faithless cynics. She appears to me like a blood-thirsty witch. || 3 || I know her
secrets well — in His Mercy, the Divine Guru met me. Says Kabeer, now I have thrown
her out. She clings to the skirt of the world. || 4 || 4 || 7 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 872 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
GOND: When someone‟s household has no glory, the guests who come there depart
still hungry. Deep within, there is no contentment. Without his bride, the wealth of
Maya, he suffers in pain. || 1 || So praise this bride, which can shake the
consciousness of even the most dedicated ascetics and sages. || 1 || Pause || This
bride is the daughter of a wretched miser. Abandoning the Lord‟s servant, she sleeps
with the world. Standing at the door of the holy man, she says, “I have come to your
sanctuary; now save me!” || 2 || This bride is so beautiful. The bells on her ankles
make soft music. As long as there is the breath of life in the man, she remains attached
to him. But when it is no more, she quickly gets up and departs, bare-footed. || 3 ||
This bride has conquered the three worlds. The eighteen Puraanas and the sacred
shrines of pilgrimage love her as well. She pierced the hearts of Brahma, Shiva and
Vishnu. She destroyed the great emperors and kings of the world. || 4 || This bride
has no restraint or limits. She is in collusion with the five thieving passions. When the
clay pot of these five passions bursts, then, says Kabeer, by Guru‟s Mercy, one is
released. || 5 || 5 || 8 || GOND: As the house will not stand when the supporting
beams are removed from within it, just so, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
how can anyone be carried across? Without the pitcher, the water is not contained; just
so, without the Holy Saint, the mortal departs in misery. || 1 || One who does not
remember the Lord — let him burn; his body and mind have remained absorbed in this
field of the world. || 1 || Pause || Without a farmer, the land is not planted; without
a thread, how can the beads be strung? Without a loop, how can the knot be tied? Just
so, without the Holy Saint, the mortal departs in misery. || 2 || Without a mother or
father there is no child; just so, without water, how can the clothes be washed? Without
a horse, how can there be a rider? Without the Holy Saint, one cannot reach the Court
of the Lord. || 3 || Just as without music, there is no dancing, the bride rejected by
her husband is dishonored. Says Kabeer, do this one thing: become Gurmukh, and you
shall never die again. || 4 || 6 || 9 || GOND: He alone is a pimp, who pounds down
his mind. Pounding down his mind, he escapes from the Messenger of Death. Pounding
and beating his mind, he puts it to the test; such a pimp attains total liberation. || 1 ||
Who is called a pimp in this world? In all speech, one must carefully consider. || 1 ||
Pause || He alone is a dancer, who dances with his mind. The Lord is not satisfied
with falsehood; He is pleased only with Truth. So play the beat of the drum in the mind.
The Lord is the Protector of the dancer with such a mind. || 2 || She alone is a streetdancer, who cleanses her body-street, and educates the five passions. She who
embraces devotional worship for the Lord — I accept such a street-dancer as my Guru.
|| 3 || He alone is a thief, who is above envy, and who uses his sense organs to chant
the Lord‟s Name. Says Kabeer, these are the qualities of the one I know as my Blessed
Divine Guru, who is the most beautiful and wise. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 873 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 4 || 7 || 10 || GOND: Blessed is the Lord of the World. Blessed is the Divine Guru.
Blessed is that grain, by which the heart-lotus of the hungry blossoms forth. Blessed are
those Saints, who know this. Meeting with them, one meets the Lord, the Sustainer of
the World. || 1 || This grain comes from the Primal Lord God. One chants the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, only when he tastes this grain. || 1 || Pause || Meditate on
the Naam, and meditate on this grain. Mixed with water, its taste becomes sublime.
One who abstains from this grain, loses his honor in the three worlds. || 2 || One who
discards this grain, is practicing hypocrisy. She is neither a happy soul-bride, nor a
widow. Those who claim in this world that they live on milk alone, secretly eat whole
loads of food. || 3 || Without this grain, time does not pass in peace. Forsaking this
grain, one does not meet the Lord of the World. Says Kabeer, this I know: blessed is
that grain, which brings faith in the Lord and Master to the mind. || 4 || 8 || 11 ||
RAAG GOND, THE WORD OF NAAM DAYV JEE, FIRST HOUSE:

The ritual sacrifice of horses, giving one‟s weight in gold to charities, and ceremonial
cleansing baths — || 1 || These are not equal to singing the Praises of the Lord‟s
Name. Meditate on your Lord, you lazy man! || 1 || Pause || Offering sweet rice at
Gaya, living on the river banks at Benares, reciting the four Vedas by heart; || 2 ||
Completing all religious rituals, restraining sexual passion by the spiritual wisdom given
by the Guru, and performing the six rituals; || 3 || Expounding on Shiva and Shakti —
O man, renounce and abandon all these things. Meditate, meditate in remembrance on
the Lord of the Universe. Meditate, O Naam Dayv, and cross over the terrifying worldocean. || 4 || 1 || GOND: The deer is lured by the sound of the hunter‟s bell; it loses
its life, but it cannot stop thinking about it. || 1 || In the same way, I look upon my
Lord. I will not abandon my Lord, and turn my thoughts to another. || 1 || Pause ||
As the fisherman looks upon the fish, and the goldsmith looks upon the gold he
fashions; || 2 || As the man driven by sex looks upon another man‟s wife, and the
gambler looks upon the throwing of the dice — || 3 || In the same way, wherever
Naam Dayv looks, he sees the Lord. Naam Dayv meditates continuously on the Feet of
the Lord. || 4 || 2 || GOND: Carry me across, O Lord, carry me across. I am
ignorant, and I do not know how to swim. O my Beloved Father, please give me Your
arm. || 1 || Pause || I have been transformed from a mortal being into an angel, in
an instant; the True Guru has taught me this. Born of human flesh, I have conquered
the heavens; such is the medicine I was given. || 1 || Please place me where You
placed Dhroo and Naarad, O my Master. With the Support of Your Name, so many have
been saved; this is Naam Dayv‟s understanding. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 874 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 2 || 3 || GOND: I am restless and unhappy. Without her calf, the cow is lonely. ||
1 || Without water, the fish writhes in pain. So is poor Naam Dayv without the Lord‟s
Name. || 1 || Pause || Like the cow‟s calf, which, when let loose, sucks at her
udders and drinks her milk — || 2 || So has Naam Dayv found the Lord. Meeting the
Guru, I have seen the Unseen Lord. || 3 || As the man driven by sex wants another
man‟s wife, so does Naam Dayv love the Lord. || 4 || As the earth burns in the
dazzling sunlight, so does poor Naam Dayv burn without the Lord‟s Name. || 5 || 4 ||
RAAG GOND, THE WORD OF NAAM DAYV JEE, SECOND HOUSE:

Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, all doubts are dispelled. Chanting the Name
of the Lord is the highest religion. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, erases
social classes and ancestral pedigrees. The Lord is the walking stick of the blind. || 1 ||
I bow to the Lord, I humbly bow to the Lord. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
you will not be tormented by the Messenger of Death. || 1 || Pause || The Lord took
the life of Harnaakhash, and gave Ajaamal a place in heaven. Teaching a parrot to
speak the Lord‟s Name, Ganika the prostitute was saved. That Lord is the light of my
eyes. || 2 || Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Pootna was saved, even
though she was a deceitful child-killer. Contemplating the Lord, Dropadi was saved.
Gautam‟s wife, turned to stone, was saved. || 3 || The Lord, who killed Kaysee and
Kans, gave the gift of life to Kali. Prays Naam Dayv, such is my Lord; meditating on
Him, fear and suffering are dispelled. || 4 || 1 || 5 || GOND: One who chases after
the god Bhairau, evil spirits and the goddess of smallpox, is riding on a donkey, kicking
up the dust. || 1 || I take only the Name of the One Lord. I have given away all other
gods in exchange for Him. || 1 || Pause || That man who chants “Shiva, Shiva”, and
meditates on him, is riding on a bull, shaking a tambourine. || 2 || One who worships
the Great Goddess Maya will be reincarnated as a woman, and not a man. || 3 || You
are called the Primal Goddess. At the time of liberation, where will you hide then? || 4
|| Follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and hold tight to the Lord‟s Name, O friend. Thus
prays Naam Dayv, and so says the Gita as well. || 5 || 2 || 6 || BILAAVAL GOND:
Today, Naam Dayv saw the Lord, and so I will instruct the ignorant. || Pause || O
Pandit, O religious scholar, your Gayatri was grazing in the fields. Taking a stick, the
farmer broke its leg, and now it walks with a limp. || 1 || O Pandit, I saw your great
god Shiva, riding along on a white bull. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 875 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
In the merchant‟s house, a banquet was prepared for him — he killed the merchant‟s
son. || 2 || O Pandit, I saw your Raam Chand coming too; he lost his wife, fighting a
war against Raawan. || 3 || The Hindu is sightless; the Muslim has only one eye. The
spiritual teacher is wiser than both of them. The Hindu worships at the temple, the
Muslim at the mosque. Naam Dayv serves that Lord, who is not limited to either the
temple or the mosque. || 4 || 3 || 7 ||
RAAG GOND, THE WORD OF RAVI DAAS JEE, SECOND HOUSE:

Meditate on the Lord Mukanday, the Liberator, O people of the world. Without
Mukanday, the body shall be reduced to ashes. Mukanday is the Giver of liberation.
Mukanday is my father and mother. || 1 || Meditate on Mukanday in life, and
meditate on Mukanday in death. His servant is blissful forever. || 1 || Pause || The
Lord, Mukanday, is my breath of life. Meditating on Mukanday, one‟s forehead will bear
the Lord‟s insignia of approval. The renunciate serves Mukanday. Mukanday is the
wealth of the poor and forlorn. || 2 || When the One Liberator does me a favor, then
what can the world do to me? Erasing my social status, I have entered His Court. You,
Mukanday, are potent throughout the four ages. || 3 || Spiritual wisdom has welled
up, and I have been enlightened. In His Mercy, the Lord has made this worm His slave.
Says Ravi Daas, now my thirst is quenched; I meditate on Mukanday the Liberator, and
I serve Him. || 4 || 1 || GOND: Someone may bathe at the sixty-eight sacred shrines
of pilgrimage, and worship the twelve Shiva-lingam stones, and dig wells and pools, but
if he indulges in slander, then all of this is useless. || 1 || How can the slanderer of
the Holy Saints be saved? Know for certain, that he shall go to hell. || 1 || Pause ||
Someone may bathe at Kuruk-shaytra during a solar eclipse, and give his decorated
wife in offering, and listen to all the Simritees, but if he indulges in slander, these are of
no account. || 2 || Someone may give countless feasts, and donate land, and build
splendid buildings; he may neglect his own affairs to work for others, but if he indulges
in slander, he shall wander in countless incarnations. || 3 || Why do you indulge in
slander, O people of the world? The emptiness of the slanderer is soon exposed. I have
thought, and determined the fate of the slanderer. Says Ravi Daas, he is a sinner; he
shall go to hell. || 4 || 2 || 11 || 7 || 2 || 49 Total || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 876 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:
ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.
TRUTH IS THE NAME.
CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED. NO FEAR. NO HATRED.
IMAGE OF THE UNDYING. BEYOND BIRTH. SELF-EXISTENT.
BY GURU‟S GRACE:
Some read the Sanskrit scriptures, and some read the Puraanas. Some meditate on the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, and chant it on their malas, focusing on it in meditation. I
know nothing, now or ever; I recognize only Your One Name, Lord. || 1 || I do not
know, Lord, what my condition shall be. I am foolish and ignorant; I seek Your
Sanctuary, God. Please, save my honor and my self-respect. || 1 || Pause ||
Sometimes, the soul soars high in the heavens, and sometimes it falls to the depths of
the nether regions. The greedy soul does not remain stable; it searches in the four
directions. || 2 || With death pre-ordained, the soul comes into the world, gathering
the riches of life. I see that some have already gone, O my Lord and Master; the
burning fire is coming closer! || 3 || No one has any friend, and no one has any
brother; no one has any father or mother. Prays Nanak, if You bless me with Your
Name, it shall be my help and support in the end. || 4 || 1 || RAAMKALEE, FIRST
MEHL: Your Light is prevailing everywhere. Wherever I look, there I see the Lord. || 1
|| Please rid me of the desire to live, O my Lord and Master. My mind is entangled in
the deep dark pit of Maya. How can I cross over, O Lord and Master? || 1 || Pause ||
He dwells deep within, inside the heart; how can He not be outside as well? Our Lord
and Master always takes care of us, and keeps us in His thoughts. || 2 || He Himself
is near at hand, and He is far away. He Himself is all-pervading, permeating
everywhere. Meeting the True Guru, the darkness is dispelled. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 877 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Wherever I look, there I see Him pervading. || 3 || There is doubt within me, and
Maya is outside; it hits me in the eyes like an arrow. Prays Nanak, the slave of the
Lord‟s slaves: such a mortal suffers terribly. || 4 || 2 || RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL:
Where is that door, where You live, O Lord? What is that door called? Among all doors,
who can find that door? For the sake of that door, I wander around sadly, detached
from the world; if only someone would come and tell me about that door. || 1 || How
can I cross over the world-ocean? While I am living, I cannot be dead. || 1 || Pause ||
Pain is the door, and anger is the guard; hope and anxiety are the two shutters. Maya is
the water in the moat; in the middle of this moat, he has built his home. The Primal
Lord sits in the Seat of Truth. || 2 || You have so many Names, Lord, I do not know
their limit. There is no other equal to You. Do not speak out loud — remain in your
mind. The Lord Himself knows, and He Himself acts. || 3 || As long as there is hope,
there is anxiety; so how can anyone speak of the One Lord? In the midst of hope,
remain untouched by hope; then, O Nanak, you shall meet the One Lord. || 4 || In
this way, you shall cross over the world-ocean. This is the way to remain dead while yet
alive. || 1 || Second Pause || 3 || RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL: Awareness of the
Shabad and the Teachings is my horn; the people hear the sound of its vibrations.
Honor is my begging-bowl, and the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the charity I
receive. || 1 || O Baba, Gorakh is the Lord of the Universe; He is always awake and
aware. He alone is Gorakh, who sustains the earth; He created it in an instant. || 1 ||
Pause || Binding together water and air, He infused the breath of life into the body,
and made the lamps of the sun and the moon. To die and to live, He gave us the earth,
but we have forgotten these blessings. || 2 || There are so many Siddhas, seekers,
Yogis, wandering pilgrims, spiritual teachers and good people. If I meet them, I chant
the Lord‟s Praises, and then, my mind serves Him. || 3 || Paper and salt, protected by
ghee, remain untouched by water, as the lotus remains unaffected in water. Those who
meet with such devotees, O servant Nanak — what can death do to them? || 4 || 4 ||
RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL: Listen, Machhindra, to what Nanak says. One who subdues
the five passions does not waver. One who practices Yoga in such a way, saves himself,
and saves all his generations. || 1 || He alone is a hermit, who attains such
understanding. Day and night, he remains absorbed in deepest Samaadhi. || 1 ||
Pause || He begs for loving devotion to the Lord, and lives in the Fear of God. He is
satisfied, with the priceless gift of contentment. Becoming the embodiment of
meditation, he attains the true Yogic posture. He focuses his consciousness in the deep
trance of the True Name. || 2 || Nanak chants the Ambrosial Bani. Listen, O
Machhindra: this is the insignia of the true hermit. One who, in the midst of hope,
remains untouched by hope, shall truly find the Creator Lord. || 3 || Prays Nanak, I
share the mysterious secrets of God. The Guru and His disciple are joined together! 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 878 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
One who eats this food, this medicine of the Teachings, has the wisdom of the six
Shaastras. || 4 || 5 || RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL: My boat is wobbly and unsteady; it
is filled with sins. The wind is rising — what if it tips over? As sunmukh, I have turned
to the Guru; O my Perfect Master; please be sure to bless me with Your glorious
greatness. || 1 || O Guru, my Saving Grace, please carry me across the world-ocean.
Bless me with devotion to the perfect, imperishable Lord God; I am a sacrifice to You.
|| 1 || Pause || He alone is a Siddha, a seeker, a Yogi, a wandering pilgrim, who
meditates on the One Perfect Lord. Touching the feet of the Lord Master, they are
emancipated; they come to receive the Word of the Teachings. || 2 || I know nothing
of charity, meditation, self-discipline or religious rituals; I only chant Your Name, God.
Nanak has met the Guru, the Transcendent Lord God; through the True Word of His
Shabad, he is set free. || 3 || 6 || RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL: Focus your
consciousness in deep absorption on the Lord. Make your body a raft, to cross over.
Deep within is the fire of desire; keep it in check. Day and night, that lamp shall burn
unceasingly. || 1 || Float such a lamp upon the water; this lamp will bring total
understanding. || 1 || Pause || This understanding is good clay; a lamp made of
such clay is acceptable to the Lord. So shape this lamp on the wheel of good actions. In
this world and in the next, this lamp shall be with you. || 2 || When He Himself grants
His Grace, then, as Gurmukh, one may understand Him. Within the heart, this lamp is
permanently lit. It is not extinguished by water or wind. Such a lamp will carry you
across the water. || 3 || Wind does not shake it, or put it out. Its light reveals the
Divine Throne. The Kh‟shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas cannot find its
value, even by thousands of calculations. If any of them lights such a lamp, O Nanak,
he is emancipated. || 4 || 7 || RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL: To place one‟s faith in
Your Name, Lord, is true worship. With an offering of Truth, one obtains a place to sit.
If a prayer is offered with truth and contentment, the Lord will hear it, and call him in to
sit by Him. || 1 || O Nanak, no one returns empty-handed; such is the Court of the
True Lord. || 1 || Pause || The treasure I seek is the gift of Your Grace. Please bless
this humble beggar — this is what I seek. Please, pour Your Love into the cup of my
heart. This is Your pre-determined value. || 2 || The One who created everything,
does everything. He Himself appraises His own value. The Sovereign Lord King
becomes manifest to the Gurmukh. He does not come, and He does not go. || 3 ||
People curse at the beggar; by begging, he does not receive honor. O Lord, You inspire
me to speak Your Words, and tell the Story of Your Court. || 4 || 8 || RAAMKALEE,
FIRST MEHL: The drop is in the ocean, and the ocean is in the drop. Who understands,
and knows this? He Himself creates the wondrous play of the world. He Himself
contemplates it, and understands its true essence. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 879 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || How rare are those who contemplate this spiritual wisdom. Through this, the
supreme state of liberation is attained. || 1 || Pause || The night is in the day, and
the day is in the night. The same is true of hot and cold. No one else knows His state
and extent; without the Guru, this is not understood. || 2 || The female is in the
male, and the male is in the female. Understand this, O God-realized being! The
meditation is in the music, and knowledge is in meditation. Become Gurmukh, and
speak the Unspoken Speech. || 3 || The Light is in the mind, and the mind is in the
Light. The Guru brings the five senses together, like brothers. Nanak is forever a
sacrifice to those who enshrine love for the One Word of the Shabad. || 4 || 9 ||
RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL: When the Lord God showered His Mercy, egotism was
eradicated from within me. That humble servant who contemplates the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad, is very dear to the Lord. || 1 || That humble servant of the Lord is
pleasing to his Lord God; day and night, he performs devotional worship, day and night.
Disregarding his own honor, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
The unstruck melody of the sound current resonates and resounds; my mind is
appeased by the subtle essence of the Lord. Through the Perfect Guru, I am absorbed
in Truth. Through the Guru, I have found the Lord, the Primal Being. || 2 || Gurbani
is the sound current of the Naad, the Vedas, everything. My mind is attuned to the Lord
of the Universe. He is my sacred shrine of pilgrimage, fasting and austere selfdiscipline. The Lord saves, and carries across, those who meet with the Guru. || 3 ||
One whose self-conceit is gone, sees his fears run away. That servant grasps the Guru‟s
feet. The Guru, the True Guru, has expelled my doubts. Says Nanak, I have merged
into the Word of the Shabad. || 4 || 10 || RAAMKALEE, FIRST MEHL: He runs
around, begging for clothes and food. He burns with hunger and corruption, and will
suffer in the world hereafter. He does not follow the Guru‟s Teachings; through his evilmindedness, he loses his honor. Only through the Guru‟s Teachings will such a person
become devoted. || 1 || The way of the Yogi is to dwell in the celestial home of bliss.
He looks impartially, equally upon all. He receives the charity of the Lord‟s Love, and
the Word of the Shabad, and so he is satisfied. || 1 || Pause || The five bulls, the
senses, pull the wagon of the body around. By the Lord‟s power, one‟s honor is
preserved. But when the axle breaks, the wagon falls and crashes. It falls apart, like a
pile of logs. || 2 || Contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, Yogi. Look upon pain
and pleasure as one and the same, sorrow and separation. Let your food be
contemplative meditation upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. Your wall shall be permanent, by meditating on the Formless Lord. || 3
|| Wear the loin-cloth of poise, and be free of entanglements. The Guru‟s Word shall
release you from sexual desire and anger. In your mind, let your ear-rings be the
Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord. O Nanak, worshipping the Lord in deep devotion, the
humble are carried across. || 4 || 11 ||

RAAMKALEE, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:
In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, everyone spoke the Truth. In each and every home,
devotional worship was performed by the people, according to the Guru‟s Teachings. In
that Golden Age, Dharma had four feet. How rare are those people who, as Gurmukh,
contemplate this and understand. || 1 || In all four ages, the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, is glory and greatness. One who holds tight to the Naam is liberated; without the
Guru, no one obtains the Naam. || 1 || Pause || In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga,
one leg was removed. Hypocrisy became prevalent, and people thought that the Lord
was far away. The Gurmukhs still understood and realized; the Naam abided deep
within them, and they were at peace. || 2 || In the Brass Age of Dwaapur Yuga,
duality and double-mindedness arose. Deluded by doubt, they knew duality. In this
Brass Age, Dharma was left with only two feet. Those who became Gurmukh implanted
the Naam deep within. || 3 || In the Iron Age of Kali Yuga, Dharma was left with only
one power. It walks on just one foot; love and emotional attachment to Maya have
increased. Love and emotional attachment to Maya bring total darkness. If someone
meets the True Guru, he is saved, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 4 ||
Throughout the ages, there is only the One True Lord. Among all, is the True Lord;
there is no other at all. Praising the True Lord, true peace is attained. How rare are
those, who as Gurmukh, chant the Naam. || 5 || Throughout all the ages, the Naam
is the ultimate, the most sublime. How rare are those, who as Gurmukh, understand
this. One who meditates on the Lord‟s Name is a humble devotee. O Nanak, in each
and every age, the Naam is glory and greatness. || 6 || 1 ||
RAAMKALEE, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

If someone is very fortunate, and is blessed with great high destiny, then he meditates on
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds peace,
and merges in the Naam. || 1 || O mortal, as Gurmukh, worship the Lord in devotion
forever. Your heart shall be illumined; through the Guru‟s Teachings, lovingly attune
yourself to the Lord. You shall merge in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Pause ||
The Great Giver is filled with diamonds, emeralds, rubies and pearls; one who has good
fortune and great destiny inscribed upon his forehead, digs them out, by following the
Guru‟s Teachings. || 2 || The Lord‟s Name is the jewel, the emerald, the ruby; digging it
out, the Guru has placed it in your palm. The unfortunate, self-willed manmukh does not
obtain it; this priceless jewel remains hidden behind a curtain of straw. || 3 || If such
pre-ordained destiny is written upon one‟s forehead, then the True Guru enjoins him to
serve Him. O Nanak, then he obtains the jewel, the gem; blessed, blessed is that one who
follows the Guru‟s Teachings, and finds the Lord. || 4 || 1 || RAAMKALEE, FOURTH
MEHL: Meeting with the humble servants of the Lord, I am in ecstasy; they preach the
sublime sermon of the Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 881 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The filth of evil-mindedness is totally washed away; joining the Sat Sangat, the True
Congregation, one is blessed with understanding. || 1 || O humble servant of the
Lord, follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and chant the Name of the Lord. Whoever hears and
speaks it is liberated; chanting the Lord‟s Name, one is embellished with beauty. || 1 ||
Pause || If someone has supremely high destiny written on his forehead, the Lord
leads him to meet the humble servants of the Lord. Be merciful, and grant me the
Blessed Vision of the Saints‟ Darshan, which shall rid me of all poverty and pain. || 2 ||
The Lord‟s people are good and sublime; the unfortunate ones do not like them at all.
The more the Lord‟s exalted servants speak of Him, the more the slanderers attack and
sting them. || 3 || Cursed, cursed are the slanderers who do not like the humble, the
friends and companions of the Lord. Those who do not like the honor and glory of the
Guru are faithless, black-faced thieves, who have turned their backs on the Lord. || 4
|| Have mercy, have mercy, please save me, Dear Lord. I am meek and humble — I
seek Your protection. I am Your child, and You are my father, God. Please forgive
servant Nanak and merge him with Yourself. || 5 || 2 || RAAMKALEE, FOURTH
MEHL: The friends of the Lord, the humble, Holy Saints are sublime; the Lord spreads
out His protecting hands above them. The Gurmukhs are the Holy Saints, pleasing to
God; in His mercy, He blends them with Himself. || 1 || O Lord, my mind longs to
meet with the humble servants of the Lord. The sweet, subtle essence of the Lord is
immortalizing ambrosia. Meeting the Saints, I drink it in. || 1 || Pause || The Lord‟s
people are the most lofty and exalted. Meeting with them, the most exalted status is
obtained. I am the slave of the slave of the Lord‟s slaves; my Lord and Master is
pleased with me. || 2 || The humble servant serves; one who enshrines love for the
Lord in his heart, mind and body is very fortunate. One who talks too much without
love, speaks falsely, and obtains only false rewards. || 3 || Take pity on me, O Lord of
the World, O Great Giver; let me fall at the feet of the Saints. I would cut off my head,
and cut it into pieces, O Nanak, and set it down for the Saints to walk upon. || 4 || 3 ||
RAAMKALEE, FOURTH MEHL: If I am blessed with supreme high destiny, I will meet
the humble servants of the Lord, without delay. The Lord‟s humble servants are pools
of ambrosial nectar; by great good fortune, one bathes in them. || 1 || O Lord, let me
work for the humble servants of the Lord. I carry water, wave the fan and grind the
corn for them; I massage and wash their feet. I apply the dust of their feet to my
forehead. || 1 || Pause || The Lord‟s humble servants are great, very great, the
greatest and most exalted; they lead us to meet the True Guru. No one else is as great
as the True Guru; meeting the True Guru, I meditate on the Lord, the Primal Being. ||
2 || Those who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru find the Lord. My Lord and
Master saves their honor. Some come for their own purposes, and sit before the Guru;
they pretend to be in Samaadhi, like storks with their eyes closed. || 3 || Associating
with the wretched and the lowly, like the stork and the crow, is like feeding on a
carcass of poison. Nanak: O God, unite me with the Sangat, the Congregation. United
with the Sangat, I will become a swan. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 882 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 4 || 4 || RAAMKALEE, FOURTH MEHL: O True Guru, please be kind, and unite me
with the Lord. My Sovereign Lord is the Beloved of my breath of life. I am a slave; I fall
at the Guru‟s feet. He has shown me the Path, the Way to my Lord God. || 1 || The
Name of my Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind. I have no friend except the Lord;
the Lord is my father, my mother, my companion. || 1 || Pause || My breath of life
will not survive for an instant, without my Beloved; unless I see Him, I will die, O my
mother! Blessed, blessed is my great, high destiny, that I have come to the Guru‟s
Sanctuary. Meeting with the Guru, I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s
Darshan. || 2 || I do not know or understand any other within my mind; I meditate
and chant the Lord‟s Chant. Those who lack the Naam, wander in shame; their noses
are chopped off, bit by bit. || 3 || O Life of the World, rejuvenate me! O my Lord and
Master, enshrine Your Name deep within my heart. O Nanak, perfect is the Guru, the
Guru. Meeting the True Guru, I meditate on the Naam. || 4 || 5 || RAAMKALEE,
FOURTH MEHL: The True Guru, the Great Giver, is the Great, Primal Being; meeting
Him, the Lord is enshrined within the heart. The Perfect Guru has granted me the life of
the soul; I meditate in remembrance on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. || 1 || O
Lord, the Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within my heart. As
Gurmukh, I have heard His sermon, which pleases my mind; blessed, blessed is my
great destiny. || 1 || Pause || Millions, thirty-three millions of gods meditate on Him,
but they cannot find His end or limitation. With sexual urges in their hearts, they beg
for beautiful women; stretching out their hands, they beg for riches. || 2 || One who
chants the Praises of the Lord is the greatest of the great; the Gurmukh keeps the Lord
clasped to his heart. If one is blessed with high destiny, he meditates on the Lord, who
carries him across the terrifying world-ocean. || 3 || The Lord is close to His humble
servant, and His humble servant is close to the Lord; He keeps His humble servant
clasped to His Heart. O Nanak, the Lord God is our father and mother. I am His child;
the Lord cherishes me. || 4 || 6 || 18 ||
