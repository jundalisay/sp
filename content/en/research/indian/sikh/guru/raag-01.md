SO DAR ~ THAT DOOR. RAAG AASAA, FIRST MEHL:

Where is That Door of Yours, and where is That Home, in which You sit and take care of all? The Sound-current of the Naad vibrates there for You, and countless musicians play all sorts of instruments there for You. There are so many Ragas and musical harmonies to You; so many minstrels sing hymns of You. Wind, water and fire sing of You. The Righteous Judge of Dharma sings at Your Door. Chitr and Gupt, the angels of the conscious and the subconscious who keep the record of actions, and the Righteous Judge of Dharma who reads this record, sing of You. Shiva, Brahma and the Goddess of Beauty, ever adorned by You, sing of You. Indra, seated on His Throne, sings of You, with the deities at Your Door. The Siddhas in Samaadhi sing of You; the Saadhus sing of You in contemplation.

The celibates, the fanatics, and the peacefully accepting sing of You; the fearless
warriors sing of You. The Pandits, the religious scholars who recite the Vedas, with the
supreme sages of all the ages, sing of You. The Mohinis, the enchanting heavenly
beauties who entice hearts in paradise, in this world, and in the underworld of the
subconscious, sing of You. The celestial jewels created by You, and the sixty-eight
sacred shrines of pilgrimage, sing of You. The brave and mighty warriors sing of You.
The spiritual heroes and the four sources of creation sing of You. The worlds, solar
systems and galaxies, created and arranged by Your Hand, sing of You. They alone sing
of You, who are pleasing to Your Will. Your devotees are imbued with Your Sublime
Essence. So many others sing of You, they do not come to mind. O Nanak, how can I
think of them all? That True Lord is True, forever True, and True is His Name. He is,
and shall always be. He shall not depart, even when this Universe which He has created
departs. He created the world, with its various colors, species of beings, and the variety
of Maya. Having created the creation, He watches over it Himself, by His Greatness. He
does whatever He pleases. No one can issue any order to Him. He is the King, the King
of kings, the Supreme Lord and Master of kings. Nanak remains subject to His Will.

1 || AASAA, FIRST MEHL: Hearing of His Greatness, everyone calls Him Great. But just
how Great His Greatness is—this is known only to those who have seen Him. His Value
cannot be estimated; He cannot be described. Those who describe You, Lord, remain
immersed and absorbed in You. || 1 || O my Great Lord and Master of Unfathomable
Depth, You are the Ocean of Excellence. No one knows the extent or the vastness of
Your Expanse. || 1 || Pause || All the intuitives met and practiced intuitive
meditation. All the appraisers met and made the appraisal. The spiritual teachers, the
teachers of meditation, and the teachers of teachers—they cannot describe even an iota
of Your Greatness. || 2 || All Truth, all austere discipline, all goodness, all the great
miraculous spiritual powers of the Siddhas—without You, no one has attained such
powers. They are received only by Your Grace. No one can block them or stop their
flow. || 3 || What can the poor helpless creatures do? Your Praises are overflowing
with Your Treasures. Those, unto whom You give—how can they think of any other? O
Nanak, the True One embellishes and exalts. || 4 || 2 || AASAA, FIRST MEHL:
Chanting it, I live; forgetting it, I die. It is so difficult to chant the True Name. If
someone feels hunger for the True Name, that hunger shall consume his pain. || 1 ||
How can I forget Him, O my mother? True is the Master, True is His Name. || 1 ||
Pause || Trying to describe even an iota of the Greatness of the True Name, people
have grown weary, but they have not been able to evaluate it. Even if everyone were to
gather together and speak of Him, He would not become any greater or any lesser. ||
2 || That Lord does not die; there is no reason to mourn. He continues to give, and
His Provisions never run short. This Virtue is His alone; there is no other like Him. There
never has been, and there never will be. || 3 || As Great as You Yourself are, O Lord,
so Great are Your Gifts. 

The One who created the day also created the night. Those who forget their Lord and
Master are vile and despicable. O Nanak, without the Name, they are wretched
outcasts. || 4 || 3 || 



RAAG GOOJAREE, FOURTH MEHL: O humble servant of the
Lord, O True Guru, O True Primal Being: I offer my humble prayer to You, O Guru. I am
a mere insect, a worm. O True Guru, I seek Your Sanctuary. Please be merciful, and
bless me with the Light of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || O my Best Friend,
O Divine Guru, please enlighten me with the Name of the Lord. Through the Guru‟s
Teachings, the Naam is my breath of life. The Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praise is my life‟s
occupation. || 1 || Pause || The servants of the Lord have the greatest good
fortune; they have faith in the Lord, and a longing for the Lord. Obtaining the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har, they are satisfied; joining the Sangat, the Blessed Congregation,
their virtues shine forth. || 2 || Those who have not obtained the Sublime Essence of
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, are most unfortunate; they are led away by the
Messenger of Death. Those who have not sought the Sanctuary of the True Guru and
the Sangat, the Holy Congregation—cursed are their lives, and cursed are their hopes of
life. || 3 || Those humble servants of the Lord who have attained the Company of the
True Guru, have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed on their foreheads. Blessed,
blessed is the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, where the Lord‟s Essence is obtained.
Meeting with His humble servant, O Nanak, the Light of the Naam shines forth. || 4 ||
4 || RAAG GOOJAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Why, O mind, do you plot and plan, when the
Dear Lord Himself provides for your care? From rocks and stones He created living
beings; He places their nourishment before them. || 1 || O my Dear Lord of souls,
one who joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is saved. By Guru‟s Grace, the
supreme status is obtained, and the dry wood blossoms forth again in lush greenery. ||
1 || Pause || Mothers, fathers, friends, children and spouses—no one is the support
of anyone else. For each and every person, our Lord and Master provides sustenance.
Why are you so afraid, O mind? || 2 || The flamingoes fly hundreds of miles, leaving
their young ones behind. Who feeds them, and who teaches them to feed themselves?
Have you ever thought of this in your mind? || 3 || All the nine treasures, and the
eighteen supernatural powers are held by our Lord and Master in the Palm of His Hand.
Servant Nanak is devoted, dedicated, forever a sacrifice to You, Lord. Your Expanse has
no limit, no boundary. || 4 || 5 ||

RAAG AASAA, FOURTH MEHL, SO PURAKH ~ THAT PRIMAL BEING:

That Primal Being is Immaculate and Pure. The Lord, the Primal Being, is Immaculate
and Pure. The Lord is Inaccessible, Unreachable and Unrivalled. All meditate, all
meditate on You, Dear Lord, O True Creator Lord. All living beings are Yours—You are
the Giver of all souls. Meditate on the Lord, O Saints; He is the Dispeller of all sorrow.
The Lord Himself is the Master, the Lord Himself is the Servant. 

O Nanak, the poor beings are wretched and miserable! || 1 || You are constant in
each and every heart, and in all things. O Dear Lord, you are the One. Some are givers,
and some are beggars. This is all Your Wondrous Play. You Yourself are the Giver, and
You Yourself are the Enjoyer. I know no other than You. You are the Supreme Lord
God, Limitless and Infinite. What Virtues of Yours can I speak of and describe? Unto
those who serve You, unto those who serve You, Dear Lord, servant Nanak is a
sacrifice. || 2 || Those who meditate on You, Lord, those who meditate on You—
those humble beings dwell in peace in this world. They are liberated, they are
liberated—those who meditate on the Lord. For them, the noose of death is cut away.
Those who meditate on the Fearless One, on the Fearless Lord—all their fears are
dispelled. Those who serve, those who serve my Dear Lord, are absorbed into the Being
of the Lord, Har, Har. Blessed are they, blessed are they, who meditate on their Dear
Lord. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to them. || 3 || Devotion to You, devotion to You, is
a treasure overflowing, infinite and beyond measure. Your devotees, Your devotees
praise You, Dear Lord, in many and various and countless ways. For You, many, for
You, so very many perform worship services, O Dear Infinite Lord; they practice
disciplined meditation and chant endlessly. For You, many, for You, so very many read
the various Simritees and Shaastras. They perform rituals and religious rites. Those
devotees, those devotees are sublime, O servant Nanak, who are pleasing to my Dear
Lord God. || 4 || You are the Primal Being, the Most Wonderful Creator. There is no
other as Great as You. Age after age, You are the One. Forever and ever, You are the
One. You never change, O Creator Lord. Everything happens according to Your Will.
You Yourself accomplish all that occurs. You Yourself created the entire universe, and
having fashioned it, You Yourself shall destroy it all. Servant Nanak sings the Glorious
Praises of the Dear Creator, the Knower of all. || 5 || 1 || AASAA, FOURTH MEHL:
You are the True Creator, my Lord and Master. Whatever pleases You comes to pass.
As You give, so do we receive. || 1 || Pause || All belong to You, all meditate on
you. Those who are blessed with Your Mercy obtain the Jewel of the Naam, the Name
of the Lord. The Gurmukhs obtain it, and the self-willed manmukhs lose it. You Yourself
separate them from Yourself, and You Yourself reunite with them again. || 1 || You
are the River of Life; all are within You. There is no one except You. All living beings are
Your playthings. The separated ones meet, and by great good fortune, those suffering
in separation are reunited once again. || 2 || They alone understand, whom You
inspire to understand; they continually chant and repeat the Lord‟s Praises. Those who
serve You find peace. 

They are intuitively absorbed into the Lord‟s Name. || 3 || You Yourself are the
Creator. Everything that happens is by Your Doing. There is no one except You. You
created the creation; You behold it and understand it. O servant Nanak, the Lord is
revealed through the Gurmukh, the Living Expression of the Guru‟s Word. || 4 || 2 ||
AASAA, FIRST MEHL: In that pool, people have made their homes, but the water there
is as hot as fire! In the swamp of emotional attachment, their feet cannot move. I have
seen them drowning there. || 1 || In your mind, you do not remember the One
Lord—you fool! You have forgotten the Lord; your virtues shall wither away. || 1 ||
Pause || I am not celibate, nor truthful, nor scholarly. I was born foolish and ignorant
into this world. Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of those who have not forgotten You,
O Lord! || 2 || 3 || AASAA, FIFTH MEHL: This human body has been given to you.
This is your chance to meet the Lord of the Universe. Nothing else will work. Join the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; vibrate and meditate on the Jewel of the
Naam. || 1 || Make every effort to cross over this terrifying world-ocean. You are
squandering this life uselessly in the love of Maya. || 1 || Pause || I have not
practiced meditation, self-discipline, self-restraint or righteous living. I have not served
the Holy; I have not acknowledged the Lord, my King. Says Nanak, my actions are
contemptible! O Lord, I seek Your Sanctuary; please, preserve my honor! || 2 || 4 ||
SOHILAA ~ THE SONG OF PRAISE. RAAG GAUREE DEEPAKEE, FIRST
MEHL:

In that house where the Praises of the Creator are chanted and contemplated—in that
house, sing Songs of Praise; meditate and remember the Creator Lord. || 1 || Sing
the Songs of Praise of my Fearless Lord. I am a sacrifice to that Song of Praise which
brings eternal peace. || 1 || Pause || Day after day, He cares for His beings; the
Great Giver watches over all. Your Gifts cannot be appraised; how can anyone compare
to the Giver? || 2 || The day of my wedding is pre-ordained. Come, gather together
and pour the oil over the threshold. My friends, give me your blessings, that I may
merge with my Lord and Master. || 3 || Unto each and every home, into each and
every heart, this summons is sent out; the call comes each and every day. Remember
in meditation the One who summons us; O Nanak, that day is drawing near! || 4 || 1 ||


RAAG AASAA, FIRST MEHL: There are six schools of philosophy, six teachers, and six
sets of teachings. But the Teacher of teachers is the One, who appears in so many
forms. || 1 || O Baba: that system in which the Praises of the Creator are sung—
follow that system; in it rests true greatness. || 1 || Pause || The seconds, minutes
and hours, days, weeks and months, and the various seasons originate from the one
sun; 


O Nanak, in just the same way, the many forms originate from the Creator. || 2 || 2 ||

RAAG DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL: Upon that cosmic plate of the sky, the sun and
the moon are the lamps. The stars and their orbs are the studded pearls. The fragrance
of sandalwood in the air is the temple incense, and the wind is the fan. All the plants of
the world are the altar flowers in offering to You, O Luminous Lord. || 1 || What a
beautiful Aartee, lamp-lit worship service this is! O Destroyer of Fear, this is Your
Ceremony of Light. The Unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad is the vibration of the
temple drums. || 1 || Pause || You have thousands of eyes, and yet You have no
eyes. You have thousands of forms, and yet You do not have even one. You have
thousands of Lotus Feet, and yet You do not have even one foot. You have no nose,
but you have thousands of noses. This Play of Yours entrances me. || 2 || Amongst
all is the Light—You are that Light. By this Illumination, that Light is radiant within all.
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Light shines forth. That which is pleasing to Him is
the lamp-lit worship service. || 3 || My mind is enticed by the honey-sweet Lotus Feet
of the Lord. Day and night, I thirst for them. Bestow the Water of Your Mercy upon
Nanak, the thirsty song-bird, so that he may come to dwell in Your Name. || 4 || 3 ||


RAAG GAUREE POORBEE, FOURTH MEHL: The body-village is filled to overflowing with
anger and sexual desire; these were broken into bits when I met with the Holy Saint. By
pre-ordained destiny, I have met with the Guru. I have entered into the realm of the
Lord‟s Love. || 1 || Greet the Holy Saint with your palms pressed together; this is an
act of great merit. Bow down before Him; this is a virtuous action indeed. || 1 || Pause
|| The wicked shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not know the Taste of the Lord‟s
Sublime Essence. The thorn of egotism is embedded deep within them. The more they
walk away, the deeper it pierces them, and the more they suffer in pain, until finally,
the Messenger of Death smashes his club against their heads. || 2 || The humble
servants of the Lord are absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The pain of birth
and the fear of death are eradicated. They have found the Imperishable Supreme
Being, the Transcendent Lord God, and they receive great honor throughout all the
worlds and realms. || 3 || I am poor and meek, God, but I belong to You! Save me—
please save me, O Greatest of the Great! Servant Nanak takes the Sustenance and
Support of the Naam. In the Name of the Lord, he enjoys celestial peace. || 4 || 4 ||


RAAG GAUREE POORBEE, FIFTH MEHL: Listen, my friends, I beg of you: now is the time to serve the Saints! In this world, earn the profit of the Lord‟s Name, and
hereafter, you shall dwell in peace. || 1 || This life is diminishing, day and night.
Meeting with the Guru, your affairs shall be resolved. || 1 || Pause || This world is
engrossed in corruption and cynicism. Only those who know God are saved. Only those
who are awakened by the Lord to drink in this Sublime Essence, come to know the
Unspoken Speech of the Lord. || 2 || Purchase only that for which you have come
into the world, and through the Guru, the Lord shall dwell within your mind. Within the
home of your own inner being, you shall obtain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence with
intuitive ease. You shall not be consigned again to the wheel of reincarnation. || 3 ||
O Inner-knower, Searcher of Hearts, O Primal Being, Architect of Destiny: please fulfill
this yearning of my mind. Nanak, Your slave, begs for this happiness: let me be the
dust of the feet of the Saints. || 4 || 5 || 


RAAG SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:
If I had a palace made of pearls, inlaid with jewels, scented with musk, saffron and
sandalwood, a sheer delight to behold—seeing this, I might go astray and forget You,
and Your Name would not enter into my mind. || 1 || Without the Lord, my soul is
scorched and burnt. I consulted my Guru, and now I see that there is no other place at
all. || 1 || Pause || If the floor of this palace was a mosaic of diamonds and rubies,
and if my bed was encased with rubies, and if heavenly beauties, their faces adorned
with emeralds, tried to entice me with sensual gestures of love—seeing these, I might
go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. || 2 || If I
were to become a Siddha, and work miracles, summon wealth and become invisible and
visible at will, so that people would hold me in awe—seeing these, I might go astray
and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. || 3 || If I were to
become an emperor and raise a huge army, and sit on a throne, issuing commands and
collecting taxes—O Nanak, all of this could pass away like a puff of wind. Seeing these,
I might go astray and forget You, and Your Name would not enter into my mind. || 4 ||
1 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: If I could live for millions and millions of years, and if
the air was my food and drink, and if I lived in a cave and never saw either the sun or
the moon, and if I never slept, even in dreams—even so, I could not estimate Your
Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? || 1 || The True Lord, the
Formless One, is Himself in His Own Place. I have heard, over and over again, and so I
tell the tale; as it pleases You, Lord, please instill within me the yearning for You. || 1
|| Pause || If I was slashed and cut into pieces, over and over again, and put into
the mill and ground into flour, burnt by fire and mixed with ashes—even then, I could
not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? || 2 || If I
was a bird, soaring and flying through hundreds of heavens, and if I was invisible,
neither eating nor drinking anything—even so, I could not estimate Your Value. 

How can I describe the Greatness of Your Name? || 3 || O Nanak, if I had hundreds
of thousands of stacks of paper, and if ink were never to fail me, and if my pen were
able to move like the wind, and if I were to read and recite and embrace love for the
Lord—even so, I could not estimate Your Value. How can I describe the Greatness of
Your Name? || 4 || 2 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: As it is pre-ordained, people
speak their words. As it is pre-ordained, they consume their food. As it is pre-ordained,
they walk along the way. As it is pre-ordained, they see and hear. As it is pre-ordained,
they draw their breath. Why should I go and ask the scholars about this? || 1 || O
Baba, the splendor of Maya is deceptive. The blind man has forgotten the Name; he is
in limbo, neither here nor there. || 1 || Pause || Life and death come to all who are
born. Everything here gets devoured by Death. He sits and examines the accounts,
there where no one goes along with anyone. Those who weep and wail might just as
well all tie bundles of straw. || 2 || Everyone says that God is the Greatest of the
Great. No one calls Him any less. No one can estimate His Worth. By speaking of Him,
His Greatness is not increased. You are the One True Lord and Master of all the other
beings, of so many worlds. || 3 || Nanak seeks the company of the lowest of the low
class, the very lowest of the low. Why should he try to compete with the great? In that
place where the lowly are cared for—there, the Blessings of Your Glance of Grace rain
down. || 4 || 3 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Greed is a dog; falsehood is a filthy
street-sweeper. Cheating is eating a rotting carcass. Slandering others is putting the
filth of others into your own mouth. The fire of anger is the outcaste who burns dead
bodies at the crematorium. I am caught in these tastes and flavors, and in selfconceited praise. These are my actions, O my Creator! || 1 || O Baba, speak only that
which will bring you honor. They alone are good, who are judged good at the Lord‟s
Door. Those with bad karma can only sit and weep. || 1 || Pause || The pleasures of
gold and silver, the pleasures of women, the pleasure of the fragrance of sandalwood,
the pleasure of horses, the pleasure of a soft bed in a palace, the pleasure of sweet
treats and the pleasure of hearty meals—these pleasures of the human body are so
numerous; how can the Naam, the Name of the Lord, find its dwelling in the heart? ||
2 || Those words are acceptable, which, when spoken, bring honor. Harsh words bring
only grief. Listen, O foolish and ignorant mind! Those who are pleasing to Him are
good. What else is there to be said? || 3 || Wisdom, honor and wealth are in the laps
of those whose hearts remain permeated with the Lord. What praise can be offered to
them? What other adornments can be bestowed upon them? O Nanak, those who lack
the Lord‟s Glance of Grace cherish neither charity nor the Lord‟s Name. || 4 || 4 ||
SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: The Great Giver has given the intoxicating drug of
falsehood. The people are intoxicated; they have forgotten death, and they have fun for
a few days. Those who do not use intoxicants are true; they dwell in the Court of the
Lord. || 1 || O Nanak, know the True Lord as True. Serving Him, peace is obtained;
you shall go to His Court with honor. || 1 || Pause || The Wine of Truth is not
fermented from molasses. 

The True Name is contained within it. I am a sacrifice to those who hear and chant the
True Name. Only one who obtains a room in the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence is
deemed to be truly intoxicated. || 2 || Bathe in the waters of Goodness and apply the
scented oil of Truth to your body, and your face shall become radiant. This is the gift of
100,000 gifts. Tell your troubles to the One who is the Source of all comfort. || 3 ||
How can you forget the One who created your soul, and the praanaa, the breath of life?
Without Him, all that we wear and eat is impure. Everything else is false. Whatever
pleases Your Will is acceptable. || 4 || 5 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Burn
emotional attachment, and grind it into ink. Transform your intelligence into the purest
of paper. Make the love of the Lord your pen, and let your consciousness be the scribe.
Then, seek the Guru‟s Instructions, and record these deliberations. Write the Praises of
the Naam, the Name of the Lord; write over and over again that He has no end or
limitation. || 1 || O Baba, write such an account, that when it is asked for, it will bring
the Mark of Truth. || 1 || Pause || There, where greatness, eternal peace and
everlasting joy are bestowed, the faces of those whose minds are attuned to the True
Name are anointed with the Mark of Grace. If one receives God‟s Grace, then such
honors are received, and not by mere words. || 2 || Some come, and some arise and
depart. They give themselves lofty names. Some are born beggars, and some hold vast
courts. Going to the world hereafter, everyone shall realize that without the Name, it is
all useless. || 3 || I am terrified by the Fear of You, God. Bothered and bewildered,
my body is wasting away. Those who are known as sultans and emperors shall be
reduced to dust in the end. O Nanak, arising and departing, all false attachments are
cut away. || 4 || 6 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Believing, all tastes are sweet.
Hearing, the salty flavors are tasted; chanting with one‟s mouth, the spicy flavors are
savored. All these spices have been made from the Sound-current of the Naad. The
thirty-six flavors of ambrosial nectar are in the Love of the One Lord; they are tasted
only by one who is blessed by His Glance of Grace. || 1 || O Baba, the pleasures of
other foods are false. Eating them, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption
enter into the mind. || 1 || Pause || My mind is imbued with the Lord‟s Love; it is
dyed a deep crimson. Truth and charity are my white clothes. The blackness of sin is
erased by my wearing of blue clothes, and meditation on the Lord‟s Lotus Feet is my
robe of honor. Contentment is my cummerbund, Your Name is my wealth and youth. ||
2 || O Baba, the pleasures of other clothes are false. Wearing them, the body is
ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. || 1 || Pause || The
understanding of Your Way, Lord, is horses, saddles and bags of gold for me. The
pursuit of virtue is my bow and arrow, my quiver, sword and scabbard. To be
distinguished with honor is my drum and banner. Your Mercy is my social status. || 3 ||
O Baba, the pleasures of other rides are false. By such rides, the body is ruined, and
wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. || 1 || Pause || The Naam, the
Name of the Lord, is the pleasure of houses and mansions. Your Glance of Grace is my
family, Lord. 

The Hukam of Your Command is the pleasure of Your Will, Lord. To say anything else is
far beyond anyone‟s reach. O Nanak, the True King does not seek advice from anyone
else in His decisions. || 4 || O Baba, the pleasure of other sleep is false. By such
sleep, the body is ruined, and wickedness and corruption enter into the mind. || 1 ||
Pause || 4 || 7 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: With the body of saffron, and the
tongue a jewel, and the breath of the body pure fragrant incense; with the face
anointed at the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, and the heart illuminated with
wisdom—with that wisdom, chant the Praises of the True Name, the Treasure of
Excellence. || 1 || O Baba, other wisdom is useless and irrelevant. If falsehood is
practiced a hundred times, it is still false in its effects. || 1 || Pause || You may be
worshipped and adored as a Pir (a spiritual teacher); you may be welcomed by all the
world; you may adopt a lofty name, and be known to have supernatural spiritual
powers—even so, if you are not accepted in the Court of the Lord, then all this
adoration is false. || 2 || No one can overthrow those who have been established by
the True Guru. The Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within them, and
through the Naam, they are radiant and famous. They worship the Naam, and they
believe in the Naam. The True One is forever Intact and Unbroken. || 3 || When the
body mingles with dust, what happens to the soul? All clever tricks are burnt away, and
you shall depart crying. O Nanak, those who forget the Naam—what will happen when
they go to the Court of the Lord? || 4 || 8 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: The
virtuous wife exudes virtue; the unvirtuous suffer in misery. If you long for your
Husband Lord, O soul-bride, you must know that He is not met by falsehood. No boat or
raft can take you to Him. Your Husband Lord is far away. || 1 || My Lord and Master
is Perfect; His Throne is Eternal and Immovable. One who attains perfection as
Gurmukh, obtains the Immeasurable True Lord. || 1 || Pause || The Palace of the
Lord God is so beautiful. Within it, there are gems, rubies, pearls and flawless
diamonds. A fortress of gold surrounds this Source of Nectar. How can I climb up to the
Fortress without a ladder? By meditating on the Lord, through the Guru, I am blessed
and exalted. || 2 || The Guru is the Ladder, the Guru is the Boat, and the Guru is the
Raft to take me to the Lord‟s Name. The Guru is the Boat to carry me across the worldocean; the Guru is the Sacred Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Holy River. If it
pleases Him, I bathe in the Pool of Truth, and become radiant and pure. || 3 || He is
called the Most Perfect of the Perfect. He sits upon His Perfect Throne. He looks so
Beautiful in His Perfect Place. He fulfills the hopes of the hopeless. O Nanak, if one
obtains the Perfect Lord, how can his virtues decrease? || 4 || 9 || SIREE RAAG,
FIRST MEHL: Come, my dear sisters and spiritual companions; hug me close in your
embrace. Let‟s join together, and tell stories of our All-powerful Husband Lord. All
Virtues are in our True Lord and Master; we are utterly without virtue. || 1 || O
Creator Lord, all are in Your Power. I dwell upon the One Word of the Shabad. You are
mine—what else do I need? || 1 || Pause || Go, and ask the happy soul-brides, “By
what virtuous qualities do you enjoy your Husband Lord?” “We are adorned with
intuitive ease, contentment and sweet words. 

We meet with our Beloved, the Source of Joy, when we listen to the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad.” || 2 || You have so many Creative Powers, Lord; Your Bountiful Blessings
are so Great. So many of Your beings and creatures praise You day and night. You have
so many forms and colors, so many classes, high and low. || 3 || Meeting the True
One, Truth wells up. The truthful are absorbed into the True Lord. Intuitive
understanding is obtained and one is welcomed with honor, through the Guru‟s Word,
filled with the Fear of God. O Nanak, the True King absorbs us into Himself. || 4 || 10
|| SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: It all worked out—I was saved, and the egotism within
my heart was subdued. The evil energies have been made to serve me, since I placed
my faith in the True Guru. I have renounced my useless schemes, by the Grace of the
True, Carefree Lord. || 1 || O mind, meeting with the True One, fear departs. Without
the Fear of God, how can anyone become fearless? Become Gurmukh, and immerse
yourself in the Shabad. || 1 || Pause || How can we describe Him with words? There
is no end to the descriptions of Him. There are so many beggars, but He is the only
Giver. He is the Giver of the soul, and the praanaa, the breath of life; when He dwells
within the mind, there is peace. || 2 || The world is a drama, staged in a dream. In a
moment, the play is played out. Some attain union with the Lord, while others depart in
separation. Whatever pleases Him comes to pass; nothing else can be done. || 3 ||
The Gurmukhs purchase the Genuine Article. The True Merchandise is purchased with
the True Capital. Those who purchase this True Merchandise through the Perfect Guru
are blessed. O Nanak, one who stocks this True Merchandise shall recognize and realize
the Genuine Article. || 4 || 11 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: As metal merges with
metal, those who chant the Praises of the Lord are absorbed into the Praiseworthy Lord.
Like the poppies, they are dyed in the deep crimson color of Truthfulness. Those
contented souls who meditate on the Lord with single-minded love, meet the True Lord.
|| 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, become the dust of the feet of the humble Saints. In the
Society of the Saints, the Guru is found. He is the Treasure of Liberation, the Source of
all good fortune. || 1 || Pause || Upon that Highest Plane of Sublime Beauty, stands
the Mansion of the Lord. By true actions, this human body is obtained, and the door
within ourselves which leads to the Mansion of the Beloved, is found. The Gurmukhs
train their minds to contemplate the Lord, the Supreme Soul. || 2 || By actions
committed under the influence of the three qualities, hope and anxiety are produced.
Without the Guru, how can anyone be released from these three qualities? Through
intuitive wisdom, we meet with Him and find peace. Within the home of the self, the
Mansion of His Presence is realized when He bestows His Glance of Grace and washes
away our pollution. || 3 || Without the Guru, this pollution is not removed. Without
the Lord, how can there be any homecoming? Contemplate the One Word of the
Shabad, and abandon other hopes. O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to the one who
beholds, and inspires others to behold Him. || 4 || 12 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL:
The life of the discarded bride is cursed. She is deceived by the love of duality. Like a
wall of sand, day and night, she crumbles, and eventually, she breaks down altogether.
Without the Word of the Shabad, peace does not come. Without her Husband Lord, her
suffering does not end. || 1 || O soul-bride, without your Husband Lord, what good
are your decorations? 

In this world, you shall not find any shelter; in the world hereafter, being false, you
shall suffer. || 1 || Pause || The True Lord Himself knows all; He makes no
mistakes. He is the Great Farmer of the Universe. First, He prepares the ground, and
then He plants the Seed of the True Name. The nine treasures are produced from
Name of the One Lord. By His Grace, we obtain His Banner and Insignia. || 2 || Some
are very knowledgeable, but if they do not know the Guru, then what is the use of their
lives? The blind have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The self-willed
manmukhs are in utter darkness. Their comings and goings in reincarnation do not end;
through death and rebirth, they are wasting away. || 3 || The bride may buy
sandalwood oil and perfumes, and apply them in great quantities to her hair; she may
sweeten her breath with betel leaf and camphor, but if this bride is not pleasing to her
Husband Lord, then all these trappings are false. || 4 || Her enjoyment of all
pleasures is futile, and all her decorations are corrupt. Until she has been pierced
through with the Shabad, how can she look beautiful at Guru‟s Gate? O Nanak, blessed
is that fortunate bride, who is in love with her Husband Lord. || 5 || 13 || SIREE
RAAG, FIRST MEHL: The empty body is dreadful, when the soul goes out from within.
The burning fire of life is extinguished, and the smoke of the breath no longer emerges.
The five relatives (the senses) weep and wail painfully, and waste away through the
love of duality. || 1 || You fool: chant the Name of the Lord, and preserve your virtue.
Egotism and possessiveness are very enticing; egotistical pride has plundered everyone.
|| 1 || Pause || Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are
attached to affairs of duality. Attached to duality, they putrefy and die; they are filled
with the fire of desire within. Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; all others
are cheated and plundered by deceitful worldly affairs. || 2 || Love dies, and affection
vanishes. Hatred and alienation die. Entanglements end, and egotism dies, along with
attachment to Maya, possessiveness and anger. Those who receive His Mercy obtain
the True One. The Gurmukhs dwell forever in balanced restraint. || 3 || By true
actions, the True Lord is met, and the Guru‟s Teachings are found. Then, they are not
subject to birth and death; they do not come and go in reincarnation. O Nanak, they are
respected at the Lord‟s Gate; they are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord. || 4 ||
14 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: The body is burnt to ashes; by its love of Maya, the
mind is rusted through. Demerits become one‟s enemies, and falsehood blows the bugle
of attack. Without the Word of the Shabad, people wander lost in reincarnation.
Through the love of duality, multitudes have been drowned. || 1 || O mind, swim
across, by focusing your consciousness on the Shabad. Those who do not become
Gurmukh do not understand the Naam; they die, and continue coming and going in
reincarnation. || 1 || Pause || That body is said to be pure, in which the True Name
abides. One whose body is imbued with the Fear of the True One, and whose tongue
savors Truthfulness, is brought to ecstasy by the True Lord‟s Glance of Grace. That
person does not have to go through the fire of the womb again. || 2 || From the True
Lord came the air, and from the air came water. From water, He created the three
worlds; in each and every heart He has infused His Light. The Immaculate Lord does
not become polluted. Attuned to the Shabad, honor is obtained. || 3 || One whose
mind is contented with Truthfulness, is blessed with the Lord‟s Glance of Grace. 

The body of the five elements is dyed in the Fear of the True One; the mind is filled
with the True Light. O Nanak, your demerits shall be forgotten; the Guru shall preserve
your honor. || 4 || 15 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, the Boat of Truth will
ferry you across; contemplate the Guru. Some come, and some go; they are totally
filled with egotism. Through stubborn-mindedness, the intellect is drowned; one who
becomes Gurmukh and truthful is saved. || 1 || Without the Guru, how can anyone
swim across to find peace? As it pleases You, Lord, You save me. There is no other for
me at all. || 1 || Pause || In front of me, I see the jungle burning; behind me, I see
green plants sprouting. We shall merge into the One from whom we came. The True
One is pervading each and every heart. He Himself unites us in Union with Himself; the
True Mansion of His Presence is close at hand. || 2 || With each and every breath, I
dwell upon You; I shall never forget You. The more the Lord and Master dwells within
the mind, the more the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. Mind and body are
Yours; You are my Master. Please rid me of my pride, and let me merge with You. || 3
|| The One who formed this universe created the creation of the three worlds. The
Gurmukh knows the Divine Light, while the foolish self-willed manmukh gropes around
in the darkness. One who sees that Light within each and every heart understands the
Essence of the Guru‟s Teachings. || 4 || Those who understand are Gurmukh;
recognize and applaud them. They meet and merge with the True One. They become
the Radiant Manifestation of the Excellence of the True One. O Nanak, they are
contented with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They offer their bodies and souls to
God. || 5 || 16 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Listen, O my mind, my friend, my
darling: now is the time to meet the Lord. As long as there is youth and breath, give
this body to Him. Without virtue, it is useless; the body shall crumble into a pile of dust.
|| 1 || O my mind, earn the profit, before you return home. The Gurmukh praises the
Naam, and the fire of egotism is extinguished. || 1 || Pause || Again and again, we
hear and tell stories; we read and write and understand loads of knowledge, but still,
desires increase day and night, and the disease of egotism fills us with corruption. That
Carefree Lord cannot be appraised; His Real Value is known only through the Wisdom
of the Guru‟s Teachings. || 2 || Even if someone has hundreds of thousands of clever
mental tricks, and the love and company of hundreds of thousands of people—still,
without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he will not feel satisfied. Without
the Name, all suffer in sorrow. Chanting the Name of the Lord, O my soul, you shall be
emancipated; as Gurmukh, you shall come to understand your own self. || 3 || I have
sold my body and mind to the Guru, and I have given my mind and head as well. I was
seeking and searching for Him throughout the three worlds; then, as Gurmukh, I sought
and found Him. The True Guru has united me in Union, O Nanak, with that God. || 4 ||
17 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: I have no anxiety about dying, and no hope of
living. You are the Cherisher of all beings; You keep the account of our breaths and
morsels of food. You abide within the Gurmukh. As it pleases You, You decide our
allotment. || 1 || O my soul, chant the Name of the Lord; the mind will be pleased
and appeased. 

The raging fire within is extinguished; the Gurmukh obtains spiritual wisdom. || 1 ||
Pause || Know the state of your inner being; meet with the Guru and get rid of your
skepticism. To reach your True Home after you die, you must conquer death while you
are still alive. The beautiful, Unstruck Sound of the Shabad is obtained, contemplating
the Guru. || 2 || The Unstruck Melody of Gurbani is obtained, and egotism is
eliminated. I am forever a sacrifice to those who serve their True Guru. They are
dressed in robes of honor in the Court of the Lord; the Name of the Lord is on their lips.
|| 3 || Wherever I look, I see the Lord pervading there, in the union of Shiva and
Shakti, of consciousness and matter. The three qualities hold the body in bondage;
whoever comes into the world is subject to their play. Those who separate themselves
from the Lord wander lost in misery. The self-willed manmukhs do not attain union with
Him. || 4 || If the mind becomes balanced and detached, and comes to dwell in its
own true home, imbued with the Fear of God, then it enjoys the essence of supreme
spiritual wisdom; it shall never feel hunger again. O Nanak, conquer and subdue this
mind; meet with the Lord, and you shall never again suffer in pain. || 5 || 18 || SIREE
RAAG, FIRST MEHL: This foolish mind is greedy; through greed, it becomes even more
attached to greed. The evil-minded shaaktas, the faithless cynics, are not attuned to the
Shabad; they come and go in reincarnation. One who meets with the Holy True Guru
finds the Treasure of Excellence. || 1 || O mind, renounce your egotistical pride.
Serve the Lord, the Guru, the Sacred Pool, and you shall be honored in the Court of the
Lord. || 1 || Pause || Chant the Name of the Lord day and night; become Gurmukh,
and know the Wealth of the Lord. All comforts and peace, and the Essence of the Lord,
are enjoyed by acquiring spiritual wisdom in the Society of the Saints. Day and night,
continually serve the Lord God; the True Guru has given the Naam. || 2 || Those who
practice falsehood are dogs; those who slander the Guru shall burn in their own fire.
They wander lost and confused, deceived by doubt, suffering in terrible pain. The
Messenger of Death shall beat them to a pulp. The self-willed manmukhs find no peace,
while the Gurmukhs are wondrously joyful. || 3 || In this world, people are engrossed
in false pursuits, but in the world hereafter, only the account of your true actions is
accepted. The Guru serves the Lord, His Intimate Friend. The Guru‟s actions are
supremely exalted. O Nanak, never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the True
Lord shall bless you with His Mark of Grace. || 4 || 19 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL:
Forgetting the Beloved, even for a moment, the mind is afflicted with terrible diseases.
How can honor be attained in His Court, if the Lord does not dwell in the mind? Meeting
with the Guru, peace is found. The fire is extinguished in His Glorious Praises. || 1 ||
O mind, enshrine the Praises of the Lord, day and night. One who does not forget the
Naam, for a moment or even an instant—how rare is such a person in this world! || 1
|| Pause || When one‟s light merges into the Light, and one‟s intuitive consciousness
is joined with the Intuitive Consciousness, then one‟s cruel and violent instincts and
egotism depart, and skepticism and sorrow are taken away. The Lord abides within the
mind of the Gurmukh, who merges in the Lord‟s Union, through the Guru. || 2 || If I
surrender my body like a bride, the Enjoyer will enjoy me. Do not make love with one
who is just a passing show. 

The Gurmukh is ravished like the pure and happy bride on the Bed of God, her
Husband. || 3 || The Gurmukh puts out the four fires, with the Water of the Lord‟s
Name. The lotus blossoms deep within the heart, and filled with Ambrosial Nectar, one
is satisfied. O Nanak, make the True Guru your friend; going to His Court, you shall
obtain the True Lord. || 4 || 20 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Meditate on the Lord,
Har, Har, O my beloved; follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and speak of the Lord. Apply the
Touchstone of Truth to your mind, and see if it comes up to its full weight. No one has
found the worth of the ruby of the heart; its value cannot be estimated. || 1 || O
Siblings of Destiny, the Diamond of the Lord is within the Guru. The True Guru is found
in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Day and night, praise the Word of His
Shabad. || 1 || Pause || The True Merchandise, Wealth and Capital are obtained
through the Radiant Light of the Guru. Just as fire is extinguished by pouring on water,
desire becomes the slave of the Lord‟s slaves. The Messenger of Death will not touch
you; in this way, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, carrying others across
with you. || 2 || The Gurmukhs do not like falsehood. They are imbued with Truth;
they love only Truth. The shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not like the Truth; false are
the foundations of the false. Imbued with Truth, you shall meet the Guru. The true
ones are absorbed into the True Lord. || 3 || Within the mind are emeralds and
rubies, the Jewel of the Naam, treasures and diamonds. The Naam is the True
Merchandise and Wealth; in each and every heart, His Presence is deep and profound.
O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Diamond of the Lord, by His Kindness and
Compassion. || 4 || 21 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: The fire of doubt is not
extinguished, even by wandering through foreign lands and countries. If inner filth is
not removed, one‟s life is cursed, and one‟s clothes are cursed. There is no other way to
perform devotional worship, except through the Teachings of the True Guru. || 1 || O
mind, become Gurmukh, and extinguish the fire within. Let the Words of the Guru abide
within your mind; let egotism and desires die. || 1 || Pause || The jewel of the mind
is priceless; through the Name of the Lord, honor is obtained. Join the Sat Sangat, the
True Congregation, and find the Lord. The Gurmukh embraces love for the Lord. Give
up your selfishness, and you shall find peace; like water mingling with water, you shall
merge in absorption. || 2 || Those who have not contemplated the Name of the Lord,
Har, Har, are unworthy; they come and go in reincarnation. One who has not met with
the True Guru, the Primal Being, is bothered and bewildered in the terrifying worldocean. This jewel of the soul is priceless, and yet it is being squandered like this, in
exchange for a mere shell. || 3 || Those who joyfully meet with the True Guru are
perfectly fulfilled and wise. Meeting with the Guru, they cross over the terrifying worldocean. In the Court of the Lord, they are honored and approved. O Nanak, their faces
are radiant; the Music of the Shabad, the Word of God, wells up within them. || 4 || 22
|| SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Make your deals, dealers, and take care of your
merchandise. Buy that object which will go along with you. In the next world, the Allknowing Merchant will take this object and care for it. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny,
chant the Lord‟s Name, and focus your consciousness on Him. Take the Merchandise of
the Lord‟s Praises with you. 

Your Husband Lord shall see this and approve. || 1 || Pause || Those who do not
have the Assets of Truth—how can they find peace? By dealing their deals of falsehood,
their minds and bodies become false. Like the deer caught in the trap, they suffer in
terrible agony; they continually cry out in pain. || 2 || The counterfeit coins are not
put into the Treasury; they do not obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord-Guru. The false
ones have no social status or honor. No one succeeds through falsehood. Practicing
falsehood again and again, people come and go in reincarnation, and forfeit their honor.
|| 3 || O Nanak, instruct your mind through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and praise
the Lord. Those who are imbued with the love of the Name of the Lord are not loaded
down by doubt. Those who chant the Name of the Lord earn great profits; the Fearless
Lord abides within their minds. || 4 || 23 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, SECOND
HOUSE: Wealth, the beauty of youth and flowers are guests for only a few days. Like
the leaves of the water-lily, they wither and fade and finally die. || 1 || Be happy,
dear beloved, as long as your youth is fresh and delightful. But your days are few—you
have grown weary, and now your body has grown old. || 1 || Pause || My playful
friends have gone to sleep in the graveyard. In my double-mindedness, I shall have to
go as well. I cry in a feeble voice. || 2 || Haven‟t you heard the call from beyond, O
beautiful soul-bride? You must go to your in-laws; you cannot stay with your parents
forever. || 3 || O Nanak, know that she who sleeps in her parents‟ home is plundered
in broad daylight. She has lost her bouquet of merits; gathering one of demerits, she
departs. || 4 || 24 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE: He Himself is the
Enjoyer, and He Himself is the Enjoyment. He Himself is the Ravisher of all. He Himself
is the Bride in her dress, He Himself is the Bridegroom on the bed. || 1 || My Lord
and Master is imbued with love; He is totally permeating and pervading all. || 1 ||
Pause || He Himself is the fisherman and the fish; He Himself is the water and the
net. He Himself is the sinker, and He Himself is the bait. || 2 || He Himself loves in so
many ways. O sister soul-brides, He is my Beloved. He continually ravishes and enjoys
the happy soul-brides; just look at the plight I am in without Him! || 3 || Prays
Nanak, please hear my prayer: You are the pool, and You are the soul-swan. You are
the lotus flower of the day and You are the water-lily of the night. You Yourself behold
them, and blossom forth in bliss. || 4 || 25 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, THIRD
HOUSE: Make this body the field, and plant the seed of good actions. Water it with the
Name of the Lord, who holds all the world in His Hands. Let your mind be the farmer;
the Lord shall sprout in your heart, and you shall attain the state of Nirvaanaa. || 1 ||
You fool! Why are you so proud of Maya? Father, children, spouse, mother and all
relatives—they shall not be your helpers in the end. || Pause || So weed out evil,
wickedness and corruption; leave these behind, and let your soul meditate on God.
When chanting, austere meditation and self-discipline become your protectors, then the
lotus blossoms forth, and the honey trickles out. || 2 || Bring the twenty-seven
elements of the body under your control, and throughout the three stages of life,
remember death. See the Infinite Lord in the ten directions, and in all the variety of
nature. Says Nanak, in this way, the One Lord shall carry you across. || 


3 || 26 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, THIRD HOUSE: Make good deeds the soil, and
let the Word of the Shabad be the seed; irrigate it continually with the water of Truth.
Become such a farmer, and faith will sprout. This brings knowledge of heaven and hell,
you fool! || 1 || Do not think that your Husband Lord can be obtained by mere words.
You are wasting this life in the pride of wealth and the splendor of beauty. || 1 ||
Pause || The defect of the body which leads to sin is the mud puddle, and this mind
is the frog, which does not appreciate the lotus flower at all. The bumble bee is the
teacher who continually teaches the lesson. But how can one understand, unless one is
made to understand? || 2 || This speaking and listening is like the song of the wind,
for those whose minds are colored by the love of Maya. The Grace of the Master is
bestowed upon those who meditate on Him alone. They are pleasing to His Heart. || 3
|| You may observe the thirty fasts, and say the five prayers each day, but „Satan‟ can
undo them. Says Nanak, you will have to walk on the Path of Death, so why do you
bother to collect wealth and property? || 4 || 27 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL,
FOURTH HOUSE: He is the Master who has made the world bloom; He makes the
Universe blossom forth, fresh and green. He holds the water and the land in bondage.
Hail to the Creator Lord! || 1 || Death, O Mullah—death will come, so live in the Fear
of God the Creator. || 1 || Pause || You are a Mullah, and you are a Qazi, only when
you know the Naam, the Name of God. You may be very educated, but no one can
remain when the measure of life is full. || 2 || He alone is a Qazi, who renounces
selfishness and conceit, and makes the One Name his Support. The True Creator Lord
is, and shall always be. He was not born; He shall not die. || 3 || You may chant your
prayers five times each day; you may read the Bible and the Koran. Says Nanak, the
grave is calling you, and now your food and drink are finished. || 4 || 28 || SIREE
RAAG, FIRST MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE: The dogs of greed are with me. In the early
morning, they continually bark at the wind. Falsehood is my dagger; through deception,
I eat the carcasses of the dead. I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! || 1 || I have not
followed good advice, nor have I done good deeds. I am deformed and horribly
disfigured. Your Name alone, Lord, saves the world. This is my hope; this is my support.
|| 1 || Pause || With my mouth I speak slander, day and night. I spy on the houses
of others—I am such a wretched low-life! Unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger
dwell in my body, like the outcasts who cremate the dead. I live as a wild hunter, O
Creator! || 2 || I make plans to trap others, although I appear gentle. I am a robber—
I rob the world. I am very clever—I carry loads of sin. I live as a wild hunter, O Creator!
|| 3 || I have not appreciated what You have done for me, Lord; I take from others
and exploit them. What face shall I show You, Lord? I am a sneak and a thief. Nanak
describes the state of the lowly. I live as a wild hunter, O Creator! || 4 || 29 || SIREE
RAAG, FIRST MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE: There is one awareness among all created
beings. None have been created without this awareness. 

As is their awareness, so is their way. According to the account of our actions, we come
and go in reincarnation. || 1 || Why, O soul, do you try such clever tricks? Taking
away and giving back, God does not delay. || 1 || Pause || All beings belong to You;
all beings are Yours. O Lord and Master, how can You become angry with them? Even if
You, O Lord and Master, become angry with them, still, You are theirs, and they are
Yours. || 2 || We are foul-mouthed; we spoil everything with our foul words. You
weigh us in the balance of Your Glance of Grace. When one‟s actions are right, the
understanding is perfect. Without good deeds, it becomes more and more deficient. ||
3 || Prays Nanak, what is the nature of the spiritual people? They are self-realized;
they understand God. By Guru‟s Grace, they contemplate Him; such spiritual people are
honored in His Court. || 4 || 30 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE: You
are the River, All-knowing and All-seeing. I am just a fish—how can I find Your limit?
Wherever I look, You are there. Outside of You, I would burst and die. || 1 || I do not
know of the fisherman, and I do not know of the net. But when the pain comes, then I
call upon You. || 1 || Pause || You are present everywhere. I had thought that You
were far away. Whatever I do, I do in Your Presence. You see all my actions, and yet I
deny them. I have not worked for You, or Your Name. || 2 || Whatever You give me,
that is what I eat. There is no other door—unto which door should I go? Nanak offers
this one prayer: this body and soul are totally Yours. || 3 || He Himself is near, and
He Himself is far away; He Himself is in-between. He Himself beholds, and He Himself
listens. By His Creative Power, He created the world. Whatever pleases Him, O Nanak—
that Command is acceptable. || 4 || 31 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, FOURTH
HOUSE: Why should the created beings feel pride in their minds? The Gift is in the
Hands of the Great Giver. As it pleases Him, He may give, or not give. What can be
done by the order of the created beings? || 1 || He Himself is True; Truth is pleasing
to His Will. The spiritually blind are unripe and imperfect, inferior and worthless. || 1 ||
Pause || The One who owns the trees of the forest and the plants of the garden—
according to their nature, He gives them all their names. The Flower and the Fruit of
the Lord‟s Love are obtained by pre-ordained destiny. As we plant, so we harvest and
eat. || 2 || The wall of the body is temporary, as is the soul-mason within it. The
flavor of the intellect is bland and insipid without the Salt. O Nanak, as He wills, He
makes things right. Without the Name, no one is approved. || 3 || 32 || SIREE RAAG,
FIRST MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE: The Undeceiveable is not deceived by deception. He
cannot be wounded by any dagger. As our Lord and Master keeps us, so do we exist.
The soul of this greedy person is tossed this way and that. || 1 || Without the oil,
how can the lamp be lit? || 1 || Pause || Let the reading of your prayer book be the
oil, and let the Fear of God be the wick for the lamp of this body. Light this lamp with
the understanding of Truth. || 2 || Use this oil to light this lamp. Light it, and meet
your Lord and Master. || 1 || Pause || This body is softened with the Word of the
Guru‟s Bani; you shall find peace, doing seva (selfless service). 

All the world continues coming and going in reincarnation. || 3 || In the midst of this
world, do seva, and you shall be given a place of honor in the Court of the Lord. Says
Nanak, swing your arms in joy! || 4 || 33 ||

SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

I serve my True Guru with single-minded devotion, and lovingly focus my consciousness
on Him. The True Guru is the mind‟s desire and the sacred shrine of pilgrimage, for
those unto whom He has given this understanding. The blessings of the wishes of the
mind are obtained, and the fruits of one‟s desires. Meditate on the Name, worship the
Name, and through the Name, you shall be absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. || 1
|| O my mind, drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and your thirst shall be
quenched. Those Gurmukhs who have tasted it remain intuitively absorbed in the Lord.
|| 1 || Pause || Those who serve the True Guru obtain the Treasure of the Naam.
Deep within, they are drenched with the Essence of the Lord, and the egotistical pride
of the mind is subdued. The heart-lotus blossoms forth, and they intuitively center
themselves in meditation. Their minds become pure, and they remain immersed in the
Lord; they are honored in His Court. || 2 || Those who serve the True Guru in this
world are very rare. Those who keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts subdue egotism
and possessiveness. I am a sacrifice to those who are in love with the Naam. Those
who attain the Inexhaustible Name of the Infinite Lord remain happy throughout the
four ages. || 3 || Meeting with the Guru, the Naam is obtained, and the thirst of
emotional attachment departs. When the mind is permeated with the Lord, one remains
detached within the home of the heart. I am a sacrifice to those who enjoy the Sublime
Taste of the Lord. O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace, the True Name, the Treasure of
Excellence, is obtained. || 4 || 1 || 34 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: People wear all
sorts of costumes and wander all around, but in their hearts and minds, they practice
deception. They do not attain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, and after death, they
sink into manure. || 1 || O mind, remain detached in the midst of your household.
Practicing truth, self-discipline and good deeds, the Gurmukh is enlightened. || 1 ||
Pause || Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the mind is conquered, and one
attains the State of Liberation in one‟s own home. So meditate on the Name of the
Lord; join and merge with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. || 2 || You may
enjoy the pleasures of hundreds of thousands of women, and rule the nine continents
of the world. But without the True Guru, you will not find peace; you will be
reincarnated over and over again. || 3 || Those who wear the Necklace of the Lord
around their necks, and focus their consciousness on the Guru‟s Feet—wealth and
supernatural spiritual powers follow them, but they do not care for such things at all. ||
4 || Whatever pleases God‟s Will comes to pass. Nothing else can be done. Servant
Nanak lives by chanting the Naam. 

O Lord, please give it to me, in Your Natural Way. || 5 || 2 || 35 || SIREE RAAG,
THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: Everyone belongs to the One who rules the Universe.
The Gurmukh practices good deeds, and the truth is revealed in the heart. True is the
reputation of the true, within whom truth abides. Those who meet the True Lord are
not separated again; they come to dwell in the home of the self deep within. || 1 || O
my Lord! Without the Lord, I have no other at all. The True Guru leads us to meet the
Immaculate True God through the Word of His Shabad. || 1 || Pause || One whom
the Lord merges into Himself is merged in the Shabad, and remains so merged. No one
merges with Him through the love of duality; over and over again, they come and go in
reincarnation. The One Lord permeates all. The One Lord is pervading everywhere. That
Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord shows His Kindness, is absorbed in the Naam, the Name
of the Lord. || 2 || After all their reading, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the
astrologers argue and debate. Their intellect and understanding are perverted; they just
don‟t understand. They are filled with greed and corruption. Through 8.4 million
incarnations they wander lost and confused; through all their wandering and roaming,
they are ruined. They act according to their pre-ordained destiny, which no one can
erase. || 3 || It is very difficult to serve the True Guru. Surrender your head; give up
your selfishness. Realizing the Shabad, one meets with the Lord, and all one‟s service is
accepted. By personally experiencing the Personality of the Guru, one‟s own personality
is uplifted, and one‟s light merges into the Light. Those who have such pre-ordained
destiny come to meet the True Guru. || 4 || O mind, don‟t cry out that you are
hungry, always hungry; stop complaining. The One who created the 8.4 million species
of beings gives sustenance to all. The Fearless Lord is forever Merciful; He takes care of
all. O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, and finds the Door of Liberation. || 5 || 3 ||
36 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Those who hear and believe, find the home of the
self deep within. Through the Guru's Teachings, they praise the True Lord; they find the
Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, they are
immaculate and pure. I am forever a sacrifice to them. Those people, within whose
hearts the Lord abides, are radiant and enlightened. || 1 || O my mind, meditate on
the Immaculate Lord, Har, Har. Those whose have such pre-ordained destiny written on
their foreheads—those Gurmukhs remain absorbed in the Lord‟s Love. || 1 || Pause ||
O Saints, see clearly that the Lord is near at hand; He is pervading everywhere. Those
who follow the Guru‟s Teachings realize Him, and see Him Ever-present. He dwells
forever in the minds of the virtuous. He is far removed from those worthless people
who lack virtue. The self-willed manmukhs are totally without virtue. Without the Name,
they die in frustration. || 2 || Those who hear and believe in the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, meditate on the Lord in their minds. Night and day, they are steeped in
devotion; their minds and bodies become pure. The color of the world is false and
weak; when it washes away, people cry out in pain. 

Those who have the Radiant Light of the Naam within, become steady and stable,
forever and ever. || 3 || The blessing of this human life has been obtained, but still,
people do not lovingly focus their thoughts on the Name of the Lord. Their feet slip, and
they cannot stay here any longer. And in the next world, they find no place of rest at
all. This opportunity shall not come again. In the end, they depart, regretting and
repenting. Those whom the Lord blesses with His Glance of Grace are saved; they are
lovingly attuned to the Lord. || 4 || They all show off and pretend, but the self-willed
manmukhs do not understand. Those Gurmukhs who are pure of heart—their service is
accepted. They sing the Glorious Praise of the Lord; they read about the Lord each day.
Singing the Praise of the Lord, they merge in absorption. O Nanak, the words of those
who are lovingly attuned to the Naam are true forever. || 5 || 4 || 37 || SIREE RAAG,
THIRD MEHL: Those who meditate single-mindedly on the Naam, and contemplate the
Teachings of the Guru—their faces are forever radiant in the Court of the True Lord.
They drink in the Ambrosial Nectar forever and ever, and they love the True Name. || 1
|| O Siblings of Destiny, the Gurmukhs are honored forever. They meditate forever on
the Lord, Har, Har, and they wash off the filth of egotism. || 1 || Pause || The selfwilled manmukhs do not know the Naam. Without the Name, they lose their honor.
They do not savor the Taste of the Shabad; they are attached to the love of duality.
They are worms in the filth of manure. They fall into manure, and into manure they are
absorbed. || 2 || Fruitful are the lives of those who walk in harmony with the Will of
the True Guru. Their families are saved; blessed are the mothers who gave birth to
them. By His Will He grants His Grace; those who are so blessed, meditate on the Name
of the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam; they eradicate
selfishness and conceit from within. They are pure, inwardly and outwardly; they merge
into the Truest of the True. O Nanak, blessed is the coming of those who follow the
Guru‟s Teachings and meditate on the Lord. || 4 || 5 || 38 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD
MEHL: The devotees of the Lord have the Wealth and Capital of the Lord; with Guru‟s
Advice, they carry on their trade. They praise the Name of the Lord forever and ever.
The Name of the Lord is their Merchandise and Support. The Perfect Guru has
implanted the Name of the Lord into the Lord‟s devotees; it is an Inexhaustible
Treasure. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, instruct your minds in this way. O mind, why
are you so lazy? Become Gurmukh, and meditate on the Naam. || 1 || Pause ||
Devotion to the Lord is love for the Lord. The Gurmukh reflects deeply and
contemplates. Hypocrisy is not devotion—speaking words of duality leads only to
misery. Those humble beings who are filled with keen understanding and meditative
contemplation—even though they intermingle with others, they remain distinct. || 2 ||
Those who keep the Lord enshrined within their hearts are said to be the servants of
the Lord. Placing mind and body in offering before the Lord, they conquer and eradicate
egotism from within. Blessed and acclaimed is that Gurmukh, who shall never be
defeated. || 3 || Those who receive His Grace find Him. 

Without His Grace, He cannot be found. The 8.4 million species of beings all yearn for
the Lord. Those whom He unites, come to be united with the Lord. O Nanak, the
Gurmukh finds the Lord, and remains forever absorbed in the Lord‟s Name. 

|| 4 || 6 ||
39 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The Name of the Lord is the Ocean of Peace; the
Gurmukhs obtain it. Meditating on the Naam, night and day, they are easily and
intuitively absorbed in the Naam. Their inner beings are immersed in the True Lord;
they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, the world is in
misery, engrossed in the love of duality. In the Sanctuary of the Guru, peace is found,
meditating on the Naam night and day. || 1 || Pause || The truthful ones are not
stained by filth. Meditating on the Lord, their minds remain pure. The Gurmukhs realize
the Word of the Shabad; they are immersed in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord‟s
Name. The Guru has lit the brilliant light of spiritual wisdom, and the darkness of
ignorance has been dispelled. || 2 || The self-willed manmukhs are polluted. They are
filled with the pollution of egotism, wickedness and desire. Without the Shabad, this
pollution is not washed off; through the cycle of death and rebirth, they waste away in
misery. Engrossed in this transitory drama, they are not at home in either this world or
the next. || 3 || For the Gurmukh, the love of the Name of the Lord is chanting, deep
meditation and self-discipline. The Gurmukh meditates forever on the Name of the One
Creator Lord. O Nanak, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Support of all
beings. || 4 || 7 || 40 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The self-willed manmukhs are
engrossed in emotional attachment; they are not balanced or detached. They do not
comprehend the Word of the Shabad. They suffer in pain forever, and lose their honor
in the Court of the Lord. The Gurmukhs shed their ego; attuned to the Naam, they find
peace. || 1 || O my mind, day and night, you are always full of wishful hopes. Serve
the True Guru, and your emotional attachment shall be totally burnt away; remain
detached within the home of your heart. || 1 || Pause || The Gurmukhs do good
deeds and blossom forth; balanced and detached in the Lord, they are in ecstasy. Night
and day, they perform devotional worship, day and night; subduing their ego, they are
carefree. By great good fortune, I found the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; I have
found the Lord, with intuitive ease and ecstasy. || 2 || That person is a Holy Saadhu,
and a renouncer of the world, whose heart is filled with the Naam. His inner being is
not touched by anger or dark energies at all; he has lost his selfishness and conceit.
The True Guru has revealed to him the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he
drinks in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and is satisfied. || 3 || Whoever has found
it, has done so in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Through perfect good
fortune, such balanced detachment is attained. The self-willed manmukhs wander
around lost, but they do not know the True Guru. They are inwardly attached to
egotism. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Shabad are dyed in the Color of the
Lord‟s Name. Without the Fear of God, how can they retain this Color? || 4 || 8 || 41 ||
SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Within the home of your own inner being, the
merchandise is obtained. All commodities are within. Each and every moment, dwell on
the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukhs obtain it. The Treasure of the Naam is
inexhaustible. By great good fortune, it is obtained. || 1 || 

O my mind, give up slander, egotism and arrogance. Become Gurmukh, and meditate
forever on the Dear Lord, the One and Only Creator. || 1 || Pause || The faces of
the Gurmukhs are radiant and bright; they reflect on the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad.
They obtain peace in this world and the next, chanting and meditating within their
hearts on the Lord. Within the home of their own inner being, they obtain the Mansion
of the Lord‟s Presence, reflecting on the Guru‟s Shabad. || 2 || Those who turn their
faces away from the True Guru shall have their faces blackened. Night and day, they
suffer in pain; they see the noose of Death always hovering above them. Even in their
dreams, they find no peace; they are consumed by the fires of intense anxiety. || 3 ||
The One Lord is the Giver of all; He Himself bestows all blessings. No one else has any
say in this; He gives just as He pleases. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs obtain Him; He Himself
knows Himself. || 4 || 9 || 42 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Serve your True Lord
and Master, and you shall be blessed with true greatness. By Guru‟s Grace, He abides in
the mind, and egotism is driven out. This wandering mind comes to rest, when the Lord
casts His Glance of Grace. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, become Gurmukh, and
meditate on the Name of the Lord. The Treasure of the Naam abides forever within the
mind, and one‟s place of rest is found in the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. || 1 ||
Pause || The minds and bodies of the self-willed manmukhs are filled with darkness;
they find no shelter, no place of rest. Through countless incarnations they wander lost,
like crows in a deserted house. Through the Guru's Teachings, the heart is illuminated.
Through the Shabad, the Name of the Lord is received. || 2 || In the corruption of the
three qualities, there is blindness; in attachment to Maya, there is darkness. The greedy
people serve others, instead of the Lord, although they loudly announce their reading of
scriptures. They are burnt to death by their own corruption; they are not at home, on
either this shore or the one beyond. || 3 || In attachment to Maya, they have
forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World. Without the Guru, all are unconscious;
they are held in bondage by the Messenger of Death. O Nanak, through the Guru‟s
Teachings, you shall be saved, contemplating the True Name. || 4 || 10 || 43 ||
SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The three qualities hold people in attachment to Maya.
The Gurmukh attains the fourth state of higher consciousness. Granting His Grace, God
unites us with Himself. The Name of the Lord comes to abide within the mind. Those
who have the treasure of goodness join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. || 1 ||
O Siblings of Destiny, follow the Guru‟s Teachings and dwell in truth. Practice truth, and
only truth, and merge in the True Word of the Shabad. || 1 || Pause || I am a
sacrifice to those who recognize the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Renouncing
selfishness, I fall at their feet, and walk in harmony with His Will. Earning the Profit of
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am intuitively absorbed in the Naam. || 2 ||
Without the Guru, the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence is not found, and the Naam is not
obtained. Seek and find such a True Guru, who shall lead you to the True Lord. Destroy
your evil passions, and you shall dwell in peace. Whatever pleases the Lord comes to
pass. || 3 || As one knows the True Guru, so is the peace obtained. There is no doubt
at all about this, but those who love Him are very rare. O Nanak, the One Light has two
forms; through the Shabad, union is attained. 

|| 4 || 11 || 44 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Discarding the Ambrosial Nectar, they
greedily grab the poison; they serve others, instead of the Lord. They lose their faith,
they have no understanding; night and day, they suffer in pain. The blind, self-willed
manmukhs do not even think of the Lord; they are drowned to death without water. ||
1 || O mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the Lord; seek the Protection of His
Sanctuary. If the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad abides deep within, then you shall not
forget the Lord. || 1 || Pause || This body is the puppet of Maya. The evil of egotism
is within it. Coming and going through birth and death, the self-willed manmukhs lose
their honor. Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained, and one‟s light merges
into the Light. || 2 || Serving the True Guru brings a deep and profound peace, and
one‟s desires are fulfilled. Abstinence, truthfulness and self-discipline are obtained, and
the body is purified; the Lord, Har, Har, comes to dwell within the mind. Such a person
remains blissful forever, day and night. Meeting the Beloved, peace is found. || 3 || I
am a sacrifice to those who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru. In the Court of the
True One, they are blessed with true greatness; they are intuitively absorbed into the
True Lord. O Nanak, by His Glance of Grace He is found; the Gurmukh is united in His
Union. || 4 || 12 || 45 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The self-willed manmukh
performs religious rituals, like the unwanted bride decorating her body. Her Husband
Lord does not come to her bed; day after day, she grows more and more miserable.
She does not attain the Mansion of His Presence; she does not find the door to His
House. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, meditate on the Naam with one-pointed mind.
Remain united with the Society of the Saints; chant the Name of the Lord, and find
peace. || 1 || Pause || The Gurmukh is the happy and pure soul-bride forever. She
keeps her Husband Lord enshrined within her heart. Her speech is sweet, and her way
of life is humble. She enjoys the Bed of her Husband Lord. The happy and pure soulbride is noble; she has infinite love for the Guru. || 2 || By perfect good fortune, one
meets the True Guru, when one‟s destiny is awakened. Suffering and doubt are cut out
from within, and peace is obtained. One who walks in harmony with the Guru‟s Will
shall not suffer in pain. || 3 || The Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar, is in the Guru‟s Will.
With intuitive ease, it is obtained. Those who are destined to have it, drink it in; their
egotism is eradicated from within. O Nanak, the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and
is united with the True Lord. || 4 || 13 || 46 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: If you
know that He is your Husband Lord, offer your body and mind to Him. Behave like the
happy and pure soul-bride. With intuitive ease, you shall merge with the True Lord, and
He shall bless you with true greatness. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, without the Guru,
there is no devotional worship. Without the Guru, devotion is not obtained, even though
everyone may long for it. || 1 || Pause || The soul-bride in love with duality goes
around the wheel of reincarnation, through 8.4 million incarnations. Without the Guru,
she finds no sleep, and she passes her life-night in pain. Without the Shabad, she does
not find her Husband Lord, and her life wastes away in vain. || 

2 || Practicing egotism, selfishness and conceit, she wanders around the world, but
her wealth and property will not go with her. The spiritually blind do not even think of
the Naam; they are all bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death. Meeting the True
Guru, the wealth is obtained, contemplating the Name of the Lord in the heart. || 3 ||
Those who are attuned to the Naam are immaculate and pure; through the Guru, they
obtain intuitive peace and poise. Their minds and bodies are dyed in the Color of the
Lord‟s Love, and their tongues savor His Sublime Essence. O Nanak, that Primal Color
which the Lord has applied, shall never fade away. || 4 || 14 || 47 || SIREE RAAG,
THIRD MEHL: By His Grace one becomes Gurmukh, worshipping the Lord with
devotion. Without the Guru there is no devotional worship. Those whom He unites with
Himself, understand and become pure. The Dear Lord is True, and True is the Word of
His Bani. Through the Shabad, we merge with Him. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny:
those who lack devotion—why have they even bothered to come into the world? They
do not serve the Perfect Guru; they waste away their lives in vain. || 1 || Pause ||
The Lord Himself, the Life of the World, is the Giver of Peace. He Himself forgives, and
unites with Himself. So what about all these poor beings and creatures? What can
anyone say? He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glory. He Himself enjoins us to His
Service. || 2 || Gazing upon their families, people are lured and trapped by emotional
attachment, but none will go along with them in the end. Serving the True Guru, one
finds the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. His Value cannot be estimated. The Lord
God is my Friend and Companion. God shall be my Helper and Support in the end. || 3
|| Within your conscious mind, you may say anything, but without the Guru,
selfishness is not removed. The Dear Lord is the Giver, the Lover of His devotees. By
His Grace, He comes to dwell in the mind. O Nanak, by His Grace, He bestows
enlightened awareness; God Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness. || 4
|| 15 || 48 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Blessed is the mother who gave birth;
blessed and respected is the father of one who serves the True Guru and finds peace.
His arrogant pride is banished from within. Standing at the Lord‟s Door, the humble
Saints serve Him; they find the Treasure of Excellence. || 1 || O my mind, become
Gurmukh, and meditate on the Lord. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad abides within the
mind, and the body and mind become pure. || 1 || Pause || By His Grace, He has
come into my home; He Himself has come to meet me. Singing His Praises through the
Shabads of the Guru, we are dyed in His Color with intuitive ease. Becoming truthful,
we merge with the True One; remaining blended with Him, we shall never be separated
again. || 2 || Whatever is to be done, the Lord is doing. No one else can do anything.
Those separated from Him for so long are reunited with Him once again by the True
Guru, who takes them into His Own Account. He Himself assigns all to their tasks;
nothing else can be done. || 3 || One whose mind and body are imbued with the
Lord‟s Love gives up egotism and corruption. Day and night, the Name of the One Lord,
the Fearless and Formless One, dwells within the heart. O Nanak, He blends us with
Himself, through the Perfect, Infinite Word of His Shabad. || 4 || 16 || 49 || SIREE
RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The Lord of the Universe is the Treasure of Excellence; His limits
cannot be found. 

He is not obtained by mouthing mere words, but by rooting out ego from within.
Meeting the True Guru, one is permeated forever with the Fear of God, who Himself
comes to dwell within the mind. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, one who becomes
Gurmukh and understands this is very rare. To act without understanding is to lose the
treasure of this human life. || 1 || Pause || Those who have tasted it, enjoy its
flavor; without tasting it, they wander in doubt, lost and deceived. The True Name is
the Ambrosial Nectar; no one can describe it. Drinking it in, one becomes honorable,
absorbed in the Perfect Word of the Shabad. || 2 || He Himself gives, and then we
receive. Nothing else can be done. The Gift is in the Hands of the Great Giver. At the
Guru‟s Door, in the Gurdwara, it is received. Whatever He does, comes to pass. All act
according to His Will. || 3 || The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is abstinence,
truthfulness, and self-restraint. Without the Name, no one becomes pure. Through
perfect good fortune, the Naam comes to abide within the mind. Through the Shabad,
we merge into Him. O Nanak, one who lives in intuitive peace and poise, imbued with
the Lord‟s Love, obtains the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 4 || 17 || 50 || SIREE
RAAG, THIRD MEHL: You may torment your body with extremes of self-discipline,
practice intensive meditation and hang upside-down, but your ego will not be eliminated
from within. You may perform religious rituals, and still never obtain the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, remain dead while yet
alive, and the Name of the Lord shall come to dwell within the mind. || 1 || Listen, O
my mind: hurry to the Protection of the Guru‟s Sanctuary. By Guru‟s Grace you shall be
saved. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, you shall cross over the terrifying
world-ocean of poison. || 1 || Pause || Everything under the influence of the three
qualities shall perish; the love of duality is corrupting. The Pandits, the religious
scholars, read the scriptures, but they are trapped in the bondage of emotional
attachment. In love with evil, they do not understand. Meeting the Guru, the bondage
of the three qualities is cut away, and in the fourth state, the Door of Liberation is
attained. || 2 || Through the Guru, the Path is found, and the darkness of emotional
attachment is dispelled. If one dies through the Shabad, then salvation is obtained, and
one finds the Door of Liberation. By Guru‟s Grace, one remains blended with the True
Name of the Creator. || 3 || This mind is very powerful; we cannot escape it just by
trying. In the love of duality, people suffer in pain, condemned to terrible punishment.
O Nanak, those who are attached to the Naam are saved; through the Shabad, their
ego is banished. || 4 || 18 || 51 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: By His Grace, the
Guru is found, and the Name of the Lord is implanted within. Without the Guru, no one
has obtained it; they waste away their lives in vain. The self-willed manmukhs create
karma, and in the Court of the Lord, they receive their punishment. || 1 || O mind,
give up the love of duality. The Lord dwells within you; serving the Guru, you shall find
peace. || Pause || When you love the Truth, your words are true; they reflect the
True Word of the Shabad. The Name of the Lord dwells within the mind; egotism and
anger are wiped away. Meditating on the Naam with a pure mind, the Door of
Liberation is found. || 2 || Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes. It dies and is reborn; it continues coming and going in reincarnation. The self-willed manmukhs do not
recognize the Shabad; they forfeit their honor, and depart in disgrace. 

Serving the Guru, the Name is obtained, and one remains absorbed in the True Lord. ||
3 || With faith in the Shabad, the Guru is found, and selfishness is eradicated from
within. Night and day, worship the True Lord with devotion and love forever. The
Treasure of the Naam abides in the mind; O Nanak, in the poise of perfect balance,
merge into the Lord. || 4 || 19 || 52 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Those who do
not serve the True Guru shall be miserable throughout the four ages. The Primal Being
is within their own home, but they do not recognize Him. They are plundered by their
egotistical pride and arrogance. Cursed by the True Guru, they wander around the
world begging, until they are exhausted. They do not serve the True Word of the
Shabad, which is the solution to all of their problems. || 1 || O my mind, see the Lord
ever close at hand. He shall remove the pains of death and rebirth; the Word of the
Shabad shall fill you to overflowing. || 1 || Pause || Those who praise the True One
are true; the True Name is their Support. They act truthfully, in love with the True Lord.
The True King has written His Order, which no one can erase. The self-willed
manmukhs do not obtain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. The false are plundered
by falsehood. || 2 || Engrossed in egotism, the world perishes. Without the Guru,
there is utter darkness. In emotional attachment to Maya, they have forgotten the Great
Giver, the Giver of Peace. Those who serve the True Guru are saved; they keep the
True One enshrined in their hearts. By His Grace, we find the Lord, and reflect on the
True Word of the Shabad. || 3 || Serving the True Guru, the mind becomes
immaculate and pure; egotism and corruption are discarded. So abandon your
selfishness, and remain dead while yet alive. Contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. The pursuit of worldly affairs comes to an end, when you embrace love for the
True One. Those who are attuned to Truth—their faces are radiant in the Court of the
True Lord. || 4 || Those who do not have faith in the Primal Being, the True Guru,
and who do not enshrine love for the Shabad—they take their cleansing baths, and give
to charity again and again, but they are ultimately consumed by their love of duality.
When the Dear Lord Himself grants His Grace, they are inspired to love the Naam. O
Nanak, immerse yourself in the Naam, through the Infinite Love of the Guru. || 5 || 20
|| 53 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Whom shall I serve? What shall I chant? I will go
and ask the Guru. I will accept the Will of the True Guru, and eradicate selfishness from
within. By this work and service, the Naam shall come to dwell within my mind.
Through the Naam, peace is obtained; I am adorned and embellished by the True Word
of the Shabad. || 1 || O my mind, remain awake and aware night and day, and think
of the Lord. Protect your crops, or else the birds shall descend on your farm. || 1 ||
Pause || The desires of the mind are fulfilled, when one is filled to overflowing with
the Shabad. One who fears, loves, and is devoted to the Dear Lord day and night, sees
Him always close at hand. Doubt runs far away from the bodies of those, whose minds
remain forever attuned to the True Word of the Shabad. The Immaculate Lord and
Master is found. He is True; He is the Ocean of Excellence. || 2 || Those who remain
awake and aware are saved, while those who sleep are plundered. They do not
recognize the True Word of the Shabad, and like a dream, their lives fade away. 

Like guests in a deserted house, they leave just exactly as they have come. The life of
the self-willed manmukh passes uselessly. What face will he show when he passes
beyond? || 3 || God Himself is everything; those who are in their ego cannot even
speak of this. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He is realized, and the pain of
egotism is eradicated from within. I fall at the feet of those who serve their True Guru.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who are found to be true in the True Court. || 4 ||
21 || 54 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Consider the time and the moment—when
should we worship the Lord? Night and day, one who is attuned to the Name of the
True Lord is true. If someone forgets the Beloved Lord, even for an instant, what sort of
devotion is that? One whose mind and body are cooled and soothed by the True Lord—
no breath of his is wasted. || 1 || O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord.
True devotional worship is performed when the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. || 1
|| Pause || With intuitive ease, cultivate your farm, and plant the Seed of the True
Name. The seedlings have sprouted luxuriantly, and with intuitive ease, the mind is
satisfied. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it in, thirst is
quenched. This true mind is attuned to Truth, and it remains permeated with the True
One. || 2 || In speaking, in seeing and in words, remain immersed in the Shabad. The
Word of the Guru‟s Bani vibrates throughout the four ages. As Truth, it teaches Truth.
Egotism and possessiveness are eliminated, and the True One absorbs them into
Himself. Those who remain lovingly absorbed in the True One see the Mansion of His
Presence close at hand. || 3 || By His Grace, we meditate on the Naam, the Name of
the Lord. Without His Mercy, it cannot be obtained. Through perfect good destiny, one
finds the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and one comes to meet the True Guru.
Night and day, remain attuned to the Naam, and the pain of corruption shall be
dispelled from within. O Nanak, merging with the Shabad through the Name, one is
immersed in the Name. || 4 || 22 || 55 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Those who
contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad are filled with the Fear of God. They
remain forever merged with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; they dwell upon
the Glories of the True One. They cast off the filth of their mental duality, and they
keep the Lord enshrined in their hearts. True is their speech, and true are their minds.
They are in love with the True One. || 1 || O my mind, you are filled with the filth of
egotism. The Immaculate Lord is eternally Beautiful. We are adorned with the Word of
the Shabad. || 1 || Pause || God joins to Himself those whose minds are fascinated
with the True Word of His Shabad. Night and day, they are attuned to the Naam, and
their light is absorbed into the Light. Through His Light, God is revealed. Without the
True Guru, understanding is not obtained. The True Guru comes to meet those who
have such pre-ordained destiny. || 2 || Without the Name, all are miserable. In the
love of duality, they are ruined. Without Him, I cannot survive even for an instant, and
my life-night passes in anguish. Wandering in doubt, the spiritually blind come and go
in reincarnation, over and over again. 

When God Himself bestows His Glance of Grace, He blends us into Himself. || 3 || He
hears and sees everything. How can anyone deny Him? Those who sin again and again,
shall rot and die in sin. God‟s Glance of Grace does not come to them; those self-willed
manmukhs do not obtain understanding. They alone see the Lord, unto whom He
reveals Himself. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs find Him. || 4 || 23 || 56 || SIREE RAAG,
THIRD MEHL: Without the Guru, the disease is not cured, and the pain of egotism is
not removed. By Guru‟s Grace, He dwells in the mind, and one remains immersed in His
Name. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the Lord is found; without the Shabad,
people wander, deceived by doubt. || 1 || O mind, dwell in the balanced state of your
own inner being. Praise the Lord‟s Name, and you shall no longer come and go in
reincarnation. || 1 || Pause || The One Lord alone is the Giver, pervading
everywhere. There is no other at all. Praise the Word of the Shabad, and He shall come
to dwell in your mind; you shall be blessed with intuitive peace and poise. Everything is
within the Lord‟s Glance of Grace. As He wishes, He gives. || 2 || In egotism, all must
account for their actions. In this accounting, there is no peace. Acting in evil and
corruption, people are immersed in corruption. Without the Name, they find no place of
rest. In the City of Death, they suffer in agony. || 3 || Body and soul all belong to
Him; He is the Support of all. By Guru‟s Grace, understanding comes, and then the Door
of Liberation is found. O Nanak, sing the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He
has no end or limitation. || 4 || 24 || 57 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Those who
have the Support of the True Name are in ecstasy and peace forever. Through the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they obtain the True One, the Destroyer of pain. Forever
and ever, they sing the Glorious Praises of the True One; they love the True Name.
When the Lord Himself grants His Grace, He bestows the treasure of devotion. || 1 ||
O mind, sing His Glorious Praises, and be in ecstasy forever. Through the True Word of
His Bani, the Lord is obtained, and one remains immersed in the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
In true devotion, the mind is dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord‟s Love, with
intuitive peace and poise. The mind is fascinated by the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
which cannot be described. The tongue imbued with the True Word of the Shabad
drinks in the Amrit with delight, singing His Glorious Praises. The Gurmukh obtains this
love, when the Lord, in His Will, grants His Grace. || 2 || This world is an illusion;
people pass their life-nights sleeping. By the Pleasure of His Will, He lifts some out, and
unites them with Himself. He Himself abides in the mind, and drives out attachment to
Maya. He Himself bestows glorious greatness; He inspires the Gurmukh to understand.
|| 3 || The One Lord is the Giver of all. He corrects those who make mistakes. He
Himself has deceived some, and attached them to duality. Through the Guru's
Teachings, the Lord is found, and one‟s light merges into the Light. Attuned to the
Name of the Lord night and day, O Nanak, you shall be absorbed into the Name. || 4 ||
25 || 58 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The virtuous obtain Truth; they give up their
desires for evil and corruption. 

Their minds are imbued with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; the Love of their Beloved
is on their tongues. Without the True Guru, no one has found Him; reflect upon this in
your mind and see. The filth of the self-willed manmukhs is not washed off; they have
no love for the Guru‟s Shabad. || 1 || O my mind, walk in harmony with the True
Guru. Dwell within the home of your own inner being, and drink in the Ambrosial
Nectar; you shall attain the Peace of the Mansion of His Presence. || 1 || Pause ||
The unvirtuous have no merit; they are not allowed to sit in His Presence. The selfwilled manmukhs do not know the Shabad; those without virtue are far removed from
God. Those who recognize the True One are permeated and attuned to Truth. Their
minds are pierced through by the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and God Himself ushers
them into His Presence. || 2 || He Himself dyes us in the Color of His Love; through
the Word of His Shabad, He unites us with Himself. This True Color shall not fade away,
for those who are attuned to His Love. The self-willed manmukhs grow weary of
wandering around in all four directions, but they do not understand. One who is united
with the True Guru, meets and merges in the True Word of the Shabad. || 3 || I have
grown weary of making so many friends, hoping that someone might be able to end my
suffering. Meeting with my Beloved, my suffering has ended; I have attained Union with
the Word of the Shabad. Earning Truth, and accumulating the Wealth of Truth, the
truthful person gains a reputation of Truth. Meeting with the True One, O Nanak, the
Gurmukh shall not be separated from Him again. || 4 || 26 || 59 || SIREE RAAG,
THIRD MEHL: The Creator Himself created the Creation; He produced the Universe,
and He Himself watches over it. The One and Only Lord is pervading and permeating
all. The Unseen cannot be seen. God Himself is Merciful; He Himself bestows
understanding. Through the Guru's Teachings, the True One dwells forever in the mind
of those who remain lovingly attached to Him. || 1 || O my mind, surrender to the
Guru‟s Will. Mind and body are totally cooled and soothed, and the Naam comes to
dwell in the mind. || 1 || Pause || Having created the creation, He supports it and
takes care of it. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is realized, when He Himself bestows
His Glance of Grace. Those who are beautifully adorned with the Shabad in the Court of
the True Lord—those Gurmukhs are attuned to the True Word of the Shabad; the
Creator unites them with Himself. || 2 || Through the Guru's Teachings, praise the
True One, who has no end or limitation. He dwells in each and every heart, by the
Hukam of His Command; by His Hukam, we contemplate Him. So praise Him through
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and drive out egotism from within. That soul-bride who
lacks the Lord‟s Name acts without virtue, and so she grieves. || 3 || Praising the
True One, attached to the True One, I am satisfied with the True Name. Contemplating
His Virtues, I accumulate virtue and merit; I wash myself clean of demerits. He Himself
unites us in His Union; there is no more separation. O Nanak, I sing the Praises of my
Guru; through Him, I find that God. || 4 || 27 || 60 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL:
Listen, listen, O soul-bride: you are overtaken by sexual desire—why do you walk like
that, swinging your arms in joy? You do not recognize your own Husband Lord! When
you go to Him, what face will you show Him? I touch the feet of my sister soul-brides
who have known their Husband Lord. 

If only I could be like them! Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I am united
in His Union. || 1 || O woman, the false ones are being cheated by falsehood. God is
your Husband; He is Handsome and True. He is obtained by reflecting upon the Guru.
|| 1 || Pause || The self-willed manmukhs do not recognize their Husband Lord; how
will they spend their life-night? Filled with arrogance, they burn with desire; they suffer
in the pain of the love of duality. The happy soul-brides are attuned to the Shabad;
their egotism is eliminated from within. They enjoy their Husband Lord forever, and
their life-night passes in the most blissful peace. || 2 || She is utterly lacking in
spiritual wisdom; she is abandoned by her Husband Lord. She cannot obtain His Love.
In the darkness of intellectual ignorance, she cannot see her Husband, and her hunger
does not depart. Come and meet with me, my sister soul-brides, and unite me with my
Husband. She who meets the True Guru, by perfect good fortune, finds her Husband;
she is absorbed in the True One. || 3 || Those upon whom He casts His Glance of
Grace become His happy soul-brides. One who recognizes her Lord and Master places
her body and mind in offering before Him. Within her own home, she finds her Husband
Lord; her egotism is dispelled. O Nanak, the happy soul-brides are embellished and
exalted; night and day they are absorbed in devotional worship. || 4 || 28 || 61 ||
SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Some enjoy their Husband Lord; unto whose door should
I go to ask for Him? I serve my True Guru with love, that He may lead me to Union with
my Husband Lord. He created all, and He Himself watches over us. Some are close to
Him, and some are far away. She who knows her Husband Lord to be always with her,
enjoys His Constant Presence. || 1 || O woman, you must walk in harmony with the
Guru‟s Will. Night and day, you shall enjoy your Husband, and you shall intuitively
merge into the True One. || 1 || Pause || Attuned to the Shabad, the happy soulbrides are adorned with the True Word of the Shabad. Within their own home, they
obtain the Lord as their Husband, with love for the Guru. Upon her beautiful and cozy
bed, she enjoys the Love of her Lord. She is overflowing with the treasure of devotion.
That Beloved God abides in her mind; He gives His Support to all. || 2 || I am forever
a sacrifice to those who praise their Husband Lord. I dedicate my mind and body to
them, and give my head as well; I fall at their feet. Those who recognize the One
renounce the love of duality. The Gurmukh recognizes the Naam, O Nanak, and is
absorbed into the True One. || 3 || 29 || 62 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: O Dear
Lord, You are the Truest of the True. All things are in Your Power. The 8.4 million
species of beings wander around searching for You, but without the Guru, they do not
find You. When the Dear Lord grants His Forgiveness, this human body finds lasting
peace. By Guru‟s Grace, I serve the True One, who is Immeasurably Deep and
Profound. || 1 || O my mind, attuned to the Naam, you shall find peace. Follow the
Guru‟s Teachings, and praise the Naam; there is no other at all. || 1 || Pause || The
Righteous Judge of Dharma, by the Hukam of God‟s Command, sits and administers
True Justice. Those evil souls, ensnared by the love of duality, are subject to Your
Command. 

The souls on their spiritual journey chant and meditate within their minds on the One
Lord, the Treasure of Excellence. The Righteous Judge of Dharma serves them; blessed
is the Lord who adorns them. || 2 || One who eliminates mental wickedness from
within the mind, and casts out emotional attachment and egotistical pride, comes to
recognize the All-pervading Soul, and is intuitively absorbed into the Naam. Without the
True Guru, the self-willed manmukhs do not find liberation; they wander around like
lunatics. They do not contemplate the Shabad; engrossed in corruption, they utter only
empty words. || 3 || He Himself is everything; there is no other at all. I speak just as
He makes me speak, when He Himself makes me speak. The Word of the Gurmukh is
God Himself. Through the Shabad, we merge in Him. O Nanak, remember the Naam;
serving Him, peace is obtained. || 4 || 30 || 63 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The
world is polluted with the filth of egotism, suffering in pain. This filth sticks to them
because of their love of duality. This filth of egotism cannot be washed away, even by
taking cleansing baths at hundreds of sacred shrines. Performing all sorts of rituals,
people are smeared with twice as much filth. This filth is not removed by studying. Go
ahead, and ask the wise ones. || 1 || O my mind, coming to the Sanctuary of the
Guru, you shall become immaculate and pure. The self-willed manmukhs have grown
weary of chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, but their filth cannot be removed. ||
1 || Pause || With a polluted mind, devotional service cannot be performed, and the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, cannot be obtained. The filthy, self-willed manmukhs die
in filth, and they depart in disgrace. By Guru‟s Grace, the Lord comes to abide in the
mind, and the filth of egotism is dispelled. Like a lamp lit in the darkness, the spiritual
wisdom of the Guru dispels ignorance. || 2 || “I have done this, and I will do that”—I
am an idiotic fool for saying this! I have forgotten the Doer of all; I am caught in the
love of duality. There is no pain as great as the pain of Maya; it drives people to wander
all around the world, until they become exhausted. Through the Guru's Teachings,
peace is found, with the True Name enshrined in the heart. || 3 || I am a sacrifice to
those who meet and merge with the Lord. This mind is attuned to devotional worship;
through the True Word of Gurbani, it finds its own home. With the mind so imbued, and
the tongue imbued as well, sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. O Nanak, never
forget the Naam; immerse yourself in the True One. || 4 || 31 || 64 || SIREE RAAG,
FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: Within my mind and body is the intense pain of
separation; how can my Beloved come to meet me in my home? When I see my God,
seeing God Himself, my pain is taken away. I go and ask my friends, “How can I meet
and merge with God?” || 1 || O my True Guru, without You I have no other at all. I
am foolish and ignorant; I seek Your Sanctuary. Please be Merciful and unite me with
the Lord. || 1 || Pause || The True Guru is the Giver of the Name of the Lord. God
Himself causes us to meet Him. The True Guru understands the Lord God. There is no
other as Great as the Guru. I have come and collapsed in the Guru‟s Sanctuary. In His
Kindness, He has united me with God. || 2 || 

No one has found Him by stubborn-mindedness. All have grown weary of the effort.
Thousands of clever mental tricks have been tried, but still, the raw and undisciplined
mind does not absorb the Color of the Lord‟s Love. By falsehood and deception, none
have found Him. Whatever you plant, you shall eat. || 3 || O God, You are the Hope
of all. All beings are Yours; You are the Wealth of all. O God, none return from You
empty-handed; at Your Door, the Gurmukhs are praised and acclaimed. In the terrifying
world-ocean of poison, people are drowning—please lift them up and save them! This is
servant Nanak‟s humble prayer. || 4 || 1 || 65 || SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL:
Receiving the Naam, the mind is satisfied; without the Naam, life is cursed. If I meet
the Gurmukh, my Spiritual Friend, he will show me God, the Treasure of Excellence. I
am every bit a sacrifice to one who reveals to me the Naam. || 1 || O my Beloved, I
live by meditating on Your Name. Without Your Name, my life does not even exist. My
True Guru has implanted the Naam within me. || 1 || Pause || The Naam is a
Priceless Jewel; it is with the Perfect True Guru. When one is enjoined to serve the True
Guru, He brings out this Jewel and bestows this enlightenment. Blessed, and most
fortunate of the very fortunate, are those who come to meet the Guru. || 2 || Those
who have not met the Primal Being, the True Guru, are most unfortunate, and are
subject to death. They wander in reincarnation over and over again, as the most
disgusting maggots in manure. Do not meet with, or even approach those people,
whose hearts are filled with horrible anger. || 3 || The True Guru, the Primal Being, is
the Pool of Ambrosial Nectar. The very fortunate ones come to bathe in it. The filth of
many incarnations is washed away, and the Immaculate Naam is implanted within.
Servant Nanak has obtained the most exalted state, lovingly attuned to the True Guru.
|| 4 || 2 || 66 || SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL: I sing His Glories, I describe His
Glories, I speak of His Glories, O my mother. The Gurmukhs, my spiritual friends,
bestow virtue. Meeting with my spiritual friends, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
The Diamond of the Guru has pierced the diamond of my mind, which is now dyed in
the deep crimson color of the Name. || 1 || O my Lord of the Universe, singing Your
Glorious Praises, my mind is satisfied. Within me is the thirst for the Lord‟s Name; may
the Guru, in His Pleasure, grant it to me. || 1 || Pause || Let your minds be imbued
with His Love, O blessed and fortunate ones. By His Pleasure, the Guru bestows His
Gifts. The Guru has lovingly implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within me; I
am a sacrifice to the True Guru. Without the True Guru, the Name of the Lord is not
found, even though people may perform hundreds of thousands, even millions of
rituals. || 2 || Without destiny, the True Guru is not found, even though He sits within
the home of our own inner being, always near and close at hand. There is ignorance
within, and the pain of doubt, like a separating screen. Without meeting with the True
Guru, no one is transformed into gold. The self-willed manmukh sinks like iron, while
the boat is very close. || 3 || The Boat of the True Guru is the Name of the Lord. How
can we climb on board? One who walks in harmony with the True Guru‟s Will comes to
sit in this Boat. Blessed, blessed are those very fortunate ones, O Nanak, who are
united with the Lord through the True Guru. || 4 || 3 || 67 || 

SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL: I stand by the wayside and ask the Way. If only
someone would show me the Way to God—I would go with him. I follow in the
footsteps of those who enjoy the Love of my Beloved. I beg of them, I implore them; I
have such a yearning to meet God! || 1 || O my Siblings of Destiny, please unite me
in Union with my Lord God. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has shown me the
Lord God. || 1 || Pause || In deep humility, I fall at the Feet of the Perfect True
Guru. The Guru is the Honor of the dishonored. The Guru, the True Guru, brings
approval and applause. I am never tired of praising the Guru, who unites me with the
Lord God. || 2 || Everyone, all over the world, longs for the True Guru. Without the
good fortune of destiny, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is not obtained. The
unfortunate ones just sit and cry. All things happen according to the Will of the Lord
God. No one can erase the pre-ordained Writ of Destiny. || 3 || He Himself is the
True Guru; He Himself is the Lord. He Himself unites in His Union. In His Kindness, He
unites us with Himself, as we follow the Guru, the True Guru. Over all the world, He is
the Life of the World, O Nanak, like water mingled with water. || 4 || 4 || 68 || SIREE
RAAG, FOURTH MEHL: The Essence of the Ambrosial Naam is the most sublime
essence; how can I get to taste this essence? I go and ask the happy soul-brides, “How
did you come to meet God?” They are care-free and do not speak; I massage and wash
their feet. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, meet with your spiritual friend, and dwell upon
the Glorious Praises of the Lord. The True Guru, the Primal Being, is your Friend, who
shall drive out pain and subdue your ego. || 1 || Pause || The Gurmukhs are the
happy soul-brides; their minds are filled with kindness. The Word of the True Guru is
the Jewel. One who believes in it tastes the Sublime Essence of the Lord. Those who
partake of the Lord‟s Sublime Essence, through the Guru‟s Love, are known as great
and very fortunate. || 2 || This Sublime Essence of the Lord is in the forests, in the
fields and everywhere, but the unfortunate ones do not taste it. Without the True Guru,
it is not obtained. The self-willed manmukhs continue to cry in misery. They do not bow
before the True Guru; the demon of anger is within them. || 3 || The Lord Himself,
Har, Har, Har, is the Sublime Essence. The Lord Himself is the Essence. In His
Kindness, He blesses the Gurmukh with it; the Ambrosial Nectar of this Amrit trickles
down. Then, the body and mind totally blossom forth and flourish; O Nanak, the Lord
comes to dwell within the mind. || 4 || 5 || 69 || SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL: The
day dawns, and then it ends, and the night passes away. Man‟s life is diminishing, but
he does not understand. Each day, the mouse of death is gnawing away at the rope of
life. Maya spreads out like sweet molasses; the self-willed manmukh is stuck like a fly,
rotting away. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, God is my Friend and Companion.
Emotional attachment to children and spouse is poison; in the end, no one will go along
with you as your helper. || 1 || Pause || 

Through the Guru's Teachings, some embrace love for the Lord, and are saved. They
remain detached and unaffected, and they find the Sanctuary of the Lord. They keep
death constantly before their eyes; they gather the Provisions of the Lord‟s Name, and
receive honor. The Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord. The Lord Himself
takes them in His Loving Embrace. || 2 || For the Gurmukhs, the Way is obvious. At
the Lord‟s Door, they face no obstructions. They praise the Lord‟s Name, they keep the
Naam in their minds, and they remain attached to the Love of the Naam. The Unstruck
Celestial Music vibrates for them at the Lord‟s Door, and they are honored at the True
Door. || 3 || Those Gurmukhs who praise the Naam are applauded by everyone.
Grant me their company, God—I am a beggar; this is my prayer. O Nanak, great is the
good fortune of those Gurmukhs, who are filled with the Light of the Naam within. || 4
|| 33 || 31 || 6 || 70 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: Why are you so
thrilled by the sight of your son and your beautifully decorated wife? You enjoy tasty
delicacies, you have lots of fun, and you indulge in endless pleasures. You give all sorts
of commands, and you act so superior. The Creator does not come into the mind of the
blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukh. || 1 || O my mind, the Lord is the Giver of peace.
By Guru‟s Grace, He is found. By His Mercy, He is obtained. || 1 || Pause || People
are entangled in the enjoyment of fine clothes, but gold and silver are only dust. They
acquire beautiful horses and elephants, and ornate carriages of many kinds. They think
of nothing else, and they forget all their relatives. They ignore their Creator; without the
Name, they are impure. || 2 || Gathering the wealth of Maya, you earn an evil
reputation. Those whom you work to please shall pass away along with you. The
egotistical are engrossed in egotism, ensnared by the intellect of the mind. One who is
deceived by God Himself, has no position and no honor. || 3 || The True Guru, the
Primal Being, has led me to meet the One, my only Friend. The One is the Saving Grace
of His humble servant. Why should the proud cry out in ego? As the servant of the Lord
wills, so does the Lord act. At the Lord‟s Door, none of his requests are denied. Nanak
is attuned to the Love of the Lord, whose Light pervades the entire Universe. || 4 || 1
|| 71 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: With the mind caught up in playful pleasures,
involved in all sorts of amusements and sights that stagger the eyes, people are led
astray. The emperors sitting on their thrones are consumed by anxiety. || 1 || O
Siblings of Destiny, peace is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. If the
Supreme Lord, the Architect of Destiny, writes such an order, then anguish and anxiety
are erased. || 1 || Pause || There are so many places—I have wandered through
them all. The masters of wealth and the great land-lords have fallen, crying out, “This is
mine! This is mine!” || 2 || They issue their commands fearlessly, and act in pride.
They subdue all under their command, but without the Name, they are reduced to dust.
|| 3 || Even those who are served by the 33 million angelic beings, at whose door the
Siddhas and the Saadhus stand, who live in wondrous affluence and rule over
mountains, oceans and vast dominions—

O Nanak, in the end, all this vanishes like a dream! || 4 || 2 || 72 || SIREE RAAG,
FIFTH MEHL: Arising each day, you cherish your body, but you are idiotic, ignorant and
without understanding. You are not conscious of God, and your body shall be cast into
the wilderness. Focus your consciousness on the True Guru; you shall enjoy bliss
forever and ever. || 1 || O mortal, you came here to earn a profit. What useless
activities are you attached to? Your life-night is coming to its end. || 1 || Pause ||
The animals and the birds frolic and play—they do not see death. Mankind is also with
them, trapped in the net of Maya. Those who always remember the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, are considered to be liberated. || 2 || That dwelling which you will have to
abandon and vacate—you are attached to it in your mind. And that place where you
must go to dwell—you have no regard for it at all. Those who fall at the Feet of the
Guru are released from this bondage. || 3 || No one else can save you—don‟t look for
anyone else. I have searched in all four directions; I have come to find His Sanctuary. O
Nanak, the True King has pulled me out and saved me from drowning! || 4 || 3 || 73 ||
SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: For a brief moment, man is a guest of the Lord; he tries to
resolve his affairs. Engrossed in Maya and sexual desire, the fool does not understand.
He arises and departs with regret, and falls into the clutches of the Messenger of Death.
|| 1 || You are sitting on the collapsing riverbank—are you blind? If you are so predestined, then act according to the Guru‟s Teachings. || 1 || Pause || The Reaper
does not look upon any as unripe, half-ripe or fully ripe. Picking up and wielding their
sickles, the harvesters arrive. When the landlord gives the order, they cut and measure
the crop. || 2 || The first watch of the night passes away in worthless affairs, and the
second passes in deep sleep. In the third, they babble nonsense, and when the fourth
watch comes, the day of death has arrived. The thought of the One who bestows body
and soul never enters the mind. || 3 || I am devoted to the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy; I sacrifice my soul to them. Through them, understanding has
entered my mind, and I have met the All-knowing Lord God. Nanak sees the Lord
always with him—the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. || 4 || 4 || 74 ||
SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: Let me forget everything, but let me not forget the One
Lord. All my evil pursuits have been burnt away; the Guru has blessed me with the
Naam, the true object of life. Give up all other hopes, and rely on the One Hope. Those
who serve the True Guru receive a place in the world hereafter. || 1 || O my mind,
praise the Creator. Give up all your clever tricks, and fall at the Feet of the Guru. || 1 ||
Pause || Pain and hunger shall not oppress you, if the Giver of Peace comes into your
mind. No undertaking shall fail, when the True Lord is always in your heart. No one can
kill that one unto whom You, Lord, give Your Hand and protect. Serve the Guru, the
Giver of Peace; He shall wash off the residues of all your mistakes. || 2 || Your
servant begs to serve those who are enjoined to Your service. 

The opportunity to work hard serving the Saadh Sangat is obtained, when the Divine
Lord is pleased. Everything is in the Hands of our Lord and Master; He Himself is the
Doer of deeds. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who fulfills all hopes and desires. || 3
|| The One appears to be my Companion; the One is my Brother and Friend. The
elements and the components are all made by the One; they are held in their order by
the One. When the mind accepts, and is satisfied with the One, then the consciousness
becomes steady and stable. Then, one‟s food is the True Name, one‟s garments are the
True Name, and one‟s Support, O Nanak, is the True Name. || 4 || 5 || 75 || SIREE
RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: All things are received if the One is obtained. The precious gift of
this human life becomes fruitful when one chants the True Word of the Shabad. One
who has such destiny written on his forehead enters the Mansion of the Lord‟s
Presence, through the Guru. || 1 || O my mind, focus your consciousness on the One.
Without the One, all entanglements are worthless; emotional attachment to Maya is
totally false. || 1 || Pause || Hundreds of thousands of princely pleasures are
enjoyed, if the True Guru bestows His Glance of Grace. If He bestows the Name of the
Lord, for even a moment, my mind and body are cooled and soothed. Those who have
such pre-ordained destiny hold tight to the Feet of the True Guru. || 2 || Fruitful is
that moment, and fruitful is that time, when one is in love with the True Lord. Suffering
and sorrow do not touch those who have the Support of the Name of the Lord.
Grasping him by the arm, the Guru lifts them up and out, and carries them across to
the other side. || 3 || Embellished and immaculate is that place where the Saints
gather together. He alone finds shelter, who has met the Perfect Guru. Nanak builds his
house upon that site where there is no death, no birth, and no old age. || 4 || 6 || 76
|| SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: Meditate on Him, O my soul; He is the Supreme Lord
over kings and emperors. Place the hopes of your mind in the One, in whom all have
faith. Give up all your clever tricks, and grasp the Feet of the Guru. || 1 || O my
mind, chant the Name with intuitive peace and poise. Twenty-four hours a day,
meditate on God. Constantly sing the Glories of the Lord of the Universe. || 1 || Pause
|| Seek His Shelter, O my mind; there is no other as Great as He. Remembering Him
in meditation, a profound peace is obtained. Pain and suffering will not touch you at all.
Forever and ever, work for God; He is our True Lord and Master. || 2 || In the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall become absolutely pure, and the noose of
death shall be cut away. So offer your prayers to Him, the Giver of Peace, the Destroyer
of fear. Showing His Mercy, the Merciful Master shall resolve your affairs. || 3 || The
Lord is said to be the Greatest of the Great; His Kingdom is the Highest of the High. He
has no color or mark; His Value cannot be estimated. Please show Mercy to Nanak,
God, and bless him with Your True Name. || 4 || 7 || 77 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH
MEHL: One who meditates on the Naam is at peace; his face is radiant and bright.
Obtaining it from the Perfect Guru, he is honored all over the world. 

In the Company of the Holy, the One True Lord comes to abide within the home of the
self. || 1 || O my mind, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Naam is
your Companion; it shall always be with you. It shall save you in the world hereafter. ||
1 || Pause || What good is worldly greatness? All the pleasures of Maya are tasteless
and insipid. In the end, they shall all fade away. Perfectly fulfilled and supremely
acclaimed is the one, in whose heart the Lord abides. || 2 || Become the dust of the
Saints; renounce your selfishness and conceit. Give up all your schemes and your clever
mental tricks, and fall at the Feet of the Guru. He alone receives the Jewel, upon whose
forehead such wondrous destiny is written. || 3 || O Siblings of Destiny, it is received
only when God Himself bestows it. People serve the True Guru only when the fever of
egotism has been eradicated. Nanak has met the Guru; all his sufferings have come to
an end. || 4 || 8 || 78 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: The One is the Knower of all
beings; He alone is our Savior. The One is the Support of the mind; the One is the
Support of the breath of life. In His Sanctuary there is eternal peace. He is the Supreme
Lord God, the Creator. || 1 || O my mind, give up all these efforts. Dwell upon the
Perfect Guru each day, and attach yourself to the One Lord. || 1 || Pause || The
One is my Brother, the One is my Friend. The One is my Mother and Father. The One is
the Support of the mind; He has given us body and soul. May I never forget God from
my mind; He holds all in the Power of His Hands. || 2 || The One is within the home
of the self, and the One is outside as well. He Himself is in all places and interspaces.
Meditate twenty-four hours a day on the One who created all beings and creatures.
Attuned to the Love of the One, there is no sorrow or suffering. || 3 || There is only
the One Supreme Lord God; there is no other at all. Soul and body all belong to Him;
whatever pleases His Will comes to pass. Through the Perfect Guru, one becomes
perfect; O Nanak, meditate on the True One. || 4 || 9 || 79 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH
MEHL: Those who focus their consciousness on the True Guru are perfectly fulfilled
and famous. Spiritual wisdom wells up in the minds of those unto whom the Lord
Himself shows Mercy. Those who have such destiny written upon their foreheads obtain
the Name of the Lord. || 1 || O my mind, meditate on the Name of the One Lord. The
happiness of all happiness shall well up, and in the Court of the Lord, you shall be
dressed in robes of honor. || 1 || Pause || The fear of death and rebirth is removed
by performing loving devotional service to the Lord of the World. In the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy, one becomes immaculate and pure; the Lord Himself takes
care of such a one. The filth of birth and death is washed away, and one is uplifted,
beholding the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan. || 2 || The Supreme Lord God is
pervading all places and interspaces. The One is the Giver of all—there is no other at
all. In His Sanctuary, one is saved. Whatever He wishes, comes to pass. || 3 ||
Perfectly fulfilled and famous are those, in whose minds the Supreme Lord God abides.
Their reputation is spotless and pure; they are famous all over the world. 

O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on my God. || 4 || 10 || 80 || SIREE
RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: Meeting the True Guru, all my sufferings have ended, and the
Peace of the Lord has come to dwell within my mind. The Divine Light illuminates my
inner being, and I am lovingly absorbed in the One. Meeting with the Holy Saint, my
face is radiant; I have realized my pre-ordained destiny. I constantly sing the Glories of
the Lord of the Universe. Through the True Name, I have become spotlessly pure. || 1
|| O my mind, you shall find peace through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Working
for the Perfect Guru, no one goes away empty-handed. || 1 || Pause || The desires
of the mind are fulfilled, when the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is
obtained. The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is always with you; recognize Him
as the Creator. By Guru‟s Grace, your face shall be radiant. Chanting the Naam, you
shall receive the benefits of giving charity and taking cleansing baths. Sexual desire,
anger and greed are eliminated, and all egotistical pride is abandoned. || 2 || The
Profit of the Naam is obtained, and all affairs are brought to fruition. In His Mercy, God
unites us with Himself, and He blesses us with the Naam. My comings and goings in
reincarnation have come to an end; He Himself has bestowed His Mercy. I have
obtained my home in the True Mansion of His Presence, realizing the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. || 3 || His humble devotees are protected and saved; He Himself
showers His Blessings upon us. In this world and in the world hereafter, radiant are the
faces of those who cherish and enshrine the Glories of the True Lord. Twenty-four
hours a day, they lovingly dwell upon His Glories; they are imbued with His Infinite
Love. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord God, the Ocean of Peace. || 4 ||
11 || 81 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: If we meet the Perfect True Guru, we obtain
the Treasure of the Shabad. Please grant Your Grace, God, that we may meditate on
Your Ambrosial Naam. The pains of birth and death are taken away; we are intuitively
centered on His Meditation. || 1 || O my mind, seek the Sanctuary of God. Without
the Lord, there is no other at all. Meditate on the One and only Naam, the Name of the
Lord. || 1 || Pause || His Value cannot be estimated; He is the Vast Ocean of
Excellence. O most fortunate ones, join the Sangat, the Blessed Congregation; purchase
the True Word of the Shabad. Serve the Lord, the Ocean of Peace, the Supreme Lord
over kings and emperors. || 2 || I take the Support of the Lord‟s Lotus Feet; there is
no other place of rest for me. I lean upon You as my Support, O Supreme Lord God. I
exist only by Your Power. O God, You are the Honor of the dishonored. I seek to merge
with You. || 3 || Chant the Lord‟s Name and contemplate the Lord of the World,
twenty-four hours a day. He preserves our soul, our breath of life, body and wealth. By
His Grace, He protects our soul. O Nanak, all pain has been washed away, by the
Supreme Lord God, the Forgiver. || 4 || 12 || 82 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: I
have fallen in love with the True Lord. He does not die, He does not come and go. In
separation, He is not separated from us; He is pervading and permeating amongst all.
He is the Destroyer of the pain and suffering of the meek. He bears True Love for His
servants. Wondrous is the Form of the Immaculate One. Through the Guru, I have met
Him, O my mother! || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, make God your Friend. 

Cursed is emotional attachment and love of Maya; no one is seen to be at peace. || 1
|| Pause || God is Wise, Giving, Tender-hearted, Pure, Beautiful and Infinite. He is
our Companion and Helper, Supremely Great, Lofty and Utterly Infinite. He is not
known as young or old; His Court is Steady and Stable. Whatever we seek from Him,
we receive. He is the Support of the unsupported. || 2 || Seeing Him, our evil
inclinations vanish; mind and body become peaceful and tranquil. With one-pointed
mind, meditate on the One Lord, and the doubts of your mind will be dispelled. He is
the Treasure of Excellence, the Ever-fresh Being. His Gift is Perfect and Complete.
Forever and ever, worship and adore Him. Day and night, do not forget Him. || 3 ||
One whose destiny is so pre-ordained, obtains the Lord of the Universe as his
Companion. I dedicate my body, mind, wealth and all to Him. I totally sacrifice my soul
to Him. Seeing and hearing, He is always close at hand. In each and every heart, God is
pervading. Even the ungrateful ones are cherished by God. O Nanak, He is forever the
Forgiver. || 4 || 13 || 83 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: This mind, body and wealth
were given by God, who naturally adorns us. He has blessed us with all our energy, and
infused His Infinite Light deep within us. Forever and ever, meditate in remembrance
on God; keep Him enshrined in your heart. || 1 || O my mind, without the Lord, there
is no other at all. Remain in God‟s Sanctuary forever, and no suffering shall afflict you.
|| 1 || Pause || Jewels, treasures, pearls, gold and silver—all these are just dust.
Mother, father, children and relatives—all relations are false. The self-willed manmukh
is an insulting beast; he does not acknowledge the One who created him. || 2 || The
Lord is pervading within and beyond, and yet people think that He is far away. They are
engrossed in clinging desires; within their hearts there is ego and falsehood. Without
devotion to the Naam, crowds of people come and go. || 3 || Please preserve Your
beings and creatures, God; O Creator Lord, please be merciful! Without God, there is no
saving grace. The Messenger of Death is cruel and unfeeling. O Nanak, may I never
forget the Naam! Please bless me with Your Mercy, Lord! || 4 || 14 || 84 || SIREE
RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: “My body and my wealth; my ruling power, my beautiful form
and country—mine!” You may have children, a wife and many mistresses; you may
enjoy all sorts of pleasures and fine clothes. And yet, if the Name of the Lord does not
abide within the heart, none of it has any use or value. || 1 || O my mind, meditate
on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Always keep the Company of the Holy, and focus
your consciousness on the Feet of the Guru. || 1 || Pause || Those who have such
blessed destiny written on their foreheads meditate on the Treasure of the Naam. All
their affairs are brought to fruition, holding onto the Guru‟s Feet. The diseases of ego
and doubt are cast out; they shall not come and go in reincarnation. || 2 || Let the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, be your cleansing baths at the sixty-eight
sacred shrines of pilgrimage. Your soul, breath of life, mind and body shall blossom
forth in lush profusion; this is the true purpose of life. 

In this world you shall be blessed with greatness, and in the Court of the Lord you shall
find your place of rest. || 3 || God Himself acts, and causes others to act; everything
is in His Hands. He Himself bestows life and death; He is with us, within and beyond.
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, the Master of all hearts. || 4 || 15 || 85 || SIREE
RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: The Guru is Merciful; we seek the Sanctuary of God. Through the
Teachings of the True Guru, all worldly entanglements are eliminated. The Name of the
Lord is firmly implanted within my mind; through His Ambrosial Glance of Grace, I am
exalted and enraptured. || 1 || O my mind, serve the True Guru. God Himself grants
His Grace; do not forget Him, even for an instant. || Pause || Continually sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, the Destroyer of demerits. Without the
Name of the Lord, there is no peace. Having tried all sorts of ostentatious displays, I
have come to see this. Intuitively imbued with His Praises, one is saved, crossing over
the terrifying world-ocean. || 2 || The merits of pilgrimages, fasts and hundreds of
thousands of techniques of austere self-discipline are found in the dust of the feet of
the Holy. From whom are you trying to hide your actions? God sees all; He is Everpresent. My God is totally pervading all places and interspaces. || 3 || True is His Empire, and True is His Command. True is His Seat of True Authority. True is the
Creative Power which He has created. True is the world which He has fashioned. O
Nanak, chant the True Name; I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him. || 4 || 16 || 86
|| SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: Make the effort, and chant the Lord‟s Name. O very
fortunate ones, earn this wealth. In the Society of the Saints, meditate in remembrance
on the Lord, and wash off the filth of countless incarnations. || 1 || O my mind, chant
and meditate on the Name of the Lord. Enjoy the fruits of your mind‟s desires; all
suffering and sorrow shall depart. || Pause || For His sake, you assumed this body;
see God always with you. God is pervading the water, the land and the sky; He sees all
with His Glance of Grace. || 2 || The mind and body become spotlessly pure,
enshrining love for the True Lord. One who dwells upon the Feet of the Supreme Lord
God has truly performed all meditations and austerities. || 3 || The Ambrosial Name
of the Lord is a Gem, a Jewel, a Pearl. The essence of intuitive peace and bliss is
obtained, O servant Nanak, by singing the Glories of God. || 4 || 17 || 87 || SIREE
RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: That is the essence of the scriptures, and that is a good omen, by
which one comes to chant the Name of the Lord. The Guru has given me the Wealth of
the Lotus Feet of the Lord, and I, without shelter, have now obtained Shelter. The True
Capital, and the True Way of Life, comes by chanting His Glories, twenty-four hours a
day. Granting His Grace, God meets us, and we no longer die, or come or go in
reincarnation. || 1 || O my mind, vibrate and meditate forever on the Lord, with
single-minded love. He is contained deep within each and every heart. He is always
with you, as your Helper and Support. || 1 || Pause || How can I measure the
happiness of meditating on the Lord of the Universe? Those who taste it are satisfied
and fulfilled; their souls know this Sublime Essence. 



In the Society of the Saints, God, the Beloved, the Forgiver, comes to dwell within the
mind. One who has served his God is the emperor of kings || 2 || This is the time to
speak and sing the Praise and the Glory of God, which brings the merit of millions of
cleansing and purifying baths. The tongue which chants these Praises is worthy; there
is no charity equal to this. Blessing us with His Glance of Grace, the Kind and
Compassionate, All-powerful Lord comes to dwell within the mind and body. My soul,
body and wealth are His. Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. || 3 || One whom
the Creator Lord has met and joined to Himself shall never again be separated. The
True Creator Lord breaks the bonds of His slave. The doubter has been put back on the
path; his merits and demerits have not been considered. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of
the One who is the Support of every heart. || 4 || 18 || 88 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH
MEHL: With your tongue, repeat the True Name, and your mind and body shall become
pure. Your mother and father and all your relations—without Him, there are none at all.
If God Himself bestows His Mercy, then He is not forgotten, even for an instant. || 1 ||
O my mind, serve the True One, as long as you have the breath of life. Without the
True One, everything is false; in the end, all shall perish. || 1 || Pause || My Lord
and Master is Immaculate and Pure; without Him, I cannot even survive. Within my
mind and body, there is such a great hunger; if only someone would come and unite
me with Him, O my mother! I have searched the four corners of the world—without our
Husband Lord, there is no other place of rest. || 2 || Offer your prayers to Him, who
shall unite you with the Creator. The True Guru is the Giver of the Naam; His Treasure
is perfect and overflowing. Forever and ever, praise the One, who has no end or
limitation. || 3 || Praise God, the Nurturer and Cherisher; His Wondrous Ways are
unlimited. Forever and ever, worship and adore Him; this is the most wonderful
wisdom. O Nanak, God‟s Flavor is sweet to the minds and bodies of those who have
such blessed destiny written on their foreheads. || 4 || 19 || 89 || SIREE RAAG,
FIFTH MEHL: Meet with the humble Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, and contemplate the
True Name. For the journey of the soul, gather those supplies which will go with you
here and hereafter. These are obtained from the Perfect Guru, when God bestows His
Glance of Grace. Those unto whom He is Merciful, receive His Grace. || 1 || O my
mind, there is no other as great as the Guru. I cannot imagine any other place. The
Guru leads me to meet the True Lord. || 1 || Pause || Those who go to see the
Guru obtain all treasures. Those whose minds are attached to the Guru‟s Feet are very
fortunate, O my mother. The Guru is the Giver, the Guru is All-powerful. The Guru is
All-pervading, contained amongst all. The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Supreme
Lord God. The Guru lifts up and saves those who are drowning. || 2 || How shall I
praise the Guru, the All-powerful Cause of causes? Those, upon whose foreheads the
Guru has placed His Hand, remain steady and stable. The Guru has led me to drink in
the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; He has released me from the
cycle of birth and death. 

I serve the Guru, the Transcendent Lord, the Dispeller of fear; my suffering has been
taken away. || 3 || The True Guru is the Deep and Profound Ocean of Peace, the
Destroyer of sin. For those who serve their Guru, there is no punishment at the hands
of the Messenger of Death. There is none to compare with the Guru; I have searched
and looked throughout the entire universe. The True Guru has bestowed the Treasure
of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, the mind is filled with peace. || 4 || 20 ||
90 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: People eat what they believe to be sweet, but it
turns out to be bitter in taste. They attach their affections to brothers and friends,
uselessly engrossed in corruption. They vanish without a moment‟s delay; without God‟s
Name, they are stunned and amazed. || 1 || O my mind, attach yourself to the
service of the True Guru. Whatever is seen, shall pass away. Abandon the
intellectualizations of your mind. || 1 || Pause || Like the mad dog running around in
all directions, the greedy person, unaware, consumes everything, edible and non-edible
alike. Engrossed in the intoxication of sexual desire and anger, people wander through
reincarnation over and over again. || 2 || Maya has spread out her net, and in it, she
has placed the bait. The bird of desire is caught, and cannot find any escape, O my
mother. One who does not know the Lord who created him, comes and goes in
reincarnation over and over again. || 3 || By various devices, and in so many ways,
this world is enticed. They alone are saved, whom the All-powerful, Infinite Lord
protects. The servants of the Lord are saved by the Love of the Lord. O Nanak, I am
forever a sacrifice to them. || 4 || 21 || 91 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND
HOUSE: The herdsman comes to the pasture lands—what good are his ostentatious
displays here? When your allotted time is up, you must go. Take care of your real
hearth and home. || 1 || O mind, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and serve the
True Guru with love. Why do you take pride in trivial matters? || 1 || Pause || Like
an overnight guest, you shall arise and depart in the morning. Why are you so attached
to your household? It is all like flowers in the garden. || 2 || Why do you say, “Mine,
mine”? Look to God, who has given it to you. It is certain that you must arise and
depart, and leave behind your hundreds of thousands and millions. || 3 || Through
8.4 million incarnations you have wandered, to obtain this rare and precious human life.
O Nanak, remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the day of departure is drawing
near! || 4 || 22 || 92 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: As long as the soul-companion is
with the body, it dwells in happiness. But when the companion arises and departs, then
the body-bride mingles with dust. || 1 || My mind has become detached from the
world; it longs to see the Vision of God‟s Darshan. Blessed is Your Place. || 1 || Pause
|| As long as the soul-husband dwells in the body-house, everyone greets you with
respect. But when the soul-husband arises and departs, then no one cares for you at
all. || 2 || In this world of your parents‟ home, serve your Husband Lord; in the world
beyond, in your in-laws‟ home, you shall dwell in peace. Meeting with the Guru, be a
sincere student of proper conduct, and suffering shall never touch you. || 3 ||
Everyone shall go to their Husband Lord. 

Everyone shall be given their ceremonial send-off after their marriage. O Nanak,
blessed are the happy soul-brides, who are in love with their Husband Lord. || 4 || 23
|| 93 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL, SIXTH HOUSE: The One Lord is the Doer, the
Cause of causes, who has created the creation. Meditate on the One, O my mind, who
is the Support of all. || 1 || Meditate within your mind on the Guru‟s Feet. Give up all
your clever mental tricks, and lovingly attune yourself to the True Word of the Shabad.
|| 1 || Pause || Suffering, agony and fear do not cling to one whose heart is filled
with the GurMantra. Trying millions of things, people have grown weary, but without
the Guru, none have been saved. || 2 || Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s
Darshan, the mind is comforted and all sins depart. I am a sacrifice to those who fall at
the Feet of the Guru. || 3 || In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the True
Name of the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. Very fortunate are those, O Nanak,
whose minds are filled with this love. || 4 || 24 || 94 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL:
Gather in the Wealth of the Lord, worship the True Guru, and give up all your corrupt
ways. Meditate in remembrance on the Lord who created and adorned you, and you
shall be saved. || 1 || O mind, chant the Name of the One, the Unique and Infinite
Lord. He gave you the praanaa, the breath of life, and your mind and body. He is the
Support of the heart. || 1 || Pause || The world is drunk, engrossed in sexual desire,
anger and egotism. Seek the Sanctuary of the Saints, and fall at their feet; your
suffering and darkness shall be removed. || 2 || Practice truth, contentment and
kindness; this is the most excellent way of life. One who is so blessed by the Formless
Lord God renounces selfishness, and becomes the dust of all. || 3 || All that is seen is
You, Lord, the expansion of the expanse. Says Nanak, the Guru has removed my
doubts; I recognize God in all. || 4 || 25 || 95 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: The
whole world is engrossed in bad deeds and good deeds. God‟s devotee is above both,
but those who understand this are very rare. || 1 || Our Lord and Master is allpervading everywhere. What should I say, and what should I hear? O my Lord and
Master, You are Great, All-powerful and All-knowing. || 1 || Pause || One who is
influenced by praise and blame is not God‟s servant. One who sees the essence of
reality with impartial vision, O Saints, is very rare—one among millions. || 2 || People
talk on and on about Him; they consider this to be praise of God. But rare indeed is the
Gurmukh, who is above this mere talk. || 3 || He is not concerned with deliverance or
bondage. Nanak has obtained the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. || 4 || 26 ||
96 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL, SEVENTH HOUSE: Relying on Your Mercy, Dear
Lord, I have indulged in sensual pleasures. Like a foolish child, I have made mistakes. O
Lord, You are my Father and Mother. || 1 || It is easy to speak and talk, but it is
difficult to accept Your Will. || 1 || Pause || I stand tall; You are my Strength. I
know that You are mine. Inside of all, and outside of all, You are our Self-sufficient
Father. || 2 || O Father, I do not know—how can I know Your Way? 


He frees us from bondage, O Saints, and saves us from possessiveness. || 3 ||
Becoming Merciful, my Lord and Master has ended my comings and goings in
reincarnation. Meeting with the Guru, Nanak has recognized the Supreme Lord God. ||
4 || 27 || 97 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: Meeting with the humble
beings, O Siblings of Destiny, the Messenger of Death is conquered. The True Lord and
Master has come to dwell within my mind; my Lord and Master has become Merciful.
Meeting with the Perfect True Guru, all my worldly entanglements have ended. || 1 ||
O my True Guru, I am a sacrifice to You. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your
Darshan. By the Pleasure of Your Will, You have blessed me with the Ambrosial Naam,
the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || Those who have served You with love are
truly wise. Those who have the Treasure of the Naam within emancipate others as well
as themselves. There is no other Giver as great as the Guru, who has given the gift of
the soul. || 2 || Blessed and acclaimed is the coming of those who have met the Guru
with loving faith. Attuned to the True One, you shall obtain a place of honor in the
Court of the Lord. Greatness is in the Hands of the Creator; it is obtained by preordained destiny. || 3 || True is the Creator, True is the Doer. True is our Lord and
Master, and True is His Support. So speak the Truest of the True. Through the True
One, an intuitive and discerning mind is obtained. Nanak lives by chanting and
meditating on the One, who is pervading within and contained amongst all. || 4 || 28 ||
98 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: Worship the Guru, the Transcendent Lord, with
your mind and body attuned to love. The True Guru is the Giver of the soul; He gives
Support to all. Act according to the Instructions of the True Guru; this is the true
philosophy. Without being attuned to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all
attachment to Maya is just dust. || 1 || O my friend, reflect upon the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. In the Saadh Sangat, He dwells within the mind, and one‟s works are
brought to perfect fruition. || 1 || Pause || The Guru is All-powerful, the Guru is
Infinite. By great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is obtained. The Guru
is Imperceptible, Immaculate and Pure. There is no other as great as the Guru. The
Guru is the Creator, the Guru is the Doer. The Gurmukh obtains true glory. Nothing is
beyond the Guru; whatever He wishes comes to pass. || 2 || The Guru is the Sacred
Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Wish-fulfilling Elysian Tree. The Guru is the Fulfiller
of the desires of the mind. The Guru is the Giver of the Name of the Lord, by which all
the world is saved. The Guru is All-powerful, the Guru is Formless; the Guru is Lofty,
Inaccessible and Infinite. The Praise of the Guru is so sublime—what can any speaker
say? || 3 || All the rewards which the mind desires are with the True Guru. One
whose destiny is so pre-ordained, obtains the Wealth of the True Name. Entering the
Sanctuary of the True Guru, you shall never die again. Nanak: may I never forget You,
Lord. This soul, body and breath are Yours. || 4 || 29 || 99 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH
MEHL: O Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, listen: release comes only through the True
Name. Worship the Feet of the Guru. Let the Name of the Lord be your sacred shrine of
pilgrimage. 


Hereafter, you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord; there, even the homeless find
a home. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, service to the True Guru alone is True. When
the True Guru is pleased, we obtain the Perfect, Unseen, Unknowable Lord. || 1 ||
Pause || I am a sacrifice to the True Guru, who has bestowed the True Name. Night
and day, I praise the True One; I sing the Glorious Praises of the True One. True is the
food, and true are the clothes, of those who chant the True Name of the True One. ||
2 || With each breath and morsel of food, do not forget the Guru, the Embodiment of
Fulfillment. None is seen to be as great as the Guru. Meditate on Him twenty-four hours
a day. As He casts His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name, the Treasure of
Excellence. || 3 || The Guru and the Transcendent Lord are one and the same,
pervading and permeating amongst all. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny,
meditate on the Naam. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Guru, who does not die, or
come and go in reincarnation. || 4 || 30 || 100 ||

SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:
I speak and chant His Praises, vibrating the instrument of my mind. The more I know
Him, the more I vibrate it. The One, unto whom we vibrate and sing—how great is He,
and where is His Place? Those who speak of Him and praise Him—they all continue
speaking of Him with love. || 1 || O Baba, the Lord Allah is Inaccessible and Infinite.
Sacred is His Name, and Sacred is His Place. He is the True Cherisher. || 1 || Pause ||
The extent of Your Command cannot be seen; no one knows how to write it. Even if a
hundred poets met together, they could not describe even a tiny bit of it. No one has
found Your Value; they all merely write what they have heard again and again. || 2 ||
The Pirs, the Prophets, the spiritual teachers, the faithful, the innocents and the
martyrs, the Shaikhs, the mystics, the Qazis, the Mullahs and the Dervishes at His
Door—they are blessed all the more as they continue reading their prayers in praise to
Him. || 3 || He seeks no advice when He builds; He seeks no advice when He
destroys. He seeks no advice while giving or taking. He alone knows His Creative
Power; He Himself does all deeds. He beholds all in His Vision. He gives to those with
whom He is pleased. || 4 || His Place and His Name are not known, no one knows
how great is His Name. How great is that place where my Sovereign Lord dwells? No
one can reach it; whom shall I go and ask? || 5 || One class of people does not like
the other, when one has been made great. Greatness is only in His Great Hands; He
gives to those with whom He is pleased. By the Hukam of His Command, He Himself
regenerates, without a moment‟s delay. || 6 || Everyone cries out, “More! More!”,
with the idea of receiving. How great should we call the Giver? His Gifts are beyond
estimation. O Nanak, there is no deficiency; Your Storehouses are filled to overflowing,
age after age. || 7 || 1 || FIRST MEHL: All are brides of the Husband Lord; all
decorate themselves for Him. 


But when the time comes to settle their accounts, their red robes are corrupt. His Love
is not obtained through hypocrisy. Her false coverings bring only ruin. || 1 || In this
way, the Dear Husband Lord ravishes and enjoys His bride. The happy soul-bride is
pleasing to You, Lord; by Your Grace, You adorn her. || 1 || Pause || She is
decorated with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; her mind and body belong to her
Husband Lord. With her palms pressed together, she stands, waiting on Him, and offers
her True prayers to Him. Dyed in the deep crimson of the Love of her Darling Lord, she
dwells in the Fear of the True One. Imbued with His Love, she is dyed in the color of
His Love. || 2 || She is said to be the hand-maiden of her Beloved Lord; His
sweetheart surrenders to His Name. True Love is never broken; she is united in Union
with the True One. Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, her mind is pierced through. I
am forever a sacrifice to Him. || 3 || That bride, who is absorbed into the True Guru,
shall never become a widow. Her Husband Lord is Beautiful; His Body is forever fresh
and new. The True One does not die, and shall not go. He continually enjoys His happy
soul-bride; He casts His Gracious Glance of Truth upon her, and she abides in His Will.
|| 4 || The bride braids her hair with Truth; her clothes are decorated with His Love.
Like the essence of sandalwood, He permeates her consciousness, and the Temple of
the Tenth Gate is opened. The lamp of the Shabad is lit, and the Name of the Lord is
her necklace. || 5 || She is the most beautiful among women; upon her forehead she
wears the Jewel of the Lord‟s Love. Her glory and her wisdom are magnificent; her love
for the Infinite Lord is True. Other than her Beloved Lord, she knows no man. She
enshrines love for the True Guru. || 6 || Asleep in the darkness of the night, how
shall she pass her life-night without her Husband? Her limbs shall burn, her body shall
burn, and her mind and wealth shall burn as well. When the Husband does not enjoy
His bride, then her youth passes away in vain. || 7 || The Husband is on the Bed, but
the bride is asleep, and so she does not come to know Him. While I am asleep, my
Husband Lord is awake. Where can I go for advice? The True Guru has led me to meet
Him, and now I dwell in the Fear of God. O Nanak, His Love is always with me. || 8 ||
2 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: O Lord, You are Your Own Glorious Praise. You
Yourself speak it; You Yourself hear it and contemplate it. You Yourself are the Jewel,
and You are the Appraiser. You Yourself are of Infinite Value. O True Lord, You are
Honor and Glory; You Yourself are the Giver. || 1 || O Dear Lord, You are the Creator
and the Cause. If it is Your Will, please save and protect me; please bless me with the
lifestyle of the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || Pause || You Yourself are the flawless diamond;
You Yourself are the deep crimson color. You Yourself are the perfect pearl; You
Yourself are the devotee and the priest. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, You
are praised. In each and every heart, the Unseen is seen. || 2 || You Yourself are the
ocean and the boat. You Yourself are this shore, and the one beyond. O All-knowing
Lord, You are the True Way. The Shabad is the Navigator to ferry us across. One who
does not fear God shall live in fear; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. || 3
|| The Creator alone is seen to be Eternal; all others come and go. Only You, Lord, are
Immaculate and Pure. All others are bound up in worldly pursuits. Those who are
protected by the Guru are saved. 


They are lovingly attuned to the True Lord. || 4 || Through the Shabad, they
recognize the Dear Lord; through the Guru‟s Word, they are attuned to Truth. Filth does
not stick to the body of one who has secured a dwelling in his True Home. When the
Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, we obtain the True Name. Without the Name, who
are our relatives? || 5 || Those who have realized the Truth are at peace throughout
the four ages. Subduing their egotism and desires, they keep the True Name enshrined
in their hearts. In this world, the only real profit is the Name of the One Lord; it is
earned by contemplating the Guru. || 6 || Loading the Merchandise of the True
Name, you shall gather in your profits forever with the Capital of Truth. In the Court of
the True One, you shall sit in truthful devotion and prayer. Your account shall be settled
with honor, in the Radiant Light of the Name of the Lord. || 7 || The Lord is said to be
the Highest of the High; no one can perceive Him. Wherever I look, I see only You. The
True Guru has inspired me to see You. The Divine Light within is revealed, O Nanak,
through this intuitive understanding. || 8 || 3 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: The fish
did not notice the net in the deep and salty sea. It was so clever and beautiful, but why
was it so confident? By its actions it was caught, and now death cannot be turned away
from its head. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, just like this, see death hovering over
your own heads! People are just like this fish; unaware, the noose of death descends
upon them. || 1 || Pause || The whole world is bound by death; without the Guru,
death cannot be avoided. Those who are attuned to Truth are saved; they renounce
duality and corruption. I am a sacrifice to those who are found to be Truthful in the
True Court. || 2 || Think of the hawk preying on the birds, and the net in the hands
of the hunter. Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; the others are caught
by the bait. Without the Name, they are picked up and thrown away; they have no
friends or companions. || 3 || God is said to be the Truest of the True; His Place is
the Truest of the True. Those who obey the True One—their minds abide in true
meditation. Those who become Gurmukh, and obtain spiritual wisdom—their minds and
mouths are known to be pure. || 4 || Offer your most sincere prayers to the True
Guru, so that He may unite you with your Best Friend. Meeting your Best Friend, you
shall find peace; the Messenger of Death shall take poison and die. I dwell deep within
the Name; the Name has come to dwell within my mind. || 5 || Without the Guru,
there is only pitch darkness; without the Shabad, understanding is not obtained.
Through the Guru's Teachings, you shall be enlightened; remain absorbed in the Love
of the True Lord. Death does not go there; your light shall merge with the Light. || 6 ||
You are my Best Friend; You are All-knowing. You are the One who unites us with
Yourself. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, we praise You; You have no end or
limitation. Death does not reach that place, where the Infinite Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad resounds. || 7 || By the Hukam of His Command, all are created. By His
Command, actions are performed. By His Command, all are subject to death; by His
Command, they merge in Truth. O Nanak, whatever pleases His Will comes to pass.
Nothing is in the hands of these beings. || 8 || 4 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: If the
mind is polluted, then the body is polluted, and the tongue is polluted as well. 


With false mouths, people speak falsehood. How can they be made pure? Without the
Holy Water of the Shabad, they are not cleansed. From the True One alone comes
Truth. || 1 || O soul-bride, without virtue, what happiness can there be? The Husband
Lord enjoys her with pleasure and delight; she is at peace in the love of the True Word
of the Shabad. || 1 || Pause || When the Husband goes away, the bride suffers in
the pain of separation, like the fish in shallow water, crying for mercy. As it pleases the
Will of the Husband Lord, peace is obtained, when He Himself casts His Glance of
Grace. || 2 || Praise your Husband Lord, together with your bridesmaids and friends.
The body is beautified, and the mind is fascinated. Imbued with His Love, we are
enraptured. Adorned with the Shabad, the beautiful bride enjoys her Husband with
virtue. || 3 || The soul-bride is of no use at all, if she is evil and without virtue. She
does not find peace in this world or the next; she burns in falsehood and corruption.
Coming and going are very difficult for that bride who is abandoned and forgotten by
her Husband Lord. || 4 || The beautiful soul-bride of the Husband Lord—by what
sensual pleasures has she been doomed? She is of no use to her Husband if she
babbles in useless arguments. At the Door of His Home, she finds no shelter; she is
discarded for seeking other pleasures. || 5 || The Pandits, the religious scholars, read
their books, but they do not understand the real meaning. They give instructions to
others, and then walk away, but they deal in Maya themselves. Speaking falsehood,
they wander around the world, while those who remain true to the Shabad are excellent
and exalted. || 6 || There are so many Pandits and astrologers who ponder over the
Vedas. They glorify their disputes and arguments, and in these controversies they
continue coming and going. Without the Guru, they are not released from their karma,
although they speak and listen and preach and explain. || 7 || They all call
themselves virtuous, but I have no virtue at all. With the Lord as her Husband, the soulbride is happy; I, too, love that God. O Nanak, through the Shabad, union is obtained;
there is no more separation. || 8 || 5 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: You may chant
and meditate, practice austerities and self-restraint, and dwell at sacred shrines of
pilgrimage; you may give donations to charity, and perform good deeds, but without
the True One, what is the use of it all? As you plant, so shall you harvest. Without
virtue, this human life passes away in vain. || 1 || O young bride, be a slave to virtue,
and you shall find peace. Renouncing wrongful actions, following the Guru's Teachings,
you shall be absorbed into the Perfect One. || 1 || Pause || Without capital, the
trader looks around in all four directions. He does not understand his own origins; the
merchandise remains within the door of his own house. Without this commodity, there
is great pain. The false are ruined by falsehood. || 2 || One who contemplates and
appraises this Jewel day and night reaps new profits. He finds the merchandise within
his own home, and departs after arranging his affairs. So trade with the true traders,
and as Gurmukh, contemplate God. || 3 || In the Society of the Saints, He is found, if
the Uniter unites us. One whose heart is filled with His Infinite Light meets with Him,
and shall never again be separated from Him. True is his position; he abides in Truth,
with love and affection for the True One. || 4 || One who understands himself finds
the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence within his own home. Imbued with the True Lord,
Truth is gathered in. 

God is known throughout the three worlds. True is the Name of the True One. || 5 || The wife who knows that her Husband Lord is always with her is very beautiful. The soul-bride is called to the Mansion of the His Presence, and her Husband Lord ravishes
her with love. The happy soul-bride is true and good; she is fascinated by the Glories of
her Husband Lord. || 6 || Wandering around and making mistakes, I climb the
plateau; having climbed the plateau, I go up the mountain. But now I have lost my way,
and I am wandering around in the forest; without the Guru, I do not understand. If I
wander around forgetting God‟s Name, I shall continue coming and going in
reincarnation, over and over again. || 7 || Go and ask the travellers, how to walk on
the Path as His slave. They know the Lord to be their King, and at the Door to His
Home, their way is not blocked. O Nanak, the One is pervading everywhere; there is no
other at all.

8 || 6 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Through the Guru, the Pure One
is known, and the human body becomes pure as well. The Pure, True Lord abides
within the mind; He knows the pain of our hearts. With intuitive ease, a great peace is
found, and the arrow of death shall not strike you. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, filth is
washed away by bathing in the Pure Water of the Name. You alone are Perfectly Pure,
O True Lord; all other places are filled with filth. || 1 || Pause || The Temple of the
Lord is beautiful; it was made by the Creator Lord. The sun and the moon are lamps of
incomparably beautiful light. Throughout the three worlds, the Infinite Light is
pervading. In the shops of the city of the body, in the fortresses and in the huts, the
True Merchandise is traded. || 2 || The ointment of spiritual wisdom is the destroyer
of fear; through love, the Pure One is seen. The mysteries of the seen and the unseen
are all known, if the mind is kept centered and balanced. If one finds such a True Guru,
the Lord is met with intuitive ease. || 3 || He draws us to His Touchstone, to test our
love and consciousness. The counterfeit have no place there, but the genuine are
placed in His Treasury. Let your hopes and anxieties depart; thus pollution is washed
away. || 4 || Everyone begs for happiness; no one asks for suffering. But in the wake
of happiness, there comes great suffering. The self-willed manmukhs do not understand
this. Those who see pain and pleasure as one and the same find peace; they are
pierced through by the Shabad. || 5 || The Vedas proclaim, and the words of Vyaasa
tell us, that the silent sages, the servants of the Lord, and those who practice a life of
spiritual discipline are attuned to the Naam, the Treasure of Excellence. Those who are
attuned to the True Name win the game of life; I am forever a sacrifice to them. || 6 ||
Those who do not have the Naam in their mouths are filled with pollution; they are
filthy throughout the four ages. Without loving devotion to God, their faces are
blackened, and their honor is lost. Those who have forgotten the Naam are plundered
by evil; they weep and wail in dismay. || 7 || I searched and searched, and found
God. In the Fear of God, I have been united in His Union. Through self-realization,
people dwell within the home of their inner being; egotism and desire depart. O Nanak,
those who are attuned to the Name of the Lord are immaculate and radiant. || 8 || 7 ||
SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Listen, O deluded and demented mind: hold tight to the
Guru‟s Feet. Chant and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; death will be
afraid of you, and suffering shall depart. The deserted wife suffers terrible pain. 

How can her Husband Lord remain with her forever? || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, I
have no other place to go. The Guru has given me the Treasure of the Wealth of the
Naam; I am a sacrifice to Him. || 1 || Pause || The Guru‟s Teachings bring honor.
Blessed is He—may I meet and be with Him! Without Him, I cannot live, even for a
moment. Without His Name, I die. I am blind—may I never forget the Naam! Under His
Protection, I shall reach my true home. || 2 || Those chaylaas, those devotees, whose
spiritual teacher is blind, shall not find their place of rest. Without the True Guru, the
Name is not obtained. Without the Name, what is the use of it all? People come and go,
regretting and repenting, like crows in a deserted house. || 3 || Without the Name,
the body suffers in pain; it crumbles like a wall of sand. As long as Truth does not enter
into the consciousness, the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence is not found. Attuned to the
Shabad, we enter our home, and obtain the Eternal State of Nirvaanaa. || 4 || I ask
my Guru for His Advice, and I follow the Guru‟s Advice. With the Shabads of Praise
abiding in the mind, the pain of egotism is burnt away. We are intuitively united with
Him, and we meet the Truest of the True. || 5 || Those who are attuned to the
Shabad are spotless and pure; they renounce sexual desire, anger, selfishness and
conceit. They sing the Praises of the Naam, forever and ever; they keep the Lord
enshrined within their hearts. How could we ever forget Him from our minds? He is the
Support of all beings. || 6 || One who dies in the Shabad is beyond death, and shall
never die again. Through the Shabad, we find Him, and embrace love for the Name of
the Lord. Without the Shabad, the world is deceived; it dies and is reborn, over and
over again. || 7 || All praise themselves, and call themselves the greatest of the
great. Without the Guru, one‟s self cannot be known. By merely speaking and listening,
what is accomplished? O Nanak, one who realizes the Shabad does not act in egotism.
|| 8 || 8 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Without her Husband, the soul-bride‟s youth
and ornaments are useless and wretched. She does not enjoy the pleasure of His Bed;
without her Husband, her ornaments are absurd. The discarded bride suffers terrible
pain; her Husband does not come to the bed of her home. || 1 || O mind, meditate
on the Lord, and find peace. Without the Guru, love is not found. United with the
Shabad, happiness is found. || 1 || Pause || Serving the Guru, she finds peace, and
her Husband Lord adorns her with intuitive wisdom. Truly, she enjoys the Bed of her
Husband, through her deep love and affection. As Gurmukh, she comes to know Him.
Meeting with the Guru, she maintains a virtuous lifestyle. || 2 || Through Truth, meet
your Husband Lord, O soul-bride. Enchanted by your Husband, enshrine love for Him.
Your mind and body shall blossom forth in Truth. The value of this cannot be described.
The soul-bride finds her Husband Lord in the home of her own being; she is purified by
the True Name. || 3 || If the mind within the mind dies, then the Husband ravishes
and enjoys His bride. They are woven into one texture, like pearls on a necklace around
the neck. In the Society of the Saints, peace wells up; the Gurmukhs take the Support
of the Naam. || 4 || In an instant, one is born, and in an instant, one dies. In an
instant one comes, and in an instant one goes. One who recognizes the Shabad merges
into it, and is not afflicted by death. 

Our Lord and Master is Unweighable; He cannot be weighed. He cannot be found
merely by talking. || 5 || The merchants and the traders have come; their profits are
pre-ordained. Those who practice Truth reap the profits, abiding in the Will of God. With
the Merchandise of Truth, they meet the Guru, who does not have a trace of greed. ||
6 || As Gurmukh, they are weighed and measured, in the balance and the scales of
Truth. The enticements of hope and desire are quieted by the Guru, whose Word is
True. He Himself weighs with the scale; perfect is the weighing of the Perfect One. || 7
|| No one is saved by mere talk and speech, nor by reading loads of books. The body
does not obtain purity without loving devotion to the Lord. O Nanak, never forget the
Naam; the Guru shall unite us with the Creator. || 8 || 9 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST
MEHL: Meeting the Perfect True Guru, we find the jewel of meditative reflection.
Surrendering our minds to our Guru, we find universal love. We find the wealth of
liberation, and our demerits are erased. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, without the
Guru, there is no spiritual wisdom. Go and ask Brahma, Naarad and Vyaas, the writer of
the Vedas. || 1 || Pause || Know that from the vibration of the Word, we obtain
spiritual wisdom and meditation. Through it, we speak the Unspoken. He is the fruitbearing Tree, luxuriantly green with abundant shade. The rubies, jewels and emeralds
are in the Guru‟s Treasury. || 2 || From the Guru‟s Treasury, we receive the Love of
the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. We gather in the True Merchandise,
through the Perfect Grace of the Infinite. The True Guru is the Giver of peace, the
Dispeller of pain, the Destroyer of demons. || 3 || The terrifying world-ocean is
difficult and dreadful; there is no shore on this side or the one beyond. There is no
boat, no raft, no oars and no boatman. The True Guru is the only boat on this terrifying
ocean. His Glance of Grace carries us across. || 4 || If I forget my Beloved, even for
an instant, suffering overtakes me and peace departs. Let that tongue be burnt in
flames, which does not chant the Naam with love. When the pitcher of the body bursts,
there is terrible pain; those who are caught by the Minister of Death regret and repent.
|| 5 || Crying out, “Mine! Mine!”, they have departed, but their bodies, their wealth,
and their wives did not go with them. Without the Name, wealth is useless; deceived by
wealth, they have lost their way. So serve the True Lord; become Gurmukh, and speak
the Unspoken. || 6 || Coming and going, people wander through reincarnation; they
act according to their past actions. How can one‟s pre-ordained destiny be erased? It is
written in accordance with the Lord‟s Will. Without the Name of the Lord, no one can be
saved. Through the Guru's Teachings, we are united in His Union. || 7 || Without
Him, I have no one to call my own. My soul and my breath of life belong to Him. May
my egotism and possessiveness be burnt to ashes, and my greed and egotistical pride
consigned to the fire. O Nanak, contemplating the Shabad, the Treasure of Excellence is
obtained. || 8 || 10 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: O mind, love the Lord, as the lotus
loves the water. Tossed about by the waves, it still blossoms with love. 

In the water, the creatures are created; outside of the water they die. || 1 || O mind,
how can you be saved without love? God permeates the inner beings of the Gurmukhs.
They are blessed with the treasure of devotion. || 1 || Pause || O mind, love the
Lord, as the fish loves the water. The more the water, the more the happiness, and the
greater the peace of mind and body. Without water, she cannot live, even for an
instant. God knows the suffering of her mind. || 2 || O mind, love the Lord, as the
song-bird loves the rain. The pools are overflowing with water, and the land is
luxuriantly green, but what are they to her, if that single drop of rain does not fall into
her mouth? By His Grace, she receives it; otherwise, because of her past actions, she
gives her head. || 3 || O mind, love the Lord, as the water loves the milk. The water,
added to the milk, itself bears the heat, and prevents the milk from burning. God unites
the separated ones with Himself again, and blesses them with true greatness. || 4 ||
O mind, love the Lord, as the chakvee duck loves the sun. She does not sleep, for an
instant or a moment; the sun is so far away, but she thinks that it is near.
Understanding does not come to the self-willed manmukh. But to the Gurmukh, the
Lord is always close. || 5 || The self-willed manmukhs make their calculations and
plans, but only the actions of the Creator come to pass. His Value cannot be estimated,
even though everyone may wish to do so. Through the Guru's Teachings, it is revealed.
Meeting with the True One, peace is found. || 6 || True love shall not be broken, if
the True Guru is met. Obtaining the wealth of spiritual wisdom, the understanding of
the three worlds is acquired. So become a customer of merit, and do not forget the
Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 7 || Those birds which peck at the shore
of the pool have played and have departed. In a moment, in an instant, we too must
depart. Our play is only for today or tomorrow. But those whom You unite, Lord, are
united with You; they obtain a seat in the Arena of Truth. || 8 || Without the Guru,
love does not well up, and the filth of egotism does not depart. One who recognizes
within himself that, “He is me”, and who is pierced through by the Shabad, is satisfied.
When one becomes Gurmukh and realizes his own self, what more is there left to do or
have done? || 9 || Why speak of union to those who are already united with the
Lord? Receiving the Shabad, they are satisfied. The self-willed manmukhs do not
understand; separated from Him, they endure beatings. O Nanak, there is only the one
door to His Home; there is no other place at all. || 10 || 11 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST
MEHL: The self-willed manmukhs wander around, deluded and deceived. They find no
place of rest. Without the Guru, no one is shown the Way. Like the blind, they continue
coming and going. Having lost the treasure of spiritual wisdom, they depart, defrauded
and plundered. || 1 || O Baba, Maya deceives with its illusion. Deceived by doubt, the
discarded bride is not received into the Lap of her Beloved. || 1 || Pause || The
deceived bride wanders around in foreign lands; she leaves, and abandons her own
home. Deceived, she climbs the plateaus and mountains; her mind wavers in doubt.
Separated from the Primal Being, how can she meet with Him again? Plundered by
pride, she cries out and bewails. || 2 || The Guru unites the separated ones with the
Lord again, through the love of the Delicious Name of the Lord. 

Through truth and intuitive poise, great honor is obtained, with the Support of the
Naam and the Glory of the Lord. As it pleases You, Lord, please save and protect me.
Without You, O my Husband Lord, who else is there for me? || 3 || Reading their
books over and over again, people continue making mistakes; they are so proud of their
religious robes. But what is the use of bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, when the
filth of stubborn pride is within the mind? Other than the Guru, who can explain that
within the mind is the Lord, the King, the Emperor? || 4 || The Treasure of the Lord‟s
Love is obtained by the Gurmukh, who contemplates the essence of reality. The bride
eradicates her selfishness, and adorns herself with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad.
Within her own home, she finds her Husband, through infinite love for the Guru. || 5 ||
Applying oneself to the service of the Guru, the mind is purified, and peace is obtained.
The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad abides within the mind, and egotism is eliminated from
within. The Treasure of the Naam is acquired, and the mind reaps the lasting profit. ||
6 || If He grants His Grace, then we obtain it. We cannot find it by our own efforts.
Remain attached to the Feet of the Guru, and eradicate selfishness from within. Attuned
to Truth, you shall obtain the True One. || 7 || Everyone makes mistakes; only the
Guru and the Creator are infallible. One who instructs his mind with the Guru‟s
Teachings comes to embrace love for the Lord. O Nanak, do not forget the Truth; you
shall receive the Infinite Word of the Shabad. || 8 || 12 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL:
The enticing desire for Maya leads people to become emotionally attached to their
children, relatives, households and spouses. The world is deceived and plundered by
riches, youth, greed and egotism. The drug of emotional attachment has destroyed me,
as it has destroyed the whole world. || 1 || O my Beloved, I have no one except You.
Without You, nothing else pleases me. Loving You, I am at peace. || 1 || Pause || I
sing the Praises of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, with love; I am content with the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Whatever is seen shall pass away. So do not be attached to
this false show. Like a traveller in his travels, you have come. Behold the caravan
leaving each day. || 2 || Many preach sermons, but without the Guru, understanding
is not obtained. If someone receives the Glory of the Naam, he is attuned to truth and
blessed with honor. Those who are pleasing to You are good; no one is counterfeit or
genuine. || 3 || In the Guru‟s Sanctuary we are saved. The assets of the self-willed
manmukhs are false. The eight metals of the King are made into coins by the Word of
His Shabad. The Assayer Himself assays them, and He places the genuine ones in His
Treasury. || 4 || Your Value cannot be appraised; I have seen and tested everything.
By speaking, His Depth cannot be found. Abiding in truth, honor is obtained. Through
the Guru's Teachings, I praise You; otherwise, I cannot describe Your Value. || 5 ||
That body which does not appreciate the Naam—that body is infested with egotism and
conflict. Without the Guru, spiritual wisdom is not obtained; other tastes are poison.
Without virtue, nothing is of any use. The taste of Maya is bland and insipid. || 6 ||
Through desire, people are cast into the womb and reborn. Through desire, they taste
the sweet and sour flavors. Bound by desire, they are led on, beaten and struck on their
faces and mouths. Bound and gagged and assaulted by evil, they are released only
through the Name, through the Guru‟s Teachings. 

7 || In all places, You are the One and Only. As it pleases You, Lord, please save
and protect me! Through the Guru's Teachings, the True One abides within the mind.
The Companionship of the Naam brings the most excellent honor. Eradicate the disease
of egotism, and chant the True Shabad, the Word of the True Lord. || 8 || You are
pervading throughout the Akaashic Ethers, the nether regions and the three worlds.
You Yourself are bhakti, loving devotional worship. You Yourself unite us in Union with
Yourself. O Nanak, may I never forget the Naam! As is Your Pleasure, so is Your Will.
|| 9 || 13 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: My mind is pierced through by the Name of
the Lord. What else should I contemplate? Focusing your awareness on the Shabad,
happiness wells up. Attuned to God, the most excellent peace is found. As it pleases
You, please save me, Lord. The Name of the Lord is my Support. || 1 || O mind, the
Will of our Lord and Master is true. Focus your love upon the One who created and
adorned your body and mind. || 1 || Pause || If I cut my body into pieces, and burn
them in the fire, and if I make my body and mind into firewood, and night and day burn
them in the fire, and if I perform hundreds of thousands and millions of religious
rituals—still, all these are not equal to the Name of the Lord. || 2 || If my body were
cut in half, if a saw was put to my head, and if my body were frozen in the Himalayas—
even then, my mind would not be free of disease. None of these are equal to the Name
of the Lord. I have seen and tried and tested them all. || 3 || If I made a donation of
castles of gold, and gave lots of fine horses and wondrous elephants in charity, and if I
made donations of land and cows—even then, pride and ego would still be within me.
The Name of the Lord has pierced my mind; the Guru has given me this true gift. || 4
|| There are so many stubborn-minded intelligent people, and so many who
contemplate the Vedas. There are so many entanglements for the soul. Only as
Gurmukh do we find the Gate of Liberation. Truth is higher than everything; but higher
still is truthful living. || 5 || Call everyone exalted; no one seems lowly. The One Lord
has fashioned the vessels, and His One Light pervades the three worlds. Receiving His
Grace, we obtain Truth. No one can erase His Primal Blessing. || 6 || When one Holy
person meets another Holy person, they abide in contentment, through the Love of the
Guru. They contemplate the Unspoken Speech, merging in absorption in the True Guru.
Drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, they are contented; they go to the Court of the Lord
in robes of honor. || 7 || In each and every heart the Music of the Lord‟s Flute
vibrates, night and day, with sublime love for the Shabad. Only those few who become
Gurmukh understand this by instructing their minds. O Nanak, do not forget the Naam.
Practicing the Shabad you shall be saved. || 8 || 14 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL:
There are painted mansions to behold, white-washed, with beautiful doors; they were
constructed to give pleasure to the mind, but this is only for the sake of the love of
duality. The inner being is empty without love. The body shall crumble into a heap of
ashes. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, this body and wealth shall not go along with you.
The Lord‟s Name is the pure wealth; through the Guru, God bestows this gift. || 1 ||
Pause || The Lord‟s Name is the pure wealth; it is given only by the Giver. One who
has the Guru, the Creator, as his Friend, shall not be questioned hereafter. He Himself
delivers those who are delivered. 

He Himself is the Forgiver. || 2 || The self-willed manmukh looks upon his daughters,
sons and relatives as his own. Gazing upon his wife, he is pleased. But along with
happiness, they bring grief. The Gurmukhs are attuned to the Word of the Shabad. Day
and night, they enjoy the Sublime Essence of the Lord. || 3 || The consciousness of
the wicked, faithless cynics wanders around in search of transitory wealth, unstable and
distracted. Searching outside of themselves, they are ruined; the object of their search
is in that sacred place within the home of the heart. The self-willed manmukhs, in their
ego, miss it; the Gurmukhs receive it in their laps. || 4 || You worthless, faithless
cynic—recognize your own origin! This body is made of blood and semen. It shall be
consigned to the fire in the end. The body is under the power of the breath, according
to the True Sign inscribed upon your forehead. || 5 || Everyone begs for a long life—
no one wishes to die. A life of peace and comfort comes to that Gurmukh, within whom
God dwells. Without the Naam, what good those who do not have the Blessed Vision,
the Darshan of the Lord and Guru? || 6 || In their dreams at night, people wander
around as long as they sleep; just so, they are under the power of the snake Maya, as
long as their hearts are filled with ego and duality. Through the Guru's Teachings, they
come to understand and see that this world is just a dream. || 7 || As thirst is
quenched with water, and the baby is satisfied with mother‟s milk, and as the lotus
does not exist without water, and as the fish dies without water—O Nanak, so does the
Gurmukh live, receiving the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and singing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. || 8 || 15 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: Beholding the terrifying
mountain in this world of my father‟s home, I am terrified. It is so difficult to climb this
high mountain; there is no ladder which reaches up there. But as Gurmukh, I know that
it is within my self; the Guru has brought me to Union, and so I cross over. || 1 || O
Siblings of Destiny, the terrifying world-ocean is so difficult to cross—I am terrified! The
Perfect True Guru, in His Pleasure, has met with me; the Guru has saved me, through
the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || I may say, “I am going, I am going”, but I
know that, in the end, I must really go. Whoever comes must also go. Only the Guru
and the Creator are Eternal. So praise the True One continually, and love His Place of
Truth. || 2 || Beautiful gates, houses and palaces, solidly built forts, elephants,
saddled horses, hundreds of thousands of uncounted armies—none of these will go
along with anyone in the end, and yet, the fools bother themselves to exhaustion with
these, and then die. || 3 || You may gather gold and sliver, but wealth is just a net of
entanglement. You may beat the drum and proclaim authority over the whole world, but
without the Name, death hovers over your head. When the body falls, the play of life is
over; what shall be the condition of the evil-doers then? || 4 || The husband is
delighted seeing his sons, and his wife upon his bed. He applies sandalwood and
scented oils, and dresses himself in his beautiful clothes. But dust shall mix with dust,
and he shall depart, leaving hearth and home behind. || 5 || He may be called a
chief, an emperor, a king, a governor or a lord; he may present himself as a leader or a
chief, but this just burns him in the fire of egotistical pride. The self-willed manmukh
has forgotten the Naam. He is like straw, burning in the forest fire. || 6 || Whoever
comes into the world and indulges in ego, must depart. 

The whole world is a store-house of lamp-black; the body and mind are blackened with
it. Those who are saved by the Guru are immaculate and pure; through the Word of the
Shabad, they extinguish the fire of desire. || 7 || O Nanak, they swim across with the
True Name of the Lord, the King above the heads of kings. May I never forget the
Name of the Lord! I have purchased the Jewel of the Lord‟s Name. The self-willed
manmukhs putrefy and die in the terrifying world-ocean, while the Gurmukhs cross over
the bottomless ocean. || 8 || 16 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:
They have made this their resting place and they sit at home, but the urge to depart is
always there. This would be known as a lasting place of rest, only if they were to
remain stable and unchanging. || 1 || What sort of a resting place is this world?
Doing deeds of faith, pack up the supplies for your journey, and remain committed to
the Name. || 1 || Pause || The Yogis sit in their Yogic postures, and the Mullahs sit
at their resting stations. The Hindu Pandits recite from their books, and the Siddhas sit
in the temples of their gods. || 2 || The angels, Siddhas, worshippers of Shiva,
heavenly musicians, silent sages, Saints, priests, preachers, spiritual teachers and
commanders—each and every one has left, and all others shall depart as well. || 3 ||
The sultans and kings, the rich and the mighty, have marched away in succession. In a
moment or two, we shall also depart. O my heart, understand that you must go as well!
|| 4 || This is described in the Shabads; only a few understand this! Nanak offers this
prayer to the One who pervades the water, the land and the air. || 5 || He is Allah,
the Unknowable, the Inaccessible, All-powerful and Merciful Creator. All the world
comes and goes—only the Merciful Lord is permanent. || 6 || Call permanent only the
One, who does not have destiny inscribed upon His Forehead. The sky and the earth
shall pass away; He alone is permanent. || 7 || The day and the sun shall pass away;
the night and the moon shall pass away; the hundreds of thousands of stars shall
disappear. He alone is permanent; Nanak speaks the Truth. || 8 || 17 || SEVENTEEN

ASHTAPADEES OF THE FIRST MEHL. SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

By God‟s Grace, the Gurmukh practices devotion; without the Guru, there is no
devotional worship. One who merges his own self into Him understands, and so
becomes pure. The Dear Lord is True, and True is the Word of His Bani. Through the
Word of the Shabad, Union with Him is obtained. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, without
devotion, why have people even come into the world? They have not served the Perfect
Guru; they have wasted their lives in vain. || 1 || Pause || The Lord Himself, the Life
of the World, is the Giver. He Himself forgives, and unites us with Himself. What are
these poor beings and creatures? What can they speak and say? God Himself grants
glory to the Gurmukhs; He joins them to His Service. || 2 || Beholding your family,
you are lured away by emotional attachment, but when you leave, they will not go with
you. 

Serving the True Guru, I have found the Treasure of Excellence. Its value cannot be
estimated. The Dear Lord God is my Best Friend. In the end, He shall be my Companion
and Support. || 3 || In this world of my father‟s home, the Great Giver is the Life of
the World. The self-willed manmukhs have lost their honor. Without the True Guru, no
one knows the Way. The blind find no place of rest. If the Lord, the Giver of Peace,
does not dwell within the mind, then they shall depart with regret in the end. || 4 ||
In this world of my father‟s house, through the Guru‟s Teachings, I have cultivated
within my mind the Great Giver, the Life of the World. Night and day, performing
devotional worship, day and night, ego and emotional attachment are removed. And
then, attuned to Him, we become like Him, truly absorbed in the True One. || 5 ||
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He gives us His Love, and we contemplate the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad. Serving the True Guru, intuitive peace wells up, and ego and desire
die. The Lord, the Giver of Virtue, dwells forever within the minds of those who keep
Truth enshrined within their hearts. || 6 || My God is forever Immaculate and Pure;
with a pure mind, He can be found. If the Treasure of the Name of the Lord abides
within the mind, egotism and pain are totally eliminated. The True Guru has instructed
me in the Word of the Shabad. I am forever a sacrifice to Him. || 7 || Within your
own conscious mind, you may say anything, but without the Guru, selfishness and
conceit are not eradicated. The Dear Lord is the Lover of His devotees, the Giver of
Peace. By His Grace, He abides within the mind. O Nanak, God blesses us with the
sublime awakening of consciousness; He Himself grants glorious greatness to the
Gurmukh. || 8 || 1 || 18 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Those who go around acting
in egotism are struck down by the Messenger of Death with his club. Those who serve
the True Guru are uplifted and saved, in love with the Lord. || 1 || O mind, become
Gurmukh, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Those who are so predestined by the Creator are absorbed into the Naam, through the Guru‟s Teachings. ||
1 || Pause || Without the True Guru, faith does not come, and love for the Naam is
not embraced. Even in dreams, they find no peace; they sleep immersed in pain. || 2
|| Even if you chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with great longing, your past
actions are still not erased. The Lord‟s devotees surrender to His Will; those devotees
are accepted at His Door. || 3 || The Guru has lovingly implanted the Word of His
Shabad within me. Without His Grace, it cannot be attained. Even if the poisonous plant
is watered with ambrosial nectar a hundred times, it will still bear poisonous fruit. || 4
|| Those humble beings who are in love with the True Guru are pure and true. They
act in harmony with the Will of the True Guru; they shed the poison of ego and
corruption. || 5 || Acting in stubborn-mindedness, no one is saved; go and study the
Simritees and the Shaastras. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and
practicing the Shabads of the Guru, you shall be saved. || 6 || The Name of the Lord
is the Treasure, which has no end or limitation. The Gurmukhs are beauteous; the
Creator has blessed them with His Mercy. || 7 || O Nanak, the One Lord alone is the
Giver; there is no other at all. By Guru‟s Grace, He is obtained.


By His Mercy, He is found. || 8 || 2 || 19 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The soulbird in the beautiful tree of the body pecks at Truth, with love for the Guru. She drinks
in the Sublime Essence of the Lord, and abides in intuitive ease; she does not fly
around coming and going. She obtains her home within her own heart; she is absorbed
into the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || O mind, work to serve the Guru. If you
walk in harmony with the Guru‟s Will, you shall remain immersed in the Lord‟s Name,
night and day. || 1 || Pause || The birds in the beautiful trees fly around in all four
directions. The more they fly around, the more they suffer; they burn and cry out in
pain. Without the Guru, they do not find the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, and they
do not obtain the Ambrosial Fruit. || 2 || The Gurmukh is like God‟s tree, always
green, blessed with the Sublime Love of the True One, with intuitive peace and poise.
He cuts off the three branches of the three qualities, and embraces love for the One
Word of the Shabad. The Lord alone is the Ambrosial Fruit; He Himself gives it to us to
eat. || 3 || The self-willed manmukhs stand there and dry up; they do not bear any
fruit, and they do not provide any shade. Don‟t even bother to sit near them—they have
no home or village. They are cut down and burnt each day; they have neither the
Shabad, nor the Lord‟s Name. || 4 || According to the Lord‟s Command, people
perform their actions; they wander around, driven by the karma of their past actions. By
the Lord‟s Command, they behold the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Wherever He
sends them, there they go. By His Command, the Lord, Har, Har, abides within our
minds; by His Command we merge in Truth. || 5 || The wretched fools do not know
the Lord‟s Will; they wander around making mistakes. They go about their business
stubborn-mindedly; they are disgraced forever and ever. Inner peace does not come to
them; they do not embrace love for the True Lord. || 6 || Beautiful are the faces of
the Gurmukhs, who bear love and affection for the Guru. Through true devotional
worship, they are attuned to Truth; at the True Door, they are found to be true. Blessed
is their coming into being; they redeem all their ancestors. || 7 || All do their deeds
under the Lord‟s Glance of Grace; no one is beyond His Vision. According to the Glance
of Grace with which the True Lord beholds us, so do we become. O Nanak, the Glorious
Greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is received only by His Mercy. 

8 || 3
|| 20 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: The Gurmukhs meditate on the Naam; the selfwilled manmukhs do not understand. The faces of the Gurmukhs are always radiant;
the Lord has come to dwell within their minds. Through intuitive understanding they are
at peace, and through intuitive understanding they remain absorbed in the Lord. || 1 ||
O Siblings of Destiny, be the slaves of the Lord‟s slaves. Service to the Guru is worship
of the Guru. How rare are those who obtain it! || 1 || Pause || The happy soul-bride
is always with her Husband Lord, if she walks in harmony with the Will of the True
Guru. She attains her Eternal, Ever-stable Husband, who never dies or goes away.
United with the Word of the Shabad, she shall not be separated again. She is immersed
in the Lap of her Beloved. || 2 || The Lord is Immaculate and Radiantly Bright;
without the Guru, He cannot be found. He cannot be understood by reading scriptures;
the deceitful pretenders are deluded by doubt. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Lord
is always found, and the tongue is permeated with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. ||
3 || 

Emotional attachment to Maya is shed with intuitive ease, through the Guru‟s
Teachings. Without the Shabad, the world wanders lost in pain. The self-willed
manmukh is consumed. Through the Shabad, meditate on the Naam; through the
Shabad, you shall merge in Truth. || 4 || The Siddhas wander around, deluded by
Maya; they are not absorbed in the Samaadhi of the Lord‟s Sublime Love. The three
worlds are permeated by Maya; they are totally covered by it. Without the Guru,
liberation is not attained, and the double-mindedness of Maya does not go away. || 5
|| What is called Maya? What does Maya do? These beings are bound by pleasure and
pain; they do their deeds in egotism. Without the Shabad, doubt is not dispelled, and
egotism is not eliminated from within. || 6 || Without love, there is no devotional
worship. Without the Shabad, no one finds acceptance. Through the Shabad, egotism is
conquered and subdued, and the illusion of Maya is dispelled. The Gurmukh obtains the
Treasure of the Naam with intuitive ease. || 7 || Without the Guru, one‟s virtues do
not shine forth; without virtue, there is no devotional worship. The Lord is the Lover of
His devotees; He abides within their minds. They meet that God with intuitive ease. O
Nanak, through the Shabad, praise the Lord. By His Grace, He is obtained. 

8 || 4 || 21 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Emotional attachment to Maya is created by my
God; He Himself misleads us through illusion and doubt. The self-willed manmukhs
perform their actions, but they do not understand; they waste away their lives in vain.
Gurbani is the Light to illuminate this world; by His Grace, it comes to abide within the
mind. || 1 || O mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and find peace. Praising
the Perfect Guru, you shall easily meet with that God. || 1 || Pause || Doubt
departs, and fear runs away, when you focus your consciousness on the Lord‟s Feet.
The Gurmukh practices the Shabad, and the Lord comes to dwell within the mind. In
the mansion of the home within the self, we merge in Truth, and the Messenger of
Death cannot devour us. || 2 || Naam Dayv the printer, and Kabeer the weaver,
obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His
Shabad lose their ego and class consciousness. Their Banis are sung by the angelic
beings, and no one can erase them, O Siblings of Destiny! || 3 || The demon‟s son
Prahlaad had not read about religious rituals or ceremonies, austerity or self-discipline;
he did not know the love of duality. Upon meeting with the True Guru, he became pure;
night and day, he chanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He read only of the One
and he understood only the One Name; he knew no other at all. || 4 || The followers
of the six different life-styles and world-views, the Yogis and the Sanyaasees have gone
astray in doubt without the Guru. If they serve the True Guru, they find the state of
salvation; they enshrine the Dear Lord within their minds. They focus their
consciousness on the True Bani, and their comings and goings in reincarnation are over.
|| 5 || The Pandits, the religious scholars, read and argue and stir up controversies,
but without the Guru, they are deluded by doubt. They wander around the cycle of 8.4
million reincarnations; without the Shabad, they do not attain liberation. But when they
remember the Name, then they attain the state of salvation, when the True Guru unites
them in Union. || 6 || 

In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the Name of the Lord wells up, when the
True Guru unites us in His Sublime Love. I offer my mind and body, and I renounce my
selfishness and conceit; I walk in Harmony with the Will of the True Guru. I am forever
a sacrifice to my Guru, who has attached my consciousness to the Lord. || 7 || He
alone is a Brahmin, who knows the Lord Brahma, and is attuned to the Love of the
Lord. God is close at hand; He dwells deep within the hearts of all. How rare are those
who, as Gurmukh, know Him. O Nanak, through the Naam, greatness is obtained;
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He is realized. 

8 || 5 || 22 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Everyone longs to be centered and balanced, but without the Guru, no
one can. The Pandits and the astrologers read and read until they grow weary, while
the fanatics are deluded by doubt. Meeting with the Guru, intuitive balance is obtained,
when God, in His Will, grants His Grace. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, without the
Guru, intuitive balance is not obtained. Through the Word of the Shabad, intuitive peace
and poise wells up, and that True Lord is obtained. || 1 || Pause || That which is
sung intuitively is acceptable; without this intuition, all chanting is useless. In the state
of intuitive balance, devotion wells up. In intuitive balance, love is balanced and
detached. In the state of intuitive balance, peace and tranquility are produced. Without
intuitive balance, life is useless. || 2 || In the state of intuitive balance, praise the
Lord forever and ever. With intuitive ease, embrace Samaadhi. In the state of intuitive
balance, chant His Glories, lovingly absorbed in devotional worship. Through the
Shabad, the Lord dwells within the mind, and the tongue tastes the Sublime Essence of
the Lord. || 3 || In the poise of intuitive balance, death is destroyed, entering the
Sanctuary of the True One. Intuitively balanced, the Name of the Lord dwells within the
mind, practicing the lifestyle of Truth. Those who have found Him are very fortunate;
they remain intuitively absorbed in Him. || 4 || Within Maya, the poise of intuitive
balance is not produced. Maya leads to the love of duality. The self-willed manmukhs
perform religious rituals, but they are burnt down by their selfishness and conceit. Their
births and deaths do not cease; over and over again, they come and go in
reincarnation. || 5 || In the three qualities, intuitive balance is not obtained; the three
qualities lead to delusion and doubt. What is the point of reading, studying and
debating, if one loses his roots? In the fourth state, there is intuitive balance; the
Gurmukhs gather it in. || 6 || The Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord, is the
treasure. Through intuitive balance, understanding is obtained. The virtuous praise the
True One; their reputation is true. The wayward are united with God through intuitive
balance; through the Shabad, union is obtained. || 7 || Without intuitive balance, all
are blind. Emotional attachment to Maya is utter darkness. In intuitive balance,
understanding of the True, Infinite Shabad is obtained. Granting forgiveness, the
Perfect Guru unites us with the Creator. || 8 || In intuitive balance, the Unseen is
recognized—the Fearless, Luminous, Formless Lord. There is only the One Giver of all
beings. He blends our light with His Light. So praise God through the Perfect Word of
His Shabad; He has no end or limitation. || 9 || Those who are wise take the Naam as
their wealth; with intuitive ease, they trade with Him. Night and day, they receive the
Profit of the Lord‟s Name, which is an inexhaustible and over-flowing treasure. 

O Nanak, when the Great Giver gives, nothing at all is lacking. || 10 || 6 || 23 ||


SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Meeting with the True Guru, you shall not have to go
through the cycle of reincarnation again; the pains of birth and death will be taken
away. Through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, all understanding is obtained; remain
absorbed in the Name of the Lord. || 1 || O my mind, focus your consciousness on
the True Guru. The Immaculate Naam itself, ever-fresh, comes to abide within the
mind. || 1 || Pause || O Dear Lord, please protect and preserve me in Your
Sanctuary. As You keep me, so do I remain. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
the Gurmukh remains dead while yet alive, and swims across the terrifying world-ocean.
|| 2 || By great good fortune, the Name is obtained. Following the Guru‟s Teachings,
through the Shabad, you shall be exalted. God, the Creator Himself, dwells within the
mind; remain absorbed in the state of intuitive balance. || 3 || Some are self-willed
manmukhs; they do not love the Word of the Shabad. Bound in chains, they wander
lost in reincarnation. Through 8.4 million lifetimes, they wander over and over again;
they waste away their lives in vain. || 4 || In the minds of the devotees there is bliss;
they are attuned to the Love of the True Word of the Shabad. Night and day, they
constantly sing the Glories of the Immaculate Lord; with intuitive ease, they are
absorbed into the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 5 || The Gurmukhs speak the
Ambrosial Bani; they recognize the Lord, the Supreme Soul in all. They serve the One;
they worship and adore the One. The Gurmukhs speak the Unspoken Speech. || 6 ||
The Gurmukhs serve their True Lord and Master, who comes to dwell in the mind. They
are forever attuned to the Love of the True One, who bestows His Mercy and unites
them with Himself. || 7 || He Himself does, and He Himself causes others to do; He
wakes some from their sleep. He Himself unites us in Union; Nanak is absorbed in the
Shabad. || 8 || 7 || 24 || SIREE RAAG, THIRD MEHL: Serving the True Guru, the
mind becomes immaculate, and the body becomes pure. The mind obtains bliss and
eternal peace, meeting with the Deep and Profound Lord. Sitting in the Sangat, the
True Congregation, the mind is comforted and consoled by the True Name. || 1 || O
mind, serve the True Guru without hesitation. Serving the True Guru, the Lord abides
within the mind, and no trace of filth shall attach itself to you. || 1 || Pause || From
the True Word of the Shabad comes honor. True is the Name of the True One. I am a
sacrifice to those who conquer their ego and recognize the Lord. The self-willed
manmukhs do not know the True One; they find no shelter, and no place of rest
anywhere. || 2 || Those who take the Truth as their food and the Truth as their
clothing, have their home in the True One. They constantly praise the True One, and in
the True Word of the Shabad they have their dwelling. They recognize the Lord, the
Supreme Soul in all, and through the Guru‟s Teachings they dwell in the home of their
own inner self. || 3 || They see the Truth, and they speak the Truth; their bodies and
minds are True. True are their teachings, and True are their instructions; True are the
reputations of the true ones. Those who have forgotten the True One are miserable—
they depart weeping and wailing. || 4 || Those who have not served the True Guru—
why did they even bother to come into the world? They are bound and gagged and
beaten at Death‟s door, but no one hears their shrieks and cries. 

They waste their lives uselessly; they die and are reincarnated over and over again. ||
5 || Seeing this world on fire, I rushed to the Sanctuary of the True Guru. The True
Guru has implanted the Truth within me; I dwell steadfastly in Truth and self-restraint.
The True Guru is the Boat of Truth; in the Word of the Shabad, we cross over the
terrifying world-ocean. || 6 || People continue wandering through the cycle of 8.4
million incarnations; without the True Guru, liberation is not obtained. Reading and
studying, the Pandits and the silent sages have grown weary, but attached to the love
of duality, they have lost their honor. The True Guru teaches the Word of the Shabad;
without the True One, there is no other at all. || 7 || Those who are linked by the
True One are linked to Truth. They always act in Truth. They attain their dwelling in the
home of their own inner being, and they abide in the Mansion of Truth. O Nanak, the
devotees are happy and peaceful forever. They are absorbed in the True Name. || 8 ||
17 || 8 || 25 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: When you are confronted with terrible
hardships, and no one offers you any support, when your friends turn into enemies, and
even your relatives have deserted you, and when all support has given way, and all
hope has been lost—if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, even the
hot wind shall not touch you. || 1 || Our Lord and Master is the Power of the
powerless. He does not come or go; He is Eternal and Permanent. Through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, He is known as True. || 1 || Pause || If you are weakened by
the pains of hunger and poverty, with no money in your pockets, and no one will give
you any comfort, and no one will satisfy your hopes and desires, and none of your
works is accomplished—if you then come to remember the Supreme Lord God, you shall
obtain the eternal kingdom. || 2 || When you are plagued by great and excessive
anxiety, and diseases of the body; when you are wrapped up in the attachments of
household and family, sometimes feeling joy, and then other times sorrow; when you
are wandering around in all four directions, and you cannot sit or sleep even for a
moment—if you come to remember the Supreme Lord God, then your body and mind
shall be cooled and soothed. || 3 || When you are under the power of sexual desire,
anger and worldly attachment, or a greedy miser in love with your wealth; if you have
committed the four great sins and other mistakes; even if you are a murderous fiend
who has never taken the time to listen to sacred books, hymns and poetry—if you then
come to remember the Supreme Lord God, and contemplate Him, even for a moment,
you shall be saved. || 4 || People may recite by heart the Shaastras, the Simritees
and the four Vedas; they may be ascetics, great, self-disciplined Yogis; they may visit
sacred shrines of pilgrimage and perform the six ceremonial rituals, over and over
again, performing worship services and ritual bathings. Even so, if they have not
embraced love for the Supreme Lord God, then they shall surely go to hell. || 5 || You
may possess empires, vast estates, authority over others, and the enjoyment of myriads
of pleasures; you may have delightful and beautiful gardens, and issue unquestioned
commands; you may have enjoyments and entertainments of all sorts and kinds, and
continue to enjoy exciting pleasures—and yet, if you do not come to remember the
Supreme Lord God, you shall be reincarnated as a snake. || 6 || You may possess
vast riches, maintain virtuous conduct, have a spotless reputation and observe religious
customs; you may have the loving affections of mother, father, children, siblings and
friends; you may have armies well-equipped with weapons, and all may salute you with
respect; 

But still, if you do not come to remember the Supreme Lord God, then you shall be
taken and consigned to the most hideous hell! || 7 || You may have a body free of
disease and deformity, and have no worries or grief at all; you may be unmindful of
death, and night and day revel in pleasures; you may take everything as your own, and
have no fear in your mind at all; but still, if you do not come to remember the Supreme
Lord God, you shall fall under the power of the Messenger of Death. || 8 || The
Supreme Lord showers His Mercy, and we find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. The more time we spend there, the more we come to love the Lord. The Lord is
the Master of both worlds; there is no other place of rest. When the True Guru is
pleased and satisfied, O Nanak, the True Name is obtained. || 9 || 1 || 26 || SIREE
RAAG, FIFTH MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE: I do not know what pleases my Lord. O mind,
seek out the way! || 1 || Pause || The meditatives practice meditation, and the wise
practice spiritual wisdom, but how rare are those who know God! || 1 || The
worshipper of Bhagaauti practices self-discipline, the Yogi speaks of liberation, and the
ascetic is absorbed in asceticism. || 2 || The men of silence observe silence, the
Sanyaasees observe celibacy, and the Udaasees abide in detachment. || 3 || There
are nine forms of devotional worship. The Pandits recite the Vedas. The householders
assert their faith in family life. || 4 || Those who utter only One Word, those who take
many forms, the naked renunciates, the wearers of patched coats, the magicians, those
who remain always awake, and those who bathe at holy places of pilgrimage— || 5 ||
Those who go without food, those who never touch others, the hermits who never
show themselves, and those who are wise in their own minds— || 6 || Of these, no
one admits to any deficiency; all say that they have found the Lord. But he alone is a
devotee, whom the Lord has united with Himself. || 7 || Abandoning all devices and
contrivances, I have sought His Sanctuary. Nanak has fallen at the Feet of the Guru. ||
8 || 2 || 27 ||

SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:


Among Yogis, You are the Yogi; among pleasure seekers, You are the Pleasure Seeker.
Your limits are not known to any of the beings in the heavens, in this world, or in the
nether regions of the underworld. || 1 || I am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to Your
Name. || 1 || Pause || You created the world, and assigned tasks to one and all.
You watch over Your Creation, and through Your All-powerful Creative Potency, You
cast the dice. || 2 || You are manifest in the Expanse of Your Workshop. Everyone
longs for Your Name, but without the Guru, no one finds You. All are enticed and
trapped by Maya. || 3 || I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. Meeting Him, the supreme
status is obtained. 

The angelic beings and the silent sages long for Him; the True Guru has given me this
understanding. || 4 || How is the Society of the Saints to be known? There, the Name
of the One Lord is chanted. The One Name is the Lord‟s Command; O Nanak, the True
Guru has given me this understanding. || 5 || This world has been deluded by doubt.
You Yourself, Lord, have led it astray. The discarded soul-brides suffer in terrible agony;
they have no luck at all. || 6 || What are the signs of the discarded brides? They miss
their Husband Lord, and they wander around in dishonor. The clothes of those brides
are filthy—they pass their life-night in agony. || 7 || What actions have the happy
soul-brides performed? They have obtained the fruit of their pre-ordained destiny.
Casting His Glance of Grace, the Lord unites them with Himself. || 8 || Those, whom
God causes to abide by His Will, have the Shabad of His Word abiding deep within.
They are the true soul-brides, who embrace love for their Husband Lord. || 9 || Those
who take pleasure in God‟s Will remove doubt from within. O Nanak, know Him as the
True Guru, who unites all with the Lord. || 10 || Meeting with the True Guru, they
receive the fruits of their destiny, and egotism is driven out from within. The pain of
evil-mindedness is eliminated; good fortune comes and shines radiantly from their
foreheads. || 11 || The Bani of Your Word is Ambrosial Nectar. It permeates the
hearts of Your devotees. Serving You, peace is obtained; granting Your Mercy, You
bestow salvation. || 12 || Meeting with the True Guru, one comes to know; by this
meeting, one comes to chant the Name. Without the True Guru, God is not found; all
have grown weary of performing religious rituals. || 13 || I am a sacrifice to the True
Guru; I was wandering in doubt, and He has set me on the right path. If the Lord casts
His Glance of Grace, He unites us with Himself. || 14 || You, Lord, are pervading in
all, and yet, the Creator keeps Himself concealed. O Nanak, the Creator is revealed to
the Gurmukh, within whom He has infused His Light. || 15 || The Master Himself
bestows honor. He creates and bestows body and soul. He Himself preserves the honor
of His servants; He places both His Hands upon their foreheads. || 16 || All strict
rituals are just clever contrivances. My God knows everything. He has made His Glory
manifest, and all people celebrate Him. || 17 || He has not considered my merits and
demerits; this is God‟s Own Nature. Hugging me close in His Embrace, He protects me,
and now, even the hot wind does not touch me. || 18 || Within my mind and body, I
meditate on God. I have obtained the fruits of my soul‟s desire. You are the Supreme
Lord and Master, above the heads of kings. 

Nanak lives by chanting Your Name. || 19 || You Yourself created the Universe; You
created the play of duality, and staged it. The Truest of the True is pervading
everywhere; He instructs those with whom He is pleased. || 20 || By Guru‟s Grace, I
have found God. By His Grace, I have shed emotional attachment to Maya. Showering
His Mercy, He has blended me into Himself. || 21 || You are the Gopis, the milkmaids of Krishna; You are the sacred river Jamunaa; You are Krishna, the herdsman.
You Yourself support the world. By Your Command, human beings are fashioned. You
Yourself embellish them, and then again destroy them. || 22 || Those who have
focused their consciousness on the True Guru have rid themselves of the love of
duality. The light of those mortal beings is immaculate. They depart after redeeming
their lives. || 23 || Forever and ever, night and day, I praise the Greatness of Your
Goodness. You bestow Your Gifts, even if we do not ask for them. Says Nanak,
contemplate the True Lord. || 24 || 1 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: I fall at His Feet
to please and appease Him. The True Guru has united me with the Lord, the Primal
Being. There is no other as great as He. || 1 || Pause || The Lord of the Universe is
my Sweet Beloved. He is sweeter than my mother or father. Among all sisters and
brothers and friends, there is no one like You. || 1 || By Your Command, the month
of Saawan has come. I have hooked up the plow of Truth, and I plant the seed of the
Name in hopes that the Lord, in His Generosity, will bestow a bountiful harvest. || 2 ||
Meeting with the Guru, I recognize only the One Lord. In my consciousness, I do not
know of any other account. The Lord has assigned one task to me; as it pleases Him, I
perform it. || 3 || Enjoy yourselves and eat, O Siblings of Destiny. In the Guru‟s
Court, He has blessed me with the Robe of Honor. I have become the Master of my
body-village; I have taken the five rivals as prisoners. || 4 || I have come to Your
Sanctuary. The five farm-hands have become my tenants; none dare to raise their
heads against me. O Nanak, my village is populous and prosperous. || 5 || I am a
sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. I meditate on You continually. The village was in ruins, but
You have re-populated it. I am a sacrifice to You. || 6 || O Beloved Lord, I meditate
on You continually; I obtain the fruits of my mind‟s desires. All my affairs are arranged,
and the hunger of my mind is appeased. || 7 || I have forsaken all my
entanglements; I serve the True Lord of the Universe. I have firmly attached the Name,
the Home of the Nine Treasures to my robe. || 8 || I have obtained the comfort of
comforts. The Guru has implanted the Word of the Shabad deep within me. The True
Guru has shown me my Husband Lord; He has placed His Hand upon my forehead. || 9
|| I have established the Temple of Truth. I sought out the Guru‟s Sikhs, and brought
them into it. I wash their feet, and wave the fan over them. 

Bowing low, I fall at their feet. || 10 || I heard of the Guru, and so I went to Him. He
instilled within me the Naam, the goodness of charity and true cleansing. All the world
is liberated, O Nanak, by embarking upon the Boat of Truth. || 11 || The whole
Universe serves You, day and night. Please hear my prayer, O Dear Lord. I have
thoroughly tested and seen all—You alone, by Your Pleasure, can save us. || 12 ||
Now, the Merciful Lord has issued His Command. Let no one chase after and attack
anyone else. Let all abide in peace, under this Benevolent Rule. || 13 || Softly and
gently, drop by drop, the Ambrosial Nectar trickles down. I speak as my Lord and
Master causes me to speak. I place all my faith in You; please accept me. || 14 ||
Your devotees are forever hungry for You. O Lord, please fulfill my desires. Grant me
the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Giver of Peace. Please, take me into Your
Embrace. || 15 || I have not found any other as Great as You. You pervade the
continents, the worlds and the nether regions; You are permeating all places and
interspaces. Nanak: You are the True Support of Your devotees. || 16 || I am a
wrestler; I belong to the Lord of the World. I met with the Guru, and I have tied a tall,
plumed turban. All have gathered to watch the wrestling match, and the Merciful Lord
Himself is seated to behold it. || 17 || The bugles play and the drums beat. The
wrestlers enter the arena and circle around. I have thrown the five challengers to the
ground, and the Guru has patted me on the back. || 18 || All have gathered together,
but we shall return home by different routes. The Gurmukhs reap their profits and
leave, while the self-willed manmukhs lose their investment and depart. || 19 || You
are without color or mark. The Lord is seen to be manifest and present. Hearing of Your
Glories again and again, Your devotees meditate on You; they are attuned to You, O
Lord, Treasure of Excellence. || 20 || Through age after age, I am the servant of the
Merciful Lord. The Guru has cut away my bonds. I shall not have to dance in the
wrestling arena of life again. Nanak has searched, and found this opportunity. || 21 ||

SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL, PEHRAY, FIRST HOUSE:
In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend, you were cast into the womb, by
the Lord‟s Command. Upside-down, within the womb, you performed penance, O my
merchant friend, and you prayed to your Lord and Master. You uttered prayers to your
Lord and Master, while upside-down, and you meditated on Him with deep love and
affection. You came into this Dark Age of Kali Yuga naked, and you shall depart again
naked. As God‟s Pen has written on your forehead, so it shall be with your soul. 

Says Nanak, in the first watch of the night, by the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, you
enter into the womb. || 1 || In the second watch of the night, O my merchant friend,
you have forgotten to meditate. From hand to hand, you are passed around, O my
merchant friend, like Krishna in the house of Yashoda. From hand to hand, you are
passed around, and your mother says, “This is my son.” O, my thoughtless and foolish
mind, think: In the end, nothing shall be yours. You do not know the One who created
the creation. Gather spiritual wisdom within your mind. Says Nanak, in the second
watch of the night, you have forgotten to meditate. || 2 || In the third watch of the
night, O my merchant friend, your consciousness is focused on wealth and youth. You
have not remembered the Name of the Lord, O my merchant friend, although it would
release you from bondage. You do not remember the Name of the Lord, and you
become confused by Maya. Revelling in your riches and intoxicated with youth, you
waste your life uselessly. You have not traded in righteousness and Dharma; you have
not made good deeds your friends. Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night, your
mind is attached to wealth and youth. || 3 || In the fourth watch of the night, O my
merchant friend, the Grim Reaper comes to the field. When the Messenger of Death
seizes and dispatches you, O my merchant friend, no one knows the mystery of where
you have gone. So think of the Lord! No one knows this secret, of when the Messenger
of Death will seize you and take you away. All your weeping and wailing then is false. In
an instant, you become a stranger. You obtain exactly what you have longed for. Says
Nanak, in the fourth watch of the night, O mortal, the Grim Reaper has harvested your
field. || 4 || 1 || SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: In the first watch of the night, O my
merchant friend, your innocent mind has a child-like understanding. You drink milk, and
you are fondled so gently, O my merchant friend. The mother and father love their child
so much, but in Maya, all are caught in emotional attachment. By the good fortune of
good deeds done in the past, you have come, and now you perform actions to
determine your future. Without the Lord‟s Name, liberation is not obtained, and you are
drowned in the love of duality. Says Nanak, in the first watch of the night, O mortal,
you shall be saved by remembering the Lord. || 1 || In the second watch of the night,
O my merchant friend, you are intoxicated with the wine of youth and beauty. Day and
night, you are engrossed in sexual desire, O my merchant friend, and your
consciousness is blind to the Naam. The Lord‟s Name is not within your heart, but all
sorts of other tastes seem sweet to you. You have no wisdom at all, no meditation, no
virtue or self-discipline; in falsehood, you are caught in the cycle of birth and death.
Pilgrimages, fasts, purification and self-discipline are of no use, nor are rituals, religious
ceremonies or empty worship. O Nanak, emancipation comes only by loving devotional
worship; through duality, people are engrossed in duality. || 2 || In the third watch of
the night, O my merchant friend, the swans, the white hairs, come and land upon the
pool of the head. 

Youth wears itself out, and old age triumphs, O my merchant friend; as time passes,
your days diminish. At the last moment, you repent—you are so blind!—when the
Messenger of Death seizes you and carries you away. You kept all your things for
yourself, but in an instant, they are all lost. Your intellect left you, your wisdom
departed, and now you repent for the evil deeds you committed. Says Nanak, O mortal,
in the third watch of the night, let your consciousness be lovingly focused on God. || 3
|| In the fourth watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your body grows old and
weak. Your eyes go blind, and cannot see, O my merchant friend, and your ears do not
hear any words. Your eyes go blind, and your tongue is unable to taste; you live only
with the help of others. With no virtue within, how can you find peace? The self-willed
manmukh comes and goes in reincarnation. When the crop of life has matured, it
bends, breaks and perishes; why take pride in that which comes and goes? Says Nanak,
O mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, the Gurmukh recognizes the Word of the
Shabad. || 4 || Your breath comes to its end, O my merchant friend, and your
shoulders are weighed down by the tyrant of old age. Not one iota of virtue came into
you, O my merchant friend; bound and gagged by evil, you are driven along. One who
departs with virtue and self-discipline is not struck down, and is not consigned to the
cycle of birth and death. The Messenger of Death and his trap cannot touch him;
through loving devotional worship, he crosses over the ocean of fear. He departs with
honor, and merges in intuitive peace and poise; all his pains depart. Says Nanak, when
the mortal becomes Gurmukh, he is saved and honored by the True Lord. || 5 || 2 ||
SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL: In the first watch of the night, O my merchant friend,
the Lord places you in the womb. You meditate on the Lord, and chant the Lord‟s
Name, O my merchant friend. You contemplate the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and meditating on it within the fire of the
womb, your life is sustained by dwelling on the Naam. You are born and you come out,
and your mother and father are delighted to see your face. Remember the One, O
mortal, to whom the child belongs. As Gurmukh, reflect upon Him within your heart.
Says Nanak, O mortal, in the first watch of the night, dwell upon the Lord, who shall
shower you with His Grace. || 1 || In the second watch of the night, O my merchant
friend, the mind is attached to the love of duality. Mother and father hug you close in
their embrace, claiming, “He is mine, he is mine”; so is the child brought up, O my
merchant friend. Your mother and father constantly hug you close in their embrace; in
their minds, they believe that you will provide for them and support them. The fool
does not know the One who gives; instead, he clings to the gift. Rare is the Gurmukh
who reflects upon, meditates upon, and within his mind, is lovingly attached to the
Lord. Says Nanak, in the second watch of the night, O mortal, death never devours you.
|| 2 || In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, your mind is entangled
in worldly and household affairs. You think of wealth, and gather wealth, O my
merchant friend, but you do not contemplate the Lord or the Lord‟s Name. 


You never dwell upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, who will be your only Helper and
Support in the end. This wealth, property and Maya are false. In the end, you must
leave these, and depart in sorrow. Those whom the Lord, in His Mercy, unites with the
Guru, reflect upon the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Says Nanak, in the third watch of
the night, O mortal, they go, and are united with the Lord. || 3 || In the fourth watch
of the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord announces the time of departure. Serve
the Perfect True Guru, O my merchant friend; your entire life-night is passing away.
Serve the Lord each and every instant—do not delay! You shall become eternal
throughout the ages. Enjoy ecstasy forever with the Lord, and do away with the pains
of birth and death. Know that there is no difference between the Guru, the True Guru,
and your Lord and Master. Meeting with Him, take pleasure in the Lord‟s devotional
service. Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch of the night, the life-night of the
devotee is fruitful. || 4 || 1 || 3 || SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL: In the first watch of
the night, O my merchant friend, the Lord placed your soul in the womb. In the tenth
month, you were made into a human being, O my merchant friend, and you were given
your allotted time to perform good deeds. You were given this time to perform good
deeds, according to your pre-ordained destiny. God placed you with your mother,
father, brothers, sons and wife. God Himself is the Cause of causes, good and bad—no
one has control over these things. Says Nanak, O mortal, in the first watch of the night,
the soul is placed in the womb. || 1 || In the second watch of the night, O my
merchant friend, the fullness of youth rises in you like waves. You do not distinguish
between good and evil, O my merchant friend—your mind is intoxicated with ego.
Mortal beings do not distinguish between good and evil, and the road ahead is
treacherous. They never serve the Perfect True Guru, and the cruel tyrant Death stands
over their heads. When the Righteous Judge seizes you and interrogates you, O
madman, what answer will you give him then? Says Nanak, in the second watch of the
night, O mortal, the fullness of youth tosses you about like waves in the storm. || 2 ||
In the third watch of the night, O my merchant friend, the blind and ignorant person
gathers poison. He is entangled in emotional attachment to his wife and sons, O my
merchant friend, and deep within him, the waves of greed are rising up. The waves of
greed are rising up within him, and he does not remember God. He does not join the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and he suffers in terrible pain through
countless incarnations. He has forgotten the Creator, his Lord and Master, and he does
not meditate on Him, even for an instant. Says Nanak, in the third watch of the night,
the blind and ignorant person gathers poison. || 3 || In the fourth watch of the night,
O my merchant friend, that day is drawing near. As Gurmukh, remember the Naam, O
my merchant friend. It shall be your Friend in the Court of the Lord. As Gurmukh,
remember the Naam, O mortal; in the end, it shall be your only companion. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 78 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
This emotional attachment to Maya shall not go with you; it is false to fall in love with it.
The entire night of your life has passed away in darkness; but by serving the True
Guru, the Divine Light shall dawn within. Says Nanak, O mortal, in the fourth watch of
the night, that day is drawing near! || 4 || Receiving the summons from the Lord of
the Universe, O my merchant friend, you must arise and depart with the actions you
have committed. You are not allowed a moment‟s delay, O my merchant friend; the
Messenger of Death seizes you with firm hands. Receiving the summons, people are
seized and dispatched. The self-willed manmukhs are miserable forever. But those who
serve the Perfect True Guru are forever happy in the Court of the Lord. The body is the
field of karma in this age; whatever you plant, you shall harvest. Says Nanak, the
devotees look beautiful in the Court of the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs wander
forever in reincarnation. || 5 || 1 || 4 ||

SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, CHHANT:

How can the ignorant soul-bride obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, while
she is in this world of her father‟s home? When the Lord Himself grants His Grace, the
Gurmukh learns the duties of her Husband‟s Celestial Home. The Gurmukh learns the
duties of her Husband‟s Celestial Home; she meditates forever on the Lord, Har, Har.
She walks happily among her companions, and in the Lord‟s Court, she swings her arms
joyfully. Her account is cleared by the Righteous Judge of Dharma, when she chants the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The ignorant soul-bride becomes Gurmukh, and gains the
Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, while she is still in her father‟s house. || 1 || My
marriage has been performed, O my father. As Gurmukh, I have found the Lord. The
darkness of ignorance has been dispelled. The Guru has revealed the blazing light of
spiritual wisdom. This spiritual wisdom given by the Guru shines forth, and the darkness
has been dispelled. I have found the Priceless Jewel of the Lord. The sickness of my
ego has been dispelled, and my pain is over and done. Through the Guru‟s Teachings,
my identity has consumed my identical identity. I have obtained my Husband Lord, the
Akaal Moorat, the Undying Form. He is Imperishable; He shall never die, and He shall
never ever leave. My marriage has been performed, O my father. As Gurmukh, I have
found the Lord. || 2 || The Lord is the Truest of the True, O my father. Meeting with
the humble servants of the Lord, the marriage procession looks beautiful. She who
chants the Lord‟s Name is happy in this world of her father‟s home, and in the next
world of her Husband Lord, she shall be very beautiful. In her Husband Lord‟s Celestial
Home, she shall be most beautiful, if she has remembered the Naam in this world.
Fruitful are the lives of those who, as Gurmukh, have conquered their minds—they have
won the game of life. Joining with the humble Saints of the Lord, my actions bring
prosperity, and I have obtained the Lord of Bliss as my Husband. The Lord is the Truest
of the True, O my father. Joining with the humble servants of the Lord, the marriage
party has been embellished. || 3 || O my father, give me the Name of the Lord God
as my wedding gift and dowry. 

Give me the Lord as my wedding gown, and the Lord as my glory, to accomplish my
works. Through devotional worship to the Lord, this ceremony is made blissful and
beautiful; the Guru, the True Guru, has given this gift. Across the continents, and
throughout the Universe, the Lord‟s Glory is pervading. This gift is not diminished by
being diffused among all. Any other dowry, which the self-willed manmukhs offer for
show, is only false egotism and a worthless display. O my father, please give me the
Name of the Lord God as my wedding gift and dowry. || 4 || The Lord, Raam, Raam,
is All-pervading, O my father. Meeting her Husband Lord, the soul-bride blossoms forth
like the flourishing vine. In age after age, through all the ages, forever and ever, those
who belong to the Guru‟s Family shall prosper and increase. Age after age, the Family
of the True Guru shall increase. As Gurmukh, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of
the Lord. The Almighty Lord never dies or goes away. Whatever He gives, keeps on
increasing. O Nanak, the One Lord is the Saint of Saints. Chanting the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har, the soul-bride is bountiful and beautiful. The Lord, Raam, Raam, is Allpervading, O my father. Meeting her Husband Lord, the soul-bride blossoms forth like
the flourishing vine. || 5 || 1 ||
SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT:

O dear beloved mind, my friend, reflect upon the Name of the Lord of the Universe. O dear
beloved mind, my friend, the Lord shall always be with you. The Name of the Lord shall be
with you as your Helper and Support. Meditate on Him—no one who does so shall ever
return empty-handed. You shall obtain the fruits of your mind‟s desires, by focusing your
consciousness on the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. He is totally pervading the water and the land; He
is the Lord of the World-forest. Behold Him in exaltation in each and every heart. Nanak
gives this advice: O beloved mind, in the Company of the Holy, burn away your doubts. ||
1 || O dear beloved mind, my friend, without the Lord, all outward show is false. O dear
beloved mind, my friend, the world is an ocean of poison. Let the Lord‟s Lotus Feet be your
Boat, so that pain and skepticism shall not touch you. Meeting with the Perfect Guru, by
great good fortune, meditate on God twenty-four hours a day. From the very beginning,
and throughout the ages, He is the Lord and Master of His servants. His Name is the
Support of His devotees. Nanak gives this advice: O beloved mind, without the Lord, all
outward show is false. || 2 || O dear beloved mind, my friend, load the profitable cargo
of the Lord‟s Name. O dear beloved mind, my friend, enter through the eternal Door of the
Lord. One who serves at the Door of the Imperceptible and Unfathomable Lord, obtains
this eternal position. There is no birth or death there, no coming or going; anguish and
anxiety are ended. The accounts of Chitr and Gupt, the recording scribes of the conscious
and the subconscious are torn up, and the Messenger of Death cannot do anything. Nanak
gives this advice: O beloved mind, load the profitable cargo of the Lord‟s Name. || 3 || O
dear beloved mind, my friend, abide in the Society of the Saints. O dear beloved mind, my
friend, chanting the Lord‟s Name, the Divine Light shines within. 

Remember your Lord and Master, who is easily obtained, and all desires shall be
fulfilled. By my past actions, I have found the Lord, the Greatest Lover. Separated from
Him for so long, I am united with Him again. Inside and out, He is pervading
everywhere. Faith in Him has welled up within my mind. Nanak gives this advice: O
beloved mind, let the Society of the Saints be your dwelling. || 4 || O dear beloved
mind, my friend, let your mind remain absorbed in loving devotion to the Lord. O dear
beloved mind, my friend, the fish of the mind lives only when it is immersed in the
Water of the Lord. Drinking in the Lord‟s Ambrosial Bani, the mind is satisfied, and all
pleasures come to abide within. Attaining the Lord of Excellence, I sing the Songs of
Joy. The True Guru, becoming merciful, has fulfilled my desires. He has attached me to
the hem of His robe, and I have obtained the nine treasures. My Lord and Master has
bestowed His Name, which is everything to me. Nanak instructs the Saints to teach,
that the mind is imbued with loving devotion to the Lord. || 5 || 1 || 2 ||
CHHANTS OF SIREE RAAG, FIFTH MEHL:

DAKHANAA: My Beloved Husband Lord is deep within my heart. How can I see Him? In
the Sanctuary of the Saints, O Nanak, the Support of the breath of life is found. || 1 ||
CHHANT: To love the Lotus Feet of the Lord—this way of life has come into the minds
of His Saints. The love of duality, this evil practice, this bad habit, is not liked by the
Lord‟s slaves. It is not pleasing to the Lord‟s slaves; without the Blessed Vision of the
Lord‟s Darshan, how can they find peace, even for a moment? Without the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, the body and mind are empty; like fish out of water, they die. Please
meet with me, O my Beloved—You are the Support of my breath of life. Joining the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing Your Glorious Praises. O Lord and
Master of Nanak, please grant Your Grace, and permeate my body, mind and being. ||
1 || DAKHANAA: He is Beautiful in all places; I do not see any other at all. Meeting
with the True Guru, O Nanak, the doors are opened wide. || 1 || CHHANT: Your
Word is Incomparable and Infinite. I contemplate the Word of Your Bani, the Support of
the Saints. I remember Him in meditation with every breath and morsel of food, with
perfect faith. How could I forget Him from my mind? How could I forget Him from my
mind, even for an instant? He is the Most Worthy; He is my very life! My Lord and
Master is the Giver of the fruits of the mind‟s desires. He knows all the useless vanities
and pains of the soul. Meditating on the Patron of lost souls, the Companion of all, your
life shall not be lost in the gamble. Nanak offers this prayer to God: Please shower me
with Your Mercy, and carry me across the terrifying world-ocean. || 2 || DAKHANAA:
People bathe in the dust of the feet of the Saints, when the Lord becomes merciful. I
have obtained all things, O Nanak; the Lord is my Wealth and Property. || 1 ||
CHHANT: My Lord and Master‟s Home is beautiful. It is the resting place of His
devotees, who live in hopes of attaining it. 

Their minds and bodies are absorbed in meditation on the Name of God; they drink in
the Lord‟s Ambrosial Nectar. They drink in the Lord‟s Ambrosial Nectar, and become
eternally stable. They know that the water of corruption is insipid and tasteless. When
my God, the Lord of the Universe became merciful, I came to look upon the Saadh
Sangat as the treasure. All pleasures and supreme ecstasy, O my Beloved, come to
those who sew the Jewel of the Lord into their minds. They do not forget, even for an
instant, the Support of the breath of life. They live by constantly meditating on Him, O
Nanak. || 3 || DAKHANAA: O Lord, You meet and merge with those whom you have
made Your Own. You Yourself are entranced, O Nanak, hearing Your Own Praises. || 1
|| CHHANT: Administering the intoxicating drug of love, I have won over the Lord of
the Universe; I have fascinated His Mind. By the Grace of the Saints, I am held in the
loving embrace of the Unfathomable Lord, and I am entranced. Held in the Lord‟s loving
embrace, I look beautiful, and all my pains have been dispelled. By the loving worship
of His devotees, the Lord has come under their power. All pleasures have come to dwell
in the mind; the Lord of the Universe is pleased and appeased. Birth and death have
been totally eliminated. O my companions, sing the Songs of Joy. My desires have been
fulfilled, and I shall never again be trapped or shaken by Maya. Taking hold of my hand,
O Nanak, my Beloved God will not let me be swallowed up by the world-ocean. || 4 ||
DAKHANAA: The Master‟s Name is Priceless; no one knows its value. Those who have
good destiny recorded upon their foreheads, O Nanak, enjoy the Love of the Lord. || 1
|| CHHANT: Those who chant are sanctified. All those who listen are blessed, and
those who write save their ancestors. Those who join the Saadh Sangat are imbued
with the Lord‟s Love; they reflect and meditate on God. Contemplating God, their lives
are reformed and redeemed; God has showered His Perfect Mercy upon them. Taking
them by the hand, the Lord has blessed them with His Praises. They no longer have to
wander in reincarnation, and they never have to die. Through the Kind and
Compassionate True Guru, I have met the Lord; I have conquered sexual desire, anger
and greed. Our Indescribable Lord and Master cannot be described. Nanak is devoted,
forever a sacrifice to Him. || 5 || 1 || 3 ||






SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL, VANAJAARAA ~ THE MERCHANT:

The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Excellent and Sublime. He created everyone. The
Lord cherishes all beings. He permeates each and every heart. Meditate forever on that
Lord. Without Him, there is no other at all. Those who focus their consciousness on
emotional attachment to Maya must leave; they depart crying out in despair. Servant
Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, his only Companion in the end.
|| 1 || I have none other than You, O Lord. In the Guru‟s Sanctuary, the Lord is found,
O my merchant friend; by great good fortune, He is obtained. || 1 || Pause || 

Without the humble Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, no one has obtained the Lord‟s Name.
Those who do their deeds in ego are like the prostitute‟s son, who has no name. The
father‟s status is obtained only if the Guru is pleased and bestows His Favor. By great
good fortune, the Guru is found; embrace love for the Lord, day and night. Servant
Nanak has realized God; he sings the Lord‟s Praises through the actions he does. || 2
|| In my mind there is such a deep yearning for the Lord, Har, Har. The Perfect Guru
has implanted the Naam within me; I have found the Lord through the Lord God‟s
Name. || 1 || Pause || As long as there is youth and health, meditate on the Naam.
Along the way, the Lord shall go along with you, and in the end, He shall save you. I
am a sacrifice to those, within whose minds the Lord has come to dwell. Those who
have not remembered the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, shall leave with regret in the
end. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their foreheads, O
servant Nanak, meditate on the Naam. || 3 || O my mind, embrace love for the Lord,
Har, Har. By great good fortune, the Guru is found; through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, we are carried across to the other side. || 1 || Pause || The Lord Himself
creates, He Himself gives and takes away. The Lord Himself leads us astray in doubt;
the Lord Himself imparts understanding. The minds of the Gurmukhs are illuminated
and enlightened; they are so very rare. I am a sacrifice to those who find the Lord,
through the Guru‟s Teachings. Servant Nanak‟s heart-lotus has blossomed forth, and
the Lord, Har, Har, has come to dwell in the mind. || 4 || O mind, chant the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har. Hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Guru, O my soul; all the
painful residues of your past mistakes shall be taken away. || 1 || Pause || The Allpervading Lord dwells within each and every person‟s heart—how can He be obtained?
By meeting the Perfect Guru, the True Guru, the Lord comes to dwell within the
conscious mind. The Naam is my Support and Sustenance. From the Lord‟s Name, I
obtain salvation and understanding. My faith is in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The
Lord‟s Name is my status and honor. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name
of the Lord; He is dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord‟s Love. || 5 || Meditate
on the Lord, the True Lord God. Through the Guru‟s Word, you shall come to know the
Lord God. From the Lord God, everything was created. || 1 || Pause || Those who
have such pre-ordained destiny, come to the Guru and meet Him. They love to serve, O
my merchant friend, and through the Guru, they are illuminated by the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. Blessed, blessed is the trade of those traders who have loaded the
merchandise of the Wealth of the Lord. The faces of the Gurmukhs are radiant in the
Court of the Lord; they come to the Lord and merge with Him. O servant Nanak, they
alone find the Guru, with whom the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence, is pleased. || 6 ||
Meditate on the Lord, with every breath and morsel of food. The Gurmukhs embrace
the Love of the Lord in their minds; they are continually occupied with the Lord‟s Name.

VAAR OF SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL, WITH SHALOKS:
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Among the ragas, Siree Raag is the best, if it inspires you to
enshrine love for the True Lord. The True Lord comes to abide forever in the mind, and
your understanding becomes steady and unequalled. The priceless jewel is obtained, by
contemplating the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The tongue becomes true, the mind
becomes true, and the body becomes true as well. O Nanak, forever true are the
dealings of those who serve the True Guru. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: All other loves are
transitory, as long as people do not love their Lord and Master. This mind is enticed by
Maya—it cannot see or hear. Without seeing her Husband Lord, love does not well up;
what can the blind person do? O Nanak, the True One who takes away the eyes of
spiritual wisdom—He alone can restore them. || 2 || PAUREE: The Lord alone is the
One Creator; there is only the One Court of the Lord. The One Lord‟s Command is the
One and Only—enshrine the One Lord in your consciousness. Without that Lord, there
is no other at all. Remove your fear, doubt and dread. Praise that Lord who protects
you, inside your home, and outside as well. When that Lord becomes merciful, and one
comes to chant the Lord‟s Name, one swims across the ocean of fear. || 1 || SHALOK,
FIRST MEHL: The gifts belong to our Lord and Master; how can we compete with Him?
Some remain awake and aware, and do not receive these gifts, while others are
awakened from their sleep to be blessed. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Faith, contentment
and tolerance are the food and provisions of the angels. They obtain the Perfect Vision
of the Lord, while those who gossip find no place of rest. || 2 || PAUREE: You
Yourself created all; You Yourself delegate the tasks. You Yourself are pleased,
beholding Your Own Glorious Greatness. O Lord, there is nothing at all beyond You. You
are the True Lord. You Yourself are contained in all places. Meditate on that Lord, O
Saints; He shall rescue and save you. || 2 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Pride in social
status is empty; pride in personal glory is useless. The One Lord gives shade to all
beings. You may call yourself good; O Nanak, this will only be known when your honor
is approved in God‟s Account. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: Die before the one whom you
love; to live after he dies is to live a worthless life in this world. || 2 || PAUREE: You
Yourself created the earth, and the two lamps of the sun and the moon. You created
the fourteen world-shops, in which Your Business is transacted. The Lord bestows His
Profits on those who become Gurmukh. The Messenger of Death does not touch those
who drink in the True Ambrosial Nectar. They themselves are saved, along with their
family, and all those who follow them are saved as well. || 3 || SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: He created the Creative Power of the Universe, within which He dwells. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 84 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
One who reflects upon his allotted span of life, becomes the slave of God. The value of
the Creative Power of the Universe cannot be known. Even if its value were known, it
could not be described. Some think about religious rituals and regulations, but without
understanding, how can they cross over to the other side? Let sincere faith be your
bowing in prayer, and let the conquest of your mind be your objective in life. Wherever
I look, there I see God‟s Presence. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The Society of the Guru is
not obtained like this, by trying to be near or far away. O Nanak, you shall meet the
True Guru, if your mind remains in His Presence. || 2 || PAUREE: The seven islands,
seven seas, nine continents, four Vedas and eighteen Puraanas—O Lord, You pervade
and permeate all. Lord, everyone loves You. All beings and creatures meditate on You,
Lord. You hold the earth in Your Hands. I am a sacrifice to those Gurmukhs who
worship and adore the Lord. You Yourself are All-pervading; You stage this wondrous
drama! || 4 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Why ask for a pen, and why ask for ink?
Write within your heart. Remain immersed forever in the Love of your Lord and Master,
and your love for Him shall never break. Pen and ink shall pass away, along with what
has been written. O Nanak, the Love of your Husband Lord shall never perish. The True
Lord has bestowed it, as it was pre-ordained. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: That which is
seen, shall not go along with you. What does it take to make you see this? The True
Guru has implanted the True Name within; remain lovingly absorbed in the True One. O
Nanak, the Word of His Shabad is True. By His Grace, it is obtained. || 2 || PAUREE:
O Lord, You are inside and outside as well. You are the Knower of secrets. Whatever
anyone does, the Lord knows. O my mind, think of the Lord. The one who commits sins
lives in fear, while the one who lives righteously rejoices. O Lord, You Yourself are True,
and True is Your Justice. Why should anyone be afraid? O Nanak, those who recognize
the True Lord are blended with the True One. || 5 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Burn
the pen, and burn the ink; burn the paper as well. Burn the writer who writes in the
love of duality. O Nanak, people do what is pre-ordained; they cannot do anything else.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: False is other reading, and false is other speaking, in the love of
Maya. O Nanak, without the Name, nothing is permanent; those who read and read are
ruined. || 2 || PAUREE: Great is the Greatness of the Lord, and the Kirtan of the
Lord‟s Praises. Great is the Greatness of the Lord; His Justice is totally Righteous. Great
is the Greatness of the Lord; people receive the fruits of the soul. Great is the
Greatness of the Lord; He does not hear the words of the back-biters. Great is the
Greatness of the Lord; He gives His Gifts without being asked. || 6 || SHALOK,
THIRD MEHL: Those who act in ego shall all die. Their worldly possessions shall not go
along with them. Because of their love of duality, they suffer in pain. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 85 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Messenger of Death is watching all. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved, by
contemplating the True Name. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: We are good at talking, but our
actions are bad. Mentally, we are impure and black, but outwardly, we appear white.
We imitate those who stand and serve at the Lord‟s Door. They are attuned to the Love
of their Husband Lord, and they experience the pleasure of His Love. They remain
powerless, even while they have power; they remain humble and meek. O Nanak, our
lives become profitable if we associate with them. || 2 || PAUREE: You Yourself are
the water, You Yourself are the fish, and You Yourself are the net. You Yourself cast the
net, and You Yourself are the bait. You Yourself are the lotus, unaffected and still
brightly-colored in hundreds of feet of water. You Yourself liberate those who think of
You for even an instant. O Lord, nothing is beyond You. I am delighted to behold You,
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 7 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: One who
does not know the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command cries out in terrible pain. She is filled
with deception, and she cannot sleep in peace. But if the soul-bride follows the Will of
her Lord and Master, she shall be honored in her own home, and called to the Mansion
of His Presence. O Nanak, by His Mercy, this understanding is obtained. By Guru‟s
Grace, she is absorbed into the True One. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O self-willed
manmukh, devoid of the Naam, do not be misled upon beholding the color of the
safflower. Its color lasts for only a few days—it is worthless! Attached to duality, the
foolish, blind and stupid people waste away and die. Like worms, they live in manure,
and in it, they die over and over again. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam
are dyed in the color of truth; they take on the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru.
The color of devotional worship does not fade away; they remain intuitively absorbed in
the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: You created the entire universe, and You Yourself bring
sustenance to it. Some eat and survive by practicing fraud and deceit; from their
mouths they drop falsehood and lies. As it pleases You, You assign them their tasks.
Some understand Truthfulness; they are given the inexhaustible treasure. Those who
eat by remembering the Lord are prosperous, while those who do not remember Him
stretch out their hands in need. || 8 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The Pandits, the
religious scholars, constantly read and recite the Vedas, for the sake of the love of
Maya. In the love of duality, the foolish people have forgotten the Lord‟s Name; they
shall receive their punishment. They never think of the One who gave them body and
soul, who provides sustenance to all. The noose of death shall not be cut away from
their necks; they shall come and go in reincarnation over and over again. The blind,
self-willed manmukhs do not understand anything. They do what they are pre-ordained
to do. Through perfect destiny, they meet the True Guru, the Giver of peace, and the
Naam comes to abide in the mind. They enjoy peace, they wear peace, and they pass
their lives in the peace of peace. O Nanak, they do not forget the Naam from the mind;
they are honored in the Court of the Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Serving the True
Guru, peace is obtained. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 86 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The True Name is the Treasure of Excellence. Follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and
recognize your own self; the Divine Light of the Lord‟s Name shall shine within. The
true ones practice Truth; greatness rests in the Great Lord. Body, soul and all things
belong to the Lord—praise Him, and offer your prayers to Him. Sing the Praises of the
True Lord through the Word of His Shabad, and you shall abide in the peace of peace.
You may practice chanting, penance and austere self-discipline within your mind, but
without the Name, life is useless. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Name is obtained,
while the self-willed manmukh wastes away in emotional attachment. Please protect
me, by the Pleasure of Your Will. Nanak is Your slave. || 2 || PAUREE: All are Yours,
and You belong to all. You are the wealth of all. Everyone begs from You, and all offer
prayers to You each day. Those, unto whom You give, receive everything. You are far
away from some, and You are close to others. Without You, there is not even a place to
stand begging. See this yourself and verify it in your mind. All praise You, O Lord; at
Your Door, the Gurmukhs are enlightened. || 9 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The
Pandits, the religious scholars, read and read, and shout out loud, but they are attached
to the love of Maya. They do not recognize God within themselves—they are so foolish
and ignorant! In the love of duality, they try to teach the world, but they do not
understand meditative contemplation. They lose their lives uselessly; they die, only to
be re-born, over and over again. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Those who serve the True
Guru obtain the Name. Reflect on this and understand. Eternal peace and joy abide in
their minds; they abandon their cries and complaints. Their identity consumes their
identical identity, and their minds become pure by contemplating the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. O Nanak, attuned to the Shabad, they are liberated. They love their
Beloved Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: Service to the Lord is fruitful; through it, the Gurmukh
is honored and approved. That person, with whom the Lord is pleased, meets with the
Guru, and meditates on the Name of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
the Lord is found. The Lord carries us across. Through stubborn-mindedness, none
have found Him; go and consult the Vedas on this. O Nanak, he alone serves the Lord,
whom the Lord attaches to Himself. || 10 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O Nanak, he is
a brave warrior, who conquers and subdues his vicious inner ego. Praising the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, the Gurmukhs redeem their lives. They themselves are liberated
forever, and they save all their ancestors. Those who love the Naam look beauteous at
the Gate of Truth. The self-willed manmukhs die in egotism—even their death is
painfully ugly. Everything happens according to the Lord‟s Will; what can the poor
people do? Attached to self-conceit and duality, they have forgotten their Lord and
Master. O Nanak, without the Name, everything is painful, and happiness is forgotten.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: The Perfect Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord within
me. It has dispelled my doubts from within. I sing the Lord‟s Name and the Kirtan of
the Lord‟s Praises; the Divine Light shines, and now I see the Way. Conquering my ego,
I am lovingly focused on the One Lord; the Naam has come to dwell within me. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 87 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I cannot be touched by the Messenger of Death. I am
absorbed in the True Name. The Creator Himself is All-pervading everywhere; He links
those with whom He is pleased to His Name. Servant Nanak chants the Naam, and so
he lives. Without the Name, he would die in an instant. || 2 || PAUREE: One who is
accepted at the Court of the Lord shall be accepted in courts everywhere. Wherever he
goes, he is recognized as honorable. Seeing his face, all sinners are saved. Within him
is the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Through the Naam, he is exalted.
He worships the Name, and believes in the Name; the Name erases all his sinful
mistakes. Those who meditate on the Name, with one-pointed mind and focused
consciousness, remain forever stable in the world. || 11 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL:
Worship the Divine, Supreme Soul, with the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru. If the
individual soul has faith in the Supreme Soul, then it shall obtain realization within its
own home. The soul becomes steady, and does not waver, by the natural inclination of
the Guru‟s Loving Will. Without the Guru, intuitive wisdom does not come, and the filth
of greed does not depart from within. If the Lord‟s Name abides within the mind, for a
moment, even for an instant, it is like bathing at all the sixty-eight sacred shrines of
pilgrimage. Filth does not stick to those who are true, but filth attaches itself to those
who love duality. This filth cannot be washed off, even by bathing at the sixty-eight
sacred shrines of pilgrimage. The self-willed manmukh does deeds in egotism; he earns
only pain and more pain. O Nanak, the filthy ones become clean only when they meet
and surrender to the True Guru. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The self-willed manmukhs may
be taught, but how can they really be taught? The manmukhs do not fit in at all.
Because of their past actions, they are condemned to the cycle of reincarnation. Loving
attention to the Lord and attachment to Maya are the two separate ways; all act
according to the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command. The Gurmukh has conquered his own
mind, by applying the Touchstone of the Shabad. He fights with his mind, he settles
with his mind, and he is at peace with his mind. All obtain the desires of their minds,
through the Love of the True Word of the Shabad. They drink in the Ambrosial Nectar
of the Naam forever; this is how the Gurmukhs act. Those who struggle with something
other than their own mind, shall depart having wasted their lives. The self-willed
manmukhs, through stubborn-mindedness and the practice of falsehood, lose the game
of life. Those who conquer their own mind, by Guru‟s Grace, lovingly focus their
attention on the Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs practice Truth, while the self-willed
manmukhs continue coming and going in reincarnation. || 2 || PAUREE: O Saints of
the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, listen, and hear the Lord‟s Teachings, through the True
Guru. Those who have good destiny pre-ordained and inscribed on their foreheads,
grasp it and keep it enshrined in the heart. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, they
intuitively taste the sublime, exquisite and ambrosial sermon of the Lord. The Divine
Light shines in their hearts, and like the sun which removes the darkness of night, it
dispels the darkness of ignorance. As Gurmukh, they behold with their eyes the Unseen,
Imperceptible, Unknowable, Immaculate Lord. || 12 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 88 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Those who serve their True Guru are certified and accepted. They eradicate selfishness
and conceit from within; they remain lovingly absorbed in the True One. Those who do
not serve the True Guru waste away their lives in vain. O Nanak, the Lord does just as
He pleases. No one has any say in this. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: With the mind encircled
by wickedness and evil, people do evil deeds. The ignorant worship the love of duality;
in the Lord‟s Court they shall be punished. So worship the Lord, the Light of the soul;
without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained. Meditation, penance and austere
self-discipline are found by surrendering to the True Guru‟s Will. By His Grace this is
received. O Nanak, serve with this intuitive awareness; only that which is pleasing to
the Lord is approved. || 2 || PAUREE: Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my
mind; it will bring you eternal peace, day and night. Chant the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, O my mind; meditating on it, all sins and misdeeds shall be erased. Chant the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; through it, all poverty, pain and hunger shall
be removed. Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; as Gurmukh, declare
your love. One who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead by the
True Lord, chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 13 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL:
Those who do not serve the True Guru, and who do not contemplate the Word of the
Shabad—spiritual wisdom does not enter into their hearts; they are like dead bodies in
the world. They go through the cycle of 8.4 million reincarnations, and they are ruined
through death and rebirth. He alone serves the True Guru, whom the Lord Himself
inspires to do so. The Treasure of the Naam is within the True Guru; by His Grace, it is
obtained. Those who are truly attuned to the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad—their love is
forever True. O Nanak, those who are united with Him shall not be separated again.
They merge imperceptibly into God. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: One who knows the
Benevolent Lord God is the true devotee of Bhagaautee. By Guru‟s Grace, he is selfrealized. He restrains his wandering mind, and brings it back to its own home within the
self. He remains dead while yet alive, and he chants the Name of the Lord. Such a
Bhagaautee is most exalted. O Nanak, he merges into the True One. || 2 || THIRD
MEHL: He is full of deceit, and yet he calls himself a devotee of Bhagaautee. Through
hypocrisy, he shall never attain the Supreme Lord God. He slanders others, and pollutes
himself with his own filth. Outwardly, he washes off the filth, but the impurity of his
mind does not go away. He argues with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Night
and day, he suffers, engrossed in the love of duality. He does not remember the Name
of the Lord, but still, he performs all sorts of empty rituals. That which is pre-ordained
cannot be erased. O Nanak, without serving the True Guru, liberation is not obtained.
|| 3 || PAUREE: Those who meditate on the True Guru shall not be burnt to ashes.
Those who meditate on the True Guru are satisfied and fulfilled. Those who meditate
on the True Guru are not afraid of the Messenger of Death. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 89 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Those upon whom the Lord showers His Mercy, fall at the Feet of the True Guru. Here
and hereafter, their faces are radiant; they go to the Lord‟s Court in robes of honor. ||
14 || SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Chop off that head which does not bow to the Lord.
O Nanak, that human body, in which there is no pain of separation from the Lord—take
that body and burn it. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: Forgetting the Primal Lord, O Nanak,
people are born and die, over and over again. Mistaking it for musk, they have fallen
into the stinking pit of filth. || 2 || PAUREE: Meditate on that Name of the Lord, O my
mind, whose Command rules over all. Chant that Name of the Lord, O my mind, which
will save you at the very last moment. Chant that Name of the Lord, O my mind, which
shall drive out all hunger and desire from your mind. Very fortunate and blessed is that
Gurmukh who chants the Naam; it shall bring all slanderers and wicked enemies to fall
at his feet. O Nanak, worship and adore the Naam, the Greatest Name of all, before
which all come and bow. || 15 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: She may wear good
clothes, but the bride is ugly and rude; her mind is false and impure. She does not walk
in harmony with the Will of her Husband Lord. Instead, she foolishly gives Him orders.
But she who walks in harmony with the Guru‟s Will, shall be spared all pain and
suffering. That destiny which was pre-ordained by the Creator cannot be erased. She
must dedicate her mind and body to her Husband Lord, and enshrine love for the Word
of the Shabad. Without His Name, no one has found Him; see this and reflect upon it in
your heart. O Nanak, she is beautiful and graceful; the Creator Lord ravishes and enjoys
her. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Attachment to Maya is an ocean of darkness; neither this
shore nor the one beyond can be seen. The ignorant, self-willed manmukhs suffer in
terrible pain; they forget the Lord‟s Name and drown. They arise in the morning and
perform all sorts of rituals, but they are caught in the love of duality. Those who serve
the True Guru cross over the terrifying world-ocean. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs keep the
True Name enshrined in their hearts; they are absorbed into the True One. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The Lord pervades and permeates the water, the land and the sky; there is
no other at all. The Lord Himself sits upon His Throne and administers justice. He beats
and drives out the false-hearted. The Lord bestows glorious greatness upon those who
are truthful. He administers righteous justice. So praise the Lord, everybody; He
protects the poor and the lost souls. He honors the righteous and punishes the sinners.
|| 16 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The self-willed manmukh, the foolish bride, is a
filthy, rude and evil wife. Forsaking her Husband Lord and leaving her own home, she
gives her love to another. Her desires are never satisfied, and she burns and cries out
in pain. O Nanak, without the Name, she is ugly and ungraceful. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 90 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
She is abandoned and left behind by her Husband Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The
happy soul-bride is attuned to the Word of the Shabad; she is in love with the True
Guru. She continually enjoys and ravishes her Beloved, with true love and affection. She
is such a loveable, beautiful and noble woman. O Nanak, through the Naam, the happy
soul-bride unites with the Lord of Union. || 2 || PAUREE: Lord, everyone sings Your
Praises. You have freed us from bondage. Lord, everyone bows in reverence to You.
You have saved us from our sinful ways. Lord, You are the Honor of the dishonored.
Lord, You are the Strongest of the strong. The Lord beats down the egocentrics and
corrects the foolish, self-willed manmukhs. The Lord bestows glorious greatness on His
devotees, the poor, and the lost souls. || 17 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: One who
walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru, obtains the greatest glory. The Exalted
Name of the Lord abides in his mind, and no one can take it away. That person, upon
whom the Lord bestows His Grace, receives His Mercy. O Nanak, creativity is under the
control of the Creator; how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize this! || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: O Nanak, those who worship and adore the Lord‟s Name night and day,
vibrate the String of the Lord‟s Love. Maya, the maid-servant of our Lord and Master,
serves them. The Perfect One has made them perfect; by the Hukam of His Command,
they are embellished. By Guru‟s Grace, they understand Him, and they find the gate of
salvation. The self-willed manmukhs do not know the Lord‟s Command; they are beaten
down by the Messenger of Death. But the Gurmukhs, who worship and adore the Lord,
cross over the terrifying world-ocean. All their demerits are erased, and replaced with
merits. The Guru Himself is their Forgiver. || 2 || PAUREE: The Lord‟s devotees have
faith in Him. The Lord knows everything. No one is as great a Knower as the Lord; the
Lord administers righteous justice. Why should we feel any burning anxiety, since the
Lord does not punish without just cause? True is the Master, and True is His Justice;
only the sinners are defeated. O devotees, praise the Lord with your palms pressed
together; the Lord saves His humble devotees. || 18 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Oh,
if only I could meet my Beloved, and keep Him enshrined deep within my heart! I praise
that God forever and ever, through love and affection for the Guru. O Nanak, that one
upon whom He bestows His Glance of Grace is united with Him; such a person is the
true soul-bride of the Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Serving the Guru, the Lord is
obtained, when He bestows His Glance of Grace. They are transformed from humans
into angels, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They conquer their egotism
and merge with the Lord; they are saved through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. O
Nanak, they merge imperceptibly into the Lord, who has bestowed His Favor upon
them. || 2 || PAUREE: The Lord Himself inspires us to worship Him; He reveals His
Glorious Greatness. He Himself inspires us to place our faith in Him. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 91 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Thus He performs His Own Service. The Lord bestows bliss upon His devotees, and
gives them a seat in the eternal home. He does not give the sinners any stability or
place of rest; He consigns them to the depths of hell. The Lord blesses His devotees
with His Love; He sides with them and saves them. || 19 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL:
False-mindedness is the drummer-woman; cruelty is the butcheress; slander of others
in one‟s heart is the cleaning-woman, and deceitful anger is the outcast-woman. What
good are the ceremonial lines drawn around your kitchen, when these four are seated
there with you? Make Truth your self-discipline, and make good deeds the lines you
draw; make chanting the Name your cleansing bath. O Nanak, those who do not walk in
the ways of sin, shall be exalted in the world hereafter. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Which is
the swan, and which is the crane? It is only by His Glance of Grace. Whoever is pleasing
to Him, O Nanak, is transformed from a crow into a swan. || 2 || PAUREE: Whatever
work you wish to accomplish—tell it to the Lord. He will resolve your affairs; the True
Guru gives His Guarantee of Truth. In the Society of the Saints, you shall taste the
treasure of the Ambrosial Nectar. The Lord is the Merciful Destroyer of fear; He
preserves and protects His slaves. O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and
see the Unseen Lord God. || 20 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Body and soul, all belong
to Him. He gives His Support to all. O Nanak, become Gurmukh and serve Him, who is
forever and ever the Giver. I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Formless
Lord. Their faces are forever radiant, and the whole world bows in reverence to them.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: Meeting the True Guru, I am totally transformed; I have
obtained the nine treasures to use and consume. The Siddhis—the eighteen
supernatural spiritual powers—follow in my footsteps; I dwell in my own home, within
my own self. The Unstruck Melody constantly vibrates within; my mind is exalted and
uplifted—I am lovingly absorbed in the Lord. O Nanak, devotion to the Lord abides
within the minds of those who have such pre-ordained destiny written on their
foreheads. || 2 || PAUREE: I am a minstrel of the Lord God, my Lord and Master; I
have come to the Lord‟s Door. The Lord has heard my sad cries from within; He has
called me, His minstrel, into His Presence. The Lord called His minstrel in, and asked,
“Why have you come here?” “O Merciful God, please grant me the gift of continual
meditation on the Lord‟s Name.” And so the Lord, the Great Giver, inspired Nanak to
chant the Lord‟s Name, and blessed him with robes of honor. || 21 || 1 || SUDH ||

SIREE RAAG, KABEER JEE: TO BE SUNG TO THE TUNE OF “AYK SU-AAN” :
The mother thinks that her son is growing up; she does not understand that, day by
day, his life is diminishing.

Calling him, “Mine, mine”, she fondles him lovingly, while the Messenger of Death looks
on and laughs. || 1 || You have misled the world so deeply in doubt. How can people
understand You, when they are entranced by Maya? || 1 || Pause || Says Kabeer,
give up the pleasures of corruption, or else you will surely die of them. Meditate on the
Lord, O mortal being, through the Word of His Bani; you shall be blessed with eternal
life. In this way, shall you cross over the terrifying world-ocean. || 2 || As it pleases
Him, people embrace love for the Lord, and doubt and delusion are dispelled from
within. Intuitive peace and poise well up within, and the intellect is awakened to
spiritual wisdom. By Guru‟s Grace, the inner being is touched by the Lord‟s Love. || 3 ||
In this association, there is no death. Recognizing the Hukam of His Command, you
shall meet with your Lord and Master. || 1 || Second Pause || SIREE RAAG,
TRILOCHAN: The mind is totally attached to Maya; the mortal has forgotten his fear of
old age and death. Gazing upon his family, he blossoms forth like the lotus flower; the
deceitful person watches and covets the homes of others. || 1 || When the powerful
Messenger of Death comes, no one can stand against his awesome power. Rare, very
rare, is that friend who comes and says, “O my Beloved, take me into Your Embrace! O
my Lord, please save me!” || 1 || Pause || Indulging in all sorts of princely
pleasures, O mortal, you have forgotten God; you have fallen into the world-ocean, and
you think that you have become immortal. Cheated and plundered by Maya, you do not
think of God, and you waste your life in laziness. || 2 || The path you must walk is
treacherous and terrifying, O mortal; neither the sun nor the moon shine there. Your
emotional attachment to Maya will be forgotten, when you have to leave this world. ||
3 || Today, it became clear to my mind that the Righteous Judge of Dharma is
watching us. His messengers, with their awesome power, crush people between their
hands; I cannot stand against them. || 4 || If someone is going to teach me
something, let it be that the Lord is pervading the forests and fields. O Dear Lord, You
Yourself know everything; so prays Trilochan, Lord. || 5 || 2 || SIREE RAAG,
DEVOTEE KABEER JEE: Listen, O religious scholar: the One Lord alone is Wondrous; no
one can describe Him. He fascinates the angels, the celestial singers and the heavenly
musicians; he has strung the three worlds upon His Thread. || 1 || The Unstruck
Melody of the Sovereign Lord‟s Harp vibrates; by His Glance of Grace, we are lovingly
attuned to the Sound-current of the Naad. || 1 || Pause || The Tenth Gate of my
crown chakra is the distilling fire, and the channels of the Ida and Pingala are the
funnels, to pour in and empty out the golden vat. Into that vat, there trickles a gentle
stream of the most sublime and pure essence of all distilled essences. || 2 ||
Something wonderful has happened—the breath has become the cup. In all the three
worlds, such a Yogi is unique. What king can compare to him? || 3 || This spiritual
wisdom of God, the Supreme Soul, has illuminated my being. Says Kabeer, I am
attuned to His Love. All the rest of the world is deluded by doubt, while my mind is
intoxicated with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. || 4 || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 93 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
SREE RAAG, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE BAYNEE JEE: TO BE SUNG TO THE
TUNE OF “PEHRAY”:

O man, when you were coiled in the cradle of the womb, upside-down, you were
absorbed in meditation. You took no pride in your perishable body; night and day were
all the same to you—you lived unknowing, in the silence of the void. Remember the
terrible pain and suffering of those days, now that you have spread out the net of your
consciousness far and wide. Leaving the womb, you entered this mortal world; you
have forgotten the Lord from your mind. || 1 || Later, you will regret and repent—you
fool! Why are you engrossed in evil-mindedness and skepticism? Think of the Lord, or
else you shall be led to the City of Death. Why are you wandering around, out of
control? || 1 || Pause || You play like a child, craving sweets; moment by moment,
you become more entangled in emotional attachment. Tasting good and bad, you eat
nectar and then poison, and then the five passions appear and torture you. Abandoning
meditation, penance and self-restraint, and the wisdom of good actions, you do not
worship and adore the Lord‟s Name. You are overflowing with sexual desire, and your
intellect is stained with darkness; you are held in the grip of Shakti‟s power. || 2 || In
the heat of youthful passion, you look with desire upon the faces of other men‟s wives;
you do not distinguish between good and evil. Drunk with sexual desire and other great
sins, you go astray, and do not distinguish between vice and virtue. Gazing upon your
children and your property, your mind is proud and arrogant; you cast out the Lord
from your heart. When others die, you measure your own wealth in your mind; you
waste your life in the pleasures of the mouth and sexual organs. || 3 || Your hair is
whiter than the jasmine flower, and your voice has grown feeble, as if it comes from
the seventh underworld. Your eyes water, and your intellect and strength have left you;
but still, your sexual desire churns and drives you on. And so, your intellect has dried
up through corruption, and the lotus flower of your body has wilted and withered. You
have forsaken the Bani, the Word of the Immortal Lord, in this mortal world; in the end,
you shall regret and repent. || 4 || Gazing upon the tiny bodies of your children, love
has welled up within your heart; you are proud of them, but you do not understand.
You long for the dignity of a long life, but your eyes can no longer see anything. Your
light has gone out, and the bird of your mind has flown away; you are no longer
welcome in your own home and courtyard. Says Baynee, listen, O devotee: who has
ever attained liberation after such a death? || 5 || SREE RAAG: You are me, and I am
You—what is the difference between us? We are like gold and the bracelet, or water
and the waves. || 1 || If I did not commit any sins, O Infinite Lord, how would You
have acquired the name, „Redeemer of sinners‟? || 1 || Pause || You are my Master,
the Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts. The servant is known by his God, and the Lord
and Master is known by His servant. || 2 || Grant me the wisdom to worship and
adore You with my body. O Ravi Daas, one who understands that the Lord is equally in
all, is very rare. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 94 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
RAAG MAAJH, CHAU-PADAS, FIRST HOUSE, FOURTH MEHL:
ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.
THE NAME IS TRUTH.
CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED. NO FEAR. NO HATRED.
IMAGE OF THE UNDYING, BEYOND BIRTH, SELF-EXISTENT.
BY GURU‟S GRACE:
The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my mind. By great good fortune, I
meditate on the Lord‟s Name. The Perfect Guru has attained spiritual perfection in the
Name of the Lord. How rare are those who follow the Guru‟s Teachings. || 1 || I have
loaded my pack with the provisions of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Companion
of my breath of life shall always be with me. The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord‟s
Name within me. I have the Imperishable Treasure of the Lord in my lap. || 2 || The
Lord, Har, Har, is my Best Friend; He is my Beloved Lord King. If only someone would
come and introduce me to Him, the Rejuvenator of my breath of life. I cannot survive
without seeing my Beloved. My eyes are welling up with tears. || 3 || My Friend, the
True Guru, has been my Best Friend since I was very young. I cannot survive without
seeing Him, O my mother! O Dear Lord, please show Mercy to me, that I may meet the
Guru. Servant Nanak gathers the Wealth of the Lord‟s Name in his lap. || 4 || 1 ||
MAAJH, FOURTH MEHL: The Lord is my mind, body and breath of life. I do not know
any other than the Lord. If only I could have the good fortune to meet some friendly
Saint; he might show me the Way to my Beloved Lord God. || 1 || I have searched
my mind and body, through and through. How can I meet my Darling Beloved, O my
mother? Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I ask about the Path to God. In
that Congregation, the Lord God abides. || 2 || My Darling Beloved True Guru is my
Protector. I am a helpless child—please cherish me. The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, is
my Mother and Father. Obtaining the Water of the Guru, the lotus of my heart blossoms
forth. || 3 || Without seeing my Guru, sleep does not come. My mind and body are
afflicted with the pain of separation from the Guru. O Lord, Har, Har, show mercy to
me, that I may meet my Guru. Meeting the Guru, servant Nanak blossoms forth. || 4 ||
2 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 95 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
MAAJH, FOURTH MEHL: Read of the Lord‟s Glories and reflect upon the Lord‟s Glories.
Listen continually to the Sermon of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Joining
the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
you shall cross over the treacherous and terrifying world-ocean. || 1 || Come, friends,
let us meet our Lord. Bring me a message from my Beloved. He alone is a friend,
companion, beloved and brother of mine, who shows me the way to the Lord, the Lord
of all. || 2 || My illness is known only to the Lord and the Perfect Guru. I cannot
continue living without chanting the Naam. So give me the medicine, the Mantra of the
Perfect Guru. Through the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I am saved. || 3 || I am just a
poor song-bird, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru, who has placed the Drop of Water,
the Lord‟s Name, Har, Har, in my mouth. The Lord is the Treasure of Water; I am just a
fish in that water. Without this Water, servant Nanak would die. || 4 || 3 || MAAJH,
FOURTH MEHL: O servants of the Lord, O Saints, O my Siblings of Destiny, let us join
together! Show me the way to my Lord God—I am so hungry for Him! Please reward
my faith, O Life of the World, O Great Giver. Obtaining the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s
Darshan, my mind is fulfilled. || 1 || Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I
chant the Bani of the Lord‟s Word. The Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is pleasing to my
mind. The Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord‟s Name, Har, Har, is so sweet to my mind.
Meeting the True Guru, I drink in this Ambrosial Nectar. || 2 || By great good fortune,
the Lord‟s Congregation is found, while the unfortunate ones wander around in doubt,
enduring painful beatings. Without good fortune, the Sat Sangat is not found; without
this Sangat, people are stained with filth and pollution. || 3 || Come and meet me, O
Life of the World, my Beloved. Please bless me with Your Mercy, and enshrine Your
Name, Har, Har, within my mind. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Sweet Name has
become pleasing to my mind. Servant Nanak‟s mind is drenched and delighted with the
Naam. || 4 || 4 || MAAJH, FOURTH MEHL: Through the Guru, I have obtained the
Lord‟s spiritual wisdom. I have obtained the Sublime Essence of the Lord. My mind is
imbued with the Love of the Lord; I drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord. With my
mouth, I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; my mind is filled to overflowing with
the Sublime Essence of the Lord. || 1 || Come, O Saints, and lead me to my Lord‟s
Embrace. Recite to me the Sermon of my Beloved. I dedicate my mind to those Saints
of the Lord, who chant the Word of the Guru‟s Bani with their mouths. || 2 || By great
good fortune, the Lord has led me to meet His Saint. The Perfect Guru has placed the
Sublime Essence of the Lord into my mouth. The unfortunate ones do not find the True
Guru; the self-willed manmukhs continually endure reincarnation through the womb. ||
3 || God, the Merciful, has Himself bestowed His Mercy. He has totally removed the
poisonous pollution of egotism. O Nanak, in the shops of the city of the human body,
the Gurmukhs buy the merchandise of the Lord‟s Name. || 4 || 5 || MAAJH, FOURTH
MEHL: I meditate on the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, and the Name of
the Lord. Joining the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, the Name comes to dwell in the
mind. The Lord God is our Lord and Master, Inaccessible and Unfathomable. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 96 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Meeting the True Guru, I enjoy the Sublime Essence of the Lord. || 1 || Blessed,
blessed are the humble servants of the Lord, who know the Lord God. I go and ask
those humble servants about the Mysteries of the Lord. I wash and massage their feet;
joining with the humble servants of the Lord, I drink in the Sublime Essence of the
Lord. || 2 || The True Guru, the Giver, has implanted the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, within me. By great good fortune, I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the
Guru‟s Darshan. The True Essence is Ambrosial Nectar; through the Ambrosial Words of
the Perfect Guru, this Amrit is obtained. || 3 || O Lord, lead me to the Sat Sangat, the
True Congregation, and the true beings. Joining the Sat Sangat, I meditate on the
Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, I listen and chant the Lord‟s Sermon; through the Guru‟s
Teachings, I am fulfilled by the Name of the Lord. || 4 || 6 || MAAJH, FOURTH
MEHL: Come, dear sisters—let us join together. I am a sacrifice to the one who tells
me of my Beloved. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have found the
Lord, my Best Friend. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru. || 1 || Wherever I look, there
I see my Lord and Master. You are permeating each and every heart, O Lord, Innerknower, Searcher of Hearts. The Perfect Guru has shown me that the Lord is always
with me. I am forever a sacrifice to the True Guru. || 2 || There is only one breath;
all are made of the same clay; the light within all is the same. The One Light pervades
all the many and various beings. This Light intermingles with them, but it is not diluted
or obscured. By Guru‟s Grace, I have come to see the One. I am a sacrifice to the True
Guru. || 3 || Servant Nanak speaks the Ambrosial Bani of the Word. It is dear and
pleasing to the minds of the GurSikhs. The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, shares the
Teachings. The Guru, the True Guru, is Generous to all. || 4 || 7 || SEVEN CHAUPADAS OF THE FOURTH MEHL. ||
MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL, CHAU-PADAS, FIRST HOUSE:
My mind longs for the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan. It cries out like the thirsty
song-bird. My thirst is not quenched, and I can find no peace, without the Blessed
Vision of the Beloved Saint. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to the
Blessed Vision of the Beloved Saint Guru. || 1 || Pause || Your Face is so Beautiful,
and the Sound of Your Words imparts intuitive wisdom. It is so long since this sparrowhawk has had even a glimpse of water. Blessed is that land where You dwell, O my
Friend and Intimate Divine Guru. || 2 || I am a sacrifice, I am forever a sacrifice, to
my Friend and Intimate Divine Guru. || 1 || Pause || When I could not be with You
for just one moment, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga dawned for me. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 97 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When will I meet You, O my Beloved Lord? I cannot endure the night, and sleep does
not come, without the Sight of the Beloved Guru‟s Court. || 3 || I am a sacrifice, my
soul is a sacrifice, to that True Court of the Beloved Guru. || 1 || Pause || By good
fortune, I have met the Saint Guru. I have found the Immortal Lord within the home of
my own self. I will now serve You forever, and I shall never be separated from You,
even for an instant. Servant Nanak is Your slave, O Beloved Master. || 4 || I am a
sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice; servant Nanak is Your slave, Lord. || Pause || 1 || 8 ||
RAAG MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Sweet is that season when I remember You. Sublime is
that work which is done for You. Blessed is that heart in which You dwell, O Giver of all.
|| 1 || You are the Universal Father of all, O my Lord and Master. Your nine treasures
are an inexhaustible storehouse. Those unto whom You give are satisfied and fulfilled;
they become Your devotees, Lord. || 2 || All place their hopes in You. You dwell deep
within each and every heart. All share in Your Grace; none are beyond You. || 3 ||
You Yourself liberate the Gurmukhs; You Yourself consign the self-willed manmukhs to
wander in reincarnation. Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to You; Your Entire Play is selfevident, Lord. || 4 || 2 || 9 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: The Unstruck Melody resounds
and resonates in peaceful ease. I rejoice in the eternal bliss of the Word of the Shabad.
In the cave of intuitive wisdom I sit, absorbed in the silent trance of the Primal Void. I
have obtained my seat in the heavens. || 1 || After wandering through many other
homes and houses, I have returned to my own home, and I have found what I was
longing for. I am satisfied and fulfilled; O Saints, the Guru has shown me the Fearless
Lord God. || 2 || He Himself is the King, and He Himself is the people. He Himself is
in Nirvaanaa, and He Himself indulges in pleasures. He Himself sits on the throne of
true justice, answering the cries and prayers of all. || 3 || As I have seen Him, so
have I described Him. This Sublime Essence comes only to one who knows the Mystery
of the Lord. His light merges into the Light, and he finds peace. O servant Nanak, this is
all the Extension of the One. || 4 || 3 || 10 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: That house, in
which the soul-bride has married her Husband Lord—in that house, O my companions,
sing the songs of rejoicing. Joy and celebrations decorate that house, in which the
Husband Lord has adorned His soul-bride. || 1 || She is virtuous, and she is very
fortunate; she is noble and tender-hearted. The happy soul-bride is loved by her
Husband. She is beautiful, wise, and clever. That soul-bride is the beloved of her
Husband Lord. || 2 || She is well-mannered, noble and distinguished. She is
decorated and adorned with wisdom. She is from a most respected family; she is the
queen, adorned with the Love of her Husband Lord. || 3 || Her glory cannot be
described; she melts in the Embrace of her Husband Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 98 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Her marriage is eternal; her Husband is Inaccessible and Incomprehensible. O Servant
Nanak, His Love is her only Support. || 4 || 4 || 11 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: I have
searched and searched, seeking the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. I travelled through
all sorts of woods and forests. My Lord, Har, Har, is both absolute and related,
unmanifest and manifest; is there anyone who can come and unite me with Him? || 1
|| People recite from memory the wisdom of the six schools of philosophy; they
perform worship services, wear ceremonial religious marks on their foreheads, and take
ritual cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. They perform the inner cleansing
practice with water and adopt the eighty-four Yogic postures; but still, they find no
peace in any of these. || 2 || They chant and meditate, practicing austere selfdiscipline for years and years; they wander on journeys all over the earth; and yet, their
hearts are not at peace, even for an instant. The Yogi rises up and goes out, over and
over again. || 3 || By His Mercy, I have met the Holy Saint. My mind and body have
been cooled and soothed; I have been blessed with patience and composure. The
Immortal Lord God has come to dwell within my heart. Nanak sings the songs of joy to
the Lord. || 4 || 5 || 12 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: The Supreme Lord God is Infinite
and Divine; He is Inaccessible, Incomprehensible, Invisible and Inscrutable. Merciful to
the meek, Sustainer of the World, Lord of the Universe—meditating on the Lord, the
Gurmukhs find salvation. || 1 || The Gurmukhs are emancipated by the Lord. The
Lord Krishna becomes the Gurmukh‟s Companion. The Gurmukh finds the Merciful Lord.
He is not found any other way. || 2 || He does not need to eat; His Hair is Wondrous
and Beautiful; He is free of hate. Millions of people worship His Feet. He alone is a
devotee, who becomes Gurmukh, whose heart is filled with the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 ||
Forever fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; He is Infinite and Incomparable.
He is Awesome and All-powerful; He is forever the Great Giver. As Gurmukh, chant the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, and you shall be carried across. O Nanak, rare are those
who know this state! || 4 || 6 || 13 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: As You command, I
obey; as You give, I receive. You are the Pride of the meek and the poor. You are
everything; You are my Beloved. I am a sacrifice to Your Creative Power. || 1 || By
Your Will, we wander in the wilderness; by Your Will, we find the path. By Your Will, we
become Gurmukh and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. By Your Will, we wander in
doubt through countless lifetimes. Everything happens by Your Will. || 2 || No one is
foolish, and no one is clever. Your Will determines everything; You are Inaccessible,
Incomprehensible, Infinite and Unfathomable. Your Value cannot be expressed. || 3 ||
Please bless me with the dust of the Saints, O my Beloved. I have come and fallen at
Your Door, O Lord. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, my mind is fulfilled.
O Nanak, with natural ease, I merge into Him. || 4 || 7 || 14 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL:
They forget the Lord, and they suffer in pain. Afflicted with hunger, they run around in
all directions. Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, they are happy forever. The
Lord, Merciful to the meek, bestows it upon them. || 1 || My True Guru is absolutely
All-powerful. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 99 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When I dwell upon Him in my soul, all my sorrows depart. The sickness of anxiety and
the disease of ego are cured; He Himself cherishes me. || 2 || Like a child, I ask for
everything. God is Bountiful and Beautiful; He never comes up empty. Again and again,
I fall at His Feet. He is Merciful to the meek, the Sustainer of the World. || 3 || I am a
sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru, who has shattered all my bonds. With the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, in my heart, I have been purified. O Nanak, His Love has imbued me
with nectar. || 4 || 8 || 15 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: O my Love, Sustainer of the
World, Merciful, Loving Lord, Profoundly Deep, Infinite Lord of the Universe, Highest of
the High, Unfathomable, Infinite Lord and Master: continually remembering You in deep
meditation, I live. || 1 || O Destroyer of pain, Priceless Treasure, Fearless, free of
hate, Unfathomable, Immeasurable, of Undying Form, Unborn, Self-illumined:
remembering You in meditation, my mind is filled with a deep and profound peace. || 2
|| The Joyous Lord, the Sustainer of the World, is my constant Companion. He
cherishes the high and the low. The Nectar of the Name satisfies my mind. As
Gurmukh, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. || 3 || In suffering and in comfort, I
meditate on You, O Beloved. I have obtained this sublime understanding from the Guru.
You are Nanak‟s Support, O my Lord and Master; through Your Love, I swim across to
the other side. || 4 || 9 || 16 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Blessed is that time when I
meet the True Guru. Gazing upon the Fruitful Vision of His Darshan, I have been saved.
Blessed are the hours, the minutes and the seconds—blessed is that Union with Him. ||
1 || Making the effort, my mind has become pure. Walking on the Lord‟s Path, my
doubts have all been cast out. The True Guru has inspired me to hear the Treasure of
the Naam; all my illness has been dispelled. || 2 || The Word of Your Bani is inside
and outside as well. You Yourself chant it, and You Yourself speak it. The Guru has said
that He is One—All is the One. There shall never be any other. || 3 || I drink in the
Lord‟s Ambrosial Essence from the Guru; the Lord‟s Name has become my clothing and
food. The Name is my delight, the Name is my play and entertainment. O Nanak, I have
made the Name my enjoyment. || 4 || 10 || 17 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: I beg of all
the Saints: please, give me the merchandise. I offer my prayers—I have forsaken my
pride. I am a sacrifice, hundreds of thousands of times a sacrifice, and I pray: please,
give me the dust of the feet of the Saints. || 1 || You are the Giver, You are the
Architect of Destiny. You are All-powerful, the Giver of Eternal Peace. You bless
everyone. Please bring my life to fulfillment. || 2 || The body-temple is sanctified by
the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, and thus, the impregnable fort of the soul is
conquered. You are the Giver, You are the Architect of Destiny. There is no other
warrior as great as You. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 100 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I applied the dust of the feet of the Saints to my face. My evil-mindedness disappeared,
along with my misfortune and false-mindedness. I sit in the true home of my self; I sing
His Glorious Praises. O Nanak, my falsehood has vanished! || 4 || 11 || 18 || MAAJH,
FIFTH MEHL: I shall never forget You—You are such a Great Giver! Please grant Your
Grace, and imbue me with the love of devotional worship. If it pleases You, let me
meditate on You day and night; please, grant me this gift! || 1 || Into this blind clay,
You have infused awareness. Everything, everywhere which You have given is good.
Bliss, joyful celebrations, wondrous plays and entertainment—whatever pleases You,
comes to pass. || 2 || Everything we receive is a gift from Him—the thirty-six
delicious foods to eat, cozy beds, cooling breezes, peaceful joy and the experience of
pleasure. || 3 || Give me that state of mind, by which I may not forget You. Give me
that understanding, by which I may meditate on You. I sing Your Glorious Praises with
each and every breath. Nanak takes the Support of the Guru‟s Feet. || 4 || 12 || 19 ||
MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: To praise You is to follow Your Command and Your Will. That
which pleases You is spiritual wisdom and meditation. That which pleases God is
chanting and meditation; to be in harmony with His Will is perfect spiritual wisdom. || 1
|| He alone sings Your Ambrosial Naam, who is pleasing to Your Mind, O my Lord and
Master. You belong to the Saints, and the Saints belong to You. The minds of the Saints
are attuned to You, O my Lord and Master. || 2 || You cherish and nurture the Saints.
The Saints play with You, O Sustainer of the World. Your Saints are very dear to You.
You are the breath of life of the Saints. || 3 || My mind is a sacrifice to those Saints
who know You, and are pleasing to Your Mind. In their company I have found a lasting
peace. Nanak is satisfied and fulfilled with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. || 4 || 13
|| 20 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: You are the Ocean of Water, and I am Your fish. Your
Name is the drop of water, and I am a thirsty sparrow-hawk. You are my hope, and You
are my thirst. My mind is absorbed in You. || 1 || Just as the baby is satisfied by
drinking milk, and the poor person is pleased by seeing wealth, and the thirsty person is
refreshed by drinking cool water, so is this mind drenched with delight in the Lord. || 2
|| Just as the darkness is lit up by the lamp, and the hopes of the wife are fulfilled by
thinking about her husband, and people are filled with bliss upon meeting their beloved,
so is my mind imbued with the Lord‟s Love. || 3 || The Saints have set me upon the
Lord‟s Path. By the Grace of the Holy Saint, I have been attuned to the Lord. The Lord
is mine, and I am the slave of the Lord. O Nanak, the Guru has blessed me with the
True Word of the Shabad. || 4 || 14 || 21 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: The Ambrosial
Naam, the Name of the Lord, is eternally pure. The Lord is the Giver of Peace and the
Dispeller of sorrow. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 101 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I have seen and tasted all other flavors, but to my mind, the Subtle Essence of the Lord
is the sweetest of all. || 1 || Whoever drinks this in, is satisfied. Whoever obtains the
Sublime Essence of the Naam becomes immortal. The Treasure of the Naam is obtained
by one whose mind is filled with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 2 || One who
obtains the Sublime Essence of the Lord is satisfied and fulfilled. One who obtains this
Flavor of the Lord does not waver. One who has this destiny written on his forehead
obtains the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || The Lord has come into the hands of
the One, the Guru, who has blessed so many with good fortune. Attached to Him, a
great many have been liberated. The Gurmukh obtains the Treasure of the Naam; says
Nanak, those who see the Lord are very rare. || 4 || 15 || 22 || MAAJH, FIFTH
MEHL: My Lord, Har, Har, Har, is the nine treasures, the supernatural spiritual powers
of the Siddhas, wealth and prosperity. He is the Deep and Profound Treasure of Life.
Hundreds of thousands, even millions of pleasures and delights are enjoyed by one who
falls at the Guru‟s Feet. || 1 || Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, all are
sanctified, and all family and friends are saved. By Guru‟s Grace, I meditate on the
Inaccessible and Unfathomable True Lord. || 2 || The One, the Guru, who is sought
by all—only a few, by great good fortune, receive His Darshan. His Place is lofty, infinite
and unfathomable; the Guru has shown me that palace. || 3 || Your Ambrosial Name
is deep and profound. That person is liberated, in whose heart You dwell. The Guru cuts
away all his bonds; O Servant Nanak, he is absorbed in the poise of intuitive peace. ||
4 || 16 || 23 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: By God‟s Grace, I meditate on the Lord, Har,
Har. By God‟s Kindness, I sing the songs of joy. While standing and sitting, while
sleeping and while awake, meditate on the Lord, all your life. || 1 || The Holy Saint
has given me the Medicine of the Naam. The residues of my mistakes have been cut
out, and I have become pure. I am filled with bliss, and all my pains have been taken
away. All my suffering has been dispelled. || 2 || One who has my Beloved on his
side, is liberated from the world-ocean. One who recognizes the Guru practices Truth;
why should he be afraid? || 3 || Since I found the Company of the Holy and met the
Guru, the demon of pride has departed. With each and every breath, Nanak sings the
Lord‟s Praises. The True Guru has covered my sins. || 4 || 17 || 24 || MAAJH, FIFTH
MEHL: Through and through, the Lord is intermingled with His servant. God, the Giver
of Peace, cherishes His servant. I carry the water, wave the fan, and grind the grain for
the servant of my Lord and Master. || 1 || God has cut the noose from around my
neck; He has placed me in His Service. The Lord and Master‟s Command is pleasing to
the mind of His servant. He does that which pleases his Lord and Master. Inwardly and
outwardly, the servant knows his Lord. || 2 || You are the All-knowing Lord and
Master; You know all ways and means. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 102 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The servant of the Lord and Master enjoys the Love and Affection of the Lord. That
which belongs to the Lord and Master, belongs to His servant. The servant becomes
distinguished in association with his Lord and Master. || 3 || He, whom the Lord and
Master dresses in the robes of honor, is not called to answer for his account any longer.
Nanak is a sacrifice to that servant. He is the pearl of the deep and unfathomable
Ocean of God. || 4 || 18 || 25 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Everything is within the
home of the self; there is nothing beyond. One who searches outside is deluded by
doubt. By Guru‟s Grace, one who has found the Lord within is happy, inwardly and
outwardly. || 1 || Slowly, gently, drop by drop, the stream of nectar trickles down
within. The mind drinks it in, hearing and reflecting on the Word of the Shabad. It
enjoys bliss and ecstasy day and night, and plays with the Lord forever and ever. || 2
|| I was separated and cut off from the Lord for so many lifetimes; by the Grace of the
Holy Saint, the dried-up branches have blossomed forth again in their greenery. I have
obtained this sublime understanding, and I meditate on the Naam; as Gurmukh, I have
met the Lord. || 3 || As the waves of water merge again with the water, so does my
light merge again into the Light. Says Nanak, the veil of illusion has been cut away, and
I shall not go out wandering any more. || 4 || 19 || 26 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: I am
a sacrifice to those who have heard of You. I am a sacrifice to those whose tongues
speak of You. Again and again, I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on You with
mind and body. || 1 || I wash the feet of those who walk upon Your Path. With my
eyes, I long to behold those kind people. I offer my mind to those friends, who have
met the Guru and found God. || 2 || Very fortunate are those who know You. In the
midst of all, they remain detached and balanced in Nirvaanaa. In the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and conquer all their
evil passions. || 3 || My mind has entered their Sanctuary. I have renounced my pride
in my own strength, and the darkness of emotional attachment. Please bless Nanak
with the Gift of the Naam, the Name of the Inaccessible and Unfathomable God. || 4 ||
20 || 27 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: You are the tree; Your branches have blossomed
forth. From the very small and subtle, You have become huge and manifest. You are
the Ocean of Water, and You are the foam and the bubbles on its surface. I cannot see
any other except You, Lord. || 1 || You are the thread, and You are also the beads.
You are the knot, and You are the primary bead of the maalaa. In the beginning, in the
middle and in the end, there is God. I cannot see any other except You, Lord. || 2 ||
You transcend all qualities, and You possess the supreme qualities. You are the Giver of
peace. You are detached in Nirvaanaa, and You are the Enjoyer, imbued with love. You
Yourself know Your Own Ways; You dwell upon Yourself. || 3 || You are the Master,
and then again, You are the servant. O God, You Yourself are the Manifest and the
Unmanifest. Slave Nanak sings Your Glorious Praises forever. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 103 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Please, just for a moment, bless him with Your Glance of Grace. || 4 || 21 || 28 ||
MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Blessed are those words, by which the Naam is chanted. Rare
are those who know this, by Guru‟s Grace. Blessed is that time when one sings and
hears the Lord‟s Name. Blessed and approved is the coming of such a one. || 1 ||
Those eyes which behold the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan are approved and
accepted. Those hands which write the Praises of the Lord are good. Those feet which
walk in the Lord‟s Way are beautiful. I am a sacrifice to that Congregation in which the
Lord is recognized. || 2 || Listen, O my beloved friends and companions: in the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall be saved in an instant. The residues of your
sinful mistakes will be cut out; your mind will be immaculate and pure. Your comings
and goings shall cease. || 3 || With my palms pressed together, I offer this prayer:
please bless me with Your Mercy, and save this sinking stone. God has become merciful
to Nanak; God is pleasing to Nanak‟s mind. || 4 || 22 || 29 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL:
The Word of Your Bani, Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar. Hearing it again and again, I am
elevated to the supreme heights. The burning within me has been extinguished, and my
mind has been cooled and soothed, by the Blessed Vision of the True Guru. || 1 ||
Happiness is obtained, and sorrow runs far away, when the Saints chant the Lord‟s
Name. The sea, the dry land, and the lakes are filled with the Water of the Lord‟s
Name; no place is left empty. || 2 || The Creator has showered His Kindness; He
cherishes and nurtures all beings and creatures. He is Merciful, Kind and
Compassionate. All are satisfied and fulfilled through Him. || 3 || The woods, the
meadows and the three worlds are rendered green. The Doer of all did this in an
instant. As Gurmukh, Nanak meditates on the One who fulfills the desires of the mind.
|| 4 || 23 || 30 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: You are my Father, and You are my Mother.
You are my Relative, and You are my Brother. You are my Protector everywhere; why
should I feel any fear or anxiety? || 1 || By Your Grace, I recognize You. You are my
Shelter, and You are my Honor. Without You, there is no other; the entire Universe is
the Arena of Your Play. || 2 || You have created all beings and creatures. As it
pleases You, You assign tasks to one and all. All things are Your Doing; we can do
nothing ourselves. || 3 || Meditating on the Naam, I have found great peace. Singing
the Glorious Praises of the Lord, my mind is cooled and soothed. Through the Perfect
Guru, congratulations are pouring in—Nanak is victorious on the arduous battlefield of
life! || 4 || 24 || 31 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: God is the Breath of Life of my soul, the
Support of my mind. His devotees live by singing the Glorious Praises of the Infinite
Lord. The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is the Treasure of Excellence. Meditating,
meditating on the Lord‟s Name, I have found peace. || 1 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 104 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
One whose heart‟s desires lead him from his own home to the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, shall be rid of the cycle of birth and death. His hopes and desires
are fulfilled, when he gains the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan. || 2 || The
limits of the Inaccessible and Unfathomable Lord cannot be known. The seekers, the
Siddhas, those beings of miraculous spiritual powers, and the spiritual teachers, all
meditate on Him. Thus, their egos are erased, and their doubts are dispelled. The Guru
has enlightened their minds. || 3 || I chant the Name of the Lord, the Treasure of
bliss, joy, salvation, intuitive peace and poise. When my Lord and Master blessed me
with His Mercy, O Nanak, then His Name entered the home of my mind. || 4 || 24 ||
32 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Hearing of You, I live. You are my Beloved, my Lord and
Master, Utterly Great. You alone know Your Ways; I grasp Your Support, Lord of the
World. || 1 || Singing Your Glorious Praises, my mind is rejuvenated. Hearing Your
Sermon, all filth is removed. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I
meditate forever on the Merciful Lord. || 2 || I dwell on my God with each and every
breath. This understanding has been implanted within my mind, by Guru‟s Grace. By
Your Grace, the Divine Light has dawned. The Merciful Lord cherishes everyone. || 3 ||
True, True, True is that God. Forever, forever and ever, He Himself is. Your Playful
Ways are revealed, O my Beloved. Beholding them, Nanak is enraptured. || 4 || 26 ||
33 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: By His Command, the rain begins to fall. The Saints and
friends have met to chant the Naam. Serene tranquility and peaceful ease have come;
God Himself has brought a deep and profound peace. || 1 || God has produced
everything in great abundance. Granting His Grace, God has satisfied all. Bless us with
Your Gifts, O my Great Giver. All beings and creatures are satisfied. || 2 || True is the
Master, and True is His Name. By Guru‟s Grace, I meditate forever on Him. The fear of
birth and death has been dispelled; emotional attachment, sorrow and suffering have
been erased. || 3 || With each and every breath, Nanak praises the Lord. Meditating
in remembrance on the Name, all bonds are cut away. One‟s hopes are fulfilled in an
instant, chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. || 4 || 27 || 34 ||
MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Come, dear friends, Saints and companions: let us join together
and sing the Glorious Praises of the Inaccessible and Infinite Lord. Those who sing and
hear these praises are liberated, so let us meditate on the One who created us. || 1 ||
The sinful residues of countless incarnations depart, and we receive the fruits of the
mind‟s desires. So meditate on that Lord, our True Lord and Master, who gives
sustenance to all. || 2 || Chanting the Naam, all pleasures are obtained. All fears are
erased, meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. One who serves the Lord swims
across to the other side, and all his affairs are resolved. || 3 || I have come to Your
Sanctuary; if it pleases You, unite me with You. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 105 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Shower Your Mercy upon me, God; let me be committed to devotional worship. Nanak
drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of Truth. || 4 || 28 || 35 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: The
Lord of the Universe, the Support of the earth, has become Merciful; the rain is falling
everywhere. He is Merciful to the meek, always Kind and Gentle; the Creator has
brought cooling relief. || 1 || He cherishes all His beings and creatures, as the mother
cares for her children. The Destroyer of pain, the Ocean of Peace, the Lord and Master
gives sustenance to all. || 2 || The Merciful Lord is totally pervading and permeating
the water and the land. I am forever devoted, a sacrifice to Him. Night and day, I
always meditate on Him; in an instant, He saves all. || 3 || God Himself protects all;
He drives out all sorrow and suffering. Chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the
mind and body are rejuvenated. O Nanak, God has bestowed His Glance of Grace. || 4
|| 29 || 36 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Where the Naam, the Name of God the Beloved
is chanted—those barren places become mansions of gold. Where the Naam, the Name
of my Lord of the Universe is not chanted—those towns are like the barren wilderness.
|| 1 || One who meditates as he eats dry bread, sees the Blessed Lord inwardly and
outwardly. Know this well, that one who eats and eats while practicing evil, is like a field
of poisonous plants. || 2 || One who does not feel love for the Saints, misbehaves in
the company of the wicked shaaktas, the faithless cynics; he wastes this human body,
so difficult to obtain. In his ignorance, he tears up his own roots. || 3 || I seek Your
Sanctuary, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek, Ocean of Peace, my Guru, Sustainer of the
world. Shower Your Mercy upon Nanak, that he may sing Your Glorious Praises; please,
preserve my honor. || 4 || 30 || 37 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: I cherish in my heart
the Feet of my Lord and Master. All my troubles and sufferings have run away. The
music of intuitive peace, poise and tranquility wells up within; I dwell in the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy. || 1 || The bonds of love with the Lord are never
broken. The Lord is totally permeating and pervading inside and out. Meditating,
meditating, meditating in remembrance on Him, singing His Glorious Praises, the noose
of death is cut away. || 2 || The Ambrosial Nectar, the Unstruck Melody of Gurbani
rains down continually; deep within my mind and body, peace and tranquility have
come. Your humble servants remain satisfied and fulfilled, and the True Guru blesses
them with encouragement and comfort. || 3 || We are His, and from Him, we receive
our rewards. Showering His Mercy upon us, God has united us with Him. Our comings
and goings have ended, and through great good fortune, O Nanak, our hopes are
fulfilled. || 4 || 31 || 38 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: The rain has fallen; I have found
the Transcendent Lord God. All beings and creatures dwell in peace. Suffering has been
dispelled, and true happiness has dawned, as we meditate on the Name of the Lord,
Har, Har. || 1 || The One, to whom we belong, cherishes and nurtures us. The
Supreme Lord God has become our Protector. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 106 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
My Lord and Master has heard my prayer; my efforts have been rewarded. || 2 || He
is the Giver of all souls. By Guru‟s Grace, He blesses us with His Glance of Grace. The
beings in the water, on the land and in the sky are all satisfied; I wash the Feet of the
Holy. || 3 || He is the Fulfiller of the desires of the mind. Forever and ever, I am a
sacrifice to Him. O Nanak, the Destroyer of pain has given this Gift; I am imbued with
the Love of the Delightful Lord. || 4 || 32 || 39 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Mind and
body are Yours; all wealth is Yours. You are my God, my Lord and Master. Body and
soul and all riches are Yours. Yours is the Power, O Lord of the World. || 1 || Forever
and ever, You are the Giver of Peace. I bow down and fall at Your Feet. I act as it
pleases You, as You cause me to act, Kind and Compassionate Dear Lord. || 2 || O
God, from You I receive; You are my decoration. Whatever You give me, brings me
happiness. Wherever You keep me, is heaven. You are the Cherisher of all. || 3 ||
Meditating, meditating in remembrance, Nanak has found peace. Twenty-four hours a
day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. All my hopes and desires are fulfilled; I shall never
again suffer sorrow. || 4 || 33 || 40 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: The Supreme Lord God
has unleashed the rain clouds. Over the sea and over the land—over all the earth‟s
surface, in all directions, He has brought the rain. Peace has come, and the thirst of all
has been quenched; there is joy and ecstasy everywhere. || 1 || He is the Giver of
Peace, the Destroyer of pain. He gives and forgives all beings. He Himself nurtures and
cherishes His Creation. I fall at His Feet and surrender to Him. || 2 || Seeking His
Sanctuary, salvation is obtained. With each and every breath, I meditate on the Lord‟s
Name. Without Him, there is no other Lord and Master. All places belong to Him. || 3 ||
Yours is the Honor, God, and Yours is the Power. You are the True Lord and Master, the
Ocean of Excellence. Servant Nanak utters this prayer: may I meditate on You twentyfour hours a day. || 4 || 34 || 41 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: All happiness comes,
when God is pleased. The Feet of the Perfect Guru dwell in my mind. I am intuitively
absorbed in the state of Samaadhi deep within. God alone knows this sweet pleasure.
|| 1 || My Lord and Master is Inaccessible and Unfathomable. Deep within each and
every heart, He dwells near and close at hand. He is always detached; He is the Giver
of souls. How rare is that person who understands his own self. || 2 || This is the sign
of union with God: in the mind, the Command of the True Lord is recognized. Intuitive
peace and poise, contentment, enduring satisfaction and bliss come through the
Pleasure of the Master‟s Will. || 3 || God, the Great Giver, has given me His Hand. He
has erased all the sickness of birth and death. O Nanak, those whom God has made His
slaves, rejoice in the pleasure of singing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 107 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
4 || 35 || 42 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: The Life of the World, the Sustainer of the
Earth, has showered His Mercy; the Guru‟s Feet have come to dwell within my mind.
The Creator has made me His Own. He has destroyed the city of sorrow. || 1 || The
True One abides within my mind and body; no place seems difficult to me now. All the
evil-doers and enemies have now become my friends. I long only for my Lord and
Master. || 2 || Whatever He does, He does all by Himself. No one can know His Ways.
He Himself is the Helper and Support of His Saints. God has cast out my doubts and
delusions. || 3 || His Lotus Feet are the Support of His humble servants. Twenty-four
hours a day, they deal in the Name of the Lord. In peace and pleasure, they sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. O Nanak, God is permeating everywhere.
|| 4 || 36 || 43 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: True is that temple, within which one
meditates on the True Lord. Blessed is that heart, within which the Lord‟s Glorious
Praises are sung. Beautiful is that land, where the Lord‟s humble servants dwell. I am a
sacrifice to the True Name. || 1 || The extent of the True Lord‟s Greatness cannot be
known. His Creative Power and His Bounties cannot be described. Your humble servants
live by meditating, meditating on You. Their minds treasure the True Word of the
Shabad. || 2 || The Praises of the True One are obtained by great good fortune. By
Guru‟s Grace, the Glorious Praises of the Lord are sung. Those who are imbued with
Your Love are pleasing to You. The True Name is their Banner and Insignia. || 3 || No
one knows the limits of the True Lord. In all places and interspaces, the True One is
pervading. O Nanak, meditate forever on the True One, the Searcher of hearts, the
Knower of all. || 4 || 37 || 44 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Beautiful is the night, and
beautiful is the day, when one joins the Society of the Saints and chants the Ambrosial
Naam. If you remember the Lord in meditation for a moment, even for an instant, then
your life will become fruitful and prosperous. || 1 || Remembering the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, all sinful mistakes are erased. Inwardly and outwardly, the Lord God
is always with us. Fear, dread and doubt have been dispelled by the Perfect Guru; now,
I see God everywhere. || 2 || God is All-powerful, Vast, Lofty and Infinite. The Naam
is overflowing with the nine treasures. In the beginning, in the middle, and in the end,
there is God. Nothing else even comes close to Him. || 3 || Take pity on me, O my
Lord, Merciful to the meek. I am a beggar, begging for the dust of the feet of the Holy.
Servant Nanak begs for this gift: let me meditate on the Lord, forever and ever. || 4 ||
38 || 45 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: You are here, and You are hereafter. All beings and
creatures were created by You. Without You, there is no other, O Creator. You are my
Support and my Protection. || 1 || The tongue lives by chanting and meditating on
the Lord‟s Name. The Supreme Lord God is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts.
Those who serve the Lord find peace; they do not lose their lives in the gamble. || 2 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 108 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Your humble servant, who obtains the Medicine of the Naam, is rid of the illnesses of
countless lifetimes and incarnations. So sing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises, day and
night. This is the most fruitful occupation. || 3 || Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He
has adorned His slave. Deep within each and every heart, the Supreme Lord is humbly
worshipped. Without the One, there is no other at all. O Baba Nanak, this is the most
excellent wisdom. || 4 || 39 || 46 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: My mind and body are
imbued with love for the Lord. I sacrifice everything for Him. Twenty-four hours a day,
sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Do not forget Him, for even one
breath. || 1 || He is a companion, a friend, and a beloved of mine, who reflects upon
the Lord‟s Name, in the Company of the Holy. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, cross over the world-ocean, and the noose of death shall be cut away. || 2 ||
The four cardinal blessings are obtained by serving the Lord. The Elysian Tree, the
source of all blessings, is meditation on the Unseen and Unknowable Lord. The Guru
has cut out the sinful mistakes of sexual desire and anger, and my hopes have been
fulfilled. || 3 || That mortal who is blessed by perfect destiny meets the Lord, the
Sustainer of the Universe, in the Company of the Holy. O Nanak, if the Naam, the Name
of the Lord, dwells within the mind, one is approved and accepted, whether he is a
house-holder or a renunciate. || 4 || 40 || 47 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Meditating on
the Naam, the Name of the Lord, my heart is filled with peace. By His Grace, His
devotees become famous and acclaimed. Joining the Society of the Saints, I chant the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har; the disease of laziness has disappeared. || 1 || O
Siblings of Destiny, the nine treasures are found in the Home of the Lord; He comes to
meet those who deserve it by their past actions. The Perfect Transcendent Lord is
spiritual wisdom and meditation. God is All-powerful to do all things. || 2 || In an
instant, He establishes and disestablishes. He Himself is the One, and He Himself is the
Many. Filth does not stick to the Giver, the Life of the World. Gazing upon the Blessed
Vision of His Darshan, the pain of separation departs. || 3 || Holding on to the hem of
His Robe, the entire Universe is saved. He Himself causes His Name to be chanted. The
Boat of the Guru is found by His Grace; O Nanak, such blessed destiny is pre-ordained.
|| 4 || 41 || 48 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: People do whatever the Lord inspires them
to do. Wherever He keeps us is a good place. That person is clever and honorable, unto
whom the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command seems sweet. || 1 || Everything is strung
upon the One String of the Lord. Those whom the Lord attaches, are attached to His
Feet. Those, whose inverted lotus of the crown chakra is illuminated, see the
Immaculate Lord everywhere. || 2 || Only You Yourself know Your Glory. You
Yourself recognize Your Own Self. I am a sacrifice to Your Saints, who have crushed
their sexual desire, anger and greed. || 3 || You have no hatred or vengeance; Your
Saints are immaculate and pure. Seeing them, all sins depart. Nanak lives by
meditating, meditating on the Naam. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 109 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
His stubborn doubt and fear have departed. || 4 || 42 || 49 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL:
One who asks for a false gift, shall not take even an instant to die. But one who
continually serves the Supreme Lord God and meets the Guru, is said to be immortal.
|| 1 || One whose mind is dedicated to loving devotional worship sings His Glorious
Praises night and day, and remains forever awake and aware. Taking him by the hand,
the Lord and Master merges into Himself that person, upon whose forehead such
destiny is written. || 2 || His Lotus Feet dwell in the minds of His devotees. Without
the Transcendent Lord, all are plundered. I long for the dust of the feet of His humble
servants. The Name of the True Lord is my decoration. || 3 || Standing up and sitting
down, I sing the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Meditating in remembrance on Him, I
obtain my Eternal Husband Lord. God has become merciful to Nanak. I cheerfully
accept Your Will. || 4 || 43 || 50 ||
RAAG MAAJH, ASHTAPADEES: FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

By His Command, all are attuned to the Word of the Shabad, and all are called to the
Mansion of His Presence, the True Court of the Lord. O my True Lord and Master,
Merciful to the meek, my mind is pleased and appeased by the Truth. || 1 || I am a
sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who are adorned with the Word of the Shabad.
The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is forever the Giver of Peace. Through the
Guru‟s Teachings, it dwells in the mind. || 1 || Pause || No one is mine, and I am no
one else‟s. The True Lord and Master of the three worlds is mine. Acting in egotism, so
very many have died. After making mistakes, they later repent and regret. || 2 ||
Those who recognize the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command chant the Glorious Praises of
the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they are glorified with the Naam.
Everyone‟s account is kept in the True Court, and through the Beauty of the Naam, they
are saved. || 3 || The self-willed manmukhs are deluded; they find no place of rest.
Bound and gagged at Death‟s Door, they are brutally beaten. Without the Name, there
are no companions or friends. Liberation comes only by meditating on the Naam. || 4
|| The false shaaktas, the faithless cynics, do not like the Truth. Bound by duality,
they come and go in reincarnation. No one can erase pre-recorded destiny; the
Gurmukhs are liberated. || 5 || In this world of her parents‟ house, the young bride
did not know her Husband. Through falsehood, she has been separated from Him, and
she cries out in misery. Defrauded by demerits, she does not find the Mansion of the
Lord‟s Presence. But through virtuous actions, her demerits are forgiven. || 6 || She,
who knows her Beloved in her parents‟ house, as Gurmukh, comes to understand the
essence of reality; she contemplates her Lord. Her comings and goings cease, and she
is absorbed in the True Name. || 7 || The Gurmukhs understand and describe the
Indescribable. True is our Lord and Master; He loves the Truth. Nanak offers this true
prayer: singing His Glorious Praises, I merge with the True One. || 8 || 1 || MAAJH,
THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: By His Mercy, we meet the True Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 110 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Center your awareness on seva—selfless service—and focus your consciousness on the
Word of the Shabad. Subduing your ego, you shall find a lasting peace, and your
emotional attachment to Maya will be dispelled. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a
sacrifice, I am totally devoted to the True Guru. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the
Divine Light has dawned; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. || 1 ||
Pause || Search your body and mind, and find the Name. Restrain your wandering
mind, and keep it in check. Night and day, sing the Songs of the Guru‟s Bani; worship
the Lord with intuitive devotion. || 2 || Within this body are countless objects. The
Gurmukh attains Truth, and comes to see them. Beyond the nine gates, the Tenth Gate
is found, and liberation is obtained. The Unstruck Melody of the Shabad vibrates. || 3
|| True is the Master, and True is His Name. By Guru‟s Grace, He comes to dwell
within the mind. Night and day, remain attuned to the Lord‟s Love forever, and you
shall obtain understanding in the True Court. || 4 || Those who do not understand
the nature of sin and virtue are attached to duality; they wander around deluded. The
ignorant and blind people do not know the way; they come and go in reincarnation over
and over again. || 5 || Serving the Guru, I have found eternal peace; my ego has
been silenced and subdued. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the darkness has been
dispelled, and the heavy doors have been opened. || 6 || Subduing my ego, I have
enshrined the Lord within my mind. I focus my consciousness on the Guru‟s Feet
forever. By Guru‟s Grace, my mind and body are immaculate and pure; I meditate on
the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 7 || From birth to death, everything
is for You. You bestow greatness upon those whom You have forgiven. O Nanak,
meditating forever on the Naam, you shall be blessed in both birth and death. || 8 || 1
|| 2 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: My God is Immaculate, Inaccessible and Infinite.
Without a scale, He weighs the universe. One who becomes Gurmukh, understands.
Chanting His Glorious Praises, he is absorbed into the Lord of Virtue. || 1 || I am a
sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those whose minds are filled with the Name of the
Lord. Those who are committed to Truth remain awake and aware night and day. They
are honored in the True Court. || 1 || Pause || He Himself hears, and He Himself
sees. Those, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace, become acceptable. They are
attached, whom the Lord Himself attaches; as Gurmukh, they live the Truth. || 2 ||
Those whom the Lord Himself misleads—whose hand can they take? That which is preordained, cannot be erased. Those who meet the True Guru are very fortunate and
blessed; through perfect karma, He is met. || 3 || The young bride is fast asleep in
her parents‟ home, night and day. She has forgotten her Husband Lord; because of her
faults and demerits, she is abandoned. She wanders around continually, crying out,
night and day. Without her Husband Lord, she cannot get any sleep. || 4 || In this
world of her parents‟ home, she may come to know the Giver of peace, if she subdues
her ego, and recognizes the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Her bed is beautiful; she
ravishes and enjoys her Husband Lord forever. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 111 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
She is adorned with the Decorations of Truth. || 5 || He created the 8.4 million
species of beings. Those, upon whom He casts His Glance of Grace, come to meet the
Guru. Shedding the residues of their sinful mistakes, His servants are forever pure; at
the True Court, they are beautified by the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 6 || When
they are called to settle their accounts, who will answer then? There shall be no peace
then, from counting out by twos and threes. The True Lord God Himself forgives, and
having forgiven, He unites them with Himself. || 7 || He Himself does, and He
Himself causes all to be done. Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, He is
met. O Nanak, through the Naam, greatness is obtained. He Himself unites in His
Union. || 8 || 2 || 3 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The One Lord Himself moves about
imperceptibly. As Gurmukh, I see Him, and then this mind is pleased and uplifted.
Renouncing desire, I have found intuitive peace and poise; I have enshrined the One
within my mind. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who focus
their consciousness on the One. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, my mind has come to
its only home; it is imbued with the True Color of the Lord‟s Love. || 1 || Pause ||
This world is deluded; You Yourself have deluded it. Forgetting the One, it has become
engrossed in duality. Night and day, it wanders around endlessly, deluded by doubt;
without the Name, it suffers in pain. || 2 || Those who are attuned to the Love of the
Lord, the Architect of Destiny—by serving the Guru, they are known throughout the
four ages. Those, upon whom the Lord bestows greatness, are absorbed in the Name of
the Lord. || 3 || Being in love with Maya, they do not think of the Lord. Bound and
gagged in the City of Death, they suffer in terrible pain. Blind and deaf, they see
nothing at all; the self-willed manmukhs rot away in sin. || 4 || Those, whom You
attach to Your Love, are attuned to Your Love. Through loving devotional worship, they
become pleasing to Your Mind. They serve the True Guru, the Giver of eternal peace,
and all their desires are fulfilled. || 5 || O Dear Lord, I seek Your Sanctuary forever.
You Yourself forgive us, and bless us with Glorious Greatness. The Messenger of Death
does not draw near those who meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 6 ||
Night and day, they are attuned to His Love; they are pleasing to the Lord. My God
merges with them, and unites them in Union. Forever and ever, O True Lord, I seek the
Protection of Your Sanctuary; You Yourself inspire us to understand the Truth. || 7 ||
Those who know the Truth are absorbed in Truth. They sing the Lord‟s Glorious Praises,
and speak the Truth. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam remain unattached
and balanced; in the home of the inner self, they are absorbed in the primal trance of
deep meditation. || 8 || 3 || 4 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: One who dies in the Word of
the Shabad is truly dead. Death does not crush him, and pain does not afflict him. His
light merges and is absorbed into the Light, when he hears and merges in the Truth. ||
1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to the Lord‟s Name, which brings us to
glory. One who serves the True Guru, and focuses his consciousness on Truth,
following the Guru‟s Teachings, is absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. || 1 || Pause
|| This human body is transitory, and transitory are the garments it wears. Attached to
duality, no one attains the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 112 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Night and day, day and night, they burn. Without her Husband Lord, the soul-bride
suffers in terrible pain. || 2 || Her body and her status shall not go with her to the
world hereafter. Where she is called to answer for her account, there, she shall be
emancipated only by true actions. Those who serve the True Guru shall prosper; here
and hereafter, they are absorbed in the Naam. || 3 || She who adorns herself with
the Love and the Fear of God, by Guru‟s Grace, obtains the Mansion of the Lord‟s
Presence as her home. Night and day, day and night, she constantly ravishes and
enjoys her Beloved. She is dyed in the permanent color of His Love. || 4 || The
Husband Lord abides with everyone, always; but how rare are those few who, by Guru‟s
Grace, obtain His Glance of Grace. My God is the Highest of the High; granting His
Grace, He merges us into Himself. || 5 || This world is asleep in emotional
attachment to Maya. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, it ultimately comes to
ruin. The One who put it to sleep shall also awaken it. Through the Guru‟s Teachings,
understanding dawns. || 6 || One who drinks in this Nectar, shall have his delusions
dispelled. By Guru‟s Grace, the state of liberation is attained. One who is imbued with
devotion to the Lord, remains always balanced and detached. Subduing selfishness and
conceit, he is united with the Lord. || 7 || He Himself creates, and He Himself assigns
us to our tasks. He Himself gives sustenance to the 8.4 million species of beings. O
Nanak, those who meditate on the Naam are atuned to Truth. They do that which is
pleasing to His Will. || 8 || 4 || 5 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: Diamonds and rubies are
produced deep within the self. They are assayed and valued tthrough the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. Those who have gathered Truth, speak Truth; they apply the Touchstone of Truth. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine
the Word of the Guru‟s Bani within their minds. In the midst of the darkness of the
world, they obtain the Immaculate One, and their light merges into the Light. || 1 ||
Pause || Within this body are countless vast vistas; the Immaculate Naam is totally
Inaccessible and Infinite. He alone becomes Gurmukh and obtains it, whom the Lord
forgives, and unites with Himself. || 2 || My Lord and Master implants the Truth. By
Guru‟s Grace, one‟s consciousness is attached to the Truth. The Truest of the True is
pervading everywhere; the true ones merge in Truth. || 3 || The True Carefree Lord
is my Beloved. He cuts out our sinful mistakes and evil actions; with love and affection,
meditate forever on Him. He implants the Fear of God and loving devotional worship
within us. || 4 || Devotional worship is True, if it pleases the True Lord. He Himself
bestows it; He does not regret it later. He alone is the Giver of all beings. The Lord kills
with the Word of His Shabad, and then revives. || 5 || Other than You, Lord, nothing
is mine. I serve You, Lord, and I praise You. You unite me with Yourself, O True God.
Through perfect good karma You are obtained. || 6 || For me, there is no other like
You. By Your Glance of Grace, my body is blessed and sanctified. Night and day, the
Lord takes care of us and protects us. The Gurmukhs are absorbed in intuitive peace
and poise. || 7 || For me, there is no other as Great as You. You Yourself create, and
You Yourself destroy. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 113 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
You Yourself create, destroy and adorn. O Nanak, we are adorned and embellished with
the Naam. || 8 || 5 || 6 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: He is the Enjoyer of all hearts. The
Invisible, Inaccessible and Infinite is pervading everywhere. Meditating on my Lord God,
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I am intuitively absorbed in the Truth. || 1 ||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who implant the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad in their minds. When someone understands the Shabad, then he wrestles with
his own mind; subduing his desires, he merges with the Lord. || 1 || Pause || The
five enemies are plundering the world. The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not
understand or appreciate this. Those who become Gurmukh—their houses are
protected. The five enemies are destroyed by the Shabad. || 2 || The Gurmukhs are
forever imbued with love for the True One. They serve God with intuitive ease. Night
and day, they are intoxicated with His Love. Meeting with their Beloved, they sing the
Glorious Praises of the True one; they are honored in the Court of the Lord. || 3 ||
First, the One created Himself; second, the sense of duality; third, the three-phased
Maya. The fourth state, the highest, is obtained by the Gurmukh, who practices Truth,
and only Truth. || 4 || Everything which is pleasing to the True Lord is true. Those
who know the Truth merge in intuitive peace and poise. The life-style of the Gurmukh is
to serve the True Lord. He goes and blends with the True Lord. || 5 || Without the
True One, there is no other at all. Attached to duality, the world is distracted and
distressed to death. One who becomes Gurmukh knows only the One. Serving the One,
peace is obtained. || 6 || All beings and creatures are in the Protection of Your
Sanctuary. You place the chessmen on the board; You see the imperfect and the
perfect as well. Night and day, You cause people to act; You unite them in Union with
Yourself. || 7 || You Yourself unite, and You see Yourself close at hand. You Yourself
are totally pervading amongst all. O Nanak, God Himself is pervading and permeating
everywhere; only the Gurmukhs understand this. || 8 || 6 || 7 || MAAJH, THIRD
MEHL: The Nectar of the Guru‟s Bani is very sweet. Rare are the Gurmukhs who see
and taste it. The Divine Light dawns within, and the supreme essence is found. In the
True Court, the Word of the Shabad vibrates. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a
sacrifice, to those who focus their consciousness on the Guru‟s Feet. The True Guru is
the True Pool of Nectar; bathing in it, the mind is washed clean of all filth. || 1 ||
Pause || Your limits, O True Lord, are not known to anyone. Rare are those who, by
Guru‟s Grace, focus their consciousness on You. Praising You, I am never satisfied; such
is the hunger I feel for the True Name. || 2 || I see only the One, and no other. By
Guru‟s Grace, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. My thirst is quenched by the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad; I am absorbed in intuitive peace and poise. || 3 || The Priceless Jewel
is discarded like straw; the blind self-willed manmukhs are attached to the love of
duality. As they plant, so do they harvest. They shall not obtain peace, even in their
dreams. || 4 || Those who are blessed with His Mercy find the Lord. The Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad abides in the mind. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 114 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Night and day, they remain in the Fear of God; conquering their fears, their doubts are
dispelled. || 5 || Dispelling their doubts, they find a lasting peace. By Guru‟s Grace,
the supreme status is attained. Deep within, they are pure, and their words are pure as
well; intuitively, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 6 || They recite the
Simritees, the Shaastras and the Vedas, but deluded by doubt, they do not understand
the essence of reality. Without serving the True Guru, they find no peace; they earn
only pain and misery. || 7 || The Lord Himself acts; unto whom should we complain?
How can anyone complain that the Lord has made a mistake? O Nanak, the Lord
Himself does, and causes things to be done; chanting the Naam, we are absorbed in
the Naam. || 8 || 7 || 8 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: He Himself imbues us with His
Love, with effortless ease. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, we are dyed in the
color of the Lord‟s Love. This mind and body are so imbued, and this tongue is dyed in
the deep crimson color of the poppy. Through the Love and the Fear of God, we are
dyed in this color. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine
the Fearless Lord within their minds. By Guru‟s Grace, I meditate on the Fearless Lord;
the Shabad has carried me across the poisonous world-ocean. || 1 || Pause || The
idiotic self-willed manmukhs try to be clever, but in spite of their bathing and washing,
they shall not be acceptable. As they came, so shall they go, regretting the mistakes
they made. || 2 || The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not understand anything;
death was pre-ordained for them when they came into the world, but they do not
understand. The self-willed manmukhs may practice religious rituals, but they do not
obtain the Name; without the Name, they lose this life in vain. || 3 || The practice of
Truth is the essence of the Shabad. Through the Perfect Guru, the gate of salvation is
found. So, night and day, listen to the Word of the Guru‟s Bani, and the Shabad. Let
yourself be colored by this love. || 4 || The tongue, imbued with the Lord‟s Essence,
delights in His Love. My mind and body are enticed by the Lord‟s Sublime Love. I have
easily obtained my Darling Beloved; I am intuitively absorbed in celestial peace. || 5 ||
Those who have the Lord‟s Love within, sing His Glorious Praises; through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, they are intuitively absorbed in celestial peace. I am forever a
sacrifice to those who dedicate their consciousness to the Guru‟s Service. || 6 || The
True Lord is pleased with Truth, and only Truth. By Guru‟s Grace, one‟s inner being is
deeply imbued with His Love. Sitting in that blessed place, sing the Glorious Praises of
the Lord, who Himself inspires us to accept His Truth. || 7 || That one, upon whom
the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, obtains it. By Guru‟s Grace, egotism departs. O
Nanak, that one, within whose mind the Name dwells, is honored in the True Court. ||
8 || 8 || 9 || MAAJH THIRD MEHL: Serving the True Guru is the greatest greatness.
The Dear Lord automatically comes to dwell in the mind. The Dear Lord is the fruitbearing tree; drinking in the Ambrosial Nectar, thirst is quenched. || 1 || I am a
sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to the one who leads me to join the True Congregation.
The Lord Himself unites me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Through the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 115 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I serve the True Guru; the Word of His Shabad is beautiful. Through it, the Name of the
Lord comes to dwell within the mind. The Pure Lord removes the filth of egotism, and
we are honored in the True Court. || 2 || Without the Guru, the Naam cannot be
obtained. The Siddhas and the seekers lack it; they weep and wail. Without serving the
True Guru, peace is not obtained; through perfect destiny, the Guru is found. || 3 ||
This mind is a mirror; how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, see themselves in it. Rust
does not stick to those who burn their ego. The Unstruck Melody of the Bani resounds
through the Pure Word of the Shabad; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, we are
absorbed into the True One. || 4 || Without the True Guru, the Lord cannot be seen.
Granting His Grace, He Himself has allowed me to see Him. All by Himself, He Himself is
permeating and pervading; He is intuitively absorbed in celestial peace. || 5 || One
who becomes Gurmukh embraces love for the One. Doubt and duality are burned away
by the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Within his body, he deals and trades, and obtains
the Treasure of the True Name. || 6 || The life-style of the Gurmukh is sublime; he
sings the Praises of the Lord. The Gurmukh finds the gate of salvation. Night and day,
he is imbued with the Lord‟s Love. He sings the Lord‟s Glorious Praises, and he is called
to the Mansion of His Presence. || 7 || The True Guru, the Giver, is met when the
Lord leads us to meet Him. Through perfect destiny, the Shabad is enshrined in the
mind. O Nanak, the greatness of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained by
chanting the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. || 8 || 9 || 10 || MAAJH, THIRD
MEHL: Those who lose their own selves obtain everything. Through the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad, they enshrine Love for the True one. They trade in Truth, they gather in
Truth, and they deal only in Truth. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to
those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day. I am Yours, You are my
Lord and Master. You bestow greatness through the Word of Your Shabad. || 1 ||
Pause || That time, that moment is totally beautiful, when the True One becomes
pleasing to my mind. Serving the True One, true greatness is obtained. By Guru‟s
Grace, the True One is obtained. || 2 || The food of spiritual love is obtained when
the True Guru is pleased. Other essences are forgotten, when the Lord‟s Essence comes
to dwell in the mind. Truth, contentment and intuitive peace and poise are obtained
from the Bani, the Word of the Perfect Guru. || 3 || The blind and ignorant fools do
not serve the True Guru; how will they find the gate of salvation? They die and die,
over and over again, only to be reborn, over and over again. They are struck down at
Death‟s Door. || 4 || Those who know the essence of the Shabad, understand their
own selves. Immaculate is the speech of those who chant the Word of the Shabad.
Serving the True One, they find a lasting peace; they enshrine the nine treasures of the
Naam within their minds. || 5 || Beautiful is that place, which is pleasing to the Lord‟s
Mind. There, sitting in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the Glorious Praises of
the Lord are sung. Night and day, the True One is praised; the Immaculate Soundcurrent of the Naad resounds there. || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 116 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
6 || The wealth of the self-willed manmukhs is false, and false is their ostentatious
display. They practice falsehood, and suffer terrible pain. Deluded by doubt, they
wander day and night; through birth and death, they lose their lives. || 7 || My True
Lord and Master is very dear to me. The Shabad of the Perfect Guru is my Support. O
Nanak, one who obtains the Greatness of the Naam, looks upon pain and pleasure as
one and the same. || 8 || 10 || 11 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The four sources of
creation are Yours; the spoken word is Yours. Without the Name, all are deluded by
doubt. Serving the Guru, the Lord‟s Name is obtained. Without the True Guru, no one
can receive it. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who focus their
consciousness on the Lord. Through devotion to the Guru, the True One is found; He
comes to abide in the mind, with intuitive ease. || 1 || Pause || Serving the True
Guru, all things are obtained. As are the desires one harbors, so are the rewards one
receives. The True Guru is the Giver of all things; through perfect destiny, He is met. ||
2 || This mind is filthy and polluted; it does not meditate on the One. Deep within, it is
soiled and stained by the love of duality. The egotists may go on pilgrimages to holy
rivers, sacred shrines and foreign lands, but they only gather more of the dirt of
egotism. || 3 || Serving the True Guru, filth and pollution are removed. Those who
focus their consciousness on the Lord remain dead while yet alive. The True Lord is
Pure; no filth sticks to Him. Those who are attached to the True One have their filth
washed away. || 4 || Without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. The ignorant
ones are blind—there is only utter darkness for them. The maggots in manure do filthy
deeds, and in filth they rot and putrefy. Serving the Lord of Liberation, liberation is
achieved. The Word of the Shabad eradicates egotism and possessiveness. So serve the
Dear True Lord, night and day. By perfect good destiny, the Guru is found. || 6 || He
Himself forgives and unites in His Union. From the Perfect Guru, the Treasure of the
Naam is obtained. By the True Name, the mind is made true forever. Serving the True
Lord, sorrow is driven out. || 7 || He is always close at hand—do not think that He is
far away. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, recognize the Lord deep within your
own being. O Nanak, through the Naam, glorious greatness is received. Through the
Perfect Guru, the Naam is obtained. || 8 || 11 || 12 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: Those
who are True here, are True hereafter as well. That mind is true, which is attuned to
the True Shabad. They serve the True One, and practice Truth; they earn Truth, and
only Truth. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those whose minds are
filled with the True Name. They serve the True One, and are absorbed into the True
One, singing the Glorious Praises of the True One. || 1 || Pause || The Pandits, the
religious scholars read, but they do not taste the essence. In love with duality and
Maya, their minds wander, unfocused. The love of Maya has displaced all their
understanding; making mistakes, they live in regret. But if they should meet the True
Guru, then they obtain the essence of reality; the Name of the Lord comes to dwell in
their minds. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 117 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Those who die in the Shabad and subdue their own minds, obtain the door of liberation.
|| 3 || They erase the residues of their sinful mistakes, and eliminate their anger; they
keep the Guru‟s Shabad clasped tightly to their hearts. Those who are attuned to Truth,
remain balanced and detached forever. Subduing their egotism, they are united with
the Lord. || 4 || Deep within the nucleus of the self is the jewel; we receive it only if
the Lord inspires us to receive it. The mind is bound by the three dispositions—the
three modes of Maya. Reading and reciting, the Pandits, the religious scholars, and the
silent sages have grown weary, but they have not found the supreme essence of the
fourth state. || 5 || The Lord Himself dyes us in the color of His Love. Only those who
are steeped in the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad are so imbued with His Love. Imbued
with the most beautiful color of the Lord‟s Love, they sing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, with great pleasure and joy. || 6 || To the Gurmukh, the True Lord is wealth,
miraculous spiritual powers and strict self-discipline. Through the spiritual wisdom of
the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Gurmukh is liberated. The Gurmukh practices
Truth, and is absorbed in the Truest of the True. || 7 || The Gurmukh realizes that
the Lord alone creates, and having created, He destroys. To the Gurmukh, the Lord
Himself is social class, status and all honor. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs meditate on the
Naam; through the Naam, they merge in the Naam. || 8 || 12 || 13 || MAAJH,
THIRD MEHL: Creation and destruction happen through the Word of the Shabad.
Through the Shabad, creation happens again. The Gurmukh knows that the True Lord is
all-pervading. The Gurmukh understands creation and merger. || 1 || I am a sacrifice,
my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Perfect Guru within their minds. From
the Guru comes peace and tranquility; worship Him with devotion, day and night.
Chanting His Glorious Praises, merge into the Glorious Lord. || 1 || Pause || The
Gurmukh sees the Lord on the earth, and the Gurmukh sees Him in the water. The
Gurmukh sees Him in wind and fire; such is the wonder of His Play. One who has no
Guru, dies over and over again, only to be re-born. One who has no Guru continues
coming and going in reincarnation. || 2 || The One Creator has set this play in
motion. In the frame of the human body, He has placed all things. Those few who are
pierced through by the Word of the Shabad, obtain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence.
He calls them into His Wondrous Palace. || 3 || True is the Banker, and true are His
traders. They purchase Truth, with infinite love for the Guru. They deal in Truth, and
they practice Truth. They earn Truth, and only Truth. || 4 || Without investment
capital, how can anyone acquire merchandise? The self-willed manmukhs have all gone
astray. Without true wealth, everyone goes empty-handed; going empty-handed, they
suffer in pain. || 5 || Some deal in Truth, through love of the Guru‟s Shabad. They
save themselves, and save all their ancestors as well. Very auspicious is the coming of
those who meet their Beloved and find peace. || 6 || Deep within the self is the
secret, but the fool looks for it outside. The blind self-willed manmukhs wander around
like demons; but where the secret is, there, they do not find it. The manmukhs are
deluded by doubt. || 7 || He Himself calls us, and bestows the Word of the Shabad.
The soul-bride finds intuitive peace and poise in the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. O
Nanak, she obtains the glorious greatness of the Naam; she hears it again and again,
and she meditates on it. || 8 || 13 || 14 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The True Guru has
imparted the True Teachings. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 118 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Think of the Lord, who shall be your Help and Support in the end. The Lord is
Inaccessible and Incomprehensible. He has no master, and He is not born. He is
obtained through love of the True Guru. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice,
to those who eliminate selfishness and conceit. They eradicate selfishness and conceit,
and then find the Lord; they are intuitively immersed in the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
According to their pre-ordained destiny, they act out their karma. Serving the True
Guru, a lasting peace is found. Without good fortune, the Guru is not found. Through
the Word of the Shabad, they are united in the Lord‟s Union. || 2 || The Gurmukhs
remain unaffected in the midst of the world. The Guru is their cushion, and the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, is their Support. Who can oppress the Gurmukh? One who tries
shall perish, writhing in pain. || 3 || The blind self-willed manmukhs have no
understanding at all. They are the assassins of the self, and the butchers of the world.
By continually slandering others, they carry a terrible load, and they carry the loads of
others for nothing. || 4 || This world is a garden, and my Lord God is the Gardener.
He always takes care of it—nothing is exempt from His Care. As is the fragrance which
He bestows, so is the fragrant flower known. || 5 || The self-willed manmukhs are
sick and diseased in the world. They have forgotten the Giver of peace, the
Unfathomable, the Infinite. These miserable people wander endlessly, crying out in
pain; without the Guru, they find no peace. || 6 || The One who created them, knows
their condition. And if He inspires them, then they realize the Hukam of His Command.
Whatever He places within them, that is what prevails, and so they outwardly appear.
|| 7 || I know of no other except the True One. Those, whom the Lord attaches to
Himself, become pure. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within
the heart of those, unto whom He has given it. || 8 || 14 || 15 || MAAJH, THIRD
MEHL: Enshrining the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, in the mind, all the pains
of egotism, selfishness and conceit are eliminated. By continually praising the Ambrosial
Bani of the Word, I obtain the Amrit, the Ambrosial Nectar. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my
soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Ambrosial Bani of the Word within their
minds. Enshrining the Ambrosial Bani in their minds, they meditate on the Ambrosial
Naam. || 1 || Pause || Those who continually chant the Ambrosial Words of Nectar
see and behold this Amrit everywhere with their eyes. They continually chant the
Ambrosial Sermon day and night; chanting it, they cause others to hear it. || 2 ||
Imbued with the Ambrosial Love of the Lord, they lovingly focus their attention on Him.
By Guru‟s Grace, they receive this Amrit. They chant the Ambrosial Name with their
tongues day and night; their minds and bodies are satisfied by this Amrit. || 3 || That
which God does is beyond anyone‟s consciousness; no one can erase the Hukam of His
Command. By His Command, the Ambrosial Bani of the Word prevails, and by His
Command, we drink in the Amrit. || 4 || The actions of the Creator Lord are
marvellous and wonderful. This mind is deluded, and goes around the wheel of
reincarnation. Those who focus their consciousness on the Ambrosial Bani of the Word,
hear the vibrations of the Ambrosial Word of the Shabad. || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 119 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
5 || You Yourself created the counterfeit and the genuine. You Yourself appraise all
people. You appraise the true, and place them in Your Treasury; You consign the false
to wander in delusion. || 6 || How can I behold You? How can I praise You? By Guru‟s
Grace, I praise You through the Word of the Shabad. In Your Sweet Will, the Amrit is
found; by Your Will, You inspire us to drink in this Amrit. || 7 || The Shabad is Amrit;
the Lord‟s Bani is Amrit. Serving the True Guru, it permeates the heart. O Nanak, the
Ambrosial Naam is forever the Giver of peace; drinking in this Amrit, all hunger is
satisfied. || 8 || 15 || 16 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The Ambrosial Nectar rains down,
softly and gently. How rare are those Gurmukhs who find it. Those who drink it in are
satisfied forever. Showering His Mercy upon them, the Lord quenches their thirst. || 1
|| I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those Gurmukhs who drink in this
Ambrosial Nectar. The tongue tastes the essence, and remains forever imbued with the
Lord‟s Love, intuitively singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || By
Guru‟s Grace, intuitive understanding is obtained; subduing the sense of duality, they
are in love with the One. When He bestows His Glance of Grace, then they sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord; by His Grace, they merge in Truth. || 2 || Above all is
Your Glance of Grace, O God. Upon some it is bestowed less, and upon others it is
bestowed more. Without You, nothing happens at all; the Gurmukhs understand this. ||
3 || The Gurmukhs contemplate the essence of reality; Your Treasures are overflowing
with Ambrosial Nectar. Without serving the True Guru, no one obtains it. It is obtained
only by Guru‟s Grace. || 4 || Those who serve the True Guru are beautiful. The
Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, entices their inner minds. Their minds and
bodies are attuned to the Ambrosial Bani of the Word; this Ambrosial Nectar is
intuitively heard. || 5 || The deluded, self-willed manmukhs are ruined through the
love of duality. They do not chant the Naam, and they die, eating poison. Night and
day, they continually sit in manure. Without selfless service, their lives are wasted
away. || 6 || They alone drink in this Amrit, whom the Lord Himself inspires to do so.
By Guru‟s Grace, they intuitively enshrine love for the Lord. The Perfect Lord is Himself
perfectly pervading everywhere; through the Guru‟s Teachings, He is perceived. || 7 ||
He Himself is the Immaculate Lord. He who has created, shall Himself destroy. O
Nanak, remember the Naam forever, and you shall merge into the True One with
intuitive ease. || 8 || 16 || 17 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: Those who please You are
linked to the Truth. They serve the True One forever, with intuitive ease. Through the
True Word of the Shabad, they praise the True One, and they merge in the merging of
Truth. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who praise the True
One. Those who meditate on the True One are attuned to Truth; they are absorbed into
the Truest of the True. || 1 || Pause || The True One is everywhere, wherever I
look. By Guru‟s Grace, I enshrine Him in my mind. True are the bodies of those whose
tongues are attuned to Truth. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 120 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They hear the Truth, and speak it with their mouths. || 2 || Subduing their desires,
they merge with the True One; they see in their minds that everyone comes and goes
in reincarnation. Serving the True Guru, they become stable forever, and they obtain
their dwelling in the home of the self. || 3 || Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
the Lord is seen within one‟s own heart. Through the Shabad, I have burned my
emotional attachment to Maya. I gaze upon the Truest of the True, and I praise Him.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I obtain the True One. || 4 || Those who are
attuned to Truth are blessed with the Love of the True One. Those who praise the
Lord‟s Name are very fortunate. Through the Word of His Shabad, the True One blends
with Himself, those who join the True Congregation and sing the Glorious Praises of the
True One. || 5 || We could read the account of the Lord, if He were in any account.
He is Inaccessible and Incomprehensible; through the Shabad, understanding is
obtained. Night and day, praise the True Word of the Shabad. There is no other way to
know His Worth. || 6 || People read and recite until they grow weary, but they do not
find peace. Consumed by desire, they have no understanding at all. They purchase
poison, and they are thirsty with their fascination for poison. Telling lies, they eat
poison. || 7 || By Guru‟s Grace, I know the One. Subduing my sense of duality, my
mind is absorbed into the True One. O Nanak, the One Name is pervading deep within
my mind; by Guru‟s Grace, I receive it. || 8 || 17 || 18 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: In
all colors and forms, You are pervading. People die over and over again; they are reborn, and make their rounds on the wheel of reincarnation. You alone are Eternal and
Unchanging, Inaccessible and Infinite. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, understanding is
imparted. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the
Lord‟s Name in their minds. The Lord has no form, features or color. Through the
Guru‟s Teachings, He inspires us to understand Him. || 1 || Pause || The One Light
is all-pervading; only a few know this. Serving the True Guru, this is revealed. In the
hidden and in the obvious, He is pervading all places. Our light merges into the Light.
|| 2 || The world is burning in the fire of desire, in greed, arrogance and excessive
ego. People die over and over again; they are re-born, and lose their honor. They waste
away their lives in vain. || 3 || Those who understand the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad
are very rare. Those who subdue their egotism, come to know the three worlds. Then,
they die, never to die again. They are intuitively absorbed in the True One. || 4 ||
They do not focus their consciousness on Maya again. They remain absorbed forever in
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. They praise the True One, who is contained deep
within all hearts. They are blessed and exalted by the Truest of the True. || 5 ||
Praise the True One, who is Ever-present. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He
is pervading everywhere. By Guru‟s Grace, we come to behold the True One; from the
True One, peace is obtained. || 6 || The True One permeates and pervades the mind
within. The True One is Eternal and Unchanging; He does not come and go in
reincarnation. Those who are attached to the True One are immaculate and pure.
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, they merge in the True One. || 7 || Praise the True
One, and no other. Serving Him, eternal peace is obtained. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 121 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam, reflect deeply on the Truth; they practice
only Truth. || 8 || 18 || 19 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The Word of the Shabad is
Immaculate and Pure; the Bani of the Word is Pure. The Light which is pervading
among all is Immaculate. So praise the Immaculate Word of the Lord‟s Bani; chanting
the Immaculate Name of the Lord, all filth is washed away. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my
soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Giver of peace within their minds. Praise
the Immaculate Lord, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Listen to the Shabad,
and quench your thirst. || 1 || Pause || When the Immaculate Naam comes to dwell
in the mind, the mind and body become Immaculate, and emotional attachment to
Maya departs. Sing the Glorious Praises of the Immaculate True Lord forever, and the
Immaculate Sound-current of the Naad shall vibrate within. || 2 || The Immaculate
Ambrosial Nectar is obtained from the Guru. When selfishness and conceit are
eradicated from within, then there is no attachment to Maya. Immaculate is the spiritual
wisdom, and utterly immaculate is the meditation, of those whose minds are filled with
the Immaculate Bani of the Word. || 3 || One who serves the Immaculate Lord
becomes immaculate. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the filth of egotism is
washed away. The Immaculate Bani and the Unstruck Melody of the Sound-current
vibrate, and in the True Court, honor is obtained. || 4 || Through the Immaculate
Lord, all become immaculate. Immaculate is the mind which weaves the Word of the
Lord‟s Shabad into itself. Blessed and very fortunate are those who are committed to
the Immaculate Name; through the Immaculate Name, they are blessed and beautified.
|| 5 || Immaculate is the one who is adorned with the Shabad. The Immaculate Naam,
the Name of the Lord, entices the mind and body. No filth ever attaches itself to the
True Name; one‟s face is made radiant by the True One. || 6 || The mind is polluted
by the love of duality. Filthy is that kitchen, and filthy is that dwelling; eating filth, the
self-willed manmukhs become even more filthy. Because of their filth, they suffer in
pain. || 7 || The filthy, and the immaculate as well, are all subject to the Hukam of
God‟s Command. They alone are immaculate, who are pleasing to the True Lord. O
Nanak, the Naam abides deep within the minds of the Gurmukhs, who are cleansed of
all their filth. || 8 || 19 || 20 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The Lord of the Universe is
radiant, and radiant are His soul-swans. Their minds and their speech are immaculate;
they are my hope and ideal. Their minds are radiant, and their faces are always
beautiful; they meditate on the most radiant Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || I
am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
of the Universe. So chant Gobind, Gobind, the Lord of the Universe, day and night; sing
the Glorious Praises of the Lord Gobind, through the Word of His Shabad. || 1 || Pause
|| Sing of the Lord Gobind with intuitive ease, in the Fear of the Guru; you shall
become radiant, and the filth of egotism shall depart. Remain in bliss forever, and
perform devotional worship, day and night. Hear and sing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord Gobind. || 2 || Channel your dancing mind in devotional worship, and through
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, merge your mind with the Supreme Mind. Let your true
and perfect tune be the subjugation of your love of Maya, and let yourself dance to the
Shabad. || 3 || People shout out loud and move their bodies, but if they are
emotionally attached to Maya, then the Messenger of Death shall hunt them down. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 122 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The love of Maya makes this mind dance, and the deceit within makes people suffer in
pain. || 4 || When the Lord inspires one to become Gurmukh, and perform devotional
worship, then his body and mind are attuned to His Love with intuitive ease. The Word
of His Bani vibrates, and the Word of His Shabad resounds, for the Gurmukh whose
devotional worship is accepted. || 5 || One may beat upon and play all sorts of
instruments, but no one will listen, and no one will enshrine it in the mind. For the sake
of Maya, they set the stage and dance, but they are in love with duality, and they
obtain only sorrow. || 6 || Those whose inner beings are attached to the Lord‟s Love
are liberated. They control their sexual desires, and their lifestyle is the self-discipline of
Truth. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they meditate forever on the Lord. This
devotional worship is pleasing to the Lord. || 7 || To live as Gurmukh is devotional
worship, throughout the four ages. This devotional worship is not obtained by any other
means. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is obtained only through devotion to
the Guru. So focus your consciousness on the Guru‟s Feet. || 8 || 20 || 21 || MAAJH,
THIRD MEHL: Serve the True One, and praise the True One. With the True Name, pain
shall never afflict you. Those who serve the Giver of peace find peace. They enshrine
the Guru‟s Teachings within their minds. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice,
to those who intuitively enter into the peace of Samaadhi. Those who serve the Lord
are always beautiful. The glory of their intuitive awareness is beautiful. || 1 || Pause
|| All call themselves Your devotees, but they alone are Your devotees, who are
pleasing to Your mind. Through the True Word of Your Bani, they praise You; attuned
to Your Love, they worship You with devotion. || 2 || All are Yours, O Dear True Lord.
Meeting the Gurmukh, this cycle of reincarnation comes to an end. When it pleases
Your Will, then we merge in the Name. You Yourself inspire us to chant the Name. || 3
|| Through the Guru‟s Teachings, I enshrine the Lord within my mind. Pleasure and
pain, and all emotional attachments are gone. I am lovingly centered on the One Lord
forever. I enshrine the Lord‟s Name within my mind. || 4 || Your devotees are
attuned to Your Love; they are always joyful. The nine treasures of the Naam come to
dwell within their minds. By perfect destiny, they find the True Guru, and through the
Word of the Shabad, they are united in the Lord‟s Union. || 5 || You are Merciful, and
always the Giver of peace. You Yourself unite us; You are known only to the Gurmukhs.
You Yourself bestow the glorious greatness of the Naam; attuned to the Naam, we find
peace. || 6 || Forever and ever, O True Lord, I praise You. As Gurmukh, I know no
other at all. My mind remains immersed in the One Lord; my mind surrenders to Him,
and in my mind I meet Him. || 7 || One who becomes Gurmukh, praises the Lord.
Our True Lord and Master is Carefree. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
abides deep within the mind; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, we merge with
the Lord. || 8 || 21 || 22 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: Your devotees look beautiful in
the True Court. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they are adorned with the
Naam. They are forever in bliss, day and night; chanting the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, they merge with the Lord of Glory. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 123 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who hear and enshrine the
Naam within their minds. The Dear Lord, the True One, the Highest of the High,
subdues their ego and blends them with Himself. || 1 || Pause || True is the Dear
Lord, and True is His Name. By Guru‟s Grace, some merge with Him. Through the Word
of the Guru‟s Shabad, those who merge with the Lord shall not be separated from Him
again. They merge with intuitive ease into the True Lord. || 2 || There is nothing
beyond You; You are the One who does, sees, and knows. The Creator Himself acts,
and inspires others to act. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, He blends us into Himself. ||
3 || The virtuous soul-bride finds the Lord; she decorates herself with the Love and
the Fear of God. She who serves the True Guru is forever a happy soul-bride. She is
absorbed in the true teachings. || 4 || Those who forget the Word of the Shabad
have no home and no place of rest. They are deluded by doubt, like a crow in a
deserted house. They forfeit both this world and the next, and they pass their lives
suffering in pain and misery. || 5 || Writing on and on endlessly, they run out of
paper and ink. Through the love with duality, no one has found peace. They write
falsehood, and they practice falsehood; they are burnt to ashes by focusing their
consciousness on falsehood. || 6 || The Gurmukhs write and reflect on Truth, and
only Truth. The true ones find the gate of salvation. True is their paper, pen and ink;
writing Truth, they are absorbed in the True One. || 7 || My God sits deep within the
self; He watches over us. Those who meet the Lord, by Guru‟s Grace, are acceptable. O
Nanak, glorious greatness is received through the Naam, which is obtained through the
Perfect Guru. || 8 || 22 || 23 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The Divine Light of the
Supreme Soul shines forth from the Guru. The filth stuck to the ego is removed through
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. One who is imbued with devotional worship to the Lord
night and day becomes pure. Worshipping the Lord, He is obtained. || 1 || I am a
sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who themselves worship the Lord, and inspire
others to worship Him as well. I humbly bow to those devotees who chant the Glorious
Praises of the Lord, night and day. || 1 || Pause || The Creator Lord Himself is the
Doer of deeds. As He pleases, He applies us to our tasks. Through perfect destiny, we
serve the Guru; serving the Guru, peace is found. || 2 || Those who die, and remain
dead while yet alive, obtain it. By Guru‟s Grace, they enshrine the Lord within their
minds. Enshrining the Lord within their minds, they are liberated forever. With intuitive
ease, they merge into the Lord. || 3 || They perform all sorts of rituals, but they do
not obtain liberation through them. They wander around the countryside, and in love
with duality, they are ruined. The deceitful lose their lives in vain; without the Word of
the Shabad, they obtain only misery. || 4 || Those who restrain their wandering mind,
keeping it steady and stable, obtain the supreme status, by Guru‟s Grace. The True
Guru Himself unites us in Union with the Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 124 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Meeting the Beloved, peace is obtained. || 5 || Some are stuck in falsehood, and false
are the rewards they receive. In love with duality, they waste away their lives in vain.
They drown themselves, and drown their entire family; speaking lies, they eat poison.
|| 6 || How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, look within their bodies, into their minds.
Through loving devotion, their ego evaporates. The Siddhas, the seekers and the silent
sages continually, lovingly focus their consciousness, but they have not seen the mind
within the body. || 7 || The Creator Himself inspires us to work; what can anyone
else do? What can be done by our doing? O Nanak, the Lord bestows His Name; we
receive it, and enshrine it within the mind. || 8 || 23 || 24 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL:
Within this cave, there is an inexhaustible treasure. Within this cave, the Invisible and
Infinite Lord abides. He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is revealed; through the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, selfishness and conceit are eliminated. || 1 || I am a
sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Ambrosial Naam, the Name
of the Lord, within their minds. The taste of the Ambrosial Naam is very sweet! Through
the Guru‟s Teachings, drink in this Ambrosial Nectar. || 1 || Pause || Subduing
egotism, the rigid doors are opened. The Priceless Naam is obtained by Guru‟s Grace.
Without the Shabad, the Naam is not obtained. By Guru‟s Grace, it is implanted within
the mind. || 2 || The Guru has applied the true ointment of spiritual wisdom to my
eyes. Deep within, the Divine Light has dawned, and the darkness of ignorance has
been dispelled. My light has merged into the Light; my mind has surrendered, and I am
blessed with Glory in the Court of the Lord. || 3 || Those who look outside the body,
searching for the Lord, shall not receive the Naam; they shall instead be forced to suffer
the terrible pains of slavery. The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not understand; but
when they return once again to their own home, then, as Gurmukh, they find the
genuine article. || 4 || By Guru‟s Grace, the True Lord is found. Within your mind and
body, see the Lord, and the filth of egotism shall depart. Sitting in that place, sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord forever, and be absorbed in the True Word of the Shabad.
|| 5 || Those who close off the nine gates, and restrain the wandering mind, come to
dwell in the Home of the Tenth Gate. There, the Unstruck Melody of the Shabad
vibrates day and night. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Shabad is heard. || 6 ||
Without the Shabad, there is only darkness within. The genuine article is not found, and
the cycle of reincarnation does not end. The key is in the hands of the True Guru; no
one else can open this door. By perfect destiny, He is met. || 7 || You are the hidden
and the revealed in all places. Receiving Guru‟s Grace, this understanding is obtained. O
Nanak, praise the Naam forever; as Gurmukh, enshrine it within the mind. || 8 || 24 ||
25 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The Gurmukhs meet the Lord, and inspire others to
meet Him as well. Death does not see them, and pain does not afflict them. Subduing
egotism, they break all their bonds; as Gurmukh, they are adorned with the Word of the
Shabad. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who look beautiful in
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 125 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Gurmukhs sing, the Gurmukhs dance, and focus their consciousness on the Lord.
|| 1 || Pause || The Gurmukhs are celebrated in life and death. Their lives are not
wasted; they realize the Word of the Shabad. The Gurmukhs do not die; they are not
consumed by death. The Gurmukhs are absorbed in the True Lord. || 2 || The
Gurmukhs are honored in the Court of the Lord. The Gurmukhs eradicate selfishness
and conceit from within. They save themselves, and save all their families and ancestors
as well. The Gurmukhs redeem their lives. || 3 || The Gurmukhs never suffer bodily
pain. The Gurmukhs have the pain of egotism taken away. The minds of the Gurmukhs
are immaculate and pure; no filth ever sticks to them again. The Gurmukhs merge in
celestial peace. || 4 || The Gurmukhs obtain the Greatness of the Naam. The
Gurmukhs sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and obtain honor. They remain in bliss
forever, day and night. The Gurmukhs practice the Word of the Shabad. || 5 || The
Gurmukhs are attuned to the Shabad, night and day. The Gurmukhs are known
throughout the four ages. The Gurmukhs always sing the Glorious Praises of the
Immaculate Lord. Through the Shabad, they practice devotional worship. || 6 ||
Without the Guru, there is only pitch-black darkness. Seized by the Messenger of Death,
people cry out and scream. Night and day, they are diseased, like maggots in manure,
and in manure they endure agony. || 7 || The Gurmukhs know that the Lord alone
acts, and causes others to act. In the hearts of the Gurmukhs, the Lord Himself comes
to dwell. O Nanak, through the Naam, greatness is obtained. It is received from the
Perfect Guru. || 8 || 25 || 26 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The One Light is the light of
all bodies. The Perfect True Guru reveals it through the Word of the Shabad. He Himself
instills the sense of separation within our hearts; He Himself created the Creation. || 1
|| I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who sing the Glorious Praises of the
True Lord. Without the Guru, no one obtains intuitive wisdom; the Gurmukh is absorbed
in intuitive peace. || 1 || Pause || You Yourself are Beautiful, and You Yourself
entice the world. You Yourself, by Your Kind Mercy, weave the thread of the world. You
Yourself bestow pain and pleasure, O Creator. The Lord reveals Himself to the
Gurmukh. || 2 || The Creator Himself acts, and causes others to act. Through Him, the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is enshrined within the mind. The Ambrosial Word of the
Guru‟s Bani emanates from the Word of the Shabad. The Gurmukh speaks it and hears
it. || 3 || He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. One who breaks
out of bondage is liberated forever. The True Lord is liberated forever. The Unseen Lord
causes Himself to be seen. || 4 || He Himself is Maya, and He Himself is the Illusion.
He Himself has generated emotional attachment throughout the entire universe. He
Himself is the Giver of Virtue; He Himself sings the Lord‟s Glorious Praises. He chants
them and causes them to be heard. || 5 || He Himself acts, and causes others to act.
He Himself establishes and disestablishes. Without You, nothing can be done. You
Yourself have engaged all in their tasks. || 6 || He Himself kills, and He Himself
revives. He Himself unites us, and unites us in Union with Himself. Through selfless
service, eternal peace is obtained. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 126 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Gurmukh is absorbed in intuitive peace. || 7 || He Himself is the Highest of the
High. How rare are those who behold Him. He causes Himself to be seen. O Nanak, the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the hearts of those who see the Lord
themselves, and inspire others to see Him as well. || 8 || 26 || 27 || MAAJH, THIRD
MEHL: My God is pervading and permeating all places. By Guru‟s Grace, I have found
Him within the home of my own heart. I serve Him constantly, and I meditate on Him
single-mindedly. As Gurmukh, I am absorbed in the True One. || 1 || I am a sacrifice,
my soul is a sacrifice, to those who enshrine the Lord, the Life of the World, within their
minds. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, I merge with intuitive ease into the Lord, the Life
of the World, the Fearless One, the Great Giver. || 1 || Pause || Within the home of
the self is the earth, its support and the nether regions of the underworld. Within the
home of the self is the Eternally Young Beloved. The Giver of peace is eternally blissful.
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, we are absorbed in intuitive peace. || 2 || When the
body is filled with ego and selfishness, the cycle of birth and death does not end. One
who becomes Gurmukh subdues egotism, and meditates on the Truest of the True. ||
3 || Within this body are the two brothers, sin and virtue. When the two joined
together, the Universe was produced. Subduing both, and entering into the Home of
the One, through the Guru‟s Teachings, we are absorbed in intuitive peace. || 4 ||
Within the home of the self is the darkness of the love of duality. When the Divine Light
dawns, ego and selfishness are dispelled. The Giver of peace is revealed through the
Shabad, meditating upon the Naam, night and day. || 5 || Deep within the self is the
Light of God; It radiates throughout the expanse of His creation. Through the Guru‟s
Teachings, the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled. The heart-lotus blossoms
forth, and eternal peace is obtained, as one‟s light merges into the Light. || 6 ||
Within the mansion is the treasure house, overflowing with jewels. The Gurmukh
obtains the Infinite Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Gurmukh, the trader, always
purchases the merchandise of the Naam, and always reaps profits. || 7 || The Lord
Himself keeps this merchandise in stock, and He Himself distributes it. Rare is that
Gurmukh who trades in this. O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of
Grace, obtain it. Through His Mercy, it is enshrined in the mind. || 8 || 27 || 28 ||
MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The Lord Himself leads us to merge with Him and serve Him.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the love of duality is eradicated. The
Immaculate Lord is the Bestower of eternal virtue. The Lord Himself leads us to merge
in His Virtuous Goodness. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who
enshrine the Truest of the True within their hearts. The True Name is eternally pure
and immaculate. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, it is enshrined within the
mind. || 1 || Pause || The Guru Himself is the Giver, the Architect of Destiny. The
Gurmukh, the humble servant who serves the Lord, comes to know Him. Those humble
beings look beautiful forever in the Ambrosial Naam. Through the Guru‟s Teachings,
they receive the sublime essence of the Lord. || 2 || Within the cave of this body,
there is one beautiful place. Through the Perfect Guru, ego and doubt are dispelled.
Night and day, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; imbued with the Lord‟s Love, by
Guru‟s Grace, you shall find Him. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 127 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, search this cave. The Immaculate Naam, the
Name of the Lord, abides deep within the self. Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord,
and decorate yourself with the Shabad. Meeting with your Beloved, you shall find
peace. || 4 || The Messenger of Death imposes his tax on those who are attached to
duality. He inflicts punishment on those who forget the Name. They are called to
account for each instant and each moment. Every grain, every particle, is weighed and
counted. || 5 || One who does not remember her Husband Lord in this world is being
cheated by duality; she shall weep bitterly in the end. She is from an evil family; she is
ugly and vile. Even in her dreams, she does not meet her Husband Lord. || 6 || She
who enshrines her Husband Lord in her mind in this world—His Presence is revealed to
her by the Perfect Guru. That soul-bride keeps her Husband Lord clasped tightly to her
heart, and through the Word of the Shabad, she enjoys her Husband Lord upon His
Beautiful Bed. || 7 || The Lord Himself sends out the call, and He summons us to His
Presence. He enshrines His Name within our minds. O Nanak, one who receives the
greatness of the Naam night and day, constantly sings His Glorious Praises. || 8 || 28
|| 29 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: Sublime is their birth, and the place where they dwell.
Those who serve the True Guru remain detached in the home of their own being. They
abide in the Lord‟s Love, and constantly imbued with His Love, their minds are satisfied
and fulfilled with the Lord‟s Essence. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to
those who read of the Lord, who understand and enshrine Him within their minds. The
Gurmukhs read and praise the Lord‟s Name; they are honored in the True Court. || 1 ||
Pause || The Unseen and Inscrutable Lord is permeating and pervading everywhere.
He cannot be obtained by any effort. If the Lord grants His Grace, then we come to
meet the True Guru. By His Kindness, we are united in His Union. || 2 || One who
reads, while attached to duality, does not understand. He yearns for the three-phased
Maya. The bonds of the three-phased Maya are broken by the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. Through the Guru‟s Shabad, liberation is achieved. || 3 || This unstable mind
cannot be held steady. Attached to duality, it wanders in the ten directions. It is a
poisonous worm, drenched with poison, and in poison it rots away. || 4 || Practicing
egotism and selfishness, they try to impress others by showing off. They perform all
sorts of rituals, but they gain no acceptance. Without You, Lord, nothing happens at all.
You forgive those who are adorned with the Word of Your Shabad. || 5 || They are
born, and they die, but they do not understand the Lord. Night and day, they wander,
in love with duality. The lives of the self-willed manmukhs are useless; in the end, they
die, regretting and repenting. || 6 || The Husband is away, and the wife is getting
dressed up. This is what the blind, self-willed manmukhs are doing. They are not
honored in this world, and they shall find no shelter in the world hereafter. They are
wasting their lives in vain. || 7 || How rare are those who know the Name of the
Lord! Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, the Lord is realized. Night and
day, they perform the Lord‟s devotional service; day and night, they find intuitive peace.
|| 8 || That One Lord is pervading in all. Only a few, as Gurmukh, understand this. O
Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are beautiful. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 128 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Granting His Grace, God unites them with Himself. || 9 || 29 || 30 || MAAJH, THIRD
MEHL: The self-willed manmukhs read and recite; they are called Pandits—spiritual
scholars. But they are in love with duality, and they suffer in terrible pain. Intoxicated
with vice, they understand nothing at all. They are reincarnated, over and over again.
|| 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who subdue their ego, and unite
with the Lord. They serve the Guru, and the Lord dwells within their minds; they
intuitively drink in the sublime essence of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || The Pandits read
the Vedas, but they do not obtain the Lord‟s essence. Intoxicated with Maya, they argue
and debate. The foolish intellectuals are forever in spiritual darkness. The Gurmukhs
understand, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 2 || The Indescribable is
described only through the beauteous Word of the Shabad. Through the Guru‟s
Teachings, the Truth becomes pleasing to the mind. Those who speak of the truest of
the true, day and night—their minds are imbued with the Truth. || 3 || Those who are
attuned to Truth, love the Truth. The Lord Himself bestows this gift; He shall not take it
back. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the True Lord is known forever; meeting
the True One, peace is found. || 4 || The filth of fraud and falsehood does not stick to
those who, by Guru‟s Grace, remain awake and aware, night and day. The Immaculate
Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within their hearts; their light merges into
the Light. || 5 || They read about the three qualities, but they do not know the
essential reality of the Lord. They forget the Primal Lord, the Source of all, and they do
not recognize the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. They are engrossed in emotional
attachment; they do not understand anything at all. Through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, the Lord is found. || 6 || The Vedas proclaim that Maya is of three qualities.
The self-willed manmukhs, in love with duality, do not understand. They read of the
three qualities, but they do not know the One Lord. Without understanding, they obtain
only pain and suffering. || 7 || When it pleases the Lord, He unites us with Himself.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, skepticism and suffering are dispelled. O
Nanak, True is the Greatness of the Name. Believing in the Name, peace is obtained. ||
8 || 30 || 31 || MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The Lord Himself is Unmanifest and Unrelated;
He is Manifest and Related as well. Those who recognize this essential reality are the
true Pandits, the spiritual scholars. They save themselves, and save all their families
and ancestors as well, when they enshrine the Lord‟s Name in the mind. || 1 || I am
a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who taste the essence of the Lord, and savor
its taste. Those who taste this essence of the Lord are the pure, immaculate beings.
They meditate on the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
Those who reflect upon the Shabad are beyond karma. They subdue their ego, and find
the essence of wisdom, deep within their being. They obtain the nine treasures of the
wealth of the Naam. Rising above the three qualities, they merge into the Lord. || 2 ||
Those who act in ego do not go beyond karma. It is only by Guru‟s Grace that one is rid
of ego. Those who have discriminating minds, continually examine their own selves.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they sing the Lord‟s Glorious Praises. || 3 ||
The Lord is the most pure and sublime Ocean. The Saintly Gurmukhs continually peck
at the Naam, like swans pecking at pearls in the ocean. They bathe in it continually, day
and night, and the filth of ego is washed away. || 4 || The pure swans, with love and
affection, dwell in the Ocean of the Lord, and subdue their ego. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 129 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Day and night, they are in love with the True Word of the Shabad. They obtain their
home in the Ocean of the Lord. || 5 || The self-willed manmukhs shall always be
filthy cranes, smeared with the filth of ego. They may bathe, but their filth is not
removed. One who dies while yet alive, and contemplates the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, is rid of this filth of ego. || 6 || The Priceless Jewel is found, in the home of
one‟s own being, when one listens to the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect True Guru.
By Guru‟s Grace, the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled; I have come to
recognize the Divine Light within my own heart. || 7 || The Lord Himself creates, and
He Himself beholds. Serving the True Guru, one becomes acceptable. O Nanak, the
Naam dwells deep within the heart; by Guru‟s Grace, it is obtained. || 8 || 31 || 32 ||
MAAJH, THIRD MEHL: The whole world is engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya.
Those who are controlled by the three qualities are attached to Maya. By Guru‟s Grace,
a few come to understand; they center their consciousness in the fourth state. || 1 ||
I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who burn away their emotional
attachment to Maya, through the Shabad. Those who burn away this attachment to
Maya, and focus their consciousness on the Lord are honored in the True Court, and the
Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. || 1 || Pause || The source, the root, of the gods
and goddesses is Maya. For them, the Simritees and the Shaastras were composed.
Sexual desire and anger are diffused throughout the universe. Coming and going,
people suffer in pain. || 2 || The jewel of spiritual wisdom was placed within the
universe. By Guru‟s Grace, it is enshrined within the mind. Celibacy, chastity, selfdiscipline and the practice of truthfulness are obtained from the Perfect Guru, by
meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 3 || In this world of her parents‟
home, the soul-bride has been deluded by doubt. Attached to duality, she later comes
to regret it. She forfeits both this world and the next, and even in her dreams, she does
not find peace. || 4 || The soul-bride who remembers her Husband Lord in this world,
by Guru‟s Grace, sees Him close at hand. She remains intuitively attuned to the Love of
her Beloved; she makes the Word of His Shabad her decoration. || 5 || Blessed and
fruitful is the coming of those who find the True Guru; through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, they burn their love of duality. The One Lord is permeating and pervading deep
within the heart. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, they sing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. || 6 || Those who do not serve the True Guru—why did they even
come into this world? Cursed are their lives; they have uselessly wasted this human life.
The self-willed manmukhs do not remember the Naam. Without the Naam, they suffer
in terrible pain. || 7 || The One who created the Universe, He alone knows it. He
unites with Himself those who realize the Shabad. O Nanak, they alone receive the
Naam, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny is recorded. || 8 || 1 || 32 ||
33 || MAAJH, FOURTH MEHL: The Primal Being is Himself remote and beyond. He
Himself establishes, and having established, He disestablishes. The One Lord is
pervading in all; those who become Gurmukh are honored. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my
soul is a sacrifice, to those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 130 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He has no form or shape; He is seen within each and every heart. The Gurmukh comes
to know the unknowable. || 1 || Pause || You are God, Kind and Merciful. Without
You, there is no other at all. When the Guru showers His Grace upon us, He blesses us
with the Naam; through the Naam, we merge in the Naam. || 2 || You Yourself are
the True Creator Lord. Your treasures are overflowing with devotional worship. The
Gurmukhs obtain the Naam. Their minds are enraptured, and they easily and intuitively
enter into Samaadhi. || 3 || Night and day, I sing Your Glorious Praises, God. I praise
You, O my Beloved. Without You, there is no other for me to seek out. It is only by
Guru‟s Grace that You are found. || 4 || The limits of the Inaccessible and
Incomprehensible Lord cannot be found. Bestowing Your Mercy, You merge us into
Yourself. Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, we meditate on the Lord.
Serving the Shabad, peace is found. || 5 || Praiseworthy is the tongue which sings
the Lord‟s Glorious Praises. Praising the Naam, one becomes pleasing to the True One.
The Gurmukh remains forever imbued with the Lord‟s Love. Meeting the True Lord,
glory is obtained. || 6 || The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in ego. They lose
their whole lives in the gamble. Within is the terrible darkness of greed, and so they
come and go in reincarnation, over and over again. || 7 || The Creator Himself
bestows Glory on those whom He Himself has so pre-destined. O Nanak, they receive
the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Destroyer of fear; through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, they find peace. || 8 || 1 || 34 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: The
Unseen Lord is within, but He cannot be seen. He has taken the Jewel of the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, and He keeps it well concealed. The Inaccessible and
Incomprehensible Lord is the highest of all. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He
is known. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to those who chant the Naam,
in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. The Beloved Saints were established by the True Lord. By
great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of their Darshan is obtained. || 1 || Pause ||
The One who is sought by the Siddhas and the seekers, upon whom Brahma and Indra
meditate within their hearts, whom the thirty-three million demi-gods search for—
meeting the Guru, one comes to sing His Praises within the heart. || 2 || Twenty-four
hours a day, the wind breathes Your Name. The earth is Your servant, a slave at Your
Feet. In the four sources of creation, and in all speech, You dwell. You are dear to the
minds of all. || 3 || The True Lord and Master is known to the Gurmukhs. He is
realized through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru. Those who drink it in are
satisfied. Through the Truest of the True, they are fulfilled. || 4 || In the home of
their own beings, they are peacefully and comfortably at ease. They are blissful,
enjoying pleasures, and eternally joyful. They are wealthy, and the greatest kings; they
center their minds on the Guru‟s Feet. || 5 || First, You created nourishment; then,
You created the living beings. There is no other Giver as Great as You, O my Lord and
Master. None approach or equal You. || 6 || Those who are pleasing to You meditate
on You. They practice the Mantra of the Holy. They themselves swim across, and they
save all their ancestors and families as well. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 131 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
In the Court of the Lord, they meet with no obstruction. || 7 || You are so Great! You
are the Highest of the High! You are Infinite, You are Everything! I am a sacrifice to
You. Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. || 8 || 1 || 35 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: Who
is liberated, and who is united? Who is a spiritual teacher, and who is a preacher? Who
is a house-holder, and who is a renunciate? Who can estimate the Lord‟s Value? || 1 ||
How is one bound, and how is one freed of his bonds? How can one escape from the
cycle of coming and going in reincarnation? Who is subject to karma, and who is
beyond karma? Who chants the Name, and inspires others to chant it? || 2 || Who is
happy, and who is sad? Who, as sunmukh, turns toward the Guru, and who, as
vaymukh, turns away from the Guru? How can one meet the Lord? How is one
separated from Him? Who can reveal the way to me? || 3 || What is that Word, by
which the wandering mind can be restrained? What are those teachings, by which we
may endure pain and pleasure alike? What is that lifestyle, by which we may come to
meditate on the Supreme Lord? How may we sing the Kirtan of His Praises? || 4 ||
The Gurmukh is liberated, and the Gurmukh is linked. The Gurmukh is the spiritual
teacher, and the Gurmukh is the preacher. Blessed is the Gurmukh, the householder
and the renunciate. The Gurmukh knows the Lord‟s Value. || 5 || Egotism is bondage;
as Gurmukh, one is emancipated. The Gurmukh escapes the cycle of coming and going
in reincarnation. The Gurmukh performs actions of good karma, and the Gurmukh is
beyond karma. Whatever the Gurmukh does, is done in good faith. || 6 || The
Gurmukh is happy, while the self-willed manmukh is sad. The Gurmukh turns toward
the Guru, and the self-willed manmukh turns away from the Guru. The Gurmukh is
united with the Lord, while the manmukh is separated from Him. The Gurmukh reveals
the way. || 7 || The Guru‟s Instruction is the Word, by which the wandering mind is
restrained. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, we can endure pain and pleasure alike. To
live as Gurmukh is the lifestyle by which we come to meditate on the Supreme Lord.
The Gurmukh sings the Kirtan of His Praises. || 8 || The Lord Himself created the
entire creation. He Himself acts, and causes others to act. He Himself establishes. From
oneness, He has brought forth the countless multitudes. O Nanak, they shall merge into
the One once again. || 9 || 2 || 36 || MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: God is Eternal and
Imperishable, so why should anyone be anxious? The Lord is Wealthy and Prosperous,
so His humble servant should feel totally secure. O Giver of peace of the soul, of life, of
honor—as You ordain, I obtain peace. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, my soul is a sacrifice, to
that Gurmukh whose mind and body are pleased with You. You are my mountain, You
are my shelter and shield. No one can rival You. || 1 || Pause || That person, unto
whom Your actions seem sweet, comes to see the Supreme Lord God in each and every
heart. In all places and interspaces, You exist. You are the One and Only Lord,
pervading everywhere. || 2 || You are the Fulfiller of all the mind‟s desires. Your
treasures are overflowing with love and devotion. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 132 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Showering Your Mercy, You protect those who, through perfect destiny, merge into
You. || 3 || You pulled me out of the deep, dark well onto the dry ground. Showering
Your Mercy, You blessed Your servant with Your Glance of Grace. I sing the Glorious
Praises of the Perfect, Immortal Lord. By speaking and hearing these Praises, they are
not used up. || 4 || Here and hereafter, You are our Protector. In the womb of the
mother, You cherish and nurture the baby. The fire of Maya does not affect those who
are imbued with the Lord‟s Love; they sing His Glorious Praises. || 5 || What Praises
of Yours can I chant and contemplate? Deep within my mind and body, I behold Your
Presence. You are my Friend and Companion, my Lord and Master. Without You, I do
not know any other at all. || 6 || O God, that one, unto whom You have given shelter,
is not touched by the hot winds. O my Lord and Master, You are my Sanctuary, the
Giver of peace. Chanting, meditating on You in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
You are revealed. || 7 || You are Exalted, Unfathomable, Infinite and Invaluable. You
are my True Lord and Master. I am Your servant and slave. You are the King, Your
Sovereign Rule is True. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. || 8 || 3 || 37 ||
MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE: Continually, continuously, remember the
Merciful Lord. Never forget Him from your mind. || 1 || Pause || Join the Society of
the Saints, and you shall not have to go down the path of Death. Take the Provisions of
the Lord‟s Name with you, and no stain shall attach itself to your family. || 1 || Those
who meditate on the Master shall not be thrown down into hell. Even the hot winds
shall not touch them. The Lord has come to dwell within their minds. || 2 || They
alone are beautiful and attractive, who abide in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. Those who have gathered in the wealth of the Lord‟s Name—they alone are deep
and thoughtful and vast. || 3 || Drink in the Ambrosial Essence of the Name, and live
by beholding the face of the Lord‟s servant. Let all your affairs be resolved, by
continually worshipping the Feet of the Guru. || 4 || He alone meditates on the Lord
of the World, whom the Lord has made His Own. He alone is a warrior, and he alone is
the chosen one, upon whose forehead good destiny is recorded. || 5 || Within my
mind, I meditate on God. For me, this is like the enjoyment of princely pleasures. Evil
does not well up within me, since I am saved, and dedicated to truthful actions. || 6 ||
I have enshrined the Creator within my mind; I have obtained the fruits of life‟s
rewards. If your Husband Lord is pleasing to your mind, then your married life shall be
eternal. || 7 || I have obtained everlasting wealth; I have found the Sanctuary of the
Dispeller of fear. Grasping hold of the hem of the Lord‟s robe, Nanak is saved. He has
won the incomparable life. || 8 || 4 || 38 ||

MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:
Chanting and meditating on the Lord, the mind is held steady. || 1 || Pause ||
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Divine Guru, one‟s fears are erased and
dispelled. || 1 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 133 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Entering the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God, how could anyone feel grief any
longer? || 2 || Serving at the Feet of the Holy Saints, all desires are fulfilled. || 3 ||
In each and every heart, the One Lord is pervading. He is totally permeating the water,
the land, and the sky. || 4 || I serve the Destroyer of sin, and I am sanctified by the
dust of the feet of the Saints. || 5 || My Lord and Master Himself has saved me
completely; I am comforted by meditating on the Lord. || 6 || The Creator has passed
judgement, and the evil-doers have been silenced and killed. || 7 || Nanak is attuned
to the True Name; he beholds the Presence of the Ever-present Lord. || 8 || 5 || 39 ||
1 || 32 || 1 || 5 || 39 ||
BAARAH MAAHAA ~ THE TWELVE MONTHS: MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL,
FOURTH HOUSE:

By the actions we have committed, we are separated from You. Please show Your
Mercy, and unite us with Yourself, Lord. We have grown weary of wandering to the four
corners of the earth and in the ten directions. We have come to Your Sanctuary, God.
Without milk, a cow serves no purpose. Without water, the crop withers, and it will not
bring a good price. If we do not meet the Lord, our Friend, how can we find our place
of rest? Those homes, those hearts, in which the Husband Lord is not manifest—those
towns and villages are like burning furnaces. All decorations, the chewing of betel to
sweeten the breath, and the body itself, are all useless and vain. Without God, our
Husband, our Lord and Master, all friends and companions are like the Messenger of
Death. This is Nanak‟s prayer: “Please show Your Mercy, and bestow Your Name. O my
Lord and Master, please unite me with Yourself, O God, in the Eternal Mansion of Your
Presence”. || 1 || In the month of Chayt, by meditating on the Lord of the Universe, a
deep and profound joy arises. Meeting with the humble Saints, the Lord is found, as we
chant His Name with our tongues. Those who have found God—blessed is their coming
into this world. Those who live without Him, for even an instant—their lives are
rendered useless. The Lord is totally pervading the water, the land, and all space. He is
contained in the forests as well. Those who do not remember God—how much pain
must they suffer! Those who dwell upon their God have great good fortune. My mind
yearns for the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan. O Nanak, my mind is so thirsty! I
touch the feet of one who unites me with God in the month of Chayt. || 2 || In the
month of Vaisaakh, how can the bride be patient? She is separated from her Beloved.
She has forgotten the Lord, her Life-companion, her Master; she has become attached
to Maya, the deceitful one. Neither son, nor spouse, nor wealth shall go along with
you—only the Eternal Lord. Entangled and enmeshed in the love of false occupations,
the whole world is perishing. Without the Naam, the Name of the One Lord, they lose
their lives in the hereafter. Forgetting the Merciful Lord, they are ruined. Without God,
there is no other at all. Pure is the reputation of those who are attached to the Feet of
the Beloved Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 134 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Nanak makes this prayer to God: “Please, come and unite me with Yourself.” The
month of Vaisaakh is beautiful and pleasant, when the Saint causes me to meet the
Lord. || 3 || In the month of Jayt‟h, the bride longs to meet with the Lord. All bow in
humility before Him. One who has grasped the hem of the robe of the Lord, the True
Friend—no one can keep him in bondage. God‟s Name is the Jewel, the Pearl. It cannot
be stolen or taken away. In the Lord are all pleasures which please the mind. As the
Lord wishes, so He acts, and so His creatures act. They alone are called blessed, whom
God has made His Own. If people could meet the Lord by their own efforts, why would
they be crying out in the pain of separation? Meeting Him in the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, O Nanak, celestial bliss is enjoyed. In the month of Jayt‟h, the
playful Husband Lord meets her, upon whose forehead such good destiny is recorded.
|| 4 || The month of Aasaarh seems burning hot, to those who are not close to their
Husband Lord. They have forsaken God the Primal Being, the Life of the World, and
they have come to rely upon mere mortals. In the love of duality, the soul-bride is
ruined; around her neck she wears the noose of Death. As you plant, so shall you
harvest; your destiny is recorded on your forehead. The life-night passes away, and in
the end, one comes to regret and repent, and then depart with no hope at all. Those
who meet with the Holy Saints are liberated in the Court of the Lord. Show Your Mercy
to me, O God; I am thirsty for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. Without You, God,
there is no other at all. This is Nanak‟s humble prayer. The month of Aasaarh is
pleasant, when the Feet of the Lord abide in the mind. || 5 || In the month of
Saawan, the soul-bride is happy, if she falls in love with the Lotus Feet of the Lord. Her
mind and body are imbued with the Love of the True One; His Name is her only
Support. The pleasures of corruption are false. All that is seen shall turn to ashes. The
drops of the Lord‟s Nectar are so beautiful! Meeting the Holy Saint, we drink these in.
The forests and the meadows are rejuvenated and refreshed with the Love of God, the
All-powerful, Infinite Primal Being. My mind yearns to meet the Lord. If only He would
show His Mercy, and unite me with Himself! Those brides who have obtained God—I
am forever a sacrifice to them. O Nanak, when the Dear Lord shows kindness, He
adorns His bride with the Word of His Shabad. Saawan is delightful for those happy
soul-brides whose hearts are adorned with the Necklace of the Lord‟s Name. || 6 || In
the month of Bhaadon, she is deluded by doubt, because of her attachment to duality.
She may wear thousands of ornaments, but they are of no use at all. On that day when
the body perishes—at that time, she becomes a ghost. The Messenger of Death seizes
and holds her, and does not tell anyone his secret. And her loved ones—in an instant,
they move on, leaving her all alone. She wrings her hands, her body writhes in pain,
and she turns from black to white. As she has planted, so does she harvest; such is the
field of karma. Nanak seeks God‟s Sanctuary; God has given him the Boat of His Feet.
Those who love the Guru, the Protector and Savior, in Bhaadon, shall not be thrown
down into hell. || 7 || In the month of Assu, my love for the Lord overwhelms me. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 135 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
How can I go and meet the Lord? My mind and body are so thirsty for the Blessed
Vision of His Darshan. Won‟t someone please come and lead me to him, O my mother.
The Saints are the helpers of the Lord‟s lovers; I fall and touch their feet. Without God,
how can I find peace? There is nowhere else to go. Those who have tasted the sublime
essence of His Love, remain satisfied and fulfilled. They renounce their selfishness and
conceit, and they pray, “God, please attach me to the hem of Your robe.” Those whom
the Husband Lord has united with Himself, shall not be separated from Him again.
Without God, there is no other at all. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Lord. In
Assu, the Lord, the Sovereign King, has granted His Mercy, and they dwell in peace. ||
8 || In the month of Katak, do good deeds. Do not try to blame anyone else.
Forgetting the Transcendent Lord, all sorts of illnesses are contracted. Those who turn
their backs on the Lord shall be separated from Him and consigned to reincarnation,
over and over again. In an instant, all of Maya‟s sensual pleasures turn bitter. No one
can then serve as your intermediary. Unto whom can we turn and cry? By one‟s own
actions, nothing can be done; destiny was pre-determined from the very beginning. By
great good fortune, I meet my God, and then all pain of separation departs. Please
protect Nanak, God; O my Lord and Master, please release me from bondage. In Katak,
in the Company of the Holy, all anxiety vanishes. || 9 || In the month of Maghar,
those who sit with their Beloved Husband Lord are beautiful. How can their glory be
measured? Their Lord and Master blends them with Himself. Their bodies and minds
blossom forth in the Lord; they have the companionship of the Holy Saints. Those who
lack the Company of the Holy, remain all alone. Their pain never departs, and they fall
into the grip of the Messenger of Death. Those who have ravished and enjoyed their
God, are seen to be continually exalted and uplifted. They wear the Necklace of the
jewels, emeralds and rubies of the Lord‟s Name. Nanak seeks the dust of the feet of
those who take to the Sanctuary of the Lord‟s Door. Those who worship and adore God
in Maghar, do not suffer the cycle of reincarnation ever again. || 10 || In the month
of Poh, the cold does not touch those, whom the Husband Lord hugs close in His
Embrace. Their minds are transfixed by His Lotus Feet. They are attached to the
Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan. Seek the Protection of the Lord of the Universe;
His service is truly profitable. Corruption shall not touch you, when you join the Holy
Saints and sing the Lord‟s Praises. From where it originated, there the soul is blended
again. It is absorbed in the Love of the True Lord. When the Supreme Lord God grasps
someone‟s hand, he shall never again suffer separation from Him. I am a sacrifice,
100,000 times, to the Lord, my Friend, the Unapproachable and Unfathomable. Please
preserve my honor, Lord; Nanak begs at Your Door. Poh is beautiful, and all comforts
come to that one, whom the Carefree Lord has forgiven. || 11 || In the month of
Maagh, let your cleansing bath be the dust of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. Meditate and listen to the Name of the Lord, and give it to everyone. In this way,
the filth of lifetimes of karma shall be removed, and egotistical pride shall vanish from
your mind. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 136 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Sexual desire and anger shall not seduce you, and the dog of greed shall depart. Those
who walk on the Path of Truth shall be praised throughout the world. Be kind to all
beings—this is more meritorious than bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of
pilgrimage and the giving of charity. That person, upon whom the Lord bestows His
Mercy, is a wise person. Nanak is a sacrifice to those who have merged with God. In
Maagh, they alone are known as true, unto whom the Perfect Guru is Merciful. || 12 ||
In the month of Phalgun, bliss comes to those, unto whom the Lord, the Friend, has
been revealed. The Saints, the Lord‟s helpers, in their mercy, have united me with Him.
My bed is beautiful, and I have all comforts. I feel no sadness at all. My desires have
been fulfilled—by great good fortune, I have obtained the Sovereign Lord as my
Husband. Join with me, my sisters, and sing the songs of rejoicing and the Hymns of
the Lord of the Universe. There is no other like the Lord—there is no equal to Him. He
embellishes this world and the world hereafter, and He gives us our permanent home
there. He rescues us from the world-ocean; never again do we have to run the cycle of
reincarnation. I have only one tongue, but Your Glorious Virtues are beyond counting.
Nanak is saved, falling at Your Feet. In Phalgun, praise Him continually; He has not
even an iota of greed. || 13 || Those who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the
Lord—their affairs are all resolved. Those who meditate on the Perfect Guru, the LordIncarnate—they are judged true in the Court of the Lord. The Lord‟s Feet are the
Treasure of all peace and comfort for them; they cross over the terrifying and
treacherous world-ocean. They obtain love and devotion, and they do not burn in
corruption. Falsehood has vanished, duality has been erased, and they are totally
overflowing with Truth. They serve the Supreme Lord God, and enshrine the One Lord
within their minds. The months, the days, and the moments are auspicious, for those
upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace. Nanak begs for the blessing of Your
Vision, O Lord. Please, shower Your Mercy upon me! || 14 || 1 ||
MAAJH, FIFTH MEHL: DAY AND NIGHT:

I serve my True Guru, and meditate on Him all day and night. Renouncing selfishness
and conceit, I seek His Sanctuary, and speak sweet words to Him. Through countless
lifetimes and incarnations, I was separated from Him. O Lord, you are my Friend and
Companion—please unite me with Yourself. Those who are separated from the Lord do
not dwell in peace, O sister. Without their Husband Lord, they find no comfort. I have
searched and seen all realms. My own evil actions have kept me separate from Him;
why should I accuse anyone else? Bestow Your Mercy, God, and save me! No one else
can bestow Your Mercy. Without You, Lord, we roll around in the dust. Unto whom
should we utter our cries of distress? This is Nanak‟s prayer: “May my eyes behold the
Lord, the Angelic Being.” || 1 || The Lord hears the anguish of the soul; He is the Allpowerful and Infinite Primal Being. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 137 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
In death and in life, worship and adore the Lord, the Support of all. In this world and in the
next, the soul-bride belongs to her Husband Lord, who has such a vast family. He is Lofty
and Inaccessible. His Wisdom is Unfathomable. He has no end or limitation. That service is
pleasing to Him, which makes one humble, like the dust of the feet of the Saints. He is the
Patron of the poor, the Merciful, Luminous Lord, the Redeemer of sinners. From the very
beginning, and throughout the ages, the True Name of the Creator has been our Saving
Grace. No one can know His Value; no one can weigh it. He dwells deep within the mind
and body. O Nanak, He cannot be measured. I am forever a sacrifice to those who serve
God, day and night. || 2 || The Saints worship and adore Him forever and ever; He is the
Forgiver of all. He fashioned the soul and the body, and by His Kindness, He bestowed the
soul. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, worship and adore Him, and chant His Pure
Mantra. His Value cannot be evaluated. The Transcendent Lord is endless. That one, within
whose mind the Lord abides, is said to be most fortunate. The soul‟s desires are fulfilled,
upon meeting the Master, our Husband Lord. Nanak lives by chanting the Lord‟s Name; all
sorrows have been erased. One who does not forget Him, day and night, is continually
rejuvenated. || 3 || God is overflowing with all powers. I have no honor—He is my
resting place. I have grasped the Support of the Lord within my mind; I live by chanting
and meditating on His Name. Grant Your Grace, God, and bless me, that I may merge into
the dust of the feet of the humble. As You keep me, so do I live. I wear and eat whatever
You give me. May I make the effort, O God, to sing Your Glorious Praises in the Company
of the Holy. I can conceive of no other place; where could I go to lodge a complaint? You
are the Dispeller of ignorance, the Destroyer of darkness, O Lofty, Unfathomable and
Unapproachable Lord. Please unite this separated one with Yourself; this is Nanak‟s
yearning. That day shall bring every joy, O Lord, when I take to the Feet of the Guru. || 4
|| 1 ||
VAAR IN MAAJH, AND SHALOKS OF THE FIRST MEHL:
TO BE SUNG TO THE TUNE OF “MALIK MUREED AND CHANDRAHRAA
SOHEE-AA”
ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD. TRUTH IS THE NAME.
CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED. BY GURU‟S GRACE:
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: The Guru is the Giver; the Guru is the House of ice. The Guru
is the Light of the three worlds. O Nanak, He is everlasting wealth. Place your mind‟s
faith in Him, and you shall find peace. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: First, the baby loves
mother‟s milk; second, he learns of his mother and father; third, his brothers, sisters
and aunts; fourth, the love of play awakens. Fifth, he runs after food and drink; sixth, in
his sexual desire, he does not respect social customs. Seventh, he gathers wealth and
dwells in his house; eighth, he becomes angry, and his body is consumed. Ninth, he
turns grey, and his breathing becomes labored; tenth, he is cremated, and turns to
ashes. His companions send him off, crying out and lamenting. The swan of the soul
takes flight, and asks which way to go. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 138 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He came and he went, and now, even his name has died. After he left, food was
offered on leaves, and the birds were called to come and eat. O Nanak, the self-willed
manmukhs love the darkness. Without the Guru, the world is drowning. || 2 || FIRST
MEHL: At the age of ten, he is a child; at twenty, a youth, and at thirty, he is called
handsome. At forty, he is full of life; at fifty, his foot slips, and at sixty, old age is upon
him. At seventy, he loses his intellect, and at eighty, he cannot perform his duties. At
ninety, he lies in his bed, and he cannot understand his weakne____ss. After seeking
and searching for such a long time, O Nanak, I have seen that the world is just a
mansion of smoke. || 3 || PAUREE: You, O Creator Lord, are Unfathomable. You
Yourself created the Universe, its colors, qualities and varieties, in so many ways and
forms. You created it, and You alone understand it. It is all Your Play. Some come, and
some arise and depart; but without the Name, all are bound to die. The Gurmukhs are
imbued with the deep crimson color of the poppy; they are dyed in the color of the
Lord‟s Love. So serve the True and Pure Lord, the Supremely Powerful Architect of
Destiny. You Yourself are All-knowing. O Lord, You are the Greatest of the Great! O my
True Lord, I am a sacrifice, a humble sacrifice, to those who meditate on You within
their conscious mind. || 1 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: He placed the soul in the body
which He had fashioned. He protects the Creation which He has created. With their
eyes, they see, and with their tongues, they speak; with their ears, they bring the mind
to awareness. With their feet, they walk, and with their hands, they work; they wear
and eat whatever is given. They do not know the One who created the Creation. The
blind fools do their dark deeds. When the pitcher of the body breaks and shatters into
pieces, it cannot be re-created again. O Nanak, without the Guru, there is no honor;
without honor, no one is carried across. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: They prefer the gift,
instead of the Giver; such is the way of the self-willed manmukhs. What can anyone say
about their intelligence, their understanding or their cleverness? The deeds which one
commits, while sitting in one‟s own home, are known far and wide, in the four
directions. One who lives righteously is known as righteous; one who commits sins is
known as a sinner. You Yourself enact the entire play, O Creator. Why should we speak
of any other? As long as Your Light is within the body, You speak through that Light.
Without Your Light, who can do anything? Show me any such cleverness! O Nanak, the
Lord alone is Perfect and All-knowing; He is revealed to the Gurmukh. || 2 || PAUREE:
You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself put it to work. Administering the drug
of emotional attachment, You Yourself have led the world astray. The fire of desire is
deep within; unsatisfied, people remain hungry and thirsty. This world is an illusion; it
dies and it is re-born—it comes and it goes in reincarnation. Without the True Guru,
emotional attachment is not broken. All have grown weary of performing empty rituals.
Those who follow the Guru‟s Teachings meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Filled with a joyful peace, they surrender to Your Will. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 139 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They save their families and ancestors; blessed are the mothers who gave birth to
them. Beautiful and sublime is the glory and the understanding of those who focus their
consciousness on the Lord. || 2 || SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: To see without eyes; to
hear without ears; to walk without feet; to work without hands; to speak without a
tongue—like this, one remains dead while yet alive. O Nanak, recognize the Hukam of
the Lord‟s Command, and merge with your Lord and Master. || 1 || SECOND MEHL:
He is seen, heard and known, but His subtle essence is not obtained. How can the
lame, armless and blind person run to embrace the Lord? Let the Fear of God be your
feet, and let His Love be your hands; let His Understanding be your eyes. Says Nanak,
in this way, O wise soul-bride, you shall be united with your Husband Lord. || 2 ||
PAUREE: Forever and ever, You are the only One; You set the play of duality in motion.
You created egotism and arrogant pride, and You placed greed within our beings. Keep
me as it pleases Your Will; everyone acts as You cause them to act. Some are forgiven,
and merge with You; through the Guru‟s Teachings, we are joined to You. Some stand
and serve You; without the Name, nothing else pleases them. Any other task would be
worthless to them—You have enjoined them to Your True Service. In the midst of
children, spouse and relations, some still remain detached; they are pleasing to Your
Will. Inwardly and outwardly, they are pure, and they are absorbed in the True Name.
|| 3 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: I may make a cave, in a mountain of gold, or in the
water of the nether regions; I may remain standing on my head, upside-down, on the
earth or up in the sky; I may totally cover my body with clothes, and wash them
continually; I may shout out loud, the white, red, yellow and black Vedas; I may even
live in dirt and filth. And yet, all this is just a product of evil-mindedness, and
intellectual corruption. I was not, I am not, and I will never be anything at all! O Nanak,
I dwell only on the Word of the Shabad. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: They wash their
clothes, and scrub their bodies, and try to practice self-discipline. But they are not
aware of the filth staining their inner being, while they try and try to wash off the outer
dirt. The blind go astray, caught by the noose of Death. They see other people‟s
property as their own, and in egotism, they suffer in pain. O Nanak, the egotism of the
Gurmukhs is broken, and then, they meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. They
chant the Naam, meditate on the Naam, and through the Naam, they are absorbed in
peace. || 2 || PAUREE: Destiny has brought together and united the body and the
soul-swan. He who created them, also separates them. The fools enjoy their pleasures;
they must also endure all their pains. From pleasures, arise diseases and the
commission of sins. From sinful pleasures come sorrow, separation, birth and death.
The fools try to account for their misdeeds, and argue uselessly. The judgement is in
the Hands of the True Guru, who puts an end to the argument. Whatever the Creator
does, comes to pass. It cannot be changed by anyone‟s efforts. || 4 || SHALOK,
FIRST MEHL: Telling lies, they eat dead bodies. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 140 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
And yet, they go out to teach others. They are deceived, and they deceive their
companions. O Nanak, such are the leaders of men. || 1 || FOURTH MEHL: Those,
within whom the Truth dwells, obtain the True Name; they speak only the Truth. They
walk on the Lord‟s Path, and inspire others to walk on the Lord‟s Path as well. Bathing
in a pool of holy water, they are washed clean of filth. But, by bathing in a stagnant
pond, they are contaminated with even more filth. The True Guru is the Perfect Pool of
Holy Water. Night and day, He meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. He is
saved, along with his family; bestowing the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, He saves the
whole world. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to one who himself chants the Naam, and
inspires others to chant it as well. || 2 || PAUREE: Some pick and eat fruits and
roots, and live in the wilderness. Some wander around wearing saffron robes, as Yogis
and Sanyaasees. But there is still so much desire within them—they still yearn for
clothes and food. They waste their lives uselessly; they are neither householders nor
renunciates. The Messenger of Death hangs over their heads, and they cannot escape
the three-phased desire. Death does not even approach those who follow the Guru‟s
Teachings, and become the slaves of the Lord‟s slaves. The True Word of the Shabad
abides in their true minds; within the home of their own inner beings, they remain
detached. O Nanak, those who serve their True Guru, rise from desire to desirelessness.
|| 5 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: If one‟s clothes are stained with blood, the garment
becomes polluted. Those who suck the blood of human beings—how can their
consciousness be pure? O Nanak, chant the Name of God, with heart-felt devotion.
Everything else is just a pompous worldly show, and the practice of false deeds. || 1 ||
FIRST MEHL: Since I am no one, what can I say? Since I am nothing, what can I be?
As He created me, so I act. As He causes me to speak, so I speak. I am full and
overflowing with sins—if only I could wash them away! I do not understand myself, and
yet I try to teach others. Such is the guide I am! O Nanak, the one who is blind shows
others the way, and misleads all his companions. But, going to the world hereafter, he
shall be beaten and kicked in the face; then, it will be obvious, what sort of guide he
was! || 2 || PAUREE: Through all the months and the seasons, the minutes and the
hours, I dwell upon You, O Lord. No one has attained You by clever calculations, O
True, Unseen and Infinite Lord. That scholar who is full of greed, arrogant pride and
egotism, is known to be a fool. So read the Name, and realize the Name, and
contemplate the Guru‟s Teachings. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, I have earned the
wealth of the Naam; I possess the storehouses, overflowing with devotion to the Lord.
Believing in the Immaculate Naam, one is hailed as true, in the True Court of the Lord.
The Divine Light of the Infinite Lord, who owns the soul and the breath of life, is deep
within the inner being. You alone are the True Banker, O Lord; the rest of the world is
just Your petty trader. || 6 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Let mercy be your mosque,
faith your prayer-mat, and honest living your Koran. Make modesty your circumcision,
and good conduct your fast. In this way, you shall be a true Muslim. Let good conduct
be your Kaabaa, Truth your spiritual guide, and the karma of good deeds your prayer
and chant. Let your rosary be that which is pleasing to His Will. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 141 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, God shall preserve your honor. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: To take what rightfully
belongs to another, is like a Muslim eating pork, or a Hindu eating beef. Our Guru, our
Spiritual Guide, stands by us, if we do not eat those carcasses. By mere talk, people do
not earn passage to Heaven. Salvation comes only from the practice of Truth. By adding
spices to forbidden foods, they are not made acceptable. O Nanak, from false talk, only
falsehood is obtained. || 2 || FIRST MEHL: There are five prayers and five times of
day for prayer; the five have five names. Let the first be truthfulness, the second
honest living, and the third charity in the Name of God. Let the fourth be good will to
all, and the fifth the praise of the Lord. Repeat the prayer of good deeds, and then, you
may call yourself a Muslim. O Nanak, the false obtain falsehood, and only falsehood. ||
3 || PAUREE: Some trade in priceless jewels, while others deal in mere glass. When
the True Guru is pleased, we find the treasure of the jewel, deep within the self.
Without the Guru, no one has found this treasure. The blind and the false have died in
their endless wanderings. The self-willed manmukhs putrefy and die in duality. They do
not understand contemplative meditation. Without the One Lord, there is no other at all.
Unto whom should they complain? Some are destitute, and wander around endlessly,
while others have storehouses of wealth. Without God‟s Name, there is no other wealth.
Everything else is just poison and ashes. O Nanak, the Lord Himself acts, and causes
others to act; by the Hukam of His Command, we are embellished and exalted. || 7 ||
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: It is difficult to be called a Muslim; if one is truly a Muslim,
then he may be called one. First, let him savor the religion of the Prophet as sweet;
then, let his pride of his possessions be scraped away. Becoming a true Muslim, a
disciple of the faith of Mohammed, let him put aside the delusion of death and life. As
he submits to God‟s Will, and surrenders to the Creator, he is rid of selfishness and
conceit. And when, O Nanak, he is merciful to all beings, only then shall he be called a
Muslim. || 1 || FOURTH MEHL: Renounce sexual desire, anger, falsehood and
slander; forsake Maya and eliminate egotistical pride. Renounce sexual desire and
promiscuity, and give up emotional attachment. Only then shall you obtain the
Immaculate Lord amidst the darkness of the world. Renounce selfishness, conceit and
arrogant pride, and your love for your children and spouse. Abandon your thirsty hopes
and desires, and embrace love for the Lord. O Nanak, the True One shall come to dwell
in your mind. Through the True Word of the Shabad, you shall be absorbed in the
Name of the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: Neither the kings, nor their subjects, nor the
leaders shall remain. The shops, the cities and the streets shall eventually disintegrate,
by the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command. Those solid and beautiful mansions—the fools
think that they belong to them. The treasure-houses, filled with wealth, shall be
emptied out in an instant. The horses, chariots, camels and elephants, with all their
decorations; the gardens, lands, houses, tents, soft beds and satin pavilions—Oh,
where are those things, which they believe to be their own? O Nanak, the True One is
the Giver of all; He is revealed through His All-powerful Creative Nature. || 8 ||
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: If the rivers became cows, giving milk, and the spring water
became milk and ghee; 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 142 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
If all the earth became sugar, to continually excite the mind; if the mountains became
gold and silver, studded with gems and jewels—even then, I would worship and adore
You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not decrease. || 1 || FIRST MEHL:
If all the eighteen loads of vegetation became fruits, and the growing grass became
sweet rice; if I were able to stop the sun and the moon in their orbits and hold them
perfectly steady—even then, I would worship and adore You, and my longing to chant
Your Praises would not decrease. || 2 || FIRST MEHL: If my body were afflicted with
pain, under the evil influence of unlucky stars; and if the blood-sucking kings were to
hold power over me—even if this were my condition, I would still worship and adore
You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not decrease. || 3 || FIRST MEHL:
If fire and ice were my clothes, and the wind was my food; and even if the enticing
heavenly beauties were my wives, O Nanak—all this shall pass away! Even then, I
would worship and adore You, and my longing to chant Your Praises would not
decrease. || 4 || PAUREE: The foolish demon, who does evil deeds, does not know
his Lord and Master. Call him a mad-man, if he does not understand himself. The strife
of this world is evil; these struggles are consuming it. Without the Lord‟s Name, life is
worthless. Through doubt, the people are being destroyed. One who recognizes that all
spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated. One who speaks lies shall fall into
hell and burn. In all the world, the most blessed and sanctified are those who remain
absorbed in Truth. One who eliminates selfishness and conceit is redeemed in the Court
of the Lord. || 9 || FIRST MEHL, SHALOK: They alone are truly alive, whose minds
are filled with the Lord. O Nanak, no one else is truly alive; those who merely live shall
depart in dishonor; everything they eat is impure. Intoxicated with power and thrilled
with wealth, they delight in their pleasures, and dance about shamelessly. O Nanak,
they are deluded and defrauded. Without the Lord‟s Name, they lose their honor and
depart. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: What good is food, and what good are clothes, if the
True Lord does not abide within the mind? What good are fruits, what good is ghee,
what good is sweet molasses, and what good is flour? What good are clothes, and what
good is a soft bed, to enjoy pleasures and sensual delights? What good is an army, and
what good are soldiers, servants and mansions to live in? O Nanak, without the True
Name, all this paraphernalia shall disappear. || 2 || PAUREE: What good is social
class and status? Truthfulness is measured within. Pride in one‟s status is like poison—
holding it in your hand and eating it, you shall die. The True Lord‟s Sovereign Rule is
known throughout the ages. One who respects the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command is
honored and respected in the Court of the Lord. By the Order of our Lord and Master,
we have been brought into this world. The Drummer, the Guru, has announced the
Lord‟s meditation, through the Word of the Shabad. Some have mounted their horses in
response, and others are saddling up. Some have tied up their bridles, and others have
already ridden off. || 10 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: When the crop is ripe, then it is
cut down; only the stalks are left standing. The corn on the cob is put into the thresher,
and the kernels are separated from the cobs. Placing the kernels between the two millstones, people sit and grind the corn. Those kernels which stick to the central axle are
spared—Nanak has seen this wonderful vision! || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Look, and see
how the sugar-cane is cut down. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 143 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
After cutting away its branches, its feet are bound together into bundles, and then, it is
placed between the wooden rollers and crushed. What punishment is inflicted upon it!
Its juice is extracted and placed in the cauldron; as it is heated, it groans and cries out.
And then, the crushed cane is collected and burnt in the fire below. Nanak: come,
people, and see how the sweet sugar-cane is treated! || 2 || PAUREE: Some do not
think of death; they entertain great hopes. They die, and are re-born, and die, over and
over again. They are of no use at all! In their conscious minds, they call themselves
good. The King of the Angels of Death hunts down those self-willed manmukhs, over
and over again. The manmukhs are false to their own selves; they feel no gratitude for
what they have been given. Those who merely perform rituals of worship are not
pleasing to their Lord and Master. Those who attain the True Lord and chant His Name
are pleasing to the Lord. They worship the Lord and bow at His Throne. They fulfill their
pre-ordained destiny. || 11 || FIRST MEHL, SHALOK: What can deep water do to a
fish? What can the vast sky do to a bird? What can cold do to a stone? What is married
life to a eunuch? You may apply sandalwood oil to a dog, but he will still be a dog. You
may try to teach a deaf person by reading the Simritees to him, but how will he learn?
You may place a light before a blind man and burn fifty lamps, but how will he see? You
may place gold before a herd of cattle, but they will pick out the grass to eat. You may
add flux to iron and melt it, but it will not become soft like cotton. O Nanak, this is the
nature of a fool—everything he speaks is useless and wasted. || 1 || FIRST MEHL:
When pieces of bronze or gold or iron break, the metal-smith welds them together
again in the fire, and the bond is established. If a husband leaves his wife, their
children may bring them back together in the world, and the bond is established. When
the king makes a demand, and it is met, the bond is established. When the hungry man
eats, he is satisfied, and the bond is established. In the famine, the rain fills the
streams to overflowing, and the bond is established. There is a bond between love and
words of sweetness. When one speaks the Truth, a bond is established with the Holy
Scriptures. Through goodness and truth, the dead establish a bond with the living. Such
are the bonds which prevail in the world. The fool establishes his bonds only when he is
slapped in the face. Nanak says this after deep reflection: through the Lord‟s Praise, we
establish a bond with His Court. || 2 || PAUREE: He Himself created and adorned the
Universe, and He Himself contemplates it. Some are counterfeit, and some are genuine.
He Himself is the Appraiser. The genuine are placed in His Treasury, while the
counterfeit are thrown away. The counterfeit are thrown out of the True Court—unto
whom should they complain? They should worship and follow the True Guru—this is the
lifestyle of excellence. The True Guru converts the counterfeit into genuine; through the
Word of the Shabad, He embellishes and exalts us. Those who have enshrined love and
affection for the Guru, are honored in the True Court. Who can estimate the value of
those who have been forgiven by the Creator Lord Himself? || 12 || SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: All the spiritual teachers, their disciples and the rulers of the world shall be
buried under the ground. The emperors shall also pass away; God alone is Eternal. You
alone, Lord, You alone. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Neither the angels, nor the demons, nor
human beings, nor the Siddhas, nor the seekers shall remain on the earth. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 144 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Who else is there? You alone, Lord, You alone. || 2 || FIRST MEHL: Neither the just,
nor the generous, nor any humans at all, nor the seven realms beneath the earth, shall
remain. The One Lord alone exists. Who else is there? You alone, Lord, You alone. || 3
|| FIRST MEHL: Neither the sun, nor the moon, nor the planets, nor the seven
continents, nor the oceans, nor food, nor the wind—nothing is permanent. You alone,
Lord, You alone. || 4 || FIRST MEHL: Our sustenance is not in the hands of any
person. The hopes of all rest in the One Lord. The One Lord alone exists—who else is
there? You alone, Lord, You alone. || 5 || FIRST MEHL: The birds have no money in
their pockets. They place their hopes on trees and water. He alone is the Giver. You
alone, Lord, You alone. || 6 || FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, that destiny which is preordained and written on one‟s forehead—no one can erase it. The Lord infuses strength,
and He takes it away again. You alone, O Lord, You alone. || 7 || PAUREE: True is
the Hukam of Your Command. To the Gurmukh, it is known. Through the Guru‟s
Teachings, selfishness and conceit are eradicated, and the Truth is realized. True is
Your Court. It is proclaimed and revealed through the Word of the Shabad. Meditating
deeply on the True Word of the Shabad, I have merged into the Truth. The self-willed
manmukhs are always false; they are deluded by doubt. They dwell in manure, and
they do not know the taste of the Name. Without the Name, they suffer the agonies of
coming and going. O Nanak, the Lord Himself is the Appraiser, who distinguishes the
counterfeit from the genuine. || 13 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Tigers, hawks, falcons
and eagles—the Lord could make them eat grass. And those animals which eat grass—
He could make them eat meat. He could make them follow this way of life. He could
raise dry land from the rivers, and turn the deserts into bottomless oceans. He could
appoint a worm as king, and reduce an army to ashes. All beings and creatures live by
breathing, but He could keep us alive, even without the breath. O Nanak, as it pleases
the True Lord, He gives us sustenance. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Some eat meat, while
others eat grass. Some have all the thirty-six varieties of delicacies, while others live in
the dirt and eat mud. Some control the breath, and regulate their breathing. Some live
by the Support of the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord. The Great Giver lives; no
one dies. O Nanak, those who do not enshrine the Lord within their minds are deluded.
|| 2 || PAUREE: By the karma of good actions, some come to serve the Perfect Guru.
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, some eliminate selfishness and conceit, and meditate on
the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Undertaking any other task, they waste their lives in
vain. Without the Name, all that they wear and eat is poison. Praising the True Word of
the Shabad, they merge with the True Lord. Without serving the True Guru, they do not
obtain the home of peace; they are consigned to reincarnation, over and over again.
Investing counterfeit capital, they earn only falsehood in the world. O Nanak, singing
the Praises of the Pure, True Lord, they depart with honor. || 14 || SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: When it pleases You, we play music and sing; when it pleases You, we bathe in
water. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 145 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When it pleases You, we smear our bodies with ashes, and blow the horn and the
conch shell. When it pleases You, we read the Islamic Scriptures, and are acclaimed as
Mullahs and Shaykhs. When it pleases You, we become kings, and enjoy all sorts of
tastes and pleasures. When it pleases You, we wield the sword, and cut off the heads of
our enemies. When it pleases You, we go out to foreign lands; hearing news of home,
we come back again. When it pleases You, we are attuned to the Name, and when it
pleases You, we become pleasing to You. Nanak utters this one prayer; everything else
is just the practice of falsehood. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: You are so Great—all Greatness
flows from You. You are So Good—Goodness radiates from You. You are True—all that
flows from You is True. Nothing at all is false. Talking, seeing, speaking, walking, living
and dying—all these are transitory. By the Hukam of His Command, He creates, and in
His Command, He keeps us. O Nanak, He Himself is True. || 2 || PAUREE: Serve the
True Guru fearlessly, and your doubt shall be dispelled. Do that work which the True
Guru asks you to do. When the True Guru becomes merciful, we meditate on the Naam.
The profit of devotional worship is excellent. It is obtained by the Gurmukh. The selfwilled manmukhs are trapped in the darkness of falsehood; they practice nothing but
falsehood. Go to the Gate of Truth, and speak the Truth. The True Lord calls the true
ones to the Mansion of His Presence. O Nanak, the true ones are forever true; they are
absorbed in the True Lord. || 15 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: The Dark Age of Kali
Yuga is the knife, and the kings are butchers; righteousness has sprouted wings and
flown away. In this dark night of falsehood, the moon of Truth is not visible anywhere. I
have searched in vain, and I am so confused; in this darkness, I cannot find the path.
In egotism, they cry out in pain. Says Nanak, how will they be saved? || 1 || THIRD
MEHL: In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praise has appeared as a
Light in the world. How rare are those few Gurmukhs who swim across to the other
side! The Lord bestows His Glance of Grace; O Nanak, the Gurmukh receives the jewel.
|| 2 || PAUREE: Between the Lord‟s devotees and the people of the world, there can
never be any true alliance. The Creator Himself is infallible. He cannot be fooled; no one
can fool Him. He blends His devotees with Himself; they practice Truth, and only Truth.
The Lord Himself leads the people of the world astray; they tell lies, and by telling lies,
they eat poison. They do not recognize the ultimate reality, that we all must go; they
continue to cultivate the poisons of sexual desire and anger. The devotees serve the
Lord; night and day, they meditate on the Naam. Becoming the slaves of the Lord‟s
slaves, they eradicate selfishness and conceit from within. In the Court of their Lord and
Master, their faces are radiant; they are embellished and exalted with the True Word of
the Shabad. || 16 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Those who praise the Lord in the early
hours of the morning and meditate on Him single-mindedly, are the perfect kings; at
the right time, they die fighting. In the second watch, the focus of the mind is scattered
in all sorts of ways. So many fall into the bottomless pit; they are dragged under, and
they cannot get out again. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 146 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
In the third watch, both hunger and thirst bark for attention, and food is put into the
mouth. That which is eaten becomes dust, but they are still attached to eating. In the
fourth watch, they become drowsy. They close their eyes and begin to dream. Rising up
again, they engage in conflicts; they set the stage as if they will live for 100 years. If at
all times, at each and every moment, they live in the fear of God—O Nanak, the Lord
dwells within their minds, and their cleansing bath is true. || 1 || SECOND MEHL:
They are the perfect kings, who have found the Perfect Lord. Twenty-four hours a day,
they remain unconcerned, imbued with the Love of the One Lord. Only a few obtain the
Darshan, the Blessed Vision of the Unimaginably Beauteous Lord. Through the perfect
karma of good deeds, one meets the Perfect Guru, whose speech is perfect. O Nanak,
when the Guru makes one perfect, one‟s weight does not decrease. || 2 || PAUREE:
When You are with me, what more could I want? I speak only the Truth. Plundered by
the thieves of worldly affairs, she does not obtain the Mansion of His Presence. Being so
stone-hearted, she has lost her chance to serve the Lord. That heart, in which the True
Lord is not found, should be torn down and re-built. How can she be weighed
accurately, upon the scale of perfection? No one will say that her weight has been
shorted, if she rids herself of egotism. The genuine are assayed, and accepted in the
Court of the All-knowing Lord. The genuine merchandise is found only in one shop—it is
obtained from the Perfect Guru. || 17 || SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Twenty-four
hours a day, destroy the eight things, and in the ninth place, conquer the body. Within
the body are the nine treasures of the Name of the Lord—seek the depths of these
virtues. Those blessed with the karma of good actions praise the Lord. O Nanak, they
make the Guru their spiritual teacher. In the fourth watch of the early morning hours, a
longing arises in their higher consciousness. They are attuned to the river of life; the
True Name is in their minds and on their lips. The Ambrosial Nectar is distributed, and
those with good karma receive this gift. Their bodies become golden, and take on the
color of spirituality. If the Jeweller casts His Glance of Grace, they are not placed in the
fire again. Throughout the other seven watches of the day, it is good to speak the
Truth, and sit with the spiritually wise. There, vice and virtue are distinguished, and the
capital of falsehood is decreased. There, the counterfeit are cast aside, and the genuine
are cheered. Speech is vain and useless. O Nanak, pain and pleasure are in the power
of our Lord and Master. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: Air is the Guru, Water is the Father,
and Earth is the Great Mother of all. Day and night are the two nurses, in whose lap all
the world is at play. Good deeds and bad deeds—the record is read out in the Presence
of the Lord of Dharma. According to their own actions, some are drawn closer, and
some are driven farther away. Those who have meditated on the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, and departed after having worked by the sweat of their brow—O Nanak, their
faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord, and many others are saved along with them!
|| 2 || PAUREE: The True Food is the Love of the Lord; the True Guru has spoken.
With this True Food, I am satisfied, and with the Truth, I am delighted. True are the
cities and the villages, where one abides in the True Home of the self. When the True
Guru is pleased, one receives the Lord‟s Name, and blossoms forth in His Love. No one
enters the Court of the True Lord through falsehood. By uttering falsehood and only
falsehood, the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence is lost. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 147 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
No one blocks the way of those who are blessed with the Banner of the True Word of
the Shabad. Hearing, understanding and speaking Truth, one is called to the Mansion of
the Lord‟s Presence. || 18 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: If I dressed myself in fire, and
built my house of snow, and made iron my food; and if I were to drink in all pain like
water, and drive the entire earth before me; and if I were to place the earth upon a
scale and balance it with a single copper coin; and if I were to become so great that I
could not be contained, and if I were to control and lead all; and if I were to possess so
much power within my mind that I could cause others to do my bidding—so what? As
Great as our Lord and Master is, so great are His gifts. He bestows them according to
His Will. O Nanak, those upon whom the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, obtain the
glorious greatness of the True Name. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: The mouth is not
satisfied by speaking, and the ears are not satisfied by hearing. The eyes are not
satisfied by seeing—each organ seeks out one sensory quality. The hunger of the
hungry is not appeased; by mere words, hunger is not relieved. O Nanak, hunger is
relieved only when one utters the Glorious Praises of the Praiseworthy Lord. || 2 ||
PAUREE: Without the True One, all are false, and all practice falsehood. Without the
True One, the false ones are bound and gagged and driven off. Without the True One,
the body is just ashes, and it mingles again with ashes. Without the True Ome, all food
and clothes are unsatisfying. Without the True One, the false ones do not attain the
Lord‟s Court. Attached to false attachments, the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence is lost.
The whole world is deceived by deception, coming and going in reincarnation. Within
the body is the fire of desire; through the Word of the Shabad, it is quenched. || 19 ||
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, the Guru is the tree of contentment, with flowers of
faith, and fruits of spiritual wisdom. Watered with the Lord‟s Love, it remains forever
green; through the karma of good deeds and meditation, it ripens. Honor is obtained by
eating this tasty dish; of all gifts, this is the greatest gift. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: The
Guru is the tree of gold, with leaves of coral, and blossoms of jewels and rubies. The
Words from His Mouth are fruits of jewels. Within His Heart, He beholds the Lord. O
Nanak, He is obtained by those, upon whose faces and foreheads such pre-recorded
destiny is written. The sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage are contained in the
constant worship of the feet of the Exalted Guru. Cruelty, material attachment, greed
and anger are the four rivers of fire. Falling into them, one is burned, O Nanak! One is
saved only by holding tight to good deeds. || 2 || PAUREE: While you are alive,
conquer death, and you shall have no regrets in the end. This world is false, but only a
few understand this. People do not enshrine love for the Truth; they chase after worldly
affairs instead. The terrible time of death and annihilation hovers over the heads of the
world. By the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, the Messenger of Death smashes his club
over their heads. The Lord Himself gives His Love, and enshrines it within their minds.
Not a moment or an instant‟s delay is permitted, when one‟s measure of life is full. By
Guru‟s Grace, one comes to know the True One, and is absorbed into Him. || 20 ||
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Bitter melon, swallow-wort, thorn-apple and nim fruit—these
bitter poisons lodge in the minds and mouths of those who do not remember You. O
Nanak, how shall I tell them this? Without the karma of good deeds, they are only
destroying themselves. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: The intellect is a bird; on account of its
actions, it is sometimes high, and sometimes low. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 148 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Sometimes it is perched on the sandalwood tree, and sometimes it is on the branch of
the poisonous swallow-wort. Sometimes, it soars through the heavens. O Nanak, our
Lord and Master leads us on, according to the Hukam of His Command; such is His
Way. || 2 || PAUREE: Some speak and expound, and while speaking and lecturing,
they pass away. The Vedas speak and expound on the Lord, but they do not know His
limits. Not by studying, but through understanding, is the Lord‟s Mystery revealed.
There are six pathways in the Shaastras, but how rare are those who merge in the True
Lord through them. The True Lord is Unknowable; through the Word of His Shabad, we
are embellished. One who believes in the Name of the Infinite Lord, attains the Court of
the Lord. I humbly bow to the Creator Lord; I am a minstrel singing His Praises. Nanak
enshrines the Lord within his mind. He is the One, throughout the ages. || 21 ||
SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Those who charm scorpions and handle snakes only brand
themselves with their own hands. By the pre-ordained Order of our Lord and Master,
they are beaten badly, and struck down. If the self-willed manmukhs fight with the
Gurmukh, they are condemned by the Lord, the True Judge. He Himself is the Lord and
Master of both worlds. He beholds all and makes the exact determination. O Nanak,
know this well: everything is in accordance with His Will. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: O
Nanak, if someone judges himself, only then is he known as a real judge. If someone
understands both the disease and the medicine, only then is he a wise physician. Do
not involve yourself in idle business on the way; remember that you are only a guest
here. Speak with those who know the Primal Lord, and renounce your evil ways. That
virtuous person who does not walk in the way of greed, and who abides in Truth, is
accepted and famous. If an arrow is shot at the sky, how can it reach there? The sky
above is unreachable—know this well, O archer! || 2 || PAUREE: The soul-bride loves
her Husband Lord; she is embellished with His Love. She worships Him day and night;
she cannot be restrained from doing so. In the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, she has
made her home; she is adorned with the Word of His Shabad. She is humble, and she
offers her true and sincere prayer. She is beautiful in the Company of her Lord and
Master; she walks in the Way of His Will. With her dear friends, she offers her heart-felt
prayers to her Beloved. Cursed is that home, and shameful is that life, which is without
the Name of the Lord. But she who is adorned with the Word of His Shabad, drinks in
the Amrit of His Nectar. || 22 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: The desert is not satisfied by
rain, and the fire is not quenched by desire. The king is not satisfied with his kingdom,
and the oceans are full, but still they thirst for more. O Nanak, how many times must I
seek and ask for the True Name? || 1 || SECOND MEHL: Life is useless, as long as
one does not know the Lord God. Only a few cross over the world-ocean, by Guru‟s
Grace. The Lord is the All-powerful Cause of causes, says Nanak after deep deliberation.
The creation is subject to the Creator, who sustains it by His Almighty Power. || 2 ||
PAUREE: In the Court of the Lord and Master, His minstrels dwell. Singing the Praises
of their True Lord and Master, the lotuses of their hearts have blossomed forth.
Obtaining their Perfect Lord and Master, their minds are transfixed with ecstasy. Their
enemies have been driven out and subdued, and their friends are very pleased. Those
who serve the Truthful True Guru are shown the True Path. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 149 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Reflecting on the True Word of the Shabad, death is overcome. Speaking the Unspoken
Speech of the Lord, one is adorned with the Word of His Shabad. Nanak holds tight to
the Treasure of Virtue, and meets with the Dear, Beloved Lord. || 23 || SHALOK,
FIRST MEHL: Born because of the karma of their past mistakes, they make more
mistakes, and fall into mistakes. By washing, their pollution is not removed, even
though they may wash hundreds of times. O Nanak, if God forgives, they are forgiven;
otherwise, they are kicked and beaten. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, it is absurd to
ask to be spared from pain by begging for comfort. Pleasure and pain are the two
garments given, to be worn in the Court of the Lord. Where you are bound to lose by
speaking, there, you ought to remain silent. || 2 || PAUREE: After looking around in
the four directions, I looked within my own self. There, I saw the True, Invisible Lord
Creator. I was wandering in the wilderness, but now the Guru has shown me the Way.
Hail to the True, True Guru, through whom we merge in the Truth. I have found the
jewel within the home of my own self; the lamp within has been lit. Those who praise
the True Word of the Shabad, abide in the peace of Truth. But those who do not have
the Fear of God, are overtaken by fear. They are destroyed by their own pride. Having
forgotten the Name, the world is roaming around like a wild demon. || 24 || SHALOK,
THIRD MEHL: In fear we are born, and in fear we die. Fear is always present in the
mind. O Nanak, if one dies in the fear of God, his coming into the world is blessed and
approved. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Without the fear of God, you may live very, very
long, and savor the most enjoyable pleasures. O Nanak, if you die without the fear of
God, you will arise and depart with a blackened face. || 2 || PAUREE: When the True
Guru is merciful, then your desires will be fulfilled. When the True Guru is merciful, you
will never grieve. When the True Guru is merciful, you will know no pain. When the
True Guru is merciful, you will enjoy the Lord‟s Love. When the True Guru is merciful,
then why should you fear death? When the True Guru is merciful, the body is always at
peace. When the True Guru is merciful, the nine treasures are obtained. When the True
Guru is merciful, you shall be absorbed in the True Lord. || 25 || SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: They pluck the hair out of their heads, and drink in filthy water; they beg
endlessly and eat the garbage which others have thrown away. They spread manure,
they suck in rotting smells, and they are afraid of clean water. Their hands are smeared
with ashes, and the hair on their heads is plucked out—they are like sheep! They have
renounced the lifestyle of their mothers and fathers, and their families and relatives cry
out in distress. No one offers the rice dishes at their last rites, and no one lights the
lamps for them. After their death, where will they be sent? The sixty-eight sacred
shrines of pilgrimage give them no place of protection, and no Brahmin will eat their
food. They remain polluted forever, day and night; they do not apply the ceremonial
tilak mark to their foreheads. They sit together in silence, as if in mourning; they do not
go to the Lord‟s Court. With their begging bowls hanging from their waists, and their
fly-brushes in their hands, they walk along in single file. They are not Yogis, and they
are not Jangams, followers of Shiva. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 150 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They are not Qazis or Mullahs. Ruined by the Merciful Lord, they wander around in
disgrace, and their entire troop is contaminated. The Lord alone kills and restores to
life; no one else can protect anyone from Him. They go without giving alms or any
cleansing baths; their shaven heads become covered with dust. The jewel emerged
from the water, when the mountain of gold was used to churn it. The gods established
the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, where the festivals are celebrated and
hymns are chanted. After bathing, the Muslims recite their prayers, and after bathing,
the Hindus perform their worship services. The wise always take cleansing baths. At the
time of death, and at the time of birth, they are purified, when water is poured on their
heads. O Nanak, the shaven-headed ones are devils. They are not pleased to hear
these words. When it rains, there is happiness. Water is the key to all life. When it
rains, the corn grows, and the sugar cane, and the cotton, which provides clothing for
all. When it rains, the cows always have grass to graze upon, and housewives can
churn the milk into butter. With that ghee, sacred feasts and worship services are
performed; all these efforts are blessed. The Guru is the ocean, and all His Teachings
are the river. Bathing within it, glorious greatness is obtained. O Nanak, if the shavenheaded ones do not bathe, then seven handfuls of ashes are upon their heads. || 1 ||
SECOND MEHL: What can the cold do to the fire? How can the night affect the sun?
What can the darkness do to the moon? What can social status do to air and water?
What are personal possessions to the earth, from which all things are produced? O
Nanak, he alone is known as honorable, whose honor the Lord preserves. || 2 ||
PAUREE: It is of You, O my True and Wondrous Lord, that I sing forever. Yours is the
True Court. All others are subject to coming and going. Those who ask for the gift of
the True Name are like You. Your Command is True; we are adorned with the Word of
Your Shabad. Through faith and trust, we receive spiritual wisdom and meditation from
You. By Your Grace, the banner of honor is obtained. It cannot be taken away or lost.
You are the True Giver; You give continually. Your Gifts continue to increase. Nanak
begs for that gift which is pleasing to You. || 26 || SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Those
who have accepted the Guru‟s Teachings, and who have found the path, remain
absorbed in the Praises of the True Lord. What teachings can be imparted to those who
have the Divine Guru Nanak as their Guru? || 1 || FIRST MEHL: We understand the
Lord only when He Himself inspires us to understand Him. He alone knows everything,
unto whom the Lord Himself gives knowledge. One may talk and preach and give
sermons but still yearn after Maya. The Lord, by the Hukam of His Command, has
created the entire creation. He Himself knows the inner nature of all. O Nanak, He
Himself uttered the Word. Doubt departs from one who receives this gift. || 2 ||
PAUREE: I was a minstrel, out of work, when the Lord took me into His service. To sing
His Praises day and night, He gave me His Order, right from the start. My Lord and
Master has summoned me, His minstrel, to the True Mansion of His Presence. He has
dressed me in the robes of His True Praise and Glory. The Ambrosial Nectar of the True
Name has become my food. Those who follow the Guru‟s Teachings, who eat this food
and are satisfied, find peace. His minstrel spreads His Glory, singing and vibrating the
Word of His Shabad. O Nanak, praising the True Lord, I have obtained His Perfection.
