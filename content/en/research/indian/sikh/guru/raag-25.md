SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:


Death comes to all, and all must suffer separation. Go and ask the clever people,
whether they shall meet in the world hereafter. Those who forget my Lord and Master
shall suffer in terrible pain. || 1 || So praise the True Lord, by whose Grace peace
ever prevails. || Pause || Praise Him as great; He is, and He shall ever be. You alone
are the Great Giver; mankind cannot give anything. Whatever pleases Him, comes to
pass; what good does it do to cry out in protest? || 2 || Many have proclaimed their
sovereignty over millions of fortresses on the earth, but they have now departed. And
those, whom even the sky could not contain, had ropes put through their noses. O
mind, if you only knew the torment in your future, you would not relish the sweet
pleasures of the present. || 3 || O Nanak, as many as are the sins one commits, so
many are the chains around his neck. If he possesses virtues, then the chains are cut
away; these virtues are his brothers, his true brothers. Going to the world hereafter,
those who have no Guru are not accepted; they are beaten, and expelled. || 4 || 1 ||
SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: Make your mind the farmer, good deeds the
farm, modesty the water, and your body the field. Let the Lord‟s Name be the seed,
contentment the plow, and your humble dress the fence. Doing deeds of love, the seed
shall sprout, and you shall see your home flourish. || 1 || O Baba, the wealth of Maya
does not go with anyone. This Maya has bewitched the world, but only a rare few
understand this. || Pause || Make your ever-decreasing life your shop, and make the
Lord‟s Name your merchandise. Make understanding and contemplation your
warehouse, and in that warehouse, store the Lord‟s Name. Deal with the Lord‟s dealers,
earn your profits, and rejoice in your mind. || 2 || Let your trade be listening to
scripture, and let Truth be the horses you take to sell. Gather up merits for your
travelling expenses, and do not think of tomorrow in your mind. When you arrive in the
land of the Formless Lord, you shall find peace in the Mansion of His Presence. || 3 ||
Let your service be the focusing of your consciousness, and let your occupation be the
placing of faith in the Naam. 

Let your work be restraint from sin; only then will people call you blessed. O Nanak, the
Lord shall look upon you with His Glance of Grace, and you shall be blessed with honor
four times over. || 4 || 2 || SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, CHAU-TUKAS: The son is dear
to his mother and father; he is the wise son-in-law to his father-in-law. The father is
dear to his son and daughter, and the brother is very dear to his brother. By the Order
of the Lord‟s Command, he leaves his house and goes outside, and in an instant,
everything becomes alien to him. The self-willed manmukh does not remember the
Name of the Lord, does not give in charity, and does not cleanse his consciousness; his
body rolls in the dust. || 1 || The mind is comforted by the Comforter of the Naam. I
fall at the Guru‟s feet — I am a sacrifice to Him; He has given me to understand the
true understanding. || Pause || The mind is impressed with the false love of the
world; he quarrels with the Lord‟s humble servant. Infatuated with Maya, night and day,
he sees only the worldly path; he does not chant the Naam, and drinking poison, he
dies. He is imbued and infatuated with vicious talk; the Word of the Shabad does not
come into his consciousness. He is not imbued with the Lord‟s Love, and he is not
impressed by the taste of the Name; the self-willed manmukh loses his honor. || 2 ||
He does not enjoy celestial peace in the Company of the Holy, and there is not even a
bit of sweetness on his tongue. He calls his mind, body and wealth his own; he has no
knowledge of the Court of the Lord. Closing his eyes, he walks in darkness; he cannot
see the home of his own being, O Siblings of Destiny. Tied up at Death‟s door, he finds
no place of rest; he receives the rewards of his own actions. || 3 || When the Lord
casts His Glance of Grace, then I see Him with my own eyes; He is indescribable, and
cannot be described. With my ears, I continually listen to the Word of the Shabad, and I
praise Him; His Ambrosial Name abides within my heart. He is Fearless, Formless and
absolutely without vengeance; I am absorbed in His Perfect Light. O Nanak, without the
Guru, doubt is not dispelled; through the True Name, glorious greatness is obtained. ||
4 || 3 || SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, DU-TUKAS: In the realm of land, and in the realm
of water, Your seat is the chamber of the four directions. Yours is the one and only
form of the entire universe; Your mouth is the mint to fashion all. || 1 || O my Lord
Master, Your play is so wonderful! You are pervading and permeating the water, the
land and the sky; You Yourself are contained in all. || Pause || Wherever I look,
there I see Your Light, but what is Your form? You have one form, but it is unseen;
there is none like any other. || 2 || The beings born of eggs, born of the womb, born
of the earth and born of sweat, all are created by You. I have seen one glory of Yours,
that You are pervading and permeating in all. || 3 || Your Glories are so numerous,
and I do not know even one of them; I am such a fool — please, give me some of
them! Prays Nanak, listen, O my Lord Master: I am sinking like a stone — please, save
me! || 4 || 4 || SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL: I am a wicked sinner and a great hypocrite;
You are the Immaculate and Formless Lord. Tasting the Ambrosial Nectar, I am imbued
with supreme bliss; O Lord and Master, I seek Your Sanctuary. || 1 || O Creator Lord,
You are the honor of the dishonored. In my lap is the honor and glory of the wealth of
the Name; I merge into the True Word of the Shabad. || Pause || 

You are perfect, while I am worthless and imperfect. You are profound, while I am
trivial. My mind is imbued with You, day and night and morning, O Lord; my tongue
chants Your Name, and my mind meditates on You. || 2 || You are True, and I am
absorbed into You; through the mystery of the Shabad, I shall ultimately become True
as well. Those who are imbued with the Naam day and night are pure, while those who
die to be reborn are impure. || 3 || I do not see any other like the Lord; who else
should I praise? No one is equal to Him. Prays Nanak, I am the slave of His slaves; by
Guru‟s Instruction, I know Him. || 4 || 5 || SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL: He is
unknowable, infinite, unapproachable and imperceptible. He is not subject to death or
karma. His caste is casteless; He is unborn, self-illumined, and free of doubt and desire.
|| 1 || I am a sacrifice to the Truest of the True. He has no form, no color and no
features; through the True Word of the Shabad, He reveals Himself. || Pause || He
has no mother, father, sons or relatives; He is free of sexual desire; He has no wife. He
has no ancestry; He is immaculate. He is infinite and endless; O Lord, Your Light is
pervading all. || 2 || Deep within each and every heart, God is hidden; His Light is in
each and every heart. The heavy doors are opened by Guru‟s Instructions; one
becomes fearless, in the trance of deep meditation. || 3 || The Lord created all
beings, and placed death over the heads of all; all the world is under His Power. Serving
the True Guru, the treasure is obtained; living the Word of the Shabad, one is
emancipated. || 4 || In the pure vessel, the True Name is contained; how few are
those who practice true conduct. The individual soul is united with the Supreme Soul;
Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary, Lord. || 5 || 6 || SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL: Like a fish
without water is the faithless cynic, who dies of thirst. So shall you die, O mind, without
the Lord, as your breath goes in vain. || 1 || O mind, chant the Lord‟s Name, and
praise Him. Without the Guru, how will you obtain this juice? The Guru shall unite you
with the Lord. || Pause || For the Gurmukh, meeting with the Society of the Saints is
like making a pilgrimage to a sacred shrine. The benefit of bathing at the sixty-eight
sacred shrines of pilgrimage is obtained by the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan. ||
2 || Like the Yogi without abstinence, and like penance without truth and
contentment, so is the body without the Lord‟s Name; death will slay it, because of the
sin within. || 3 || The faithless cynic does not obtain the Lord‟s Love; the Lord‟s Love
is obtained only through the True Guru. One who meets with the Guru, the Giver of
pleasure and pain, says Nanak, is absorbed in the Lord‟s Praise. || 4 || 7 || SORAT‟H,
FIRST MEHL: You, God, are the Giver of gifts, the Lord of perfect understanding; I am
a mere beggar at Your Door. What should I beg for? Nothing remains permanent; O
Lord, please, bless me with Your Beloved Name. || 1 || In each and every heart, the
Lord, the Lord of the forest, is permeating and pervading. In the water, on the land,
and in the sky, He is pervading but hidden; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He
is revealed. || Pause || In this world, in the nether regions of the underworld, and in
the Akaashic Ethers, the Guru, the True Guru, has shown me the Lord; He has
showered me with His Mercy. He is the unborn Lord God; He is, and shall ever be. 

Deep within your heart, behold Him, the Destroyer of ego. || 2 || This wretched world
is caught in birth and death; in the love of duality, it has forgotten devotional worship of
the Lord. Meeting the True Guru, the Guru‟s Teachings are obtained; the faithless cynic
loses the game of life. || 3 || Breaking my bonds, the True Guru has set me free, and
I shall not be cast into the womb of reincarnation again. O Nanak, the jewel of spiritual
wisdom shines forth, and the Lord, the Formless Lord, dwells within my mind. || 4 || 8
|| SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL: The treasure of the Name, for which you have come into
the world — that Ambrosial Nectar is with the Guru. Renounce costumes, disguises and
clever tricks; this fruit is not obtained by duplicity. || 1 || O my mind, remain steady,
and do not wander away. By searching around on the outside, you shall only suffer
great pain; the Ambrosial Nectar is found within the home of your own being. || Pause
|| Renounce corruption, and seek virtue; committing sins, you shall only come to
regret and repent. You do not know the difference between good and evil; again and
again, you sink into the mud. || 2 || Within you is the great filth of greed and
falsehood; why do you bother to wash your body on the outside? Chant the Immaculate
Naam, the Name of the Lord always, under Guru‟s Instruction; only then will your
innermost being be emancipated. || 3 || Let greed and slander be far away from you,
and renounce falsehood; through the True Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, you shall obtain
the true fruit. As it pleases You, You preserve me, Dear Lord; servant Nanak sings the
Praises of Your Shabad. || 4 || 9 || SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, PANCH-PADAS: You
cannot save your own home from being plundered; why do you spy on the houses of
others? That Gurmukh who joins himself to the Guru‟s service, saves his own home,
and tastes the Lord‟s Nectar. || 1 || O mind, you must realize what your intellect is
focused on. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is involved with other
tastes; the unfortunate wretch shall come to regret it in the end. || Pause || When
things come, he is pleased, but when they go, he weeps and wails; this pain and
pleasure remains attached to him. The Lord Himself causes him to enjoy pleasure and
endure pain; the Gurmukh, however, remains unaffected. || 2 || What else can be
said to be above the subtle essence of the Lord? One who drinks it in is satisfied and
satiated. One who is lured by Maya loses this juice; that faithless cynic is tied to his evilmindedness. || 3 || The Lord is the life of the mind, the Master of the breath of life;
the Divine Lord is contained in the body. If You so bless us, Lord, then we sing Your
Praises; the mind is satisfied and fulfilled, lovingly attached to the Lord. || 4 || In the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the subtle essence of the Lord is obtained;
meeting the Guru, the fear of death departs. O Nanak, chant the Name of the Lord, as
Gurmukh; you shall obtain the Lord, and realize your pre-ordained destiny. || 5 || 10 ||
SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL: Destiny, pre-ordained by the Lord, looms over the heads of all
beings; no one is without this pre-ordained destiny. Only He Himself is beyond destiny;
creating the creation by His creative power, He beholds it, and causes His Command to
be followed. || 1 || O mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and be at peace. 

Day and night, serve at the Guru‟s feet; the Lord is the Giver, and the Enjoyer. ||
Pause || He is within — see Him outside as well; there is no one, other than Him. As
Gurmukh, look upon all with the single eye of equality; in each and every heart, the
Divine Light is contained. || 2 || Restrain your fickle mind, and keep it steady within
its own home; meeting the Guru, this understanding is obtained. Seeing the unseen
Lord, you shall be amazed and delighted; forgetting your pain, you shall be at peace. ||
3 || Drinking in the ambrosial nectar, you shall attain the highest bliss, and dwell
within the home of your own self. So sing the Praises of the Lord, the Destroyer of the
fear of birth and death, and you shall not be reincarnated again. || 4 || The essence,
the immaculate Lord, the Light of all — I am He and He is me — there is no difference
between us. The Infinite Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God — Nanak has met
with Him, the Guru. || 5 || 11 ||
SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

When I am pleasing to Him, then I sing His Praises. Singing His Praises, I receive the
fruits of my rewards. The rewards of singing His Praises are obtained when He Himself
gives them. || 1 || O my mind, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the treasure
is obtained; this is why I remain immersed in the True Name. || Pause || When I
awoke within myself to the Guru‟s Teachings, then I renounced my fickle intellect.
When the Light of the Guru‟s Teachings dawned, and then all darkness was dispelled.
|| 2 || When the mind is attached to the Guru‟s Feet, then the Path of Death recedes.
Through the Fear of God, one attains the Fearless Lord; then, one enters the home of
celestial bliss. || 3 || Prays Nanak, how rare are those who reflect and understand,
the most sublime action in this world. The noblest deed is to sing the Lord‟s Praises,
and so meet the Lord Himself. || 4 || 1 || 12 ||

SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

All of Your servants, who relish the Word of Your Shabad, serve You. By Guru‟s Grace,
they become pure, eradicating self-conceit from within. Night and day, they continually
sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord; they are adorned with the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. || 1 || O my Lord and Master, I am Your child; I seek Your Sanctuary.
You are the One and Only Lord, the Truest of the True; You Yourself are the Destroyer
of ego. || Pause || Those who remain wakeful obtain God; through the Word of the
Shabad, they conquer their ego. Immersed in family life, the Lord‟s humble servant ever
remains detached; he reflects upon the essence of spiritual wisdom. Serving the True
Guru, he finds eternal peace, and he keeps the Lord enshrined in his heart. || 2 ||
This mind wanders in the ten directions; it is consumed by the love of duality. 

The foolish self-willed manmukh does not remember the Lord‟s Name; he wastes away
his life in vain. But when he meets the True Guru, then he obtains the Name; he sheds
egotism and emotional attachment. || 3 || The Lord‟s humble servants are True —
they practice Truth, and reflect upon the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The True Lord
God unites them with Himself, and they keep the True Lord enshrined in their hearts. O
Nanak, through the Name, I have obtained salvation and understanding; this alone is
my wealth. || 4 || 1 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL: The True Lord has blessed His
devotees with the treasure of devotional worship, and the wealth of the Lord‟s Name.
The wealth of the Naam, shall never be exhausted; no one can estimate its worth. With
the wealth of the Naam, their faces are radiant, and they attain the True Lord. || 1 ||
O my mind, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the Lord is found. Without the
Shabad, the world wanders around, and receives its punishment in the Court of the
Lord. || Pause || Within this body dwell the five thieves: sexual desire, anger, greed,
emotional attachment and egotism. They plunder the Nectar, but the self-willed
manmukh does not realize it; no one hears his complaint. The world is blind, and its
dealings are blind as well; without the Guru, there is only pitch darkness. || 2 ||
Indulging in egotism and possessiveness, they are ruined; when they depart, nothing
goes along with them. But one who becomes Gurmukh meditates on the Naam, and
ever contemplates the Lord‟s Name. Through the True Word of Gurbani, he sings the
Glorious Praises of the Lord; blessed with the Lord‟s Glance of Grace, he is enraptured.
|| 3 || The spiritual wisdom of the True Guru is a steady light within the heart. The
Lord‟s decree is over the heads of even kings. Night and day, the Lord‟s devotees
worship Him; night and day, they gather in the true profit of the Lord‟s Name. O Nanak,
through the Lord‟s Name, one is emancipated; attuned to the Shabad, he finds the
Lord. || 4 || 2 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL: If one becomes the slave of the Lord‟s
slaves, then he finds the Lord, and eradicates ego from within. The Lord of bliss is his
object of devotion; night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Attuned to
the Word of the Shabad, the Lord‟s devotees remain ever as one, absorbed in the Lord.
|| 1 || O Dear Lord, Your Glance of Grace is True. Show mercy to Your slave, O
Beloved Lord, and preserve my honor. || Pause || Continually praising the Word of
the Shabad, I live; under Guru‟s Instruction, my fear has been dispelled. My True Lord
God is so beautiful! Serving the Guru, my consciousness is focused on Him. One who
chants the True Word of the Shabad, and the Truest of the True, the Word of His Bani,
remains wakeful, day and night. || 2 || He is so very deep and profound, the Giver of
eternal peace; no one can find His limit. Serving the Perfect Guru, one becomes
carefree, enshrining the Lord within the mind. The mind and body become immaculately
pure, and a lasting peace fills the heart; doubt is eradicated from within. || 3 || The
Way of the Lord is always such a difficult path; only a few find it, contemplating the
Guru. Imbued with the Lord‟s Love, and intoxicated with the Shabad, he renounces ego
and corruption. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, and the Love of the One Lord, he is
embellished with the Word of the Shabad. 

|| 4 || 3 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL: Dear Beloved Lord, I praise You continually, as
long as there is the breath within my body. If I were to forget You, for a moment, even
for an instant, O Lord Master, it would be like fifty years for me. I was always such a
fool and an idiot, O Siblings of Destiny, but now, through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, my mind is enlightened. || 1 || Dear Lord, You Yourself bestow
understanding. Dear Lord, I am forever a sacrifice to You; I am dedicated and devoted
to Your Name. || Pause || I have died in the Word of the Shabad, and through the
Shabad, I am dead while yet alive, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Shabad, I have
been liberated. Through the Shabad, my mind and body have been purified, and the
Lord has come to dwell within my mind. The Guru is the Giver of the Shabad; my mind
is imbued with it, and I remain absorbed in the Lord. || 2 || Those who do not know
the Shabad are blind and deaf; why did they even bother to come into the world? They
do not obtain the subtle essence of the Lord‟s elixir; they waste away their lives, and
are reincarnated over and over again. The blind, idiotic, self-willed manmukhs are like
maggots in manure, and in manure they rot away. || 3 || The Lord Himself creates us,
watches over us, and places us on the Path, O Siblings of Destiny; there is no one other
than Him. No one can erase that which is pre-ordained, O Siblings of Destiny; whatever
the Creator wills, comes to pass. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides
deep within the mind; O Siblings of Destiny, there is no other at all. || 4 || 4 ||

SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL: The Gurmukhs practice devotional worship, and become
pleasing to God; night and day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. You
Yourself protect and take care of Your devotees, who are pleasing to Your Mind. You
are the Giver of virtue, realized through the Word of Your Shabad. Uttering Your
Glories, we merge with You, O Glorious Lord. || 1 || O my mind, remember always
the Dear Lord. At the very last moment, He alone shall be your best friend; He shall
always stand by you. || Pause || The gathering of the wicked enemies shall always
practice falsehood; they do not contemplate understanding. Who can obtain fruit from
the slander of evil enemies? Remember that Harnaakhash was torn apart by the Lord‟s
claws. Prahlaad, the Lord‟s humble servant, constantly sang the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, and the Dear Lord saved him. || 2 || The self-willed manmukhs see themselves
as being very virtuous; they have absolutely no understanding at all. They indulge in
slander of the humble spiritual people; they waste their lives away, and then they have
to depart. They never think of the Lord‟s Name, and in the end, they depart, regretting
and repenting. || 3 || The Lord makes the lives of His devotees fruitful; He Himself
links them to the Guru‟s service. Imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and intoxicated
with celestial bliss, night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Slave
Nanak utters this prayer: O Lord, please, let me fall at their feet. || 4 || 5 || SORAT‟H,
THIRD MEHL: He alone is a Sikh, a friend, a relative and a sibling, who walks in the
Way of the Guru‟s Will. One who walks according to his own will, O Siblings of Destiny,
suffers separation from the Lord, and shall be punished. Without the True Guru, peace
is never obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; again and again, he regrets and repents. || 1
|| The Lord‟s slaves are happy, O Siblings of Destiny. 

The sins and sorrows of countless lifetimes are eradicated; the Lord Himself unites
them in His Union. || Pause || All of these relatives are like chains upon the soul, O
Siblings of Destiny; the world is deluded by doubt. Without the Guru, the chains cannot
be broken; the Gurmukhs find the door of salvation. One who performs rituals without
realizing the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, shall die and be reborn, again and again. || 2
|| The world is entangled in egotism and possessiveness, O Siblings of Destiny, but no
one belongs to anyone else. The Gurmukhs attain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence,
singing the Glories of the Lord; they dwell in the home of their own inner being. One
who understands here, realizes himself; the Lord God belongs to him. || 3 || The
True Guru is forever merciful, O Siblings of Destiny; without good destiny, what can
anyone obtain? He looks alike upon all with His Glance of Grace, but people receive the
fruits of their rewards according to their love for the Lord. O Nanak, when the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind, then self-conceit is eradicated
from within. || 4 || 6 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL, CHAU-TUKAS: True devotional
worship is obtained only through the True Guru, when the True Word of His Bani is in
the heart. Serving the True Guru, eternal peace is obtained; egotism is obliterated
through the Word of the Shabad. Without the Guru, there is no true devotion;
otherwise, people wander around, deluded by ignorance. The self-willed manmukhs
wander around, suffering in constant pain; they drown and die, even without water. ||
1 || O Siblings of Destiny, remain forever in the Lord‟s Sanctuary, under His
Protection. Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He preserves our honor, and blesses us with
the glory of the Lord‟s Name. || Pause || Through the Perfect Guru, one comes to
understand himself, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. The Lord, the Life of
the world, ever abides in his heart, and he renounces sexual desire, anger and egotism.
The Lord is ever-present, permeating and pervading all places; the Name of the Infinite
Lord is enshrined within the heart. Throughout the ages, through the Word of His Bani,
His Shabad is realized, and the Name becomes so sweet and beloved to the mind. || 2
|| Serving the Guru, one realizes the Naam, the Name of the Lord; fruitful is his life,
and his coming into the world. Tasting the sublime elixir of the Lord, his mind is
satisfied and satiated forever; singing the Glories of the Glorious Lord, he is fulfilled and
satisfied. The lotus of his heart blossoms forth, he is ever imbued with the Lord‟s Love,
and the unstruck melody of the Shabad resounds within him. His body and mind
become immaculately pure; his speech becomes immaculate as well, and he merges in
the Truest of the True. || 3 || No one knows the state of the Lord‟s Name; through
the Guru‟s Teachings, it comes to abide in the heart. One who becomes Gurmukh,
understands the Path; his tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord‟s Nectar.
Meditation, austere self-discipline and self-restraint are all obtained from the Guru; the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to abide within the heart. O Nanak, those humble
beings who praise the Naam are beautiful; they are honored in the Court of the True
Lord. || 4 || 7 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL, DU-TUKAS: Meeting the True Guru, one
turns away from the world, O Siblings of Destiny; when he remains dead while yet
alive, he obtains true understanding. He alone is the Guru, and he alone is a Sikh, O
Siblings of Destiny, whose light merges in the Light. || 1 || O my mind, be lovingly
attuned to the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Chanting the Name of the Lord, it seems so
sweet to the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; the Gurmukhs obtain a place in the Court of
the Lord. || Pause || 

Without the Guru, love for the Lord does not well up, O Siblings of Destiny; the selfwilled manmukhs are engrossed in the love of duality. Actions performed by the
manmukh are like the threshing of the chaff — they obtain nothing for their efforts. ||
2 || Meeting the Guru, the Naam comes to permeate the mind, O Siblings of Destiny,
with true love and affection. He always sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O Siblings
of Destiny, with infinite love for the Guru. || 3 || How blessed and approved is his
coming into the world, O Siblings of Destiny, who focuses his mind on serving the Guru.
O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is obtained, O Siblings of Destiny, through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, and we merge with the Lord. || 4 || 8 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL,
FIRST HOUSE: The three worlds are entangled in the three qualities, O Siblings of
Destiny; the Guru imparts understanding. Attached to the Lord‟s Name, one is
emancipated, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the wise ones about this. || 1 || O
mind, renounce the three qualities, and focus your consciousness on the fourth state.
The Dear Lord abides in the mind, O Siblings of Destiny; ever sing the Glorious Praises
of the Lord. || Pause || From the Naam, everyone originated, O Siblings of Destiny;
forgetting the Naam, they die away. The ignorant world is blind, O Siblings of Destiny;
those who sleep are plundered. || 2 || Those Gurmukhs who remain awake are
saved, O Siblings of Destiny; they cross over the terrifying world-ocean. In this world,
the Name of the Lord is the true profit, O Siblings of Destiny; keep it enshrined within
your heart. || 3 || In the Guru‟s Sanctuary, O Siblings of Destiny, you shall be saved;
be lovingly attuned to the Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, the Name of the Lord is the boat, and
the Name is the raft, O Siblings of Destiny; setting out on it, the Lord‟s humble servant
crosses over the world-ocean. || 4 || 9 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:
The True Guru is the ocean of peace in the world; there is no other place of rest and
peace. The world is afflicted with the painful disease of egotism; dying, only to be
reborn, it cries out in pain. || 1 || O mind, serve the True Guru, and obtain peace. If
you serve the True Guru, you shall find peace; otherwise, you shall depart, after
wasting away your life in vain. || Pause || Led around by the three qualities, he
does many deeds, but he does not come to taste and savor the subtle essence of the
Lord. He says his evening prayers, and makes offerings of water, and recites his
morning prayers, but without true understanding, he still suffers in pain. || 2 || One
who serves the True Guru is very fortunate; as the Lord so wills, he meets with the
Guru. Drinking in the sublime essence of the Lord, His humble servants remain ever
satisfied; they eradicate self-conceit from within themselves. || 3 || This world is
blind, and all act blindly; without the Guru, no one finds the Path. O Nanak, meeting
with the True Guru, one sees with his eyes, and finds the True Lord within the home of
his own being. || 4 || 10 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL: Without serving the True Guru,
he suffers in terrible pain, and throughout the four ages, he wanders aimlessly. I am
poor and meek, and throughout the ages, You are the Great Giver — please, grant me
the understanding of the Shabad. || 1 || O Dear Beloved Lord, please show mercy to
me. Unite me in the Union of the True Guru, the Great Giver, and give me the support
of the Lord‟s Name. || Pause || Conquering my desires and duality, I have merged
in celestial peace, and I have found the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord. I have
tasted the sublime essence of the Lord, and my soul has become immaculately pure;
the Lord is the Destroyer of sins. 

|| 2 || Dying in the Word of the Shabad, you shall live forever, and you shall never die
again. The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam is ever-sweet to the mind; but how few are
those who obtain the Shabad. || 3 || The Great Giver keeps His Gifts in His Hand; He
gives them to those with whom He is pleased. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, they
find peace, and in the Court of the Lord, they are exalted. || 4 || 11 || SORAT‟H,
THIRD MEHL: Serving the True Guru, the divine melody wells up within, and one is
blessed with wisdom and salvation. The True Name of the Lord comes to abide in the
mind, and through the Name, one merges in the Name. || 1 || Without the True
Guru, the whole world is insane. The blind, self-willed manmukhs do not realize the
Word of the Shabad; they are deluded by false doubts. || Pause || The three-faced
Maya had led them astray in doubt, and they are snared by the noose of egotism. Birth
and death hang over their heads, and being reborn from the womb, they suffer in pain.
|| 2 || The three qualities permeate the whole world; acting in ego, it loses its honor.
But one who becomes Gurmukh comes to realize the fourth state of celestial bliss; he
finds peace through the Name of the Lord. || 3 || The three qualities are all Yours, O
Lord; You Yourself created them. Whatever You do, comes to pass. O Nanak, through
the Lord‟s Name, one is emancipated; through the Shabad, he is rid of egotism. || 4 ||
12 ||
SORAT‟H, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

My Beloved Lord Himself pervades and permeates all; He Himself is, all by Himself. My
Beloved Himself is the trader in this world; He Himself is the true banker. My Beloved
Himself is the trade and the trader; He Himself is the true credit. || 1 || O mind,
meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, and praise His Name. By Guru‟s Grace, the Beloved,
Ambrosial, unapproachable and unfathomable Lord is obtained. || Pause || The
Beloved Himself sees and hears everything; He Himself speaks through the mouths of
all beings. The Beloved Himself leads us into the wilderness, and He Himself shows us
the Way. The Beloved Himself is Himself all-in-all; He Himself is carefree. || 2 || The
Beloved Himself, all by Himself, created everything; He Himself links all to their tasks.
The Beloved Himself creates the Creation, and He Himself destroys it. He Himself is the
wharf, and He Himself is the ferryman, who ferries us across. || 3 || The Beloved
Himself is the ocean, and the boat; He Himself is the Guru, the boatman who steers it.
The Beloved Himself sets sail and crosses over; He, the King, beholds His wondrous
play. The Beloved Himself is the Merciful Master; O servant Nanak, He forgives and
blends with Himself. || 4 || 1 || SORAT‟H, FOURTH MEHL: He Himself is born of the
egg, from the womb, from sweat and from the earth; He Himself is the continents and
all the worlds. He Himself is the thread, and He Himself is the many beads; through His
Almighty Power, He has strung the worlds. 

He holds the thread, and when He withdraws the thread, the beads scatter into heaps.
|| 1 || O my mind, there is no other than the Lord for me. The treasure of the Beloved
Naam is within the True Guru; in His Mercy, he pours the Ambrosial Nectar into my
mouth. || Pause || The Beloved Himself is in all the oceans and lands; whatever God
does, comes to pass. The Beloved brings nourishment to all; there is no other than Him.
The Beloved Himself plays, and whatever He Himself does, comes to pass. || 2 || The
Beloved Himself, all by Himself, is immaculate and pure; He Himself is immaculate and
pure. The Beloved Himself determines the value of all; whatever He does comes to
pass. The Beloved Himself is unseen — He cannot be seen; He Himself causes us to
see. || 3 || The Beloved Himself is deep and profound and unfathomable; there is no
other as great as He. The Beloved Himself enjoys every heart; He is contained within
every woman and man. O Nanak, the Beloved is pervading everywhere, but He is
hidden; through the Guru, He is revealed. || 4 || 2 || SORAT‟H, FOURTH MEHL: He
Himself, the Beloved, is Himself all-in-all; He Himself establishes and disestablishes. The
Beloved Himself beholds, and rejoices; God Himself works wonders, and beholds them.
The Beloved Himself is contained in all the woods and meadows; as Gurmukh, He
reveals Himself. || 1 || Meditate, O mind, on the Lord, Har, Har; through the sublime
essence of Lord‟s Name, you shall be satisfied. The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, is
the sweetest juice; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, its taste is revealed. ||
Pause || The Beloved is Himself the place of pilgrimage and the raft; God Himself
ferries Himself across. The Beloved Himself casts the net over all the world; the Lord
Himself is the fish. The Beloved Himself is infallible; He makes no mistakes. There is no
other like Him to be seen. || 2 || The Beloved Himself is the Yogi‟s horn, and the
sound current of the Naad; He Himself plays the tune. The Beloved Himself is the Yogi,
the Primal Being; He Himself practices intense meditation. He Himself is the True Guru,
and He Himself is the disciple; God Himself imparts the Teachings. || 3 || The
Beloved Himself inspires us to chant His Name, and He Himself practices meditation.
The Beloved Himself is the Ambrosial Nectar; He Himself is the juice of it. The Beloved
Himself praises Himself; servant Nanak is satisfied, with the sublime essence of the
Lord. || 4 || 3 || SORAT‟H, FOURTH MEHL: God Himself is the balance scale, He
Himself is the weigher, and He Himself weighs with the weights. He Himself is the
banker, He Himself is the trader, and He Himself makes the trades. The Beloved
Himself fashioned the world, and He Himself counter-balances it with a gram. || 1 ||
My mind meditates on the Lord, Har, Har, and finds peace. The Name of the Beloved
Lord, Har, Har, is a treasure; the Perfect Guru has made it seem sweet to me. ||
Pause || The Beloved Himself is the earth, and He Himself is the water; He Himself
acts, and causes others to act. The Beloved Himself issues His Commands, and keeps
the water and the land bound down. 

The Beloved Himself instills the Fear of God; He binds the tiger and the goat together.
|| 2 || The Beloved Lord Himself is the firewood, and He Himself keeps the fire within
the wood. The Beloved Lord Himself, all by Himself, permeates them, and because of
the Fear of God, the fire cannot burn the wood. The Beloved Himself kills and revives;
all draw the breath of life, given by Him. || 3 || The Beloved Himself is power and
presence; He Himself engages us in our work. As the Beloved makes me walk, I walk,
as it pleases my Lord God. The Beloved Himself is the musician, and the musical
instrument; servant Nanak vibrates His vibration. || 4 || 4 || SORAT‟H, FOURTH
MEHL: The Beloved Himself created the Universe; He made the light of the sun and the
moon. The Beloved Himself is the power of the powerless; He Himself is the honor of
the dishonored. The Beloved Himself grants His Grace and protects us; He Himself is
wise and all-knowing. || 1 || O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, and receive His
Insignia. Join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and meditate on the Lord, Har,
Har; you shall not have to come and go in reincarnation again. || Pause || The
Beloved Himself pervades His Glorious Praises, and He Himself approves them. The
Beloved Himself grants His forgiveness, and He Himself bestows the Insignia of Truth.
The Beloved Himself obeys His Will, and He Himself issues His Command. || 2 || The
Beloved Himself is the treasure of devotion; He Himself gives His gifts. The Beloved
Himself commits some to His service, and He Himself blesses them with honor. The
Beloved Himself is absorbed in Samaadhi; He Himself is the treasure of excellence. || 3
|| The Beloved Himself is the greatest; He Himself is supreme. The Beloved Himself
appraises the value; He Himself is the scale, and the weights. The Beloved Himself is
unweighable — He weighs Himself; servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. || 4 ||
5 || SORAT‟H, FOURTH MEHL: The Beloved Himself commits some to His service; He
Himself blesses them with the joy of devotional worship. The Beloved Himself causes us
to sing His Glorious Praises; He Himself is absorbed in the Word of His Shabad. He
Himself is the pen, and He Himself is the scribe; He Himself inscribes His inscription. ||
1 || O my mind, joyfully chant the Name of the Lord. Those very fortunate ones are in
ecstasy night and day; through the Perfect Guru, they obtain the profit of the Lord‟s
Name. || Pause || The Beloved Himself is the milk-maid and Krishna; He Himself
herds the cows in the woods. The Beloved Himself is the blue-skinned, handsome one;
He Himself plays on His flute. The Beloved Himself took the form of a child, and
destroyed Kuwalia-peer, the mad elephant. || 2 || The Beloved Himself sets the
stage; He performs the plays, and He Himself watches them. The Beloved Himself
assumed the form of the child, and killed the demons Chandoor, Kansa and Kaysee.
The Beloved Himself, by Himself, is the embodiment of power; He shatters the power of
the fools and idiots. || 3 || The Beloved Himself created the whole world. 

In His hands He holds the power of the ages. The Beloved Himself puts the chains
around their necks; as God pulls them, must they go. Whoever harbors pride shall be
destroyed, O Beloved; meditating on the Lord, Nanak is absorbed in devotional worship.
|| 4 || 6 || SORAT‟H, FOURTH MEHL, DU-TUKAS: Separated from the Lord for
countless lifetimes, the self-willed manmukh suffers in pain, engaged in acts of egotism.
Beholding the Holy Saint, I found God; O Lord of the Universe, I seek Your Sanctuary.
|| 1 || The Love of God is very dear to me. When I joined the Sat Sangat, the
Company of the Holy People, the Lord, the embodiment of peace, came into my heart.
|| Pause || You dwell, hidden, within my heart day and night, Lord; but the poor
fools do not understand Your Love. Meeting with the Almighty True Guru, God was
revealed to me; I sing His Glorious Praises, and reflect upon His Glories. || 2 || As
Gurmukh, I have become enlightened; peace has come, and evil-mindedness has been
dispelled from my mind. Understanding the relationship of the individual soul with God,
I have found peace, in Your Sat Sangat, Your True Congregation, O Lord. || 3 ||
Those who are blessed by Your Kind Mercy, meet the Almighty Lord, and find the Guru.
Nanak has found the immeasurable, celestial peace; night and day, he remains awake
to the Lord, the Master of the Forest of the Universe. || 4 || 7 || SORAT‟H, FOURTH
MEHL: The inner depths of my mind are pierced by love for the Lord; I cannot live
without the Lord. Just as the fish dies without water, I die without the Lord‟s Name. ||
1 || O my God, please bless me with the water of Your Name. I beg for Your Name,
deep within myself, day and night; through the Name, I find peace. || Pause || The
song-bird cries out for lack of water — without water, its thirst cannot be quenched.
The Gurmukh obtains the water of celestial bliss, and is rejuvenated, blossoming forth
through the blessed Love of the Lord. || 2 || The self-willed manmukhs are hungry,
wandering around in the ten directions; without the Name, they suffer in pain. They are
born, only to die, and enter into reincarnation again; in the Court of the Lord, they are
punished. || 3 || But if the Lord shows His Mercy, then one comes to sing His
Glorious Praises; deep within the nucleus of his own self, he finds the sublime essence
of the Lord‟s elixir. The Lord has become Merciful to meek Nanak, and through the
Word of the Shabad, his desires are quenched. || 4 || 8 || SORAT‟H, FOURTH MEHL,
PANCH-PADAS: If one eats the uneatable, then he becomes a Siddha, a being of
perfect spirituality; through this perfection, he obtains wisdom. When the arrow of the
Lord‟s Love pierces his body, then his doubt is eradicated. || 1 || O my Lord of the
Universe, please bless Your humble servant with glory. Under Guru‟s Instructions,
enlighten me with the Lord‟s Name, that I may dwell forever in Your Sanctuary. ||
Pause || This whole world is engrossed in coming and going; O my foolish and
ignorant mind, be mindful of the Lord. O Dear Lord, please, take pity upon me, and
unite me with the Guru, that I may merge in the Lord‟s Name. || 2 || Only one who
has it knows God; he alone has it, to whom God has given it — so very beautiful,
unapproachable and unfathomable. Through the Perfect Guru, the unknowable is
known. || 3 || Only one who tastes it knows it, like the mute, who tastes the sweet
candy, but cannot speak of it. 

The jewel is concealed, but it is not concealed, even though one may try to conceal it.
|| 4 || Everything is Yours, O Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts; You are the Lord God
of all. He alone receives the gift, unto whom You give it; O servant Nanak, there is no
one else. || 5 || 9 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, TI-TUKAS:

Who should I ask? Who should I worship? All were created by Him. Whoever appears to
be the greatest of the great, shall ultimately be mixed with the dust. The Fearless,
Formless Lord, the Destroyer of Fear bestows all comforts, and the nine treasures. || 1
|| O Dear Lord, Your gifts alone satisfy me. Why should I praise the poor helpless
man? Why should I feel subservient to him? || Pause || All things come to one who
meditates on the Lord; the Lord satisfies his hunger. The Lord, the Giver of peace,
bestows such wealth, that it can never be exhausted. I am in ecstasy, absorbed in
celestial peace; the True Guru has united me in His Union. || 2 || O mind, chant the
Naam, the Name of the Lord; worship the Naam, night and day, and recite the Naam.
Listen to the Teachings of the Holy Saints, and all fear of death will be dispelled. Those
blessed by God‟s Grace are attached to the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. || 3 || Who can
estimate Your worth, God? You are kind and compassionate to all beings. Everything
which You do, prevails; I am just a poor child — what can I do? Protect and preserve
Your servant Nanak; be kind to him, like a father to his son. || 4 || 1 || SORAT‟H,
FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, CHAU-TUKAS: Praise the Guru, and the Lord of the
Universe, O Siblings of Destiny; enshrine Him in your mind, body and heart. Let the
True Lord and Master abide in your mind, O Siblings of Destiny; this is the most
excellent way of life. Those bodies, in which the Name of the Lord does not well up, O
Siblings of Destiny — those bodies are reduced to ashes. I am a sacrifice to the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Siblings of Destiny; they take the Support of the
One and Only Lord. || 1 || So worship and adore that True Lord, O Siblings of
Destiny; He alone does everything. The Perfect Guru has taught me, O Siblings of
Destiny, that without Him, there is no other at all. || Pause || Without the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, they putrefy and die, O Siblings of Destiny; their numbers cannot be
counted. Without Truth, purity cannot be achieved, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is
true and unfathomable. Coming and going do not end, O Siblings of Destiny; pride in
worldly valuables is false. The Gurmukh saves millions of people, O Siblings of Destiny,
blessing them with even a particle of the Name. || 2 || I have searched through the
Simritees and the Shaastras, O Siblings of Destiny — without the True Guru, doubt does
not depart. They are so tired of performing their many deeds, O Siblings of Destiny, but
they fall into bondage again and again. I have searched in the four directions, O
Siblings of Destiny, but without the True Guru, there is no place at all. 

By great good fortune, I found the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, and I meditate on the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || The Truth is forever pure, O Siblings of Destiny;
those who are true are pure. When the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace, O Siblings of
Destiny, then one obtains Him. Among millions, O Siblings of Destiny, hardly one
humble servant of the Lord is found. Nanak is imbued with the True Name, O Siblings
of Destiny; hearing it, the mind and body become immaculately pure. || 4 || 2 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, DU-TUKAS: As long as this person believes in love and hate,
it is difficult for him to meet the Lord. As long as he discriminates between himself and
others, he will distance himself from the Lord. || 1 || O Lord, grant me such
understanding, that I might serve the Holy Saints, and seek the protection of their feet,
and not forget them, for a moment, even an instant. || Pause || O foolish,
thoughtless and fickle mind, such understanding did not come into your heart.
Renouncing the Lord of Life, you have become engrossed in other things, and you are
involved with your enemies. || 2 || Sorrow does not afflict one who does not harbor
self-conceit; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have attained this
understanding. Know that the babbling of the faithless cynic is like wind passing by. ||
3 || This mind is inundated by millions of sins — what can I say? Nanak, Your humble
servant has come to Your Sanctuary, God; please, erase all his accounts. || 4 || 3 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Children, spouses, men and women in one‟s household, are all
bound by Maya. At the very last moment, none of them shall stand by you; their love is
totally false. || 1 || O man, why do you pamper your body so? It shall disperse like a
cloud of smoke; vibrate upon the One, the Beloved Lord. || Pause || There are three
ways in which the body can be consumed — it can be thrown into water, given to the
dogs, or cremated to ashes. He considers himself to be immortal; he sits in his home,
and forgets the Lord, the Cause of causes. || 2 || In various ways, the Lord has
fashioned the beads, and strung them on a slender thread. The thread shall break, O
wretched man, and then, you shall repent and regret. || 3 || He created you, and
after creating you, He adorned you — meditate on Him day and night. God has
showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak; I hold tight to the Support of the True Guru.
|| 4 || 4 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: I met the True Guru, by great good fortune, and
my mind has been enlightened. No one else can equal me, because I have the loving
support of my Lord and Master. || 1 || I am a sacrifice to my True Guru. I am at
peace in this world, and I shall be in celestial peace in the next; my home is filled with
bliss. || Pause || He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, the Creator, my
Lord and Master. I have become fearless, attached to the Guru‟s feet; I take the
Support of the Name of the One Lord. || 2 || Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of His
Darshan; the Form of God is deathless; He is and shall always be. He hugs His humble
servants close, and protects and preserves them; their love for Him is sweet to Him. ||
3 || Great is His glorious greatness, and wondrous is His magnificence; through Him,
all affairs are resolved. 

Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru; all his sorrows have been dispelled. || 4 || 5 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: To the happy person, everyone seems happy; to the sick
person, everyone seems sick. The Lord and Master acts, and causes us to act; union is
in His Hands. || 1 || O my mind, no one appears to be mistaken, to one who has
dispelled his own doubts; he realizes that everyone is God. || Pause || One whose
mind is comforted in the Society of the Saints, believes that all are joyful. One whose
mind is afflicted by the disease of egotism, cries out in birth and death. || 2 ||
Everything is clear to one whose eyes are blessed with the ointment of spiritual wisdom.
In the darkness of spiritual ignorance, he sees nothing at all; he wanders around in
reincarnation, over and over again. || 3 || Hear my prayer, O Lord and Master; Nanak
begs for this happiness: whereever Your Holy Saints sing the Kirtan of Your Praises, let
my mind be attached to that place. || 4 || 6 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: My body
belongs to the Saints, my wealth belongs to the Saints, and my mind belongs to the
Saints. By the Grace of the Saints, I meditate on the Lord‟s Name, and then, all
comforts come to me. || 1 || Without the Saints, there are no other givers. Whoever
takes to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, is carried across. || Pause || Millions of
sins are erased by serving the humble Saints, and singing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord with love. One finds peace in this world, and one‟s face is radiant in the next
world, by associating with the humble Saints, through great good fortune. || 2 || I
have only one tongue, and the Lord‟s humble servant is filled with countless virtues;
how can I sing his praises? The inaccessible, unapproachable and eternally unchanging
Lord is obtained in the Sanctuary of the Saints. || 3 || I am worthless, lowly, without
friends or support, and full of sins; I long for the Shelter of the Saints. I am drowning in
the deep, dark pit of household attachments — please save me, Lord! || 4 || 7 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: O Creator Lord, You fulfill the desires of those,
within whose heart You abide. Your slaves do not forget You; the dust of Your feet is
pleasing to their minds. || 1 || Your Unspoken Speech cannot be spoken. O treasure
of excellence, Giver of peace, Lord and Master, Your greatness is the highest of all. ||
Pause || The mortal does those deeds, and those alone, which You ordained by
destiny. Your servant, whom You bless with Your service, is satisfied and fulfilled,
beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. || 2 || You are contained in all, but he
alone realizes this, whom You bless with understanding. By Guru‟s Grace, his spiritual
ignorance is dispelled, and he is respected everywhere. || 3 || He alone is spiritually
enlightened, he alone is a meditator, and he alone is a man of good nature. Says
Nanak, one unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful, does not forget the Lord from his
mind. || 4 || 8 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The whole creation is engrossed in
emotional attachment; sometimes, one is high, and at other times, low. 

No one can be purified by any rituals or devices; they cannot reach their goal. || 1 ||
O my mind, emancipation is attained in the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints. Without the
Perfect Guru, births and deaths do not cease, and one comes and goes, over and over
again. || Pause || The whole world is entangled in what is called the delusion of
doubt. The perfect devotee of the Primal Lord God remains detached from everything.
|| 2 || Don‟t indulge in slander for any reason, for everything is the creation of the
Lord and Master. One who is blessed with the Mercy of my God, dwells on the Name in
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. || 3 || The Supreme Lord God, the
Transcendent Lord, the True Guru, saves all. Says Nanak, without the Guru, no one
crosses over; this is the perfect essence of all contemplation. || 4 || 9 || SORAT‟H,
FIFTH MEHL: I have searched and searched and searched, and found that the Lord‟s
Name is the most sublime reality. Contemplating it for even an instant, sins are erased;
the Gurmukh is carried across and saved. || 1 || Drink in the sublime essence of the
Lord‟s Name, O man of spiritual wisdom. Listening to the Ambrosial Words of the Holy
Saints, the mind finds absolute fulfillment and satisfaction. || Pause || Liberation,
pleasures, and the true way of life are obtained from the Lord, the Giver of all peace.
The Perfect Lord, the Architect of Destiny, blesses His slave with the gift of devotional
worship. || 2 || Hear with your ears, and sing with your tongue, and meditate within
your heart on Him. The Lord and Master is all-powerful, the Cause of causes; without
Him, there is nothing at all. || 3 || By great good fortune, I have obtained the jewel
of human life; have mercy on me, O Merciful Lord. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
of the Holy, Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and contemplates Him forever
in meditation. || 4 || 10 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: After taking your cleansing bath,
remember your God in meditation, and your mind and body shall be free of disease.
Millions of obstacles are removed, in the Sanctuary of God, and good fortune dawns. ||
1 || The Word of God‟s Bani, and His Shabad, are the best utterances. So constantly
sing them, listen to them, and read them, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Perfect Guru
shall save you. || Pause || The glorious greatness of the True Lord is immeasurable;
the Merciful Lord is the Lover of His devotees. He has preserved the honor of His
Saints; from the very beginning of time, His Nature is to cherish them. || 2 || So eat
the Ambrosial Name of the Lord as your food; put it into your mouth at all times. The
pains of old age and death shall all depart, when you constantly sing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord of the Universe. || 3 || My Lord and Master has heard my prayer,
and all my affairs have been resolved. The glorious greatness of Guru Nanak is
manifest, throughout all the ages. || 4 || 11 ||

SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

The One God is our father; we are the children of the One God. You are our Guru. 

Listen, friends: my soul is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You; O Lord, reveal to me the
Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. || 1 || Listen, friends: I am a sacrifice to the dust of
Your feet. This mind is yours, O Siblings of Destiny. || Pause || I wash your feet, I
massage and clean them; I give this mind to you. Listen, friends: I have come to Your
Sanctuary; teach me, that I might unite with God. || 2 || Do not be proud; seek His
Sanctuary, and accept as good all that He does. Listen, friends: dedicate your soul,
body and your whole being to Him; thus you shall receive the Blessed Vision of His
Darshan. || 3 || He has shown mercy to me, by the Grace of the Saints; the Lord‟s
Name is sweet to me. The Guru has shown mercy to servant Nanak; I see the casteless,
immaculate Lord everywhere. || 4 || 1 || 12 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: God is the
Lord and Master of millions of universes; He is the Giver of all beings. He ever cherishes
and cares for all beings, but the fool does not appreciate any of His virtues. || 1 || I
do not know how to worship the Lord in adoration. I can only repeat, “Lord, Lord,
Guru, Guru.” O Dear Lord, I go by the name of the Lord‟s slave. || Pause || The
Compassionate Lord is Merciful to the meek, the ocean of peace; He fills all hearts. He
sees, hears, and is always with me; but I am a fool, and I think that He is far away. ||
2 || The Lord is limitless, but I can only describe Him within my limitations; what do I
know, about what He is like? I offer my prayer to my True Guru; I am so foolish —
please, teach me! || 3 || I am just a fool, but millions of sinners just like me have
been saved. Those who have heard, and seen Guru Nanak, do not descend into the
womb of reincarnation again. || 4 || 2 || 13 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Those things,
which caused me such anxiety, have all vanished. Now, I sleep in peace and tranquility,
and my mind is in a state of deep and profound peace; the inverted lotus of my heart
has blossomed forth. || 1 || Behold, a wondrous miracle has happened! That Lord
and Master, whose wisdom is said to be unfathomable, has been enshrined within my
heart, by the Guru. || Pause || The demons which tormented me so much, have
themselves become terrified. They pray: please, save us from your Lord Master; we
seek your protection. || 2 || When the treasure of the Lord of the Universe is opened,
those who are pre-destined, receive it. The Guru has given me the one jewel, and my
mind and body have become peaceful and tranquil. || 3 || The Guru has blessed me
with the one drop of Ambrosial Nectar, and so I have become stable, unmoving and
immortal — I shall not die. The Lord blessed Guru Nanak with the treasure of devotional
worship, and did not call him to account again. || 4 || 3 || 14 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH
MEHL: Those whose minds are attached to the lotus feet of the Lord — those humble
beings are satisfied and fulfilled. But those, within whose hearts the priceless virtue
does not abide — those men remain thirsty and unsatisfied. || 1 || Worshipping the
Lord in adoration, one becomes happy, and free of disease. But one who forgets my
Dear Lord — know him to be afflicted with tens of thousands of illnesses. 

|| Pause || Those who hold tightly to Your Support, God, are happy in Your
Sanctuary. But those humble beings who forget the Primal Lord, the Architect of
Destiny, are counted among the most miserable beings. || 2 || One who has faith in
the Guru, and who is lovingly attached to God, enjoys the delights of supreme ecstasy.
One who forgets God and forsakes the Guru, falls into the most horrible hell. || 3 ||
As the Lord engages someone, so he is engaged, and so does he perform. Nanak has
taken to the Shelter of the Saints; his heart is absorbed in the Lord‟s feet. || 4 || 4 ||
15 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: As the king is entangled in kingly affairs, and the
egotist in his own egotism, and the greedy man is enticed by greed, so is the spiritually
enlightened being absorbed in the Love of the Lord. || 1 || This is what befits the
Lord‟s servant. Beholding the Lord near at hand, he serves the True Guru, and he is
satisfied through the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. || Pause || The addict is addicted
to his drug, and the landlord is in love with his land. As the baby is attached to his milk,
so the Saint is in love with God. || 2 || The scholar is absorbed in scholarship, and the
eyes are happy to see. As the tongue savors the tastes, so does the humble servant of
the Lord sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 3 || As is the hunger, so is the
fulfiller; He is the Lord and Master of all hearts. Nanak thirsts for the Blessed Vision of
the Lord‟s Darshan; he has met God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. || 4 ||
5 || 16 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: We are filthy, and You are immaculate, O Creator
Lord; we are worthless, and You are the Great Giver. We are fools, and You are wise
and all-knowing. You are the knower of all things. || 1 || O Lord, this is what we are,
and this is what You are. We are sinners, and You are the Destroyer of sins. Your abode
is so beautiful, O Lord and Master. || Pause || You fashion all, and having fashioned
them, You bless them. You bestow upon them soul, body and the breath of life. We are
worthless — we have no virtue at all; please, bless us with Your gift, O Merciful Lordand
Master. || 2 || You do good for us, but we do not see it as good; You are kind and
compassionate, forever and ever. You are the Giver of peace, the Primal Lord, the
Architect of Destiny; please, save us, Your children! || 3 || You are the treasure,
eternal Lord King; all beings and creatures beg of You. Says Nanak, such is our
condition; please, Lord, keep us on the Path of the Saints. || 4 || 6 || 17 || SORAT‟H,
FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE: In our mother‟s womb, You blessed us with Your
meditative remembrance, and You preserved us there. Through the countless waves of
the ocean of fire, please, carry us across and save us, O Savior Lord! || 1 || O Lord,
You are the Master above my head. Here and hereafter, You alone are my Support. ||
Pause || He looks upon the creation like a mountain of gold, and sees the Creator as
a blade of grass. You are the Great Giver, and we are all mere beggars; O God, You
give gifts according to Your Will. || 2 || In an instant, You are one thing, and in
another instant, You are another. Wondrous are Your ways! 

You are beautiful, mysterious, profound, unfathomable, lofty, inaccessible and infinite.
|| 3 || When You brought me to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, then I
heard the Bani of Your Word. Nanak is in ecstasy, beholding the Glory of the Primal
Lord of Nirvaanaa. || 4 || 7 || 18 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: I am the dust of the
feet of the Beloved Saints; I seek the Protection of their Sanctuary. The Saints are my
all-powerful Support; the Saints are my ornament and decoration. || 1 || I am hand
and glove with the Saints. I have realized my pre-ordained destiny. This mind is yours,
O Siblings of Destiny. || Pause || My dealings are with the Saints, and my business
is with the Saints. I have earned the profit with the Saints, and the treasure filled to
over-flowing with devotion to the Lord. || 2 || The Saints entrusted to me the capital,
and my mind‟s delusion was dispelled. What can the Righteous Judge of Dharma do
now? All my accounts have been torn up. || 3 || I have found the greatest bliss, and I
am at peace, by the Grace of the Saints. Says Nanak, my mind is reconciled with the
Lord; it is imbued with the wondrous Love of the Lord. || 4 || 8 || 19 || SORAT‟H,
FIFTH MEHL: All the things that you see, O man, you shall have to leave behind. Let
your dealings be with the Lord‟s Name, and you shall attain the state of Nirvaanaa. || 1
|| O my Beloved, You are the Giver of peace. The Perfect Guru has given me these
Teachings, and I am attuned to You. || Pause || In sexual desire, anger, greed,
emotional attachment and self-conceit, peace is not to be found. So be the dust of the
feet of all, O my mind, and then you shall find bliss, joy and peace. || 2 || He knows
the condition of your inner self, and He will not let your work go in vain — serve Him, O
mind. Worship Him, and dedicate this mind unto Him, the Image of the Undying Lord,
the Divine Guru. || 3 || He is the Lord of the Universe, the Compassionate Lord, the
Supreme Lord God, the Formless Lord. The Naam is my merchandise, the Naam is my
nourishment; the Naam, O Nanak, is the Support of my breath of life. || 4 || 9 || 20 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: He infuses the breath into the dead bodies, and he reunited
the separated ones. Even beasts, demons and fools become attentive listeners, when
He sings the Praises of the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || Behold the glorious greatness of the
Perfect Guru. His worth cannot be described. || Pause || He has demolished the
abode of sorrow and disease, and brought bliss, joy and happiness. He effortlessly
awards the fruits of the mind‟s desire, and all works are brought to perfection. || 2 ||
He finds peace in this world, and his face is radiant in the world hereafter; his comings
and goings are finished. He becomes fearless, and his heart is filled with the Naam, the
Name of the Lord; his mind is pleasing to the True Guru. || 3 || Standing up and
sitting down, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; his pain, sorrow and doubt are
dispelled. Says Nanak, his karma is perfect; his mind is attached to the Guru‟s feet. || 4
|| 10 || 21 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Forsaking the jewel, he is attached to the shell;
nothing will come of it. 

O my mind, meditate forever on the Perfect, Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent
Lord. || 1 || Meditate in remembrance on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O mortal.
Your frail body shall perish, you ignorant fool. || Pause || Illusions and dreamobjects possess nothing of greatness. Without meditating on the Lord, nothing
succeeds, and nothing will go along with you. || 2 || Acting in egotism and pride, his
life passes away, and he does nothing for his soul. Wandering and wandering all
around, he is never satisfied; he does not remember the Name of the Lord. || 3 ||
Intoxicated with the taste of corruption, cruel pleasures and countless sins, he is
consigned to the cycle of reincarnation. Nanak offers his prayer to God, to eradicate his
demerits. || 4 || 11 || 22 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Sing the Glorious Praises of the
Perfect, Imperishable Lord, and the poison of sexual desire and anger shall be burnt
away. You shall cross over the awesome, arduous ocean of fire, in the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy. || 1 || The Perfect Guru has dispelled the darkness of
doubt. Remember God with love and devotion; He is near at hand. || Pause || Drink
in the sublime essence, the treasure of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and your mind
and body shall remain satisfied. The Transcendent Lord is totally permeating and
pervading everywhere; where would He come from, and where would He go? || 2 ||
One whose mind is filled with the Lord, is a person of meditation, penance, selfrestraint and spiritual wisdom, and a knower of reality. The Gurmukh obtains the jewel
of the Naam; his efforts come to perfect fruition. || 3 || All his struggles, sufferings
and pains are dispelled, and the noose of death is cut away from him. Says Nanak, God
has extended His Mercy, and so his mind and body blossom forth. || 4 || 12 || 23 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: God is the Doer, the Cause of causes, the Great Giver; God is
the Supreme Lord and Master. The Merciful Lord created all beings; God is the Innerknower, the Searcher of hearts. || 1 || My Guru is Himself my friend and support. I
am in celestial peace, bliss, joy, pleasure and wondrous glory. || Pause || Seeking
the Sanctuary of the Guru, my fears have been dispelled, and I am accepted in the
Court of the True Lord. Singing His Glorious Praises, and worshipping in adoration the
Name of the Lord, I have reached my destination. || 2 || Everyone applauds and
congratulates me; the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is dear to me. I am
forever a sacrifice to my God, who has totally protected and preserved my honor. || 3
|| They are saved, who receive the Blessed Vision of His Darshan; they listen to the
spiritual dialogue of the Naam. Nanak‟s God has become Merciful to him; he has arrived
home in ecstasy. || 4 || 13 || 24 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: In God‟s Sanctuary, all
fears depart, suffering disappears, and peace is obtained. When the Supreme Lord God
and Master becomes merciful, we meditate on the Perfect True Guru. || 1 || O Dear
God, You are my Lord Master and Great Giver. By Your Mercy, O God, Merciful to the
meek, imbue me with Your Love, that I might sing Your Glorious Praises. || Pause || 

The True Guru has implanted the treasure of the Naam within me, and all my anxieties
have been dispelled. By His Mercy, He has made me His own, and the imperishable
Lord has come to dwell within my mind. || 2 || No misfortune afflicts one who is
protected by the True Guru. The Lotus Feet of God come to abide within his heart, and
he savors the sublime essence of the Lord‟s Ambrosial Nectar. || 3 || So, as a
servant, serve your God, who fulfills your mind‟s desires. Slave Nanak is a sacrifice to
the Perfect Lord, who has protected and preserved his honor. || 4 || 14 || 25 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Infatuated with the darkness of emotional attachment to
Maya, he does not know the Lord, the Great Giver. The Lord created his body and
fashioned his soul, but he claims that his power is his own. || 1 || O foolish mind,
God, your Lord and Master is watching over you. Whatever you do, He knows; nothing
can remain concealed from Him. || Pause || You are intoxicated with the tastes of
the tongue, with greed and pride; countless sins spring from these. You wandered in
pain through countless incarnations, weighed down by the chains of egotism. || 2 ||
Behind closed doors, hidden by many screens, the man takes his pleasure with another
man‟s wife. When Chitr and Gupt, the celestial accountants of the conscious and
subconscious, call for your account, who will screen you then? || 3 || O Perfect Lord,
Merciful to the meek, Destroyer of pain, without You, I have no shelter at all. Please, lift
me up out of the world-ocean; O God, I have come to Your Sanctuary. || 4 || 15 || 26
|| SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Supreme Lord God has become my helper and friend;
His sermon and the Kirtan of His Praises have brought me peace. Chant the Word of the
Perfect Guru‟s Bani, and be ever in bliss, O mortal. || 1 || Remember the True Lord in
meditation, O Siblings of Destiny. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
eternal peace is obtained, and the Lord is never forgotten. || Pause || Your Name, O
Transcendent Lord, is Ambrosial Nectar; whoever meditates on it, lives. One who is
blessed with God‟s Grace — that humble servant becomes immaculate and pure. || 2 ||
Obstacles are removed, and all pains are eliminated; my mind is attached to the Guru‟s
feet. Singing the Glorious Praises of the immovable and imperishable Lord, one remains
awake to the Lord‟s Love, day and night. || 3 || He obtains the fruits of his mind‟s
desires, listening to the comforting sermon of the Lord. In the beginning, in the middle,
and in the end, God is Nanak‟s best friend. || 4 || 16 || 27 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL,
PANCH-PADAS: May my emotional attachment, my sense of mine and yours, and my
self-conceit be dispelled. || 1 || O Saints, show me such a way, by which my egotism
and pride might be eliminated. || 1 || Pause || I see the Supreme Lord God in all
beings, and I am the dust of all. || 2 || I see God always with me, and the wall of
doubt has been shattered. || 3 || The medicine of the Naam, and the Immaculate
Water of Ambrosial Nectar, are obtained through the Guru‟s Gate. || 4 || Says Nanak,
one who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead, meets with the
Guru, and his diseases are cured. || 5 || 17 || 28 || 

SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Fire is contained in all firewood, and butter is contained in all milk. God‟s Light is
contained in the high and the low; the Lord is in the hearts of all beings. || 1 || O
Saints, He is pervading and permeating each and every heart. The Perfect Lord is
completely permeating everyone, everywhere; He is diffused in the water and the land.
|| 1 || Pause || Nanak sings the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of excellence; the
True Guru has dispelled his doubt. The Lord is pervading everywhere, permeating all,
and yet, He is unattached from all. || 2 || 1 || 29 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL:
Meditating on Him, one is in ecstasy; the pains of birth and death and fear are
removed. The four cardinal blessings, and the nine treasures are received; you shall
never feel hunger or thirst again. || 1 || Chanting His Name, you shall be at peace.
With each and every breath, meditate on the Lord and Master, O my soul, with mind,
body and mouth. || 1 || Pause || You shall find peace, and your mind shall be
soothed and cooled; the fire of desire shall not burn within you. The Guru has revealed
God to Nanak, in the three worlds, in the water, the earth and the woods. || 2 || 2 ||
30 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Sexual desire, anger, greed, falsehood and slander —
please, save me from these, O Lord. Please eradicate these from within me, and call me
to come close to You. || 1 || You alone teach me Your Ways. With the Lord‟s humble
servants, I sing His Praises. || 1 || Pause || May I never forget the Lord within my
heart; please, instill such understanding within my mind. By great good fortune, servant
Nanak has met with the Perfect Guru, and now, he will not go anywhere else. || 2 || 3
|| 31 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Meditating in remembrance on Him, all things are
obtained, and one‟s efforts shall not be in vain. Forsaking God, why do you attach
yourself to another? He is contained in everything. || 1 || O Saints, meditate in
remembrance on the World-Lord, Har, Har. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; your efforts shall be rewarded.
|| 1 || Pause || He ever preserves and cherishes His servant; with Love, He hugs him
close. Says Nanak, forgetting You, O God, how can the world find life? || 2 || 4 || 32 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: He is imperishable, the Giver of all beings; meditating on Him,
all filth is removed. He is the treasure of excellence, the object of His devotees, but rare
are those who find Him. || 1 || O my mind, meditate on the Guru, and God, the
Cherisher of the world. Seeking His Sanctuary, one finds peace, and he shall not suffer
in pain again. || 1 || Pause || By great good fortune, one obtains the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy. 

Meeting them, evil-mindedness is eliminated. Slave Nanak yearns for the dust of the
feet of those, who have woven the Lord‟s Name into their hearts. || 2 || 5 || 33 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: He dispels the pains of countless incarnations, and lends
support to the dry and shrivelled mind. Beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan,
one is enraptured, contemplating the Name of the Lord. || 1 || My physician is the
Guru, the Lord of the Universe. He places the medicine of the Naam into my mouth,
and cuts away the noose of Death. || 1 || Pause || He is the all-powerful, Perfect
Lord, the Architect of Destiny; He Himself is the Doer of deeds. The Lord Himself saves
His slave; Nanak takes the Support of the Naam. || 2 || 6 || 34 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH
MEHL: Only You know the state of my innermost self; You alone can judge me. Please
forgive me, O Lord God Master; I have committed thousands of sins and mistakes. || 1
|| O my Dear Lord God Master, You are always near me. O Lord, please bless Your
disciple with the shelter of Your feet. || 1 || Pause || Infinite and endless is my Lord
and Master; He is lofty, virtuous and profoundly deep. Cutting away the noose of death,
the Lord has made Nanak His slave, and now, what does he owe to anyone else? || 2
|| 7 || 35 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, became
merciful to me, and I obtained all of my mind‟s desires. I have become stable and
steady, touching the Lord‟s Feet, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
Universe. || 1 || It is a good time, a perfectly auspicious time. I am in celestial peace,
tranquility and ecstasy, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unstruck melody
of the sound current vibrates and resounds. || 1 || Pause || Meeting with my
Beloved Lord and Master, my home has become a mansion filled with happiness.
Servant Nanak has attained the treasure of the Lord‟s Name; all his desires have been
fulfilled. || 2 || 8 || 36 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Guru‟s feet abide within my
heart; God has blessed me with good fortune. The Perfect Transcendent Lord became
merciful to me, and I found the treasure of the Naam within my mind. || 1 || My Guru
is my Saving Grace, my only best friend. Over and over again, He blesses me with
double, even four-fold, greatness. || 1 || Pause || God saves all beings and
creatures, giving them the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Wondrous is the glorious
greatness of the Perfect Guru; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. || 2 || 9 || 37 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: I gather in and collect the immaculate wealth of the Naam;
this commodity is inaccessible and incomparable. Revel in it, delight in it, be happy and
enjoy peace, and live long, O Sikhs and brethren. || 1 || I have the support of the
Lotus Feet of the Lord. By the Grace of the Saints, I have found the boat of Truth;

their child. || 2 || 22 || 50 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

Meeting with the council, my doubts were not dispelled. The chiefs did not give me
satisfaction. I presented my dispute to the noblemen as well. But it was only settled by
meeting with the King, my Lord. || 1 || Now, I do not go searching anywhere else,
because I have met the Guru, the Lord of the Universe. || Pause || When I came to
God‟s Darbaar, His Holy Court, then all of my cries and complaints were settled. Now
that I have attained what I had sought, where should I come and where should I go?
|| 2 || There, true justice is administered. There, the Lord Master and His disciple are
one and the same. The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows. Without our
speaking, He understands. || 3 || He is the King of all places. There, the unstruck
melody of the Shabad resounds. Of what use is cleverness when dealing with Him?
Meeting with Him, O Nanak, one loses his self-conceit. || 4 || 1 || 51 || SORAT‟H,

the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is saved by God Himself. By His Grace, He
has blessed me with the sublime essence of the Naam. All joy and pleasure then came
to me. || 3 || God became my helper and my best friend; everyone rises up and bows
down at my feet. With each and every breath, meditate on God; O Nanak, sing the
songs of joy to the Lord. || 4 || 4 || 54 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Celestial peace
and bliss have come, meeting God, who is so pleasing to my mind. The Perfect Guru
showered me with His Mercy, and I attained salvation. || 1 || My mind is absorbed in
loving devotional worship of the Lord, and the unstruck melody of the celestial sound
current ever resounds within me. || Pause || The Lord‟s feet are my all-powerful
shelter and support; my dependence on other people is totally finished. I have found
the Life of the world, the Great Giver; in joyful rapture, I sing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord. || 2 || God has cut away the noose of death. My mind‟s desires have been

The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad has become manifest, and through it, my honor was
totally preserved. || 3 || I speak as You cause me to speak; O Lord and Master, You
are the ocean of excellence. Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, according
to the Teachings of Truth. God preserves the honor of His slaves. || 4 || 6 || 56 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Creator Lord Himself stood between us, and not a hair
upon my head was touched. The Guru made my cleansing bath successful; meditating
on the Lord, Har, Har, my sins were erased. || 1 || O Saints, the purifying pool of
Ram Das is sublime. Whoever bathes in it, his family and ancestry are saved, and his
soul is saved as well. || 1 || Pause || The world sings cheers of victory, and the
fruits of his mind‟s desires are obtained. Whoever comes and bathes here, and
meditates on his God, is safe and sound. || 2 || One who bathes in the healing pool
of the Saints, that humble being obtains the supreme status. He does not die, or come
and go in reincarnation; he meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || He
alone knows this about God, whom God blesses with His kindness. Baba Nanak seeks
the Sanctuary of God; all his worries and anxieties are dispelled. || 4 || 7 || 57 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Supreme Lord God has stood by me and fulfilled me, and
nothing is left unfinished. Attached to the Guru‟s feet, I am saved; I contemplate and
cherish the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || He is forever the Savior of His slaves.
Bestowing His Mercy, He made me His own and preserved me; like a mother or father,
He cherishes me. || 1 || Pause || By great good fortune, I found the True Guru, who
obliterated the path of the Messenger of Death. My consciousness is focused on loving,
devotional worship of the Lord. One who lives in this meditation is very fortunate
indeed. || 2 || He sings the Ambrosial Word of the Guru‟s Bani, and bathes in the
dust of the feet of the Holy. He Himself bestows His Name. God, the Creator, saves us.
|| 3 || The Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan is the support of the breath of life.
This is the perfect, pure wisdom. The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, has
granted His Mercy; slave Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master. || 4 || 8 ||
58 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Perfect Guru has attached me to His feet. I have
obtained the Lord as my companion, my support, my best friend. Wherever I go, I am
happy there. By His Kind Mercy, God united me with Himself. || 1 || So sing forever
the Glorious Praises of the Lord with loving devotion. You shall obtain all the fruits of
your mind‟s desires, and the Lord shall become the companion and the support of your
soul. || 1 || Pause || The Lord is the support of the breath of life. I am the dust of
the feet of the Holy people. I am a sinner, but the Lord made me pure. By His Kind
Mercy, the Lord blessed me with His Praises. || 2 || The Supreme Lord God cherishes
and nurtures me. He is always with me, the Protector of my soul. Singing the Kirtan of
the Lord‟s Praises day and night, I shall not be consigned to reincarnation again. || 3 ||
One who is blessed by the Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, realizes the subtle
essence of the Lord. The Messenger of Death does not come near him. 

In the Lord‟s Sanctuary, Nanak has found peace. || 4 || 9 || 59 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH
MEHL: The Perfect Guru has made me perfect. God is totally pervading and permeating
everywhere. With joy and pleasure, I take my purifying bath. I am a sacrifice to the
Supreme Lord God. || 1 || I enshrine the lotus feet of the Guru within my heart. Not
even the tiniest obstacle blocks my way; all my affairs are resolved. || 1 || Pause ||
Meeting with the Holy Saints, my evil-mindedness was eradicated. All the sinners are
purified. Bathing in the sacred pool of Guru Ram Das, all the sins one has committed
are washed away. || 2 || So sing forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
Universe; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on Him. The
fruits of your mind‟s desires are obtained by meditating on the Perfect Guru within your
heart. || 3 || The Guru, the Lord of the World, is blissful; chanting, meditating on the
Lord of supreme bliss, He lives. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of
the Lord. God has confirmed His innate nature. || 4 || 10 || 60 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH
MEHL: In the ten directions, the clouds cover the sky like a canopy; through the dark
clouds, lightning flashes, and I am terrified. By bed is empty, and my eyes are
sleepless; my Husband Lord has gone far away. || 1 || Now, I receive no messages
from Him, O mother! When my Beloved used to go even a mile away, He would send
me four letters. || Pause || How could I forget this Dear Beloved of mine? He is the
Giver of peace, and all virtues. Ascending to His Mansion, I gaze upon His path, and my
eyes are filled with tears. || 2 || The wall of egotism and pride separates us, but I can
hear Him nearby. There is a veil between us, like the wings of a butterfly; without being
able to see Him, He seems so far away. || 3 || The Lord and Master of all has become
merciful; He has dispelled all my sufferings. Says Nanak, when the Guru tore down the
wall of egotism, then, I found my Merciful Lord and Master. || 4 || All my fears have
been dispelled, O mother! Whoever I seek, the Guru leads me to find. The Lord, our
King, is the treasure of all virtue. || Second Pause || 11 || 61 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH
MEHL: The Restorer of what was taken away, the Liberator from captivity; the
Formless Lord, the Destroyer of pain. I do not know about karma and good deeds; I do
not know about Dharma and righteous living. I am so greedy, chasing after Maya. I go
by the name of God‟s devotee; please, save this honor of Yours. || 1 || O Dear Lord,
You are the honor of the dishonored. You make the unworthy ones worthy, O my Lord
of the Universe; I am a sacrifice to Your almighty creative power. || Pause || Like
the child, innocently making thousands of mistakes — his father teaches him, and
scolds him so many times, but still, he hugs him close in his embrace. Please forgive my
past actions, God, and place me on Your path for the future. || 2 || The Lord, the
Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows all about my state of mind; so who else
should I go to and speak to? The Lord, the Lord of the Universe, is not pleased by mere
recitation of words; if it is pleasing to His Will, He preserves our honor. 

I have seen all other shelters, but Yours alone remains for me. || 3 || Becoming kind
and compassionate, God the Lord and Master Himself listens to my prayer. He unites
me in Union with the Perfect True Guru, and all the cares and anxieties of my mind are
dispelled. The Lord, Har, Har, has placed the medicine of the Naam into my mouth;
servant Nanak abides in peace. || 4 || 12 || 62 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL:
Remembering, remembering God in meditation, bliss ensues, and one is rid of all
suffering and pain. Singing the Glorious Praises of God, and meditating on Him, all my
affairs are brought into harmony. || 1 || Your Name is the Life of the world. The
Perfect Guru has taught me, that by meditating, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean.
|| Pause || You are Your own advisor; You hear everything, God, and You do
everything. You Yourself are the Giver, and You Yourself are the Enjoyer. What can this
poor creature do? || 2 || Which of Your Glorious Virtues should I describe and speak
of? Your value cannot be described. I live by beholding, beholding You, O God. Your
glorious greatness is wonderful and amazing! || 3 || Granting His Grace, God my Lord
and Master Himself saved my honor, and my intellect has been made perfect. Forever
and ever, Nanak is a sacrifice, longing for the dust of the feet of the Saints. || 4 || 13
|| 63 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: I bow in reverence to the Perfect Guru. God has
resolved all my affairs. The Lord has showered me with His Mercy. God has perfectly
preserved my honor. || 1 || He has become the help and support of His slave. The
Creator has achieved all my goals, and now, nothing is lacking. || Pause || The
Creator Lord has caused the pool of nectar to be constructed. The wealth of Maya
follows in my footsteps, and now, nothing is lacking at all. This is pleasing to my Perfect
True Guru. || 2 || Remembering, remembering the Merciful Lord in meditation, all
beings have become kind and compassionate to me. Hail! Hail to the Lord of the world,
who created the perfect creation. || 3 || You are my Great Lord and Master. These
blessings and wealth are Yours. Servant Nanak has meditated on the One Lord; he has
obtained the fruitful rewards for all good deeds. || 4 || 14 || 64 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Bathing in the nectar tank of Ram Das, the residues of all sins are erased. One becomes
immaculately pure, taking this cleansing bath. The Perfect Guru has bestowed this gift.
|| 1 || God has blessed all with peace and pleasure. Everything is safe and sound, as
we contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || Pause || In the Saadh Sangat,

|| He alone is attached in loving devotion to God, who realizes his great destiny.
Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He obtains the rewards
of all joys and peace. || 2 || 12 || 76 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Transcendent
Lord has given me His support. The house of pain and disease has been demolished.
The men and women celebrate. 

The Lord God, Har, Har, has extended His Mercy. || 1 || O Saints, there is peace
everywhere. The Supreme Lord God, the Perfect Transcendent Lord, is pervading
everywhere. || Pause || The Bani of His Word emanated from the Primal Lord. It
eradicates all anxiety. The Lord is merciful, kind and compassionate. Nanak chants the

Perfect True Guru, then I chanted the Naam, the Name of the Pervading Lord. The Lord
of the Universe extended His Mercy to me, and God saved my honor. || 1 || The
Lord‟s feet are forever peace-giving. Whatever fruit one desires, he receives; his hopes
shall not go in vain. || 1 || Pause || That Saint, unto whom the Lord of Life, the
Great Giver, extends His Mercy — he alone sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. His
soul is absorbed in loving devotional worship; his mind is pleasing to the Supreme Lord
God. || 2 || Twenty-four hours a day, he chants the Praises of the Lord, and the bitter
poison does not affect him. My Creator Lord has united me with Himself, and the Holy
Saints have become my companions. || 3 || Taking me by the hand, He has given me
everything, and blended me with Himself. Says Nanak, everything has been perfectly
resolved; I have found the Perfect True Guru. || 4 || 15 || 79 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH

evil-doer can withstand these weapons. The Perfect Guru has given me this
understanding. || 1 || The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the support and shelter of
the Saints. One who remembers the Lord in meditation, is emancipated; millions have

eradicated my self-conceit. I see the Supreme Lord God everywhere. || 2 || 16 || 80 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Perfect Guru has done it perfectly. He blessed me with
forgiveness. I have found lasting peace and bliss. Everywhere, the people dwell in
peace. || 1 || Devotional worship to the Lord is what gives rewards. The Perfect Guru,
by His Grace, gave it to me; how rare are those who know this. || Pause || Sing the
Word of the Guru‟s Bani, O Siblings of Destiny. That is always rewarding and peacegiving. Nanak has meditated on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He has realized his
pre-ordained destiny. || 2 || 17 || 81 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: 

I worship and adore the Perfect Guru. All my affairs have been resolved. All desires
have been fulfilled. The unstruck melody of the sound current resounds. || 1 || O
Saints, meditating on the Lord, we obtain peace. In the home of the Saints, celestial
peace is pervading; all pain and suffering is dispelled. || 1 || Pause || The Word of
the Perfect Guru‟s Bani is pleasing to the Mind of the Supreme Lord God. Slave Nanak
speaks the Unspoken, immaculate sermon of the Lord. || 2 || 18 || 82 || SORAT‟H,
FIFTH MEHL: The hungry man is not ashamed to eat. Just so, the humble servant of
the Lord sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || Why are you so lazy in your
own affairs? Remembering Him in meditation, your face shall be radiant in the Court of
the Lord; you shall find peace, forever and ever. || 1 || Pause || Just as the lustful
man is enticed by lust, so is the Lord‟s slave pleased with the Lord‟s Praise. || 2 ||
Just as the mother holds her baby close, so does the spiritual person cherish the Naam,
the Name of the Lord. || 3 || This is obtained from the Perfect Guru. Servant Nanak
meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 4 || 19 || 83 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH
MEHL: Safe and sound, I have returned home. The slanderer‟s face is blackened with
ashes. The Perfect Guru has dressed in robes of honor. All my pains and sufferings are
over. || 1 || O Saints, this is the glorious greatness of the True Lord. He has created
such wonder and glory! || 1 || Pause || I speak according to the Will of my Lord and

greatness is wonderful and marvellous. Nanak ever meditates on the Naam, the Name
of the Lord. || 2 || 23 || 87 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord is always with me.
The Messenger of Death does not approach me. God holds me close in His embrace,
and protects me. True are the Teachings of the True Guru. || 1 || The Perfect Guru

and one sings the Lord‟s Praises. || 1 || Drink in the sublime essence of the Lord, O

adoration, and enter the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru. || Pause || Only one who
has such pre-ordained destiny receives it; he alone becomes perfect, O Siblings of
Destiny. Nanak‟s prayer, O Dear God, is to remain lovingly absorbed in the Naam. || 2
|| 25 || 89 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord is the Cause of Causes, the Innerknower, the Searcher of hearts; He preserves the honor of His servant. He is hailed and
congratulated throughout the world, and he tastes the sublime essence of the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad. || 1 || Dear God, Lord of the world, You are my only support. You
are all-powerful, the Giver of Sanctuary; twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on You. ||
Pause || That humble being, who vibrates upon You, O God, is not afflicted by
anxiety. Attached to the Feet of the True Guru, his fear is dispelled, and within his

and utter ecstasy; the True Guru has comforted him. He has returned home victorious,
with honor, and his hopes have been fulfilled. || 3 || Perfect are the Teachings of the
Perfect Guru; Perfect are the actions of God. Grasping hold of the Guru‟s feet, Nanak
has crossed over the terrifying world-ocean, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
|| 4 || 26 || 90 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: Becoming merciful, the Destroyer of the
pains of the poor has Himself devised all devices. In an instant, He has saved His
humble servant; the Perfect Guru has cut away his bonds. || 1 || O my mind,
meditate forever on the Guru, the Lord of the Universe. All illness shall depart from this
body, and you shall obtain the fruits of your mind‟s desires. || Pause || God created
all beings and creatures; He is lofty, inaccessible and infinite. In the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; his face is

meditate in remembrance on my Lord. Day and night, I ever meditate on Him. He gave

Name. || 1 || 

I am a sacrifice to my Guru. God, the Great Giver, the Perfect One, has become
merciful to me, and now, all are kind to me. || Pause || Servant Nanak has entered
His Sanctuary. He has perfectly preserved his honor. All suffering has been dispelled. So
enjoy peace, O my Siblings of Destiny! || 2 || 28 || 92 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL:
Hear my prayer, O my Lord and Master; all beings and creatures were created by You.
You preserve the honor of Your Name, O Lord, Cause of causes. || 1 || O Dear God,
Beloved, please, make me Your own. Whether good or bad, I am Yours. || Pause ||
The Almighty Lord and Master heard my prayer; cutting away my bonds, He has
adorned me. He dressed me in robes of honor, and blended His servant with Himself;
Nanak is revealed in glory throughout the world. || 2 || 29 || 93 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH
MEHL: All beings and creatures are subservient to all those who serve in the Lord‟s
Court. Their God made them His own, and carried them across the terrifying worldocean. || 1 || He resolves all the affairs of His Saints. He is merciful to the meek, kind
and compassionate, the ocean of kindness, my Perfect Lord and Master. || Pause ||
I am asked to come and be seated, everywhere I go, and I lack nothing. The Lord
blesses His humble devotee with robes of honor; O Nanak, the Glory of God is manifest.
|| 2 || 30 || 94 ||
SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL:

O mind, love the Lord. With your ears, hear the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
Universe, and with your tongue, sing His song. || 1 || Pause || Join the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and meditate in remembrance on the Lord; even a
sinner like yourself will become pure. Death is on the prowl, with its mouth wide open,
friend. || 1 || Today or tomorrow, eventually it will seize you; understand this in your
consciousness. Says Nanak, meditate, and vibrate upon the Lord; this opportunity is
slipping away! || 2 || 1 || SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: The mind remains in the mind.
He does not meditate on the Lord, nor does he perform service at sacred shrines, and
so death seizes him by the hair. || 1 || Pause || Wife, friends, children, carriages,
property, total wealth, the entire world — know that all of these things are false. The
Lord‟s meditation alone is true. || 1 || Wandering, wandering around for so many
ages, he has grown weary, and finally, he obtained this human body. Says Nanak, this
is the opportunity to meet the Lord; why don‟t you remember Him in meditation? || 2
|| 2 || SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: O mind, what evil-mindedness have you developed?
You are engrossed in the pleasures of other men‟s wives, and slander; you have not
worshipped the Lord at all. || 1 || Pause || You do not know the way to liberation,
but you run all around chasing wealth. 

In the end, nothing shall go along with you; you have entrapped yourself in vain. || 1
|| You have not meditated or vibrated upon the Lord; you have not served the Guru,
or His humble servants; spiritual wisdom has not welled up within you. The Immaculate
Lord is within your heart, and yet you search for Him in the wilderness. || 2 || Now
that you have obtained this human body, meditate on the Lord‟s Feet; Nanak advises
with this advice. || 3 || 3 || SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: O mind, contemplate the
Sanctuary of God. Meditating on Him in remembrance, Ganika the prostitute was saved;
enshrine His Praises within your heart. || 1 || Pause || Meditating on Him in
remembrance, Dhroo became immortal, and obtained the state of fearlessness. The
Lord and Master removes suffering in this way — why have you forgotten Him? || 1 ||
As soon as the elephant took to the protective Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of
mercy, he escaped from the crocodile. How much can I describe the Glorious Praises of
the Naam? Whoever chants the Lord‟s Name, his bonds are broken. || 2 || Ajaamal,
known throughout the world as a sinner, was redeemed in an instant. Says Nanak,
remember the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all desires, and you too shall be
carried across and saved. || 3 || 4 || SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: What efforts should
the mortal make, to attain devotional worship of the Lord, and eradicate the fear of
death? || 1 || Pause || Which actions, what sort of knowledge, and what religion —
what Dharma should one practice? What Name of the Guru should one remember in
meditation, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean? || 1 || In this Dark Age of Kali
Yuga, the Name of the One Lord is the treasure of mercy; chanting it, one obtains
salvation. No other religion is comparable to this; so speak the Vedas. || 2 || He is
beyond pain and pleasure, forever unattached; He is called the Lord of the world. He
dwells deep within your inner self, O Nanak, like the image in a mirror. || 3 || 5 ||
SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: O mother, how can I see the Lord of the world? In the utter
darkness of emotional attachment and spiritual ignorance, my mind remains entangled.
|| 1 || Pause || Deluded by doubt, I have wasted my whole life; I have not obtained
a stable intellect. I remain under the influence of corrupting sins, night and day, and I
have not renounced wickedness. || 1 || I never joined the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, and I did not sing the Kirtan of God‟s Praises. O servant Nanak, I
have no virtues at all; keep me in Your Sanctuary, Lord. || 2 || 6 || SORAT‟H, NINTH
MEHL: O mother, my mind is out of control. Night and day, it runs after sin and
corruption. How can I restrain it? || 1 || Pause || He listens to the teachings of the
Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees, but he does not enshrine them in his heart,
even for an instant. Engrossed in the wealth and women of others, his life passes away
uselessly. || 1 || He has gone insane with the wine of Maya, and does not understand
even a bit of spiritual wisdom. 

Deep within his heart, the Immaculate Lord dwells, but he does not know this secret. ||
2 || When I came to the Sanctuary of the Holy Saints, all my evil-mindedness was
dispelled. Then, O Nanak, I remembered the Chintaamani, the jewel which fulfills all
desires, and the noose of Death was snapped. || 3 || 7 || SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: O
man, grasp this Truth firmly in your soul. The whole world is just like a dream; it will
pass away in an instant. || 1 || Pause || Like a wall of sand, built up and plastered
with great care, which does not last even a few days, just so are the pleasures of Maya.
Why are you entangled in them, you ignorant fool? || 1 || Understand this today — it
is not yet too late! Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord. Says Nanak, this is the
subtle wisdom of the Holy Saints, which I proclaim out loud to you. || 2 || 8 ||
SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: In this world, I have not found any true friend. The whole
world is attached to its own pleasures, and when trouble comes, no one is with you. ||
1 || Pause || Wives, friends, children and relatives — all are attached to wealth.
When they see a poor man, they all forsake his company and run away. || 1 || So
what should I say to this crazy mind, which is affectionately attached to them? The Lord
is the Master of the meek, the Destroyer of all fears, and I have forgotten to praise
Him. || 2 || Like a dog‟s tail, which will never straighten out, the mind will not
change, no matter how many things are tried. Says Nanak, please, Lord, uphold the
honor of Your innate nature; I chant Your Name. || 3 || 9 || SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL:
O mind, you have not accepted the Guru‟s Teachings. What is the use of shaving your
head, and wearing saffron robes? || 1 || Pause || Abandoning Truth, you cling to
falsehood; your life is uselessly wasting away. Practicing hypocrisy, you fill your belly,
and then sleep like an animal. || 1 || You do not know the Way of the Lord‟s
meditation; you have sold yourself into Maya‟s hands. The madman remains entangled
in vice and corruption; he has forgotten the jewel of the Naam. || 2 || He remains
thoughtless, not thinking of the Lord of the Universe; his life is uselessly passing away.
Says Nanak, O Lord, please, confirm your innate nature; this mortal is continually
making mistakes. || 3 || 10 || SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: That man, who in the midst
of pain, does not feel pain, who is not affected by pleasure, affection or fear, and who
looks alike upon gold and dust; || 1 || Pause || Who is not swayed by either slander
or praise, nor affected by greed, attachment or pride; who remains unaffected by joy
and sorrow, honor and dishonor; || 1 || who renounces all hopes and desires and
remains desireless in the world; who is not touched by sexual desire or anger — within
his heart, God dwells. || 2 || That man, blessed by Guru‟s Grace, understands this
way. 

O Nanak, he merges with the Lord of the Universe, like water with water. || 3 || 11 ||
SORAT‟H, NINTH MEHL: O dear friend, know this in your mind. The world is entangled
in its own pleasures; no one is for anyone else. || 1 || Pause || In good times, many
come and sit together, surrounding you on all four sides. But when hard times come,
they all leave, and no one comes near you. || 1 || Your wife, whom you love so
much, and who has remained ever attached to you, runs away crying, “Ghost! Ghost!”,
as soon as the swan-soul leaves this body. || 2 || This is the way they act — those
whom we love so much. At the very last moment, O Nanak, no one is any use at all,
except the Dear Lord. || 3 || 12 || 139 ||
SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES, CHAU-TUKAS:

I am not torn by duality, because I do not worship any other than the Lord; I do not
visit tombs or crematoriums. I do not enter the houses of strangers, engrossed in
desire. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, has satisfied my desires. Deep within my
heart, the Guru has shown me the home of my being, and my mind is imbued with
peace and poise, O Siblings of Destiny. You Yourself are all-knowing, and You Yourself
are all-seeing; You alone bestow intelligence, O Lord. || 1 || My mind is detached,
imbued with detachment; the Word of the Shabad has pierced my mind, O my mother.
God‟s Light shines continually within the nucleus of my deepest self; I am lovingly
attached to the Bani, the Word of the True Lord Master. || Pause || Countless
detached renunciates talk of detachment and renunciation, but he alone is a true
renunciate, who is pleasing to the Lord Master. The Word of the Shabad is ever in his
heart; he is absorbed in the Fear of God, and he works to serve the Guru. He
remembers the One Lord, his mind does not waver, and he restrains its wanderings. He
is intoxicated with celestial bliss, and is ever imbued with the Lord‟s Love; he sings the
Glorious Praises of the True Lord. || 2 || The mind is like the wind, but if it comes to
rest in peace, even for an instant, then he shall abide in the peace of the Name, O
Siblings of Destiny. His tongue, eyes and ears are imbued with Truth; O Lord, You
quench the fires of desire. In hope, the renunciate remains free of hopes; in the home
of his own inner self, he is absorbed in the trance of deep meditation. He remains
content, satisfied with the charity of the Naam; he drinks in the Ambrosial Amrit with
ease. || 3 || There is no renunciation in duality, as long as there is even a particle of
duality. The whole world is Yours, Lord; You alone are the Giver. There is not any other,
O Siblings of Destiny. The self-willed manmukh dwells in misery forever, while the Lord
bestows greatness upon the Gurmukh. God is infinite, endless, inaccessible and
unfathomable; His worth cannot be described. || 4 || The consciousness in deep
Samaadhi, the Supreme Being, the Lord of the three worlds — these are Your Names,
Lord. The creatures born into this world have their destiny inscribed upon their
foreheads; they experience according to their destinies. The Lord Himself causes them
to do good and bad deeds; He Himself makes them steadfast in devotional worship. The
filth of their mind and mouth is washed off when they live in the Fear of God; the
inaccessible Lord Himself blesses them with spiritual wisdom. || 5 || 

Only those who taste it know its sweet taste, like the mute, who eats the candy, and
only smiles. How can I describe the indescribable, O Siblings of Destiny? I shall follow
His Will forever. If one meets with the Guru, the Generous Giver, then he understands;
those who have no Guru cannot understand this. As the Lord causes us to act, so do we
act, O Siblings of Destiny. What other clever tricks can anyone try? || 6 || Some are
deluded by doubt, while others are imbued with devotional worship; Your play is infinite
and endless. As You engage them, they receive the fruits of their rewards; You alone
are the One who issues Your Commands. I would serve You, if anything were my own;
my soul and body are Yours. One who meets with the True Guru, by His Grace, takes
the Support of the Ambrosial Naam. || 7 || He dwells in the heavenly realms, and his
virtues radiantly shine forth; meditation and spiritual wisdom are found in virtue. The
Naam is pleasing to his mind; he speaks it, and causes others to speak it as well. He
speaks the essential essence of wisdom. The Word of the Shabad is his Guru and
spiritual teacher, profound and unfathomable; without the Shabad, the world is insane.
He is a perfect renunciate, naturally at ease, O Nanak, whose mind is pleased with the
True Lord. || 8 || 1 || SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, TI-TUKAS: Hope and desire are
entrapments, O Siblings of Destiny. Religious rituals and ceremonies are traps. Because
of good and bad deeds, one is born into the world, O Siblings of Destiny; forgetting the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, he is ruined. This Maya is the enticer of the world, O
Siblings of Destiny; all such actions are corrupt. || 1 || Listen, O ritualistic Pandit: that
religious ritual which produces happiness, O Siblings of Destiny, is contemplation of the
essence of the soul. || Pause || You may stand and recite the Shaastras and the
Vedas, O Siblings of Destiny, but these are just worldly actions. Filth cannot be washed
away by hypocrisy, O Siblings of Destiny; the filth of corruption and sin is within you.
This is how the spider is destroyed, O Siblings of Destiny, by falling head-long in its own
web. || 2 || So many are destroyed by their own evil-mindedness, O Siblings of
Destiny; in the love of duality, they are ruined. Without the True Guru, the Name is not
obtained, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, doubt does not depart. If one serves
the True Guru, then he obtains peace, O Siblings of Destiny; his comings and goings
are ended. || 3 || True celestial peace comes from the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny;
the immaculate mind is absorbed into the True Lord. One who serves the Guru,
understands, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Guru, the way is not found. What can
anyone do, with greed within? O Siblings of Destiny, by telling lies, they eat poison. ||
4 || O Pandit, by churning cream, butter is produced. By churning water, you shall
only see water, O Siblings of Destiny; this world is like that. Without the Guru, he is
ruined by doubt, O Siblings of Destiny; the unseen Divine Lord is in each and every
heart. || 5 || This world is like a thread of cotton, O Siblings of Destiny, which Maya
has tied on all ten sides. Without the Guru, the knots cannot be untied, O Siblings of
Destiny; I am so tired of religious rituals. This world is deluded by doubt, O Siblings of
Destiny; no one can say anything about it. || 6 || Meeting with the Guru, the Fear of
God comes to abide in the mind; to die in the Fear of God is one‟s true destiny. In the
Court of the Lord, the Naam is far superior to ritualistic cleansing baths, charity and
good deeds, O Siblings of Destiny. 

One who implants the Naam within himself, through the Guru‟s halter — O Siblings of
Destiny, the Lord dwells in his mind, and he is free of hypocrisy. || 7 || This body is
the jeweller‟s shop, O Siblings of Destiny; the incomparable Naam is the merchandise.
The merchant secures this merchandise, O Siblings of Destiny, by contemplating the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Blessed is the merchant, O Nanak, who meets the Guru,
and engages in this trade. || 8 || 2 || SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL: Those who serve the
True Guru, O Beloved, their companions are saved as well. No one blocks their way, O
Beloved, and the Lord‟s Ambrosial Nectar is on their tongue. Without the Fear of God,
they are so heavy that they sink and drown, O Beloved; but the Lord, casting His
Glance of Grace, carries them across. || 1 || I ever praise You, O Beloved, I ever sing
Your Praises. Without the boat, one is drowned in the sea of fear, O Beloved; how can I
reach the distant shore? || 1 || Pause || I praise the Praiseworthy Lord, O Beloved;
there is no other one to praise. Those who praise my God are good, O Beloved; they
are imbued with the Word of the Shabad, and His Love. If I join them, O Beloved, I can
churn the essence and so find joy. || 2 || The gateway to honor is Truth, O Beloved;
it bears the Insignia of the True Name of the Lord. We come into the world, and we
depart, with our destiny written and pre-ordained, O Beloved; realize the Command of
the Commander. Without the Guru, this Command is not understood, O Beloved; True
is the Power of the True Lord. || 3 || By His Command, we are conceived, O Beloved,
and by His Command, we grow in the womb. By His Command, we are born, O
Beloved, head-first, and upside-down. The Gurmukh is honored in the Court of the
Lord, O Beloved; he departs after resolving his affairs. || 4 || By His Command, one
comes into the world, O Beloved, and by His Will, he goes. By His Will, some are bound
and gagged and driven away, O Beloved; the self-willed manmukhs suffer their
punishment. By His Command, the Word of the Shabad, is realized, O Beloved, and one
goes to the Court of the Lord robed in honor. || 5 || By His Command, some accounts
are accounted for, O Beloved; by His Command, some suffer in egotism and duality. By
His Command, one wanders in reincarnation, O Beloved; deceived by sins and demerits,
he cries out in his suffering. If he comes to realize the Command of the Lord‟s Will, O
Beloved, then he is blessed with Truth and Honor. || 6 || It is so difficult to speak it,
O Beloved; how can we speak, and hear, the True Name? I am a sacrifice to those who
praise the Lord, O Beloved. I have obtained the Name, and I am satisfied, O Beloved;
by His Grace, I am united in His Union. || 7 || If my body were to become the paper,
O Beloved, and my mind the inkpot; and if my tongue became the pen, O Beloved, I
would write, and contemplate, the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. Blessed is that
scribe, O Nanak, who writes the True Name, and enshrines it within his heart. || 8 || 3
|| SORAT‟H, FIRST MEHL, DU-TUKAS: You are the Giver of virtue, O Immaculate
Lord, but my mind is not immaculate, O Siblings of Destiny. I am a worthless sinner, O
Siblings of Destiny; virtue is obtained from You alone, Lord. || 1 || O my Beloved
Creator Lord, You create, and You behold. I am a hypocritical sinner, O Siblings of
Destiny. 

Bless my mind and body with Your Name, O Lord. || Pause || The poisonous Maya
has enticed the consciousness, O Siblings of Destiny; through clever tricks, one loses
his honor. The True Lord and Master abides in the consciousness, O Siblings of Destiny,
if the Guru‟s spiritual wisdom permeates it. || 2 || Beautiful, beautiful, the Lord is
called, O Siblings of Destiny; beautiful, like the deep crimson color of the poppy. If man
loves the Lord with detachment, O Siblings of Destiny, he is judged to be true and
infallible in the Lord‟s court and home. || 3 || You are pervading the realms of the
underworld and the heavenly skies; Your wisdom and glories are in each and every
heart. Meeting with the Guru, one finds peace, O Siblings of Destiny, and pride is
dispelled from the mind. || 4 || Scrubbing with water, the body can be cleaned, O
Siblings of Destiny, but the body becomes dirty again. Bathing in the supreme essence
of spiritual wisdom, O Siblings of Destiny, the mind and body become pure. || 5 ||
Why worship gods and goddesses, O Siblings of Destiny? What can we ask of them?
What can they give us? The stone gods are washed with water, O Siblings of Destiny,
but they just sink in the water. || 6 || Without the Guru, the unseen Lord cannot be
seen, O Siblings of Destiny; the world is drowning, having lost its honor. Greatness is in
the hands of my Lord and Master, O Siblings of Destiny; as He is pleased, He gives. ||
7 || That soul-bride, who talks sweetly and speaks the Truth, O Siblings of Destiny,
becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord. Pierced by His Love, she abides in Truth, O
Siblings of Destiny, deeply imbued with the Lord‟s Name. || 8 || Everyone calls God
his own, O Siblings of Destiny, but the all-knowing Lord is known only through the
Guru. Those who are pierced by His Love are saved, O Siblings of Destiny; they bear
the Insignia of the True Word of the Shabad. || 9 || A large pile of firewood, O
Siblings of Destiny, will burn if a small fire is applied. In the same way, if the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, dwells in the heart for a moment, even for an instant, O Siblings of
Destiny, then one meets the Lord with ease, O Nanak. || 10 || 4 ||
SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, TI-TUKAS:

You always preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Dear Lord; You have protected
them from the very beginning of time. You protected Your servant Prahlaad, O Dear
Lord, and annihilated Harnaakhash. The Gurmukhs place their faith in the Dear Lord,
but the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt. || 1 || O Dear Lord, this is Your
Glory. You preserve the honor of Your devotees, O Lord Master; Your devotees seek
Your Sanctuary. || Pause || The Messenger of Death cannot touch Your devotees;
death cannot even approach them. The Name of the Lord alone abides in their minds;
through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they find liberation. Wealth and all the
spiritual powers of the Siddhis fall at the feet of the Lord‟s devotees; they obtain peace
and poise from the Guru. || 2 || The self-willed manmukhs have no faith; they are
filled with greed and self-interest. They are not Gurmukh — they do not understand the
Word of the Shabad in their hearts; they do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Their masks of falsehood and hypocrisy shall fall off; the self-willed manmukhs speak
with insipid words. || 3 || You are pervading through Your devotees, O Dear God;
through Your devotees, You are known. 

All the people are enticed by Maya; they are Yours, Lord — You alone are the Architect
of Destiny. Overcoming my egotism and quieting the desires within my mind, I have
come to realize the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 4 || God automatically does the
work of those who love the Name of the Lord. By Guru‟s Grace, he ever dwells in their
minds, and He resolves all their affairs. Whoever challenges them is destroyed; they
have the Lord God as their Savior. || 5 || Without serving the True Guru, no one finds
the Lord; the self-willed manmukhs die crying out in pain. They come and go, and find
no place of rest; in pain and suffering, they perish. But one who becomes Gurmukh
drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, and is easily absorbed in the True Name. || 6 ||
Without serving the True Guru, one cannot escape reincarnation, even by performing
numerous rituals. Those who read the Vedas, and argue and debate without the Lord,
lose their honor. True is the True Guru, and True is the Word of His Bani; in the Guru‟s
Sanctuary, one is saved. || 7 || Those whose minds are filled with the Lord are
judged as true in the Court of the Lord; they are hailed as true in the True Court. Their
praises echo throughout the ages, and no one can erase them. Nanak is forever a
sacrifice to those who enshrine the Lord within their hearts. || 8 || 1 || SORAT‟H,
THIRD MEHL, DU-TUKAS: He Himself forgives the worthless, O Siblings of Destiny; He
commits them to the service of the True Guru. Service to the True Guru is sublime, O
Siblings of Destiny; through it, one‟s consciousness is attached to the Lord‟s Name. || 1
|| The Dear Lord forgives, and unites with Himself. I am a sinner, totally without
virtue, O Siblings of Destiny; the Perfect True Guru has blended me. || Pause || So
many, so many sinners have been forgiven, O beloved one, by contemplating the True
Word of the Shabad. They got on board the boat of the True Guru, who carried them
across the terrifying world-ocean, O Siblings of Destiny. || 2 || I have been
transformed from rusty iron into gold, O Siblings of Destiny, united in Union with the
Guru, the Philosopher‟s Stone. Eliminating my self-conceit, the Name has come to dwell
within my mind, O Siblings of Destiny; my light has merged in the Light. || 3 || I am a
sacrifice, I am a sacrifice, O Siblings of Destiny, I am forever a sacrifice to my True
Guru. He has given me the treasure of the Naam; O Siblings of Destiny, through the
Guru‟s Teachings, I am absorbed in celestial bliss. || 4 || Without the Guru, celestial
peace is not produced, O Siblings of Destiny; go and ask the spiritual teachers about
this. Serve the True Guru forever, O Siblings of Destiny, and eradicate self-conceit from
within. || 5 || Under Guru‟s Instruction, the Fear of God is produced, O Siblings of
Destiny; true and excellent are the deeds done in the Fear of God. Then, one is blessed
with the treasure of the Lord‟s Love, O Siblings of Destiny, and the Support of the True
Name. || 6 || I fall at the feet of those who serve their True Guru, O Siblings of
Destiny. I have fulfilled my life, O Siblings of Destiny, and my family has been saved as
well. || 7 || The True Word of the Guru‟s Bani, and the True Word of the Shabad, O
Siblings of Destiny, are obtained only by Guru‟s Grace. 

O Nanak, with the Name of the Lord abiding in one‟s mind, no obstacles stand in one‟s
way, O Siblings of Destiny. || 8 || 2 || SORAT‟H, THIRD MEHL: The Dear Lord is
realized through the Word of His Shabad, O Siblings of Destiny, which is found only by
perfect destiny. The happy soul-brides are forever in peace, O Siblings of Destiny; night
and day, they are attuned to the Lord‟s Love. || 1 || O Dear Lord, You Yourself color us
in Your Love. Sing, continually sing His Praises, imbued with His Love, O Siblings of
Destiny; be in love with the Lord. || Pause || Work to serve the Guru, O Siblings of
Destiny; abandon self-conceit, and and focus your consciousness. You shall be in peace
forever, and you shall not suffer in pain any longer, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord Himself
shall come and abide in your mind. || 2 || She who does not know the Will of her
Husband Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, is an ill-mannered and bitter bride. She does things
with a stubborn mind, O Siblings of Destiny; without the Name, she is false. || 3 || They
alone sing the Lord‟s Praises, who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their
foreheads, O Siblings of Destiny; through the Love of the True Lord, they find detachment.
Night and day, they are imbued with His Love; they utter His Glorious Praises, O Siblings of
Destiny, and they lovingly focus their consciousness on the Fearless Guru. || 4 || He kills
and revives all, O Siblings of Destiny; serve Him, day and night. How can we forget Him
from our minds, O Siblings of Destiny? His gifts are glorious and great. || 5 || The selfwilled manmukh is filthy and double-minded, O Siblings of Destiny; the finds no place of
rest in the Court of the Lord. But if she becomes Gurmukh, then she chants the Glorious
Praises of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny; the meets her True Beloved, and merges in Him.
|| 6 || In this life, she has not focused her consciousness on the Lord, O Siblings of
Destiny; how can she show her face when she leaves? In spite of the warning calls which
were sounded, she has been plundered, O Siblings of Destiny; she yearned only for
corruption. || 7 || Those who dwell upon the Naam, O Siblings of Destiny, their bodies
are ever peaceful and tranquil. O Nanak, dwell upon the Naam; the Lord is infinite, virtuous
and unfathomable, O Siblings of Destiny. || 8 || 3 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

The One who created the whole world, O Siblings of Destiny, is the Almighty Lord, the
Cause of causes. He fashioned the soul and the body, O Siblings of Destiny, by His own
power. How can He be described? How can He be seen, O Siblings of Destiny? The
Creator is One; He is indescribable. Praise the Guru, the Lord of the Universe, O
Siblings of Destiny; through Him, the essence is known. || 1 || O my mind, meditate
on the Lord, the Lord God. He blesses His servant with the gift of the Naam; He is the
Destroyer of pain and suffering. || Pause || Everything is in His home, O Siblings of
Destiny; His warehouse is overflowing with the nine treasures. His worth cannot be
estimated, O Siblings of Destiny; He is lofty, inaccessible and infinite. He cherishes all
beings and creatures, O Siblings of Destiny; he continually takes care of them. So meet
with the Perfect True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, and merge in the Word of the
Shabad. || 2 || Adoring the feet of the True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, doubt and
fear are dispelled. Joining the Society of the Saints, cleanse your mind, O Siblings of
Destiny, and dwell in the Name of the Lord. The darkness of ignorance shall be
dispelled, O Siblings of Destiny, and the lotus of your heart shall blossom forth. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 640 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
By the Guru‟s Word, peace wells up, O Siblings of Destiny; all fruits are with the True
Guru. || 3 || Give up your sense of mine and yours, O Siblings of Destiny, and
become the dust of the feet of all. In each and every heart, God is contained, O Siblings
of Destiny; He sees, and hears, and is ever-present with us. On that day when one
forgets the Supreme Lord God, O Siblings of Destiny, on that day, one ought to die
crying out in pain. He is the all-powerful Cause of Causes, O Siblings of Destiny; he is
totally filled with all powers. || 4 || The Love of the Name is the greatest treasure, O
Siblings of Destiny; through it, emotional attachment to Maya is dispelled. If it is
pleasing to His Will, then He unites us in His Union, O Siblings of Destiny; the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, comes to abide in the mind. The heart-lotus of the Gurmukh
blossoms forth, O Siblings of Destiny, and the heart is illumined. The Glory of God has
been revealed, O Siblings of Destiny, and the earth and sky have blossomed forth. || 5
|| The Perfect Guru has blessed me with contentment, O Siblings of Destiny; day and
night, I remain attached to the Lord‟s Love. My tongue continually chants the Lord‟s
Name, O Siblings of Destiny; this is the true taste, and the object of human life.
Listening with my ears, I hear and so I live, O Siblings of Destiny; I have obtained the
unchanging, unmoving state. That soul,which does not place its faith in the Lord shall
burn, O Siblings of Destiny. || 6 || My Lord and Master has so many virtues, O
Siblings of Destiny; I am a sacrifice to Him. He nurtures even the most worthless, O
Siblings of Destiny, and gives home to the homeless. He gives us nourishment with
each and every breath, O Siblings of Destiny; His Name is everlasting. One who meets
with the True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny, does so only by perfect destiny. || 7 ||
Without Him, I cannot live, even for an instant, O Siblings of Destiny; He is totally filled
with all powers. With every breath and morsel of food, I will not forget Him, O Siblings
of Destiny; I behold Him ever-present. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I
meet Him, O Siblings of Destiny; He is totally pervading and permeating everywhere.
Those who do not embrace love for the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, always die crying
out in pain. || 8 || Grasping hold of the hem of His robe, O Siblings of Destiny, we are
carried across the world-ocean of fear and pain. By His Glance of Grace, He has blessed
us, O Siblings of Destiny; He shall be with us until the very end. My mind and body are
soothed and calmed, O Siblings of Destiny, nourished by the food of the Naam. Nanak
has entered His Sanctuary, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is the Destroyer of sins. || 9
|| 1 || SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL: The womb of the mother is an ocean of pain, O
Beloved; even there, the Lord causes His Name to be chanted. When he emerges, he
finds corruption pervading everywhere, O Beloved, and he becomes increasingly
attached to Maya. One whom the Lord blesses with His kind favor, O Beloved, meets
the Perfect Guru. He worships the Lord in adoration with each and every breath, O
Beloved; he is lovingly attached to the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || You are the support of my
mind and body, O Beloved; You are the support of my mind and body. There is no
other Creator except for You, O Beloved; You alone are the Inner-knower, the Searcher
of hearts. || Pause || After wandering in doubt for millions of incarnations, he comes
into the world, O Beloved; for uncounted lifetimes, he has suffered in pain. He has
forgotten his True Lord and Master, O Beloved, and so he suffers terrible punishment.
Those who meet with the Perfect True Guru, O Beloved, are attached to the True
Name. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 641 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
We are saved by following those, O Beloved, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Lord.
|| 2 || He thinks that his food is so sweet, O Beloved, but it makes his body ill. It turns
out to be bitter, O Beloved, and it produces only sadness. The Lord leads him astray in
the enjoyment of pleasures, O Beloved, and so his sense of separation does not depart.
Those who meet the Guru are saved, O Beloved; this is their pre-ordained destiny. || 3
|| He is filled with longing for Maya, O Beloved, and so the Lord does not ever come
into his mind. Those who forget You, O Supreme Lord Master, their bodies turn to dust.
They cry out and scream horribly, O Beloved, but their torment does not end. Those
who meet the Guru, and reform themselves, O Beloved, their capital remains intact. ||
4 || As far as possible, do not associate with the faithless cynics, O Beloved. Meeting
with them, the Lord is forgotten, O Beloved, and you rise and depart with a blackened
face. The self-willed manmukh finds no rest or shelter, O Beloved; in the Court of the
Lord, they are punished. Those who meet with the Guru, and reform themselves, O
Beloved, their affairs are resolved. || 5 || One may have thousands of clever tricks
and techniques of austere self-discipline, O Beloved, but not even one of them will go
with him. Those who turn their backs on the Lord of the Universe, O Beloved, their
families are stained with disgrace. He does not know that thing which is, O Beloved;
falsehood will not help him. Those who meet with the True Guru, O Beloved, dwell
upon the True Name. || 6 || When the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, O Beloved,
one is blessed with Truth, contentment, wisdom and meditation. Night and day, he
sings the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises, O Beloved, totally filled with Ambrosial Nectar. He
crosses over the sea of pain, O Beloved, and swims across the terrifying world-ocean.
One who is pleasing to His Will, He unites with Himself, O Beloved; he is forever true.
|| 7 || The all-powerful Divine Lord is compassionate, O Beloved; He is the Support of
His devotees. I seek His Sanctuary, O Beloved; He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of
hearts. He has adorned me in this world and the next, O Beloved; He has placed the
Emblem of Truth upon my forehead. I shall never forget that God, O Beloved; Nanak is
forever a sacrifice to Him. || 8 || 2 ||
SORAT‟H, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

They read scriptures, and contemplate the Vedas; they practice the inner cleansing
techniques of Yoga, and control of the breath. But they cannot escape from the
company of the five passions; they are increasingly bound to egotism. || 1 || O
Beloved, this is not the way to meet the Lord; I have performed these rituals so many
times. I have collapsed, exhausted, at the Door of my Lord Master; I pray that He may
grant me a discerning intellect. || Pause || One may remain silent and use his hands
as begging bowls, and wander naked in the forest. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 642 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He may make pilgrimages to river banks and sacred shrines all over the world, but his
sense of duality will not leave him. || 2 || His mind‟s desires may lead him to go and
dwell at sacred places of pilgrimage, and offer his head to be sawn off; but this will not
cause the filth of his mind to depart, even though he may make thousands of efforts. || 3
|| He may give gifts of all sorts — gold, women, horses and elephants. He may make
offerings of corn, clothes and land in abundance, but this will not lead him to the Lord‟s
Door. || 4 || He may remain devoted to worship and adoration, bowing his forehead to
the floor, practicing the six religious rituals. He indulges in egotism and pride, and falls into
entanglements, but he does not meet the Lord by these devices. || 5 || He practices the
eighty-four postures of Yoga, and acquires the supernatural powers of the Siddhas, but he
gets tired of practicing these. He lives a long life, but is reincarnated again and again; he
has not met with the Lord. || 6 || He may enjoy princely pleasures, and regal pomp and
ceremony, and issue unchallenged commands. He may lie on beautiful beds, perfumed
with sandalwood oil, but this will led him only to the gates of the most horrible hell. || 7 ||
Singing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is
the highest of all actions. Says Nanak, he alone obtains it, who is pre-destined to receive it.
|| 8 || Your slave is intoxicated with this Love of Yours. The Destroyer of the pains of the
poor has become merciful to me, and this mind is imbued with the Praises of the Lord, Har,
Har. || Second Pause || 1 || 3 ||
VAAR OF RAAG SORAT‟H, FOURTH MEHL:

SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Sorat‟h is always beautiful, if it brings the True Lord to dwell in
the mind of the soul-bride. Her teeth are clean and her mind is not split by duality; the
Name of the True Lord is on her tongue. Here and hereafter, she abides in the Fear of
God, and serves the True Guru without hesitation. Discarding worldly adornments, she
meets her Husband Lord, and she celebrates joyfully with Him. She is adorned forever
with the Name in her mind, and she does not have even an iota of filth. Her husband‟s
younger and elder brothers, the corrupt desires, have died, suffering in pain; and now,
who fears Maya, the mother-in-law? If she becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord, O
Nanak, she bears the jewel of good karma upon her forehead, and everything is Truth
to her. || 1 || FOURTH MEHL: Sorat‟h is beautiful only when it leads the soul-bride to
seek the Lord‟s Name. She pleases her Guru and God; under Guru‟s Instruction, she
speaks the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. She is attracted to the Lord‟s Name, day and
night, and her body is drenched in the color of the Love of the Lord, Har, Har. No other
being like the Lord God can be found; I have looked and searched over the whole
world. The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam within me; my mind does not
waver any more. Servant Nanak is the Lord‟s slave, the slave of the slaves of the Guru,
the True Guru. || 2 || PAUREE: You Yourself are the Creator, the Fashioner of the
world. You Yourself have arranged the play, and You Yourself arrange it. You Yourself
are the Giver and the Creator; You Yourself are the Enjoyer. The Word of Your Shabad
is pervading everywhere, O Creator Lord. As Gurmukh, I ever praise the Lord; I am a
sacrifice to the Guru. || 1 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 643 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: In the flames of egotism, he is burnt to death; he wanders in
doubt and the love of duality. The Perfect True Guru saves him, making him His own.
This world is burning; through the Sublime Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, this comes to
be seen. Those who are attuned to the Shabad are cooled and soothed; O Nanak, they
practice Truth. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Service to the True Guru is fruitful and
rewarding; blessed and acceptable is such a life. Those who do not forget the True
Guru, in life and in death, are truly wise people. Their families are saved, and they are
approved by the Lord. The Gurmukhs are approved in death as in life, while the selfwilled manmukhs continue the cycle of birth and death. O Nanak, they are not
described as dead, who are absorbed in the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 2 ||
PAUREE: Serve the Immaculate Lord God, and meditate on the Lord‟s Name. Join the
Society of the Holy Saints, and be absorbed in the Lord‟s Name. O Lord, glorious and
great is service to You; I am so foolish — please, commit me to it. I am Your servant
and slave; command me, according to Your Will. As Gurmukh, I shall serve You, as
Guru has instructed me. || 2 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: He acts according to preordained destiny, written by the Creator Himself. Emotional attachment has drugged
him, and he has forgotten the Lord, the treasure of virtue. Don‟t think that he is alive in
the world — he is dead, through the love of duality. Those who do not meditate on the
Lord, as Gurmukh, are not permitted to sit near the Lord. They suffer the most horrible
pain and suffering, and neither their sons nor their wives go along with them. Their
faces are blackened among men, and they sigh in deep regret. No one places any
reliance in the self-willed manmukhs; trust in them is lost. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs live
in absolute peace; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides within them. || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: They alone are relatives, and they alone are friends, who, as Gurmukh,
join together in love. Night and day, they act according to the True Guru‟s Will; they
remain absorbed in the True Name. Those who are attached to the love of duality are
not called friends; they practice egotism and corruption. The self-willed manmukhs are
selfish; they cannot resolve anyone‟s affairs. O Nanak, they act according to their preordained destiny; no one can erase it. || 2 || PAUREE: You Yourself created the
world, and You Yourself arranged the play of it. You Yourself created the three
qualities, and fostered emotional attachment to Maya. He is called to account for his
deeds done in egotism; he continues coming and going in reincarnation. The Guru
instructs those whom the Lord Himself blesses with Grace. I am a sacrifice to my Guru;
forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to Him. || 3 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The love of
Maya is enticing; without teeth, it has eaten up the world. The self-willed manmukhs
are eaten away, while the Gurmukhs are saved; they focus their consciousness on the
True Name. Without the Name, the world wanders around insane; the Gurmukhs come
to see this. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 644 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Involved in worldly affairs, he wastes his life in vain; the peace-giving Lord does not
come to abide in his mind. O Nanak, they alone obtain the Name, who have such preordained destiny. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The home within is filled with Ambrosial
Nectar, but the self-willed manmukh does not get to taste it. He is like the deer, who
does not recognize its own musk-scent; it wanders around, deluded by doubt. The
manmukh forsakes the Ambrosial Nectar, and instead gathers poison; the Creator
Himself has fooled him. How rare are the Gurmukhs, who obtain this understanding;
they behold the Lord God within themselves. Their minds and bodies are cooled and
soothed, and their tongues enjoy the sublime taste of the Lord. Through the Word of
the Shabad, the Name wells up; through the Shabad, we are united in the Lord‟s Union.
Without the Shabad, the whole world is insane, and it loses its life in vain. The Shabad
alone is Ambrosial Nectar; O Nanak, the Gurmukhs obtain it. || 2 || PAUREE: The
Lord God is inaccessible; tell me, how can we find Him? He has no form or feature, and
He cannot be seen; tell me, how can we meditate on Him? The Lord is formless,
immaculate and inaccessible; which of His Virtues should we speak of and sing? They
alone walk on the Lord‟s Path, whom the Lord Himself instructs. The Perfect Guru has
revealed Him to me; serving the Guru, He is found. || 4 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: It
is as if my body has been crushed in the oil-press, without yielding even a drop of
blood; it is as if my soul has been cut apart into pieces for the sake of the Love of the
True Lord; O Nanak, still, night and day, my Union with the Lord is not broken. || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: My Friend is so full of joy and love; He colors my mind with the color of
His Love, like the fabric which is treated to retain the color of the dye. O Nanak, this
color does not depart, and no other color can be imparted to this fabric. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The Lord Himself is pervading everywhere; the Lord Himself causes us to
chant His Name. The Lord Himself created the creation; He commits all to their tasks.
He engages some in devotional worship, and others, He causes to stray. He places
some on the Path, while He leads others into the wilderness. Servant Nanak meditates
on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh, he sings the Glorious Praises of the
Lord. || 5 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Service to the True Guru is fruitful and
rewarding, if one performs it with his mind focused on it. The fruits of the mind‟s
desires are obtained, and egotism departs from within. His bonds are broken, and he is
liberated; he remains absorbed in the True Lord. It is so difficult to obtain the Naam in
this world; it comes to dwell in the mind of the Gurmukh. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to
one who serves his True Guru. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The mind of the self-willed
manmukh is so very stubborn; it is stuck in the love of duality. He does not find peace,
even in dreams; he passes his life in misery and suffering. The Pandits have grown
weary of going door to door, reading and reciting their scriptures; the Siddhas have
gone into their trances of Samaadhi. This mind cannot be controlled; they are tired of
performing religious rituals. The impersonators have grown weary of wearing false
costumes, and bathing at the sixty-eight sacred shrines. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 645 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They do not know the state of their own minds; they are deluded by doubt and
egotism. By Guru‟s Grace, the Fear of God is obtained; by great good fortune, the Lord
comes to abide in the mind. When the Fear of God comes, the mind is restrained, and
through the Word of the Shabad, the ego is burnt away. Those who are imbued with
Truth are immaculate; their light merges in the Light. Meeting the True Guru, one
obtains the Name; O Nanak, he is absorbed in peace. || 2 || PAUREE: The pleasures
of kings and emperors are pleasing, but they last for only a few days. These pleasures
of Maya are like the color of the safflower, which wears off in a moment. They do not
go with him when he departs; instead, he carries the load of sins upon his head. When
death seizes him, and marches him away, then he looks absolutely hideous. That lost
opportunity will not come into his hands again, and in the end, he regrets and repents.
|| 6 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Those who turn their faces away from the True Guru,
suffer in sorrow and bondage. Again and again, they are born only to die; they cannot
meet their Lord. The disease of doubt does not depart, and they find only pain and
more pain. O Nanak, if the Gracious Lord forgives, then one is united in Union with the
Word of the Shabad. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Those who turn their faces away from the
True Guru, shall find no place of rest or shelter. They wander around from door to door,
like a woman forsaken, with a bad character and a bad reputation. O Nanak, the
Gurmukhs are forgiven, and united in Union with the True Guru. || 2 || PAUREE:
Those who serve the True Lord, the Destroyer of ego, cross over the terrifying worldocean. Those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, are passed over by the
Messenger of Death. Those who meditate on the Lord, go to His Court in robes of
honor. They alone serve You, O Lord, whom You bless with Grace. I sing continually
Your Glorious Praises, O Beloved; as Gurmukh, my doubts and fears have been
dispelled. || 7 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Upon the plate, three things have been
placed; this is the sublime, ambrosial food of the Lord. Eating this, the mind is satisfied,
and the Door of Salvation is found. It is so difficult to obtain this food, O Saints; it is
obtained only by contemplating the Guru. Why should we cast this riddle out of our
minds? We should keep it ever enshrined in our hearts. The True Guru has posed this
riddle. The Guru‟s Sikhs have found its solution. O Nanak, he alone understands this,
whom the Lord inspires to understand. The Gurmukhs work hard, and find the Lord. ||
1 || THIRD MEHL: Those whom the Primal Lord unites, remain in Union with Him;
they focus their consciousness on the True Guru. Those whom the Lord Himself
separates, remain separated; in the love of duality, they are ruined. O Nanak, without
good karma, what can anyone obtain? He earns what he is pre-destined to receive. || 2
|| PAUREE: Sitting together, the companions sing the Songs of the Lord‟s Praises.
They praise the Lord‟s Name continually; they are a sacrifice to the Lord. Those who
hear, and believe in the Lord‟s Name, to them I am a sacrifice. O Lord, let me unite with
the Gurmukhs, who are united with You. I am a sacrifice to those who, day and night,
behold their Guru. || 8 || SHALOK, 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 646 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
THIRD MEHL: Without the Name of the Lord, everyone wanders around the world,
losing. The self-willed manmukhs do their deeds in the pitch black darkness of egotism.
The Gurmukhs drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak, contemplating the Word of the
Shabad. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: He wakes in peace, and he sleeps in peace. The
Gurmukh praises the Lord night and day. The self-willed manmukh remains deluded by
his doubts. He is filled with anxiety, and he cannot even sleep. The spiritually wise wake
and sleep in peace. Nanak is a sacrifice to those who are imbued with the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: They alone meditate on the Lord‟s Name, who are
imbued with the Lord. They meditate on the One Lord; the One and Only Lord is True.
The One Lord is pervading everywhere; the One Lord created the Universe. Those who
meditate on the Lord‟s Name, cast out their fears. The Lord Himself blesses them with
Guru‟s Instruction; the Gurmukh meditates on the Lord. || 9 || SHALOK, THIRD
MEHL: Spiritual wisdom, which would bring understanding, does not enter into his
mind. Without seeing, how can he praise the Lord? The blind act in blindness. O Nanak,
when one realizes the Word of the Shabad, then the Naam comes to abide in the mind.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: There is One Bani; there is One Guru; there is one Shabad to
contemplate. True is the merchandise, and true is the shop; the warehouses are
overflowing with jewels. By Guru‟s Grace, they are obtained, if the Great Giver gives
them. Dealing in this true merchandise, one earns the profit of the incomparable Naam.
In the midst of poison, the Ambrosial Nectar is revealed; by His Mercy, one drinks it in.
O Nanak, praise the True Lord; blessed is the Creator, the Embellisher. || 2 ||
PAUREE: Those who are permeated by falsehood, do not love the Truth. If someone
speaks the Truth, falsehood is burnt away. The false are satisfied by falsehood, like the
crows who eat manure. When the Lord grants His Grace, then one meditates on the
Naam, the Name of the Lord. As Gurmukh, worship the Lord‟s Name in adoration; fraud
and sin shall disappear. || 10 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O Shaykh, you wander in
the four directions, blown by the four winds; bring your mind back to the home of the
One Lord. Renounce your petty arguments, and realize the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad.
Bow in humble respect before the True Guru; He is the Knower who knows everything.
Burn away your hopes and desires, and live like a guest in this world. If you walk in
harmony with the True Guru‟s Will, then you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord.
O Nanak, those who do not contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord — cursed are
their clothes, and cursed is their food. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: There is no end to the
Lord‟s Glorious Praises; His worth cannot be described. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs chant
the Glorious Praises of the Lord; they are absorbed in His Glorious Virtues. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The Lord has adorned the coat of the body; He has embroidered it with
devotional worship. The Lord has woven His silk into it, in so many ways and fashions.
How rare is that man of understanding, who understands, and deliberates within. He
alone understands these deliberations, whom the Lord Himself inspires to understand. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 647 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Poor servant Nanak speaks: the Gurmukhs know the Lord, the Lord is True. || 11 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Great men speak the teachings by relating them to individual
situations, but the whole world shares in them. One who becomes Gurmukh knows the
Fear of God, and realizes his own self. If, by Guru‟s Grace, one remains dead while yet
alive, the mind becomes content in itself. Those who have no faith in their own minds,
O Nanak — how can they speak of spiritual wisdom? || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Those who
do not focus their consciousness on the Lord, as Gurmukh, suffer pain and grief in the
end. They are blind, inwardly and outwardly, and they do not understand anything. O
Pandit, O religious scholar, the whole world is fed for the sake of those who are attuned
to the Lord‟s Name. Those who praise the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, remain blended
with the Lord. O Pandit, O religious scholar, no one is satisfied, and no one finds true
wealth through the love of duality. They have grown weary of reading scriptures, but
still, they do not find contentment, and they pass their lives burning, night and day.
Their cries and complaints never end, and doubt does not depart from within them. O
Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they rise up and depart with
blackened faces. || 2 || PAUREE: O Beloved, lead me to meet my True Friend;
meeting with Him, I shall ask Him to show me the Path. I am a sacrifice to that Friend,
who shows it to me. I share His Virtues with Him, and meditate on the Lord‟s Name. I
serve my Beloved Lord forever; serving the Lord, I have found peace. I am a sacrifice
to the True Guru, who has imparted this understanding to me. || 12 || SHALOK,
THIRD MEHL: O Pandit, O religious scholar, your filth shall not be erased, even if you
read the Vedas for four ages. The three qualities are the roots of Maya; in egotism, one
forgets the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Pandits are deluded, attached to duality,
and they deal only in Maya. They are filled with thirst and hunger; the ignorant fools
starve to death. Serving the True Guru, peace is obtained, contemplating the True Word
of the Shabad. Hunger and thirst have departed from within me; I am in love with the
True Name. O Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam, who keep the Lord clasped
tightly to their hearts, are automatically satisfied. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The self-willed
manmukh does not serve the Lord‟s Name, and so he suffers in horrible pain. He is
filled with the darkness of ignorance, and he does not understand anything. Because of
his stubborn mind, he does not plant the seeds of intuitive peace; what will he eat in
the world hereafter, to satisfy his hunger? He has forgotten the treasure of the Naam;
he is caught in the love of duality. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are honored with glory,
when the Lord Himself unites them in His Union. || 2 || PAUREE: The tongue which
sings the Lord‟s Praises, is so very beautiful. One who speaks the Lord‟s Name, with
mind, body and mouth, is pleasing to the Lord. That Gurmukh tastes the the sublime
taste of the Lord, and is satisfied. She sings continually the Glorious Praises of her
Beloved; singing His Glorious Praises, she is uplifted. She is blessed with the Lord‟s
Mercy, and she chants the Words of the Guru, the True Guru. || 13 || SHALOK,
THIRD MEHL: The elephant offers its head to the reins, and the anvil offers itself to the
hammer; just so, we offer our minds and bodies to our Guru; we stand before Him, and
serve Him.
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 648 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
This is how the Gurmukhs eliminate their self-conceit, and come to rule the whole
world. O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands, when the Lord casts His Glance of Grace.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: Blessed and approved is the coming into the world, of those
Gurmukhs who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak, they save their
families, and they are honored in the Court of the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: The Guru
unites His Sikhs, the Gurmukhs, with the Lord. The Guru keeps some of them with
Himself, and engages others in His Service. Those who cherish their Beloved in their
conscious minds, the Guru blesses them with His Love. The Guru loves all of His
Gursikhs equally well, like friends, children and siblings. So chant the Name of the Guru,
the True Guru, everyone! Chanting the Name of the Guru, Guru, you shall be
rejuvenated. || 14 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O Nanak, the blind, ignorant fools do
not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord; they involve themselves in other
activities. They are bound and gagged at the door of the Messenger of Death; they are
punished, and in the end, they rot away in manure. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O Nanak,
those humble beings are true and approved, who serve their True Guru. They remain
absorbed in the Name of the Lord, and their comings and goings cease. || 2 ||
PAUREE: Gathering the wealth and property of Maya, brings only pain in the end.
Homes, mansions and adorned palaces will not go with anyone. He may breed horses of
various colors, but these will not be of any use to him. O human, link your
consciousness to the Lord‟s Name, and in the end, it shall be your companion and
helper. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Gurmukh is
blessed with peace. || 15 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Without the karma of good
actions, the Name is not obtained; it can be obtained only by perfect good karma. O
Nanak, if the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then under Guru‟s Instruction, one is
united in His Union. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Some are cremated, and some are buried;
some are eaten by dogs. Some are thrown into water, while others are thrown into
wells. O Nanak, it is not known, where they go and into what they merge. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The food and clothes, and all the worldly possessions of those who are
attuned to the Lord‟s Name are sacred. All the homes, temples, palaces and waystations are sacred, where the Gurmukhs, the selfless servants, the Sikhs and the
renouncers of the world, go and take their rest. All the horses, saddles and horse
blankets are sacred, upon which the Gurmukhs, the Sikhs, the Holy and the Saints,
mount and ride. All the rituals and Dharmic practices and deeds are sacred, for those
who utter the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the True Name of the Lord. Those
Gurmukhs, those Sikhs, who have purity as their treasure, go to their Guru. || 16 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O Nanak, forsaking the Name, he loses everything, in this
world and the next. Chanting, deep meditation and austere self-disciplined practices are
all wasted; he is deceived by the love of duality. He is bound and gagged at the door of
the Messenger of Death. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 649 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He is beaten, and receives terrible punishment. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: They inflict their
hatred upon the Saints, and they love the wicked sinners. They find no peace in either
this world or the next; they are born only to die, again and again. Their hunger is never
satisfied, and they are ruined by duality. The faces of these slanderers are blackened in
the Court of the True Lord. O Nanak, without the Naam, they find no shelter on either
this shore, or the one beyond. || 2 || PAUREE: Those who meditate on the Lord‟s
Name, are imbued with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in their minds. For those who
worship the One Lord in their conscious minds, there is no other than the One Lord.
They alone serve the Lord, upon whose foreheads such pre-ordained destiny is written.
They continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and singing the Glories of the
Glorious Lord, they are uplifted. Great is the greatness of the Gurmukhs, who, through
the Perfect Guru, remain absorbed in the Lord‟s Name. || 17 || SHALOK, THIRD
MEHL: It is very difficult to serve the True Guru; offer your head, and eradicate selfconceit. One who dies in the Word of the Shabad shall never have to die again; his
service is totally approved. Touching the philosopher‟s stone, one becomes the
philosopher‟s stone, which transforms lead into gold; remain lovingly attached to the
True Lord. One who has such pre-ordained destiny, comes to meet the True Guru and
God. O Nanak, the Lord‟s servant does not meet Him because of his own account; he
alone is acceptable, whom the Lord forgives. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The fools do not
know the difference between good and bad; they are deceived by their self-interests.
But if they contemplate the Word of the Shabad, they obtain the Mansion of the Lord‟s
Presence, and their light merges in the Light. The Fear of God is always on their minds,
and so they come to understand everything. The True Guru is pervading the homes
within; He Himself blends them with the Lord. O Nanak, they meet the True Guru, and
all their desires are fulfilled, if the Lord grants His Grace and so wills. || 2 || PAUREE:
Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those devotees, who, with their mouths, utter
the Name of the Lord. Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those Saints, who, with
their ears, listen to the Lord‟s Praises. Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of those holy
people, who sing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises, and so become virtuous. Blessed,
blessed is the good fortune of those Gurmukhs, who live as Gursikhs, and conquer their
minds. But the greatest good fortune of all, is that of the Guru‟s Sikhs, who fall at the
Guru‟s feet. || 18 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: One who knows God, and who lovingly
focuses his attention on the One Word of the Shabad, keeps his spirituality intact. The
nine treasures and the eighteen spiritual powers of the Siddhas follow him, who keeps
the Lord enshrined in his heart. Without the True Guru, the Name is not found;
understand this, and reflect upon it. O Nanak, through perfect good destiny, one meets
the True Guru, and finds peace, throughout the four ages. || 1 || THIRD MEHL:
Whether he is young or old, the self-willed manmukh cannot escape hunger and thirst.
The Gurmukhs are imbued with the Word of the Shabad; they are at peace, having lost
their self-conceit. They are satisfied and satiated within; they never feel hungry again. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 650 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, whatever the Gurmukhs do is acceptable; they remain lovingly absorbed in
the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: I am a sacrifice to those Sikhs who
are Gurmukhs. I behold the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of those who meditate on the
Lord‟s Name. Listening to the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises, I contemplate His virtues; I
write His Praises on the fabric of my mind. I praise the Lord‟s Name with love, and
eradicate all my sins. Blessed, blessed and beauteous is that body and place, where my
Guru places His feet. || 19 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Without the Guru, spiritual
wisdom is not obtained, and peace does not come to abide in the mind. O Nanak,
without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the self-willed manmukhs depart, after having
wasted their lives. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: All the Siddhas, spiritual masters and seekers
search for the Name; they have grown weary of concentrating and focusing their
attention. Without the True Guru, no one finds the Name; the Gurmukhs unite in Union
with the Lord. Without the Name, all food and clothes are worthless; cursed is such
spirituality, and cursed are such miraculous powers. That alone is spirituality, and that
alone is miraculous power, which the Carefree Lord spontaneously bestows. O Nanak,
the Lord‟s Name abides in the mind of the Gurmukh; this is spirituality, and this is
miraculous power. || 2 || PAUREE: I am a minstrel of God, my Lord and Master;
every day, I sing the songs of the Lord‟s Glorious Praises. I sing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s
Praises, and I listen to the Praises of the Lord, the Master of wealth and Maya. The Lord
is the Great Giver; all the world is begging; all beings and creatures are beggars. O
Lord, You are kind and compassionate; You give Your gifts to even worms and insects
among the rocks. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; as
Gurmukh, he has become truly wealthy. || 20 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Reading
and studying are just worldly pursuits, if there is thirst and corruption within. Reading in
egotism, all have grown weary; through the love of duality, they are ruined. He alone is
educated, and he alone is a wise Pandit, who contemplates the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. He searches within himself, and finds the true essence; he finds the Door of
Salvation. He finds the Lord, the treasure of excellence, and peacefully contemplates
Him. Blessed is the trader, O Nanak, who, as Gurmukh, takes the Name as his only
Support. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Without conquering his mind, no one can be
successful. See this, and concentrate on it. The wandering holy men are tired of of
making pilgrimages to sacred shrines; they have not been able to conquer their minds.
The Gurmukh has conquered his mind, and he remains lovingly absorbed in the True
Lord. O Nanak, this is how the filth of the mind is removed; the Word of the Shabad
burns away the ego. || 2 || PAUREE: O Saints of the Lord, O my Siblings of Destiny,
please meet with me, and implant the Name of the One Lord within me. O humble
servants of the Lord, adorn me with the decorations of the Lord, Har, Har; let me wear
the robes of the Lord‟s forgiveness. Such decorations are pleasing to my God; such love
is dear to the Lord. I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, day and night; in an
instant, all sins are eradicated. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 651 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
That Gurmukh, unto whom the Lord becomes merciful, chants the Lord‟s Name, and
wins the game of life. || 21 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The filth of countless
incarnations sticks to this mind; it has become pitch black. The oily rag cannot be
cleaned by merely washing it, even if it is washed a hundred times. By Guru‟s Grace,
one remains dead while yet alive; his intellect is transformed, and he becomes detached
from the world. O Nanak, no filth sticks to him, and he does not fall into the womb
again. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Kali Yuga is called the Dark Age, but the most sublime
state is attained in this age. The Gurmukh obtains the fruit, the Kirtan of the Lord‟s
Praises; this is his destiny, ordained by the Lord. O Nanak, by Guru‟s Grace, he
worships the Lord night and day; he chants the Lord‟s Name, and remains absorbed in
the Lord‟s devotional worship. || 2 || PAUREE: O Lord, unite me with the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy, so that with my mouth, I may speak the sublime
Word of the Guru‟s Bani. I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and constantly chant
the Lord‟s Name; through the Guru‟s Teachings, I enjoy the Lord‟s Love constantly. I
take the medicine of meditation on the Lord‟s Name, which has cured all diseases and
multitudes of sufferings. Those who do not forget the Lord, while breathing or eating —
know them to be the perfect servants of the Lord. Those Gurmukhs who worship the
Lord in adoration end their subservience to the Messenger of Death, and to the world.
|| 22 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O man, you have been tormented by a nightmare,
and you have passed your life in sleep. You did not wake to hear the Word of the True
Guru‟s Shabad; you have no inspiration within yourself. That body burns, which has no
virtue, and which does not serve the Guru. I have seen that the world is burning, in
egotism and the love of duality. O Nanak, those who seek the Guru‟s Sanctuary are
saved; within their minds, they meditate on the True Word of the Shabad. || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: Attuned to the Word of the Shabad, the soul-bride is rid of egotism, and
she is glorified. If she walks steadily in the way of His Will, then she is adorned with
decorations. Her couch becomes beautiful, and she constantly enjoys her Husband
Lord; she obtains the Lord as her Husband. The Lord does not die, and she never
suffers pain; she is a happy soul-bride forever. O Nanak, the Lord God unites her with
Himself; she enshrines love and affection for the Guru. || 2 || PAUREE: Those who
conceal and deny their Guru, are the most evil people. O Dear Lord, let me not even
see them; they are the worst sinners and murderers. They wander from house to
house, with impure minds, like wicked, forsaken women. But by great good fortune,
they may meet the Company of the Holy; as Gurmukhs, they are reformed. O Lord,
please be kind and let me meet the True Guru; I am a sacrifice to the Guru. || 23 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Serving the Guru, peace is produced, and then, one does not
suffer in pain. The cycle of birth and death is brought to an end, and death has no
power over at all. His mind is imbued with the Lord, and he remains merged in the True
Lord. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who walk in the Way of the True Guru‟s Will.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: Without the Word of the Shabad, purity is not obtained, even
though the soul-bride may adorn herself with all sorts of decorations. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 652 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
She does not know the value of her Husband Lord; she is attached to the love of
duality. She is impure, and ill-mannered, O Nanak; among women, she is the most evil
woman. || 2 || PAUREE: Be kind to me, Lord, that I might chant the Word of Your
Bani. May I meditate on the Lord‟s Name, chant the Lord‟s Name, and obtain the profit
of the Lord‟s Name. I am a sacrifice to those who chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
day and night. May I behold with my eyes those who worship and adore my Beloved
True Guru. I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has united me with my Lord, my friend,
my very best friend. || 24 || SHALOK, FOURTH MEHL: The Lord loves His slaves;
the Lord is the friend of His slaves. The Lord is under the control of His slaves, like the
musical instrument under the control of the musician. The Lord‟s slaves meditate on the
Lord; they love their Beloved. Please, hear me, O God — let Your Grace rain over the
whole world. The praise of the Lord‟s slaves is the Glory of the Lord. The Lord loves His
Own Glory, and so His humble servant is celebrated and hailed. That humble servant of
the Lord meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the Lord, and the Lord‟s
humble servant, are one and the same. Servant Nanak is the slave of the Lord; O Lord,
O God, please, preserve his honor. || 1 || FOURTH MEHL: Nanak loves the True
Lord; without Him, he cannot even survive. Meeting the True Guru, one finds the
Perfect Lord, and the tongue enjoys the sublime essence of the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE:
Night and day, morning and night, I sing to You, Lord. All beings and creatures
meditate on Your Name. You are the Giver, the Great Giver; we eat whatever You give
us. In the congregation of the devotees, sins are eradicated. Servant Nanak is forever a
sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, O Lord. || 25 || SHALOK, FOURTH MEHL: He has
spiritual ignorance within, and his intellect is dull and dim; he does not place his faith in
the True Guru. He has deceit within himself, and so he sees deception in all others;
through his deceptions, he is totally ruined. The True Guru‟s Will does not enter into his
consciousness, and so he wanders around, pursuing his own interests. If He grants His
Grace, then Nanak is absorbed into the Word of the Shabad. || 1 || FOURTH MEHL:
The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in emotional attachment to Maya; in the love
of duality, their minds are unsteady. Night and day, they are burning; day and night,
they are totally ruined by their egotism. Within them, is the total pitch darkness of
greed, and no one even approaches them. They themselves are miserable, and they
never find peace; they are born, only to die, and die again. O Nanak, the True Lord God
forgives those, who focus their consciousness on the Guru‟s feet. || 2 || PAUREE:
That Saint, that devotee, is acceptable, who is loved by God. Those beings are wise,
who meditate on the Lord. They eat the food, the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam, the
Name of the Lord. They apply the dust of the feet of the Saints to their foreheads. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 653 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, they are purified, bathing in the sacred shrine of the Lord. || 26 || SHALOK,
FOURTH MEHL: Within the Gurmukh is peace and tranquility; his mind and body are
absorbed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He contemplates the Naam, he studies
the Naam, and he remains lovingly absorbed in the Naam. He obtains the treasure of
the Naam, and his anxiety is dispelled. Meeting with the Guru, the Naam wells up, and
his thirst and hunger are completely relieved. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, he
gathers in the Naam. || 1 || FOURTH MEHL: One who is cursed by the True Guru,
abandons his home, and wanders around aimlessly. He is jeered at, and his face is
blackened in the world hereafter. He babbles incoherently, and foaming at the mouth,
he dies. What can anyone do? Such is his destiny, according to his past deeds.
Wherever he goes, he is a liar, and by telling lies, he not liked by anyone. O Siblings of
Destiny, behold this, the glorious greatness of our Lord and Master, O Saints; as one
behaves, so does he receive. This shall be God‟s determination in His True Court;
servant Nanak predicts and proclaims this. || 2 || PAUREE: The True Guru has
established the village; the Guru has appointed its guards and protectors. My hopes are
fulfilled, and my mind is imbued with the love of the Guru‟s Feet. The Guru is infinitely
merciful; He has erased all my sins. The Guru has showered me with His Mercy, and He
has made me His own. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who has countless
virtues. || 27 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: By His Command, we receive our preordained rewards; so what can we do now, O Pandit? When His Command is received,
then it is decided; all beings move and act accordingly. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: The
string through the nose is in the hands of the Lord Master; one‟s own actions drive him
on. Wherever his food is, there he eats it; O Nanak, this is the Truth. || 2 || PAUREE:
The Lord Himself puts everything in its proper place. He Himself created the creation,
and He Himself destroys it. He Himself fashions His creatures, and He Himself nourishes
them. He hugs His slaves close in His embrace, and blesses them with His Glance of
Grace. O Nanak, His devotees are forever in bliss; they have burnt away the love of
duality. || 28 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O mind, meditate on the Dear Lord, with
single-minded conscious concentration. The glorious greatness of the Lord shall last
forever and ever; He never regrets what He gives. I am forever a sacrifice to the Lord;
serving Him, peace is obtained. O Nanak, the Gurmukh remains merged with the Lord;
he burns away his ego through the Word of the Shabad. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: He
Himself enjoins us to serve Him, and He Himself blesses us with forgiveness. He
Himself is the father and mother of all; He Himself cares for us. O Nanak, those who
meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, abide in the home of their inner being;
they are honored throughout the ages. || 2 || PAUREE: You are the Creator, allpowerful, able to do anything. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 654 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Without You, there is no other at all. You Yourself created the world, and You Yourself
shall destroy it in the end. The Word of Your Shabad alone is pervading everywhere;
whatever You do, comes to pass. God blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness,
and then, he finds the Lord. As Gurmukh, Nanak worships and adores the Lord; let
everyone proclaim, “Blessed, blessed, blessed is He, the Guru!” || 29 || 1 || SUDH ||
RAAG SORAT‟H, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE KABEER JEE, FIRST HOUSE:

Worshipping their idols, the Hindus die; the Muslims die bowing their heads. The Hindus
cremate their dead, while the Muslims bury theirs; neither finds Your true state, Lord.
|| 1 || O mind, the world is a deep, dark pit. On all four sides, Death has spread his
net. || 1 || Pause || Reciting their poems, the poets die; the mystical ascetics die
while journeying to Kaydaar Naat‟h. The Yogis die, with their matted hair, but even they
do not find Your state, Lord. || 2 || The kings die, gathering and hoarding their
money, burying great quantities of gold. The Pandits die, reading and reciting the
Vedas; women die, gazing at their own beauty. || 3 || Without the Lord‟s Name, all
come to ruin; behold, and know this, O body. Without the Name of the Lord, who can
find salvation? Kabeer speaks the Teachings. || 4 || 1 || When the body is burnt, it
turns to ashes; if it is not cremated, then it is eaten by armies of worms. The unbaked
clay pitcher dissolves, when water is poured into it; this is also the nature of the body.
|| 1 || Why, O Siblings of Destiny, do you strut around, all puffed up with pride? Have
you forgotten those days, when you were hanging, face down, for ten months? || 1 ||
Pause || Like the bee which collects honey, the fool eagerly gathers and collects
wealth. At the time of death, they shout, “Take him away, take him away! Why leave a
ghost lying around?” || 2 || His wife accompanies his to the threshold, and his friends
and companions beyond. All the people and relatives go as far as the cremation
grounds, and then, the soul-swan goes on alone. || 3 || Says Kabeer, listen, O mortal
being: you have been seized by Death, and you have fallen into the deep, dark pit. You
have entangled yourself in the false wealth of Maya, like the parrot caught in the trap.
|| 4 || 2 || Listening to all the teachings of the Vedas and the Puraanas, I wanted to
perform the religious rituals. But seeing all the wise men caught by Death, I arose and
left the Pandits; now I am free of this desire. || 1 || O mind, you have not completed
the only task you were given; you have not meditated on the Lord, your King. || 1 ||
Pause || Going to the forests, they practice Yoga and deep, austere meditation; they
live on roots and the fruits they gather. The musicians, the Vedic scholars, the chanters
of one word and the men of silence, all are listed on the Register of Death. || 2 ||
Loving devotional worship does not enter into your heart; pampering and adorning your
body, you must still give it up. You sit and play music, but you are still a hypocrite;
what do you expect to receive from the Lord? || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 655 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Death has fallen on the whole world; the doubting religious scholars are also listed on
the Register of Death. Says Kabeer, those humble people become pure — they become
Khalsa — who know the Lord‟s loving devotional worship. || 4 || 3 || SECOND HOUSE
|| With both of my eyes, I look around; I don‟t see anything except the Lord. My eyes
gaze lovingly upon Him, and now, I cannot speak of anything else. || 1 || My doubts
were removed, and my fear ran away, when my consciousness became attached to the
Lord‟s Name. || 1 || Pause || When the magician beats his tambourine, everyone
comes to see the show. When the magician winds up his show, then he enjoys its play
all alone. || 2 || By preaching sermons, one‟s doubt is not dispelled. Everyone is tired
of preaching and teaching. The Lord causes the Gurmukh to understand; his heart
remains permeated with the Lord. || 3 || When the Guru grants even a bit of His
Grace, one‟s body, mind and entire being are absorbed into the Lord. Says Kabeer, I am
imbued with the Lord‟s Love; I have met with the Life of the world, the Great Giver. ||
4 || 4 || Let the sacred scriptures be your milk and cream, and the ocean of the mind
the churning vat. Be the butter-churner of the Lord, and your buttermilk shall not be
wasted. || 1 || O soul-bride slave, why don‟t you take the Lord as your Husband? He
is the Life of the world, the Support of the breath of life. || 1 || Pause || The chain
is around your neck, and the cuffs are on your feet. The Lord has sent you wandering
around from house to house. And still, you do not meditate on the Lord, O soul-bride,
slave. Death is watching you, O wretched woman. || 2 || The Lord God is the Cause
of causes. What is in the hands of the poor soul-bride, the slave? She awakens from her
slumber, and she becomes attached to whatever the Lord attaches her. || 3 || O soulbride, slave, where did you obtain that wisdom, by which you erased your inscription of
doubt? Kabeer has tasted that subtle essence; by Guru‟s Grace, his mind is reconciled
with the Lord. || 4 || 5 || Without Him, we cannot even live; when we meet Him,
then our task is completed. People say it is good to live forever, but without dying,
there is no life. || 1 || So now, what sort wisdom should I contemplate and preach?
As I watch, worldly things dissipate. || 1 || Pause || Saffron is ground up, and mixed
with sandalwood; without eyes, the world is seen. The son has given birth to his father;
without a place, the city has been established. || 2 || The humble beggar has found
the Great Giver, but he is unable to eat what he has been given. He cannot leave it
alone, but it is never exhausted. He shall not go to beg from others any longer. || 3 ||
Those select few, who know how to die while yet alive, enjoy great peace. Kabeer has
found that wealth; meeting with the Lord, he has erased his self-conceit. || 4 || 6 ||
What use is it to read, and what use is it to study? What use is it to listen to the Vedas
and the Puraanas? What use is reading and listening, if celestial peace is not attained?
|| 1 || The fool does not chant the Name of the Lord. So what does he think of, over
and over again? || 1 || Pause || In the darkness, we need a lamp to find the
incomprehensible thing. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 656 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I have found this incomprehensible thing; my mind is illuminated and enlightened. || 2
|| Says Kabeer, now I know Him; since I know Him, my mind is pleased and
appeased. My mind is pleased and appeased, and yet, people do not believe it. They do
not believe it, so what can I do? || 3 || 7 || In his heart there is deception, and yet in
his mouth are words of wisdom. You are false — why are you churning water? || 1 ||
Why do you bother to wash your body? Your heart is still full of filth. || 1 || Pause ||
The gourd may be washed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines, but even then, its
bitterness is not removed. || 2 || Says Kabeer after deep contemplation, please help
me cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Lord, O Destroyer of ego. || 3 || 8 ||
SORAT‟H:

Practicing great hypocrisy, he acquires the wealth of others. Returning home, he
squanders it on his wife and children. || 1 || O my mind, do not practice deception,
even inadvertently. In the end, your own soul shall have to answer for its account. || 1
|| Pause || Moment by moment, the body is wearing away, and old age is asserting
itself. And then, when you are old, no one shall pour water into your cup. || 2 || Says
Kabeer, no one belongs to you. Why not chant the Lord‟s Name in your heart, when you
are still young? || 3 || 9 || O Saints, my windy mind has now become peaceful and
still. It seems that I have learned something of the science of Yoga. || Pause || The
Guru has shown me the hole, through which the deer carefully enters. I have now
closed off the doors, and the unstruck celestial sound current resounds. || 1 || The
pitcher of my heart-lotus is filled with water; I have spilled out the water, and set it
upright. Says Kabeer, the Lord‟s humble servant, this I know. Now that I know this, my
mind is pleased and appeased. || 2 || 10 || RAAG SORAT‟H: I am so hungry, I
cannot perform devotional worship service. Here, Lord, take back Your mala. I beg for
the dust of the feet of the Saints. I do not owe anyone anything. || 1 || O Lord, how
can I be with You? If You do not give me Yourself, then I shall beg until I get You. ||
Pause || I ask for two kilos of flour, and half a pound of ghee, and salt. I ask for a
pound of beans, which I shall eat twice a day. || 2 || I ask for a cot, with four legs,
and a pillow and mattress. I ask for a quit to cover myself. Your humble servant shall
perform Your devotional worship service with love. || 3 || I have no greed; Your
Name is the only ornament I wish for. Says Kabeer, my mind is pleased and appeased;
now that my mind is pleased and appeased, I have come to know the Lord. || 4 || 11
||
RAAG SORAT‟H, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE NAAM DAYV JEE, SECOND
HOUSE:

When I see Him, I sing His Praises. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 657 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Then I, his humble servant, become patient. || 1 || Meeting the Divine True Guru, I
merge into the sound current of the Naad. || 1 || Pause || Where the dazzling white
light is seen, there the unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds. One‟s light
merges in the Light; by Guru‟s Grace, I know this. || 2 || The jewels are in the
treasure chamber of the heart-lotus. They sparkle and glitter like lightning. The Lord is
near at hand, not far away. He is totally permeating and pervading in my soul. || 3 ||
Where the light of the undying sun shines, the light of burning lamps seems
insignificant. By Guru‟s Grace, I know this. Servant Naam Dayv is absorbed in the
Celestial Lord. || 4 || 1 || FOURTH HOUSE, SORAT‟H: The woman next door asked
Naam Dayv, “Who built your house? I shall pay him double wages. Tell me, who is your
carpenter?” || 1 || O sister, I cannot give this carpenter to you. Behold, my carpenter
is pervading everywhere. My carpenter is the Support of the breath of life. || 1 ||
Pause || This carpenter demands the wages of love, if someone wants Him to build
their house. When one breaks his ties with all the people and relatives, then the
carpenter comes of His own accord. || 2 || I cannot describe such a carpenter, who is
contained in everything, everywhere. The mute tastes the most sublime ambrosial
nectar, but if you ask him to describe it, he cannot. || 3 || Listen to the virtues of this
carpenter, O sister; He stopped the oceans, and established Dhroo as the pole star.
Naam Dayv‟s Lord Master brought Sita back, and gave Sri Lanka to Bhabheekhan. || 4
|| 2 || SORAT‟H, THIRD HOUSE: The skinless drum plays. Without the rainy season,
the clouds shake with thunder. Without clouds, the rain falls, if one contemplates the
essence of reality. || 1 || I have met my Beloved Lord. Meeting with Him, my body is
made beauteous and sublime. || 1 || Pause || Touching the philosopher‟s stone, I
have been transformed into gold. I have threaded the jewels into my mouth and mind.
I love Him as my own, and my doubt has been dispelled. Seeking the Guru‟s guidance,
my mind is content. || 2 || The water is contained within the pitcher; I know that the
One Lord is contained in all. The mind of the disciple has faith in the Guru. Servant
Naam Dayv understands the essence of reality. || 3 || 3 ||
RAAG SORAT‟H, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE RAVI DAAS JEE:

When I am in my ego, then You are not with me. Now that You are with me, there is no
egotism within me. The wind may raise up huge waves in the vast ocean, but they are
just water in water. || 1 || O Lord, what can I say about such an illusion? Things are
not as they seem. || 1 || Pause || It is like the king, who falls asleep upon his
throne, and dreams that he is a beggar. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 658 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
His kingdom is intact, but separated from it, he suffers in sorrow. Such is my own
condition. || 2 || Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has
now been explained to me. Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were
gold; now, I do not say what I said then. || 3 || The One Lord is pervading the many
forms; He enjoys Himself in all hearts. Says Ravi Daas, the Lord is nearer than our own
hands and feet. Whatever will be, will be. || 4 || 1 || If I am bound by the noose of
emotional attachment, then I shall bind You, Lord, with the bonds of love. Go ahead
and try to escape, Lord; I have escaped by worshipping and adoring You. || 1 || O
Lord, You know my love for You. Now, what will You do? || 1 || Pause || A fish is
caught, cut up, and cooked it in many different ways. Bit by bit, it is eaten, but still, it
does not forget the water. || 2 || The Lord, our King, is father to no one, except
those who love Him. The veil of emotional attachment has been cast over the entire
world, but it does not bother the Lord‟s devotee. || 3 || Says Ravi Daas, my devotion
to the One Lord is increasing; now, who can I tell this to? That which brought me to
worship and adore You — I am still suffering that pain. || 4 || 2 || I obtained this
precious human life as a reward for my past actions, but without discriminating wisdom,
it is wasted in vain. Tell me, without devotional worship of the Lord, of what use are
mansions and thrones like those of King Indra? || 1 || You have not considered the
sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, our King; this sublime essence shall cause
you to forget all other essences. || 1 || Pause || We do not know what we need to
know, and we have become insane. We do not consider what we should consider; our
days are passing away. Our passions are strong, and our discriminating intellect is
weak; we have no access to the supreme objective. || 2 || We say one thing, and do
something else; entangled in endless Maya, we do not understand anything. Says Ravi
Daas, Your slave, O Lord, I am disillusioned and detached; please, spare me Your
anger, and have mercy on my soul. || 3 || 3 || He is the ocean of peace; the
miraculous tree of life, the wish-fulfilling jewel, and the Kaamadhayna, the cow which
fulfills all desires, all are in His power. The four great blessings, the eighteen
supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, and the nine treasures, are all in the palm
of His hand. || 1 || You do not chant with your tongue the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, Har. Abandon your involvement in all other words. || 1 || Pause || The various
Shaastras, Puranaas, and the Vedas of Brahma, are made up of thirty-four letters. After
deep contemplation, Vyaas spoke of the supreme objective; there is nothing equal to
the Lord‟s Name. || 2 || Very fortunate are those who are absorbed in celestial bliss,
and released from their entanglements; they are lovingly attached to the Lord. Says
Ravi Daas, enshrine the Lord‟s Light within your heart, and your fear of birth and death
shall run away from you. || 3 || 4 || If You are the mountain, Lord, then I am the
peacock. If You are the moon, then I am the partridge in love with it. || 1 || O Lord, if
You will not break with me, then I will not break with You. For, if I were to break with
You, with whom would I then join? || 1 || Pause || If You are the lamp, then I am
the wick. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 659 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
If You are the sacred place of pilgrimage, then I am the pilgrim. || 2 || I am joined in
true love with You, Lord. I am joined with You, and I have broken with all others. || 3
|| Wherever I go, there I serve You. There is no other Lord Master than You, O Divine
Lord. || 4 || Meditating, vibrating upon You, the noose of death is cut away. To attain
devotional worship, Ravi Daas sings to You, Lord. || 5 || 5 || The body is a wall of
water, supported by the pillars of air; the egg and sperm are the mortar. The
framework is made up of bones, flesh and veins; the poor soul-bird dwells within it. ||
1 || O mortal, what is mine, and what is yours? The soul is like a bird perched upon a
tree. || 1 || Pause || You lay the foundation and build the walls. But in the end,
three and a half cubits will be your measured space. || 2 || You make your hair
beautiful, and wear a stylish turban on your head. But in the end, this body shall be
reduced to a pile of ashes. || 3 || Your palaces are lofty, and your brides are
beautiful. But without the Lord‟s Name, you shall lose the game entirely. || 4 || My
social status is low, my ancestry is low, and my life is wretched. I have come to Your
Sanctuary, O Luminous Lord, my King; so says Ravi Daas, the shoemaker. || 5 || 6 ||
I am a shoemaker, but I do not know how to mend shoes. People come to me to mend
their shoes. || 1 || Pause || I have no awl to stitch them; I have no knife to patch
them. || 1 || Mending, mending, people waste their lives and ruin themselves.
Without wasting my time mending, I have found the Lord. || 2 || Ravi Daas chants
the Lord‟s Name; he is not concerned with the Messenger of Death. || 3 || 7 ||
RAAG SORAT‟H, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE BHEEKHAN JEE, SECOND
HOUSE:

Tears well up in my eyes, my body has become weak, and my har has become milkywhite. My throat is tight, and I cannot utter even one word; what can I do now? I am a
mere mortal. || 1 || O Lord, my King, Gardener of the world-garden, be my Physician,
and save me, Your Saint. || 1 || Pause || My head aches, my body is burning, and
my heart is filled with anguish. Such is the disease that has struck me; there is no
medicine to cure it. || 2 || The Name of the Lord, the ambrosial, immaculate water, is
the best medicine in the world. By Guru‟s Grace, says servant Bheekhan, I have found
the Door of Salvation. || 3 || 1 || Such is the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the
invaluable jewel, the most sublime wealth, which I have found through good deeds. By
various efforts, I have enshrined it within my heart; this jewel cannot be hidden by
hiding it. || 1 || The Glorious Praises of the Lord cannot be spoken by speaking. They
are like the sweet candies given to a mute. || 1 || Pause || The tongue speaks, the
ears listen, and the mind contemplates the Lord; they find peace and comfort. Says
Bheekhan, my eyes are content; wherever I look, there I see the Lord. || 2 || 2 || 


DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:




My soul is afraid; to whom should I complain? I serve Him, who makes me forget my
pains; He is the Giver, forever and ever. || 1 || My Lord and Master is forever new;
He is the Giver, forever and ever. || 1 || Pause || Night and day, I serve my Lord
and Master; He shall save me in the end. Hearing and listening, O my dear sister, I
have crossed over. || 2 || O Merciful Lord, Your Name carries me across. I am forever
a sacrifice to You. || 1 || Pause || In all the world, there is only the One True Lord;
there is no other at all. He alone serves the Lord, upon whom the Lord casts His Glance
of Grace. || 3 || Without You, O Beloved, how could I even live? Bless me with such
greatness, that I may remain attached to Your Name. There is no other, O Beloved, to
whom I can go and speak. || 1 || Pause || I serve my Lord and Master; I ask for no
other. Nanak is His slave; moment by moment, bit by bit, he is a sacrifice to Him. || 4
|| O Lord Master, I am a sacrifice to Your Name, moment by moment, bit by bit. || 1
|| Pause || 4 || 1 || DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL: We are human beings of the
briefest moment; we do not know the appointed time of our departure. Prays Nanak,
serve the One, to whom our soul and breath of life belong. || 1 || You are blind —
see and consider, how many days your life shall last. || 1 || Pause || My breath, my
flesh and my soul are all Yours, Lord; You are so very dear to me. Nanak, the poet,
says this, O True Lord Cherisher. || 2 || If you gave nothing, O my Lord and Master,
what could anyone pledge to You? Nanak prays, we receive that which we are predestined to receive. || 3 || The deceitful person does not remember the Lord‟s Name;
he practices only deceit. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 661 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When he is marched in chains to Death‟s door, then, he regrets his actions. || 4 || As
long as we are in this world, O Nanak, we should listen, and speak of the Lord. I have
searched, but I have found no way to remain here; so, remain dead while yet alive. ||
5 || 2 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

How can I remember the Lord in meditation? I cannot meditate on Him in
remembrance. My heart is burning, and my soul is crying out in pain. The True Lord
creates and adorns. Forgetting Him, how can one be good? || 1 || By clever tricks and
commands, He cannot be found. How am I to meet my True Lord, O my mother? || 1
|| Pause || How rare is the one who goes out, and searches for the merchandise of
the Naam. No one tastes it, and no one eats it. Honor is not obtained by trying to
please other people. One‟s honor is preserved, only if the Lord preserves it. || 2 ||
Wherever I look, there I see Him, pervading and permeating. Without You, I have no
other place of rest. He may try, but what can anyone do by his own doing? He alone is
blessed, whom the True Lord forgives. || 3 || Now, I shall have to get up and depart,
in an instant, in the clapping of hands. What face will I show the Lord? I have no virtue
at all. As is the Lord‟s Glance of Grace, so it is. Without His Glance of Grace, O Nanak,
no one is blessed. || 4 || 1 || 3 || DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL: If the Lord bestows
His Glance of Grace, then one remembers Him in meditation. The soul is softened, and
he remains absorbed in the Lord‟s Love. His soul and the Supreme Soul become one.
The duality of the inner mind is overcome. || 1 || By Guru‟s Grace, God is found.
One‟s consciousness is attached to the Lord, and so Death does not devour him. || 1 ||
Pause || Remembering the True Lord in meditation, one is enlightened. Then, in the
midst of Maya, he remains detached. Such is the Glory of the True Guru; in the midst of
children and spouses, they attain emancipation. || 2 || Such is the service which the
Lord‟s servant performs, that he dedicates his soul to the Lord, to whom it belongs. One
who is pleasing to the Lord and Master is acceptable. Such a servant obtains honor in
the Court of the Lord. || 3 || He enshrines the image of the True Guru in his heart.
He obtains the rewards which he desires. The True Lord and Master grants His Grace;
how can such a servant be afraid of death? || 4 || Prays Nanak, practice
contemplation, and enshrine love for the True Word of His Bani. Then, you shall find
the Gate of Salvation. This Shabad is the most excellent of all chanting and austere
meditations. || 5 || 2 || 4 || DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL: My soul burns, over and
over again. Burning and burning, it is ruined, and it falls into evil. That body, which
forgets the Word of the Guru‟s Bani, cries out in pain, like a chronic patient. || 1 || To
speak too much and babble is useless. Even without our speaking, He knows
everything. || 1 || Pause || He created our ears, eyes and nose. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 662 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He gave us our tongue to speak so fluently. He preserved the mind in the fire of the
womb; at His Command, the wind blows everywhere. || 2 || These worldly
attachments, loves and pleasurable tastes, all are just black stains. One who departs,
with these black stains of sin on his face shall find no place to sit in the Court of the
Lord. || 3 || By Your Grace, we chant Your Name. Becoming attached to it, one is
saved; there is no other way. Even if one is drowning, still, he may be saved. O Nanak,
the True Lord is the Giver of all. || 4 || 3 || 5 || DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL: If a
thief praises someone, his mind is not pleased. If a thief curses him, no damage is
done. No one will take responsibility for a thief. How can a thief‟s actions be good? || 1
|| Listen, O mind, you blind, false dog! Even without your speaking, the Lord knows
and understands. || 1 || Pause || A thief may be handsome, and a thief may be
wise, but he is still just a counterfeit coin, worth only a shell. If it is kept and mixed with
other coins, it will be found to be false, when the coins are inspected. || 2 || As one
acts, so does he receive. As he plants, so does he eat. He may praise himself gloriously,
but still, according to his understanding, so is the path he must follow. || 3 || He may
tell hundreds of lies to conceal his falsehood, and all the world may call him good. If it
pleases You, Lord, even the foolish are approved. O Nanak, the Lord is wise, knowing,
all-knowing. || 4 || 4 || 6 || DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL: The body is the paper,
and the mind is the inscription written upon it. The ignorant fool does not read what is
written on his forehead. In the Court of the Lord, three inscriptions are recorded.
Behold, the counterfeit coin is worthless there. || 1 || O Nanak, if there is silver in it,
then everyone proclaims, “It is genuine, it is genuine.” || 1 || Pause || The Qazi tells
lies and eats filth; the Brahmin kills and then takes cleansing baths. The Yogi is blind,
and does not know the Way. The three of them devise their own destruction. || 2 ||
He alone is a Yogi, who understands the Way. By Guru‟s Grace, he knows the One Lord.
He alone is a Qazi, who turns away from the world, and who, by Guru‟s Grace, remains
dead while yet alive. He alone is a Brahmin, who contemplates God. He saves himself,
and saves all his generations as well. || 3 || One who cleanses his own mind is wise.
One who cleanses himself of impurity is a Muslim. One who reads and understands is
acceptable. Upon his forehead is the Insignia of the Court of the Lord. || 4 || 5 || 7 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

No, no, this is not the time, when people know the way to Yoga and Truth. The holy
places of worship in the world are polluted, and so the world is drowning. || 1 || In
this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord‟s Name is the most sublime. Some people try to
deceive the world by closing their eyes and holding their nostrils closed. || 1 || Pause
|| 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 663 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They close off their nostrils with their fingers, and claim to see the three worlds. But
they cannot even see what is behind them. What a strange lotus pose this is! || 2 ||
The K‟shatriyas have abandoned their religion, and have adopted a foreign language.
The whole world has been reduced to the same social status; the state of righteousness
and Dharma has been lost. || 3 || They study and analyze the Puraanas and the
Vedas, but without the Lord‟s Name, no one is liberated; so says Nanak, the Lord‟s
slave. || 4 || 1 || 6 || 8 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL, AARTEE:

In the bowl of the sky, the sun and moon are the lamps; the stars in the constellations
are the pearls. The fragrance of sandalwood is the incense, the wind is the fan, and all
the vegetation are flowers in offering to You, O Luminous Lord. || 1 || What a
beautiful lamp-lit worship service this is! O Destroyer of fear, this is Your Aartee, Your
worship service. The sound current of the Shabad is the sounding of the temple drums.
|| 1 || Pause || Thousands are Your eyes, and yet You have no eyes. Thousands are
Your forms, and yet You have not even one form. Thousands are Your lotus feet, and
yet You have no feet. Without a nose, thousands are Your noses. I am enchanted with
Your play! || 2 || The Divine Light is within everyone; You are that Light. Yours is that
Light which shines within everyone. By the Guru‟s Teachings, this Divine Light is
revealed. That which pleases the Lord is the true worship service. || 3 || My soul is
enticed by the honey-sweet lotus feet of the Lord; night and day, I thirst for them.
Bless Nanak, the thirsty song-bird, with the water of Your Mercy, that he may come to
dwell in Your Name. || 4 || 1 || 7 || 9 ||
DHANAASAREE, THIRD MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

This wealth is inexhaustible. It shall never be exhausted, and it shall never be lost. The
Perfect True Guru has revealed it to me. I am forever a sacrifice to my True Guru. By
Guru‟s Grace, I have enshrined the Lord within my mind. || 1 || They alone are
wealthy, who lovingly attune themselves to the Lord‟s Name. The Perfect Guru has
revealed to me the Lord‟s treasure; by the Lord‟s Grace, it has come to abide in my
mind. || Pause || He is rid of his demerits, and his heart is permeated with merit
and virtue. By Guru‟s Grace, he naturally dwells in celestial peace. True is the Word of
the Perfect Guru‟s Bani. They bring peace to the mind, and celestial peace is absorbed
within. || 2 || O my humble Siblings of Destiny, behold this strange and wonderful
thing: duality is overcome, and the Lord dwells within his mind. The Naam, the Name of
the Lord, is priceless; it cannot be taken. By Guru‟s Grace, it comes to abide in the
mind. || 3 || He is the One God, abiding within all. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, He
is revealed in the heart. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 664 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
One who intuitively knows and realizes God, O Nanak, obtains the Naam; his mind is
pleased and appeased. || 4 || 1 || DHANAASAREE, THIRD MEHL: The wealth of the
Lord‟s Name is immaculate, and absolutely infinite. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is
over-flowing with treasure. Know that, except for the wealth of the Name, all other
wealth is poison. The egotistical people are burning in their attachment to Maya. || 1 ||
How rare is that Gurmukh who tastes the sublime essence of the Lord. He is always in
bliss, day and night; through perfect good destiny, he obtains the Name. || Pause ||
The Word of the Shabad is a lamp, illuminating the three worlds. One who tastes it,
becomes immaculate. The immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, washes off the filth
of ego. True devotional worship brings lasting peace. || 2 || One who tastes the
sublime essence of the Lord is the Lord‟s humble servant. He is forever happy; he is
never sad. He himself is liberated, and he liberates others as well. He chants the Lord‟s
Name, and through the Lord, he finds peace. || 3 || Without the True Guru, everyone
dies, crying out in pain. Night and day, they burn, and find no peace. But meeting the
True Guru, all thirst is quenched. O Nanak, through the Naam, one finds peace and
tranquility. || 4 || 2 || DHANAASAREE, THIRD MEHL: Gather in and cherish forever
the wealth of the Lord‟s Name, deep within; He cherishes and nurtures all beings and
creatures. They alone obtain the treasure of Liberation, who are lovingly imbued with,
and focused on the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || Serving the Guru, one obtains the wealth of
the Lord‟s Name. He is illumined and enlightened within, and he meditates on the Lord‟s
Name. || Pause || This love for the Lord is like the love of the bride for her husband.
God ravishes and enjoys the soul-bride who is adorned with peace and tranquility. No
one finds God through egotism. Wandering away from the Primal Lord, the root of all,
one wastes his life in vain. || 2 || Tranquility, celestial peace, pleasure and the Word
of His Bani come from the Guru. True is that service, which leads one to merge in the
Naam. Blessed with the Word of the Shabad, he meditates forever on the Lord, the
Beloved. Through the True Name, glorious greatness is obtained. || 3 || The Creator
Himself abides throughout the ages. If He casts His Glance of Grace, then we meet
Him. Through the Word of Gurbani, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind. O Nanak, God
unites with Himself those who are imbued with Truth. || 4 || 3 || DHANAASAREE,
THIRD MEHL: The world is polluted, and those in the world become polluted as well. In
attachment to duality, it comes and goes. This love of duality has ruined the entire
world. The self-willed manmukh suffers punishment, and forfeits his honor. || 1 ||
Serving the Guru, one becomes immaculate. He enshrines the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, within, and his state becomes exalted. || Pause || The Gurmukhs are saved,
taking to the Lord‟s Sanctuary. Attuned to the Lord‟s Name, they commit themselves to
devotional worship. The Lord‟s humble servant performs devotional worship, and is
blessed with greatness. Attuned to Truth, he is absorbed in celestial peace. || 2 ||
Know that one who purchases the True Name is very rare. Through the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad, he comes to understand himself. True is his capital, and true is his
trade. Blessed is that person, who loves the Naam. || 3 || God, the True Lord, has
attached some to His True Name. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 665 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They listen to the most sublime Word of His Bani, and the Word of His Shabad. True is
service to the True Lord God. O Nanak, the Naam is the Embellisher. || 4 || 4 ||
DHANAASAREE, THIRD MEHL: I am a sacrifice to those who serve the Lord. The Truth
is in their hearts, and the True Name is on their lips. Dwelling upon the Truest of the
True, their pains are dispelled. Through the True Word of the Shabad, the Lord comes
to dwell in their minds. || 1 || Listening to the Word of Gurbani, filth is washed off,
and they naturally enshrine the Lord‟s Name in their minds. || 1 || Pause || One
who conquers fraud, deceit and the fire of desire finds tranquility, peace and pleasure
within. If one walks in harmony with the Guru‟s Will, he eliminates his self-conceit. He
finds the True Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord.
|| 2 || The blind, self-willed manmukh does not understand the Shabad; he does not
know the Word of the Guru‟s Bani, and so he passes his life in misery. But if he meets
the True Guru, then he finds peace, and the ego within is silenced. || 3 || Who else
should I speak to? The One Lord is the Giver of all. When He grants His Grace, then we
obtain the Word of the Shabad. Meeting with my Beloved, I sing the Glorious Praises of
the True Lord. O Nanak, becoming truthful, I have become pleasing to the True Lord.
|| 4 || 5 || DHANAASAREE, THIRD MEHL: When the mind is conquered, its turbulent
wanderings are stopped. Without conquering the mind, how can the Lord be found?
Rare is the one who knows the medicine to conquer the mind. The mind is conquered
through the Word of the Shabad; this is known to the Lord‟s humble servant. || 1 ||
The Lord forgives him, and blesses him with glory. By Guru‟s Grace, the Lord comes to
dwell in the mind. || Pause || The Gurmukh does good deeds, and so, he comes to
understand this mind. The mind is intoxicated, like the elephant with wine. The Guru
places the harness upon it, and rejuvenates it. || 2 || The mind is undisciplined; only
a rare few can discipline it. If someone eats the uneatable, then he becomes
immaculate. As Gurmukh, his mind is embellished. Egotism and corruption are
eradicated from within. || 3 || Those whom the Primal Lord keeps united in His Union,
shall never be separated from Him; they are merged in the Word of the Shabad. Only
God Himself knows His own power. O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. || 4 || 6 || DHANAASAREE, THIRD MEHL: The ignorant fools
amass false wealth. The blind, foolish, self-willed manmukhs have gone astray.
Poisonous wealth brings constant pain. It will not go with you, and it will not yield any
profit. || 1 || True wealth is obtained through the Guru‟s Teachings. False wealth
continues coming and going. || Pause || The foolish self-willed manmukhs all go
astray and die. They drown in the terrifying world-ocean, and they cannot reach either
this shore, or the one beyond. But by perfect destiny, they meet the True Guru; imbued
with the True Name, day and night, they remain detached from the world. || 2 ||
Throughout the four ages, the True Bani of His Word is Ambrosial Nectar. By perfect
destiny, one is absorbed in the True Name. The Siddhas, the seekers and all men long
for the Name. It is obtained only by perfect destiny. || 3 || The True Lord is
everything; He is True. Only a few realize the exalted Lord God. He is the Truest of the
True; He Himself implants the True Name within. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 666 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, the Lord Himself sees all; He Himself links us to the Truth. || 4 || 7 ||
DHANAASAREE, THIRD MEHL: The value and worth of the Lord‟s Name cannot be
described. Blessed are those humble beings, who lovingly focus their minds on the
Naam, the Name of the Lord. True are the Guru‟s Teachings, and True is contemplative
meditation. God Himself forgives, and bestows contemplative meditation. || 1 || The
Lord‟s Name is wonderful! God Himself imparts it. In the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the
Gurmukhs obtain it. || 1 || Pause || We are ignorant; ignorance fills our minds. We
do all our deeds in ego. By Guru‟s Grace, egotism is eradicated. Forgiving us, the Lord
blends us with Himself. || 2 || Poisonous wealth gives rise to great arrogance.
Drowning in egotism, no one is honored. Forsaking self-conceit, one finds lasting peace.
Under Guru‟s Instruction, he praises the True Lord. || 3 || The Creator Lord Himself
fashions all. Without Him, there is no other at all. He alone is attached to Truth, whom
the Lord Himself so attaches. O Nanak, through the Naam, lasting peace is attained in
the hereafter. || 4 || 8 ||
RAAG DHANAASAREE, THIRD MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE:

I am just a poor beggar of Yours; You are Your Own Lord Master, You are the Great
Giver. Be Merciful, and bless me, a humble beggar, with Your Name, so that I may
forever remain imbued with Your Love. || 1 || I am a sacrifice to Your Name, O True
Lord. The One Lord is the Cause of causes; there is no other at all. || 1 || Pause || I
was wretched; I wandered through so many cycles of reincarnation. Now, Lord, please
bless me with Your Grace. Be merciful, and grant me the Blessed Vision of Your
Darshan; please grant me such a gift. || 2 || Prays Nanak, the shutters of doubt have
been opened wide; by Guru‟s Grace, I have come to know the Lord. I am filled to
overflowing with true love; my mind is pleased and appeased by the True Guru. || 3 ||
1 || 9 ||
DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

Those Saints and devotees who serve the Lord have all their sins washed away. Have
Mercy on me, O Lord and Master, and keep me in the Sangat, the Congregation that
You love. || 1 || I cannot even speak the Praises of the Lord, the Gardener of the
world. We are sinners, sinking like stones in water; grant Your Grace, and carry us
stones across. || Pause || The rust of poison and corruption from countless
incarnations sticks to us; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, it is
cleaned away. It is just like gold, which is heated in the fire, to remove the impurities
from it. || 2 || I chant the chant of the Name of the Lord, day and night; I chant the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, and enshrine it within my heart. The Name of the
Lord, Har, Har, Har, is the most perfect medicine in this world; chanting the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har, I have conquered my ego. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 667 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Lord, Har, Har, is unapproachable, of unfathomable wisdom, unlimited, all-powerful
and infinite. Show Mercy to Your humble servant, O Life of the world, and save the
honor of servant Nanak. || 4 || 1 || DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL: The humble
Saints of the Lord meditate on the Lord; their pain, doubt and fear have run away. The
Lord Himself inspires them to serve Him; they are awakened within to the Guru‟s
Teachings. || 1 || Imbued with the Lord‟s Name, they are unattached to the world.
Listening to the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, their minds are pleased; through Guru‟s
Instruction, they enshrine love for the Lord. || 1 || Pause || God, the Lord and
Master, is the caste and social status of His humble Saints. You are the Lord and
Master; I am just Your puppet. As is the understanding You bless us with, so are the
words we speak. || 2 || What are we? Tiny worms, and microscopic germs. You are
our great and glorious Lord and Master. I cannot describe Your state and extent. O
God, how can we unfortunate ones meet with You? || 3 || O God, my Lord and
Master, shower me with Your Mercy, and commit me to Your service. Make Nanak the
slave of Your slaves, God; I speak the speech of the Lord‟s sermon. || 4 || 2 ||
DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL: The True Guru is the Lord‟s Saint, the True Being,
who chants the Bani of the Lord, Har, Har. Whoever chants it, and listens to it, is
liberated; I am forever a sacrifice to him. || 1 || O Saints of the Lord, listen to the
Lord‟s Praises with your ears. Listen to the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, for a moment,
for even an instant, and all your sins and mistakes shall be erased. || 1 || Pause ||
Those who find such humble, Holy Saints, are the greatest of the great persons. I beg
for the dust of their feet; I long for the longing for God, my Lord and Master. || 2 ||
The Name of God, the Lord and Master, Har, Har, is the fruit-bearing tree; those who
meditate on it are satisfied. Drinking in the ambrosia of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
I am satisfied; all my hunger and thirst is quenched. || 3 || Those who are blessed
with the highest, loftiest destiny, chant and meditate on the Lord. Let me join their
congregation, O God, my Lord and Master; Nanak is the slave of their slaves. || 4 || 3
|| DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL: I am blind, totally blind, entangled in corruption
and poison. How can I walk on the Guru‟s Path? If the True Guru, the Giver of peace,
shows His kindness, He attaches us to the hem of His robe. || 1 || O Sikhs of the
Guru, O friends, walk on the Guru‟s Path. Whatever the Guru says, accept that as good;
the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is unique and wonderful. || 1 || Pause || O Saints
of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, listen: serve the Guru, quickly now! Let your service
to the True Guru be your supplies on the Lord‟s Path; pack them up, and don‟t think of
today or tomorrow. || 2 || O Saints of the Lord, chant the chant of the Lord‟s Name;
the Lord‟s Saints walk with the Lord. Those who meditate on the Lord, become the
Lord; the playful, wondrous Lord meets them. || 3 || To chant the chant of the Lord‟s
Name, Har, Har, is the longing I long for; have Mercy upon me, O Lord of the worldforest. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 668 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Lord, unite servant Nanak with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; make
me the dust of the feet of the Holy. || 4 || 4 || DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL: The
Lord, Har, Har, is the rain-drop; I am the song-bird, crying, crying out for it. O Lord
God, please bless me with Your Mercy, and pour Your Name into my mouth, even if for
only an instant. || 1 || Without the Lord, I cannot live for even a second. Like the
addict who dies without his drug, I die without the Lord. || Pause || You, Lord, are
the deepest, most unfathomable ocean; I cannot find even a trace of Your limits. You
are the most remote of the remote, limitless and transcendent; O Lord Master, You
alone know Your state and extent. || 2 || The Lord‟s humble Saints meditate on the
Lord; they are imbued with the deep crimson color of the Guru‟s Love. Meditating on
the Lord, they attain great glory, and the most sublime honor. || 3 || He Himself is
the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the servant; He Himself creates His
environments. Servant Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary, O Lord; protect and
preserve the honor of Your devotee. || 4 || 5 || DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL: Tell
me, O Siblings of Destiny, the religion for this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. I seek
emancipation — how can I be emancipated? Meditation on the Lord, Har, Har, is the
boat, the raft; meditating on the Lord, the swimmer swims across. || 1 || O Dear
Lord, protect and preserve the honor of Your humble servant. O Lord, Har, Har, please
make me chant the chant of Your Name; I beg only for Your devotional worship. ||
Pause || The Lord‟s servants are very dear to the Lord; they chant the Word of the
Lord‟s Bani. The account of the recording angels, Chitr and Gupt, and the account with
the Messenger of Death is totally erased. || 2 || The Saints of the Lord meditate on
the Lord in their minds; they join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. The
piercing sun of desires has set, and the cool moon has risen. || 3 || You are the
Greatest Being, absolutely unapproachable and unfathomable; You created the Universe
from Your Own Being. O God, take pity on servant Nanak, and make him the slave of
the slave of Your slaves. || 4 || 6 ||
DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Enshrine the Lord within your heart, and contemplate Him. Dwell upon Him, reflect
upon Him, and chant the Name of the Lord, the Enticer of hearts. The Lord Master is
unseen, unfathomable and unreachable; through the Perfect Guru, He is revealed. || 1
|| The Lord is the philosopher‟s stone, which transforms lead into gold, and
sandalwood, while I am just dry wood and stone. Associating with the Lord, and the Sat
Sangat, the Lord‟s True Congregation, the Lord has transformed me into gold and
sandalwood. || 1 || Pause || One may repeat, verbatim, the nine grammars and the
six Shaastras, but my Lord God is not pleased by this. O servant Nanak, meditate
forever on the Lord in your heart; this is what pleases my Lord God. || 2 || 1 || 7 ||

DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL:

Chant His Praises, learn of the Lord, and serve the True Guru; in this way, meditate on
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. In the Court of the Lord, He shall be pleased with you,
and you shall not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again; you shall merge in the
Divine Light of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. || 1 || Chant the Name of the Lord, O my
mind, and you shall be totally at peace. The Lord‟s Praises are the most sublime, the
most exalted; serving the Lord, Har, Har, Har, you shall be emancipated. || Pause ||
The Lord, the treasure of mercy, blessed me, and so the Guru blessed me with the
Lord‟s devotional worship; I have come to be in love with the Lord. I have forgotten my
cares and anxieties, and enshrined the Lord‟s Name in my heart; O Nanak, the Lord has
become my friend and companion. || 2 || 2 || 8 || DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL:
Read about the Lord, write about the Lord, chant the Lord‟s Name, and sing the Lord‟s
Praises; the Lord will carry you across the terrifying world-ocean. In your mind, by your
words, and within your heart, meditate on the Lord, and He will be pleased. In this way,
repeat the Name of the Lord. || 1 || O mind, meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the
World. Join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O friend. You shall be happy
forever, day and night; sing the Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the world-forest. ||
Pause || When the Lord, Har, Har, casts His Glance of Grace, then I made the effort
in my mind; meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, I have been emancipated.
Preserve the honor of servant Nanak, O my Lord and Master; I have come seeking Your
Sanctuary. || 2 || 3 || 9 || DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL: The eighty-four Siddhas,
the spiritual masters, the Buddhas, the thirty-three million gods and the silent sages, all
long for Your Name, O Dear Lord. By Guru‟s Grace, a rare few obtain it; upon their
foreheads, the pre-ordained destiny of loving devotion is written. || 1 || O mind,
chant the Name of the Lord; singing the Lord‟s Praises is the most exalted activity. I am
forever a sacrifice to those who sing, and hear Your Praises, O Lord and Master. ||
Pause || I seek Your Sanctuary, O Cherisher God, my Lord and Master; whatever You
give me, I accept. O Lord, Merciful to the meek, give me this blessing; Nanak longs for
the Lord‟s meditative remembrance. || 2 || 4 || 10 || DHANAASAREE, FOURTH
MEHL: All the Sikhs and servants come to worship and adore You; they sing the
sublime Bani of the Lord, Har, Har. Their singing and listening is approved by the Lord;
they accept the Order of the True Guru as True, totally True. || 1 || Chant the Lord‟s
Praises, O Siblings of Destiny; the Lord is the sacred shrine of pilgrimage in the
terrifying world-ocean. They alone are praised in the Court of the Lord, O Saints, who
know and understand the Lord‟s sermon. || Pause || He Himself is the Guru, and He
Himself is the disciple; the Lord God Himself plays His wondrous games. O servant
Nanak, he alone merges with the Lord, whom the Lord Himself merges; all the others
are forsaken, but the Lord loves him. || 2 || 5 || 11 || DHANAASAREE, FOURTH
MEHL: The Lord is the Fulfiller of desires, the Giver of total peace; the Kaamadhaynaa,
the wish-fulfilling cow, is in His power. So meditate on such a Lord, O my soul. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 670 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Then, you shall obtain total peace, O my mind. || 1 || Chant, O my mind, the True
Name, Sat Naam, the True Name. In this world, and in the world beyond, your face
shall be radiant, by meditating continually on the immaculate Lord God. || Pause ||
Wherever anyone remembers the Lord in meditation, disaster runs away from that
place. By great good fortune, we meditate on the Lord. The Guru has blessed servant
Nanak with this understanding, that by meditating on the Lord, we cross over the
terrifying world-ocean. || 2 || 6 || 12 || DHANAASAREE, FOURTH MEHL: O my King,
beholding the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, I am at peace. You alone know my
inner pain, O King; what can anyone else know? || Pause || O True Lord and
Master, You are truly my King; whatever You do, all that is True. Who should I call a
liar? There is no other than You, O King. || 1 || You are pervading and permeating in
all; O King, everyone meditates on You, day and night. Everyone begs of You, O my
King; You alone give gifts to all. || 2 || All are under Your Power, O my King; none at
all are beyond You. All beings are Yours—You belong to all, O my King. All shall merge
and be absorbed in You. || 3 || You are the hope of all, O my Beloved; all meditate
on You, O my King. As it pleases You, protect and preserve me, O my Beloved; You are
the True King of Nanak. || 4 || 7 || 13 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

O Destroyer of fear, Remover of suffering, Lord and Master, Lover of Your devotees,
Formless Lord. Millions of sins are eradicated in an instant when, as Gurmukh, one
contemplates the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || My mind is attached to my
Beloved Lord. God, Merciful to the meek, granted His Grace, and placed the five
enemies under my control. || 1 || Pause || Your place is so beautiful; Your form is
so beautiful; Your devotees look so beautiful in Your Court. O Lord and Master, Giver of
all beings, please, grant Your Grace, and save me. || 2 || Your color is not known,
and Your form is not seen; who can contemplate Your Almighty Creative Power? You
are contained in the water, the land and the sky, everywhere, O Lord of unfathomable
form, Holder of the mountain. || 3 || All beings sing Your Praises; You are the
imperishable Primal Being, the Destroyer of ego. As it pleases You, please protect and
preserve me; servant Nanak seeks Sanctuary at Your Door. || 4 || 1 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The fish out of water loses its life; it is deeply in love
with the water. The bumble bee, totally in love with the lotus flower, is lost in it; it
cannot find the way to escape from it. || 1 || Now, my mind has nurtured love for the
One Lord. He does not die, and is not born; He is always with me. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 671 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Through the Word of the True Guru‟s Shabad, I know Him. || 1 || Pause || Lured by
sexual desire, the elephant is trapped; the poor beast falls into the power of another.
Lured by the sound of the hunter‟s bell, the deer offers its head; because of this
enticement, it is killed. || 2 || Gazing upon his family, the mortal is enticed by greed;
he clings in attachment to Maya. Totally engrossed in worldly things, he considers them
to be his own; but in the end, he shall surely have to leave them behind. || 3 || Know
it well, that anyone who loves any other than God, shall be miserable forever. Says
Nanak, the Guru has explained this to me, that love for God brings lasting bliss. || 4 ||
2 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Granting His Grace, God has blessed me with His
Name, and released me of my bonds. I have forgotten all worldly entanglements, and I
am attached to the Guru‟s feet. || 1 || In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy,
I have renounced my other cares and anxieties. I dug a deep pit, and buried my
egotistical pride, emotional attachment and the desires of my mind. || 1 || Pause ||
No one is my enemy, and I am no one‟s enemy. God, who expanded His expanse, is
within all; I learned this from the True Guru. || 2 || I am a friend to all; I am
everyone‟s friend. When the sense of separation was removed from my mind, then I
was united with the Lord, my King. || 3 || My stubbornness is gone, Ambrosial Nectar
rains down, and the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad seems so sweet to me. He is pervading
everywhere, in the water, on the land and in the sky; Nanak beholds the all-pervading
Lord. || 4 || 3 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Ever since I obtained the Blessed
Vision of the Darshan of the Holy, my days have been blessed and prosperous. I have
found lasting bliss, singing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Primal Lord, the Architect of
destiny. || 1 || Now, I sing the Praises of the Lord within my mind. My mind has been
illumined and enlightened, and it is always at peace; I have found the Perfect True
Guru. || 1 || Pause || The Lord, the treasure of virtue, abides deep within the heart,
and so pain, doubt and fear have been dispelled. I have obtained the most
incomprehensible thing, enshrining love for the Name of the Lord. || 2 || I was
anxious, and now I am free of anxiety; I was worried, and now I am free of worry; my
grief, greed and emotional attachments are gone. By His Grace, I am cured of the
disease of egotism, and the Messenger of Death no longer terrifies me. || 3 ||
Working for the Guru, serving the Guru and the Guru‟s Command, all are pleasing to
me. Says Nanak, He has released me from the clutches of Death; I am a sacrifice to
that Guru. || 4 || 4 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Body, mind, wealth and
everything belong to Him; He alone is all-wise and all-knowing. He listens to my pains
and pleasures, and then my condition improves. || 1 || My soul is satisfied with the
One Lord alone. People make all sorts of other efforts, but they have no value at all. ||
Pause || The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a priceless jewel. The Guru
has given me this advice. It cannot be lost, and it cannot be shaken off; it remains
steady, and I am perfectly satisfied with it. || 2 || Those things which tore me away
from You, Lord, are now gone. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 672 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When golden ornaments are melted down into a lump, they are still said to be gold. ||
3 || The Divine Light has illuminated me, and I am filled with celestial peace and
glory; the unstruck melody of the Lord‟s Bani resounds within me. Says Nanak, I have
built my eternal home; the Guru has constructed it for me. || 4 || 5 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The desires of the greatest of the great kings and
landlords cannot be satisfied. They remain engrossed in Maya, intoxicated with the
pleasures of their wealth; their eyes see nothing else at all. || 1 || No one has ever
found satisfaction in sin and corruption. The flame is not satisfied by more fuel; how
can one be satisfied without the Lord? || Pause || Day after day, he eats his meals
with many different foods, but his hunger is not eradicated. He runs around like a dog,
searching in the four directions. || 2 || The lustful, lecherous man desires many
women, and he never stops peeking into the homes of others. Day after day, he
commits adultery again and again, and then he regrets his actions; he wastes away in
misery and greed. || 3 || The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is incomparable and
priceless; it is the treasure of Ambrosial Nectar. The Saints abide in peace, poise and
bliss; O Nanak, through the Guru, this is known. || 4 || 6 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: Nothing which this mortal being runs after, can compare to it. He alone comes
to have it, whom the Guru blesses with this Ambrosial Nectar. || 1 || The desire to
eat, to wear new clothes, and all other desires, do not abide in the mind of one who
comes to know the subtle essence of the One Lord. || Pause || The mind and body
blossom forth in abundance, when one receives even a drop of this Nectar. I cannot
express His glory; I cannot describe His worth. || 2 || We cannot meet the Lord by
our own efforts, nor can we meet Him through service; He comes and meets us
spontaneously. One who is blessed by my Lord Master‟s Grace, practices the Teachings
of the Guru‟s Mantra. || 3 || He is merciful to the meek, always kind and
compassionate; He cherishes and nurtures all beings. The Lord is mingled with Nanak,
through and through; He cherishes him, like the mother her child. || 4 || 7 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has implanted the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within me. In the utter darkness of the wilderness, He
showed me the straight path. || 1 || The Lord of the universe, the Cherisher of the
world, He is my breath of life. Here and hereafter, he takes care of everything for me.
|| 1 || Pause || Meditating on Him in remembrance, I have found all treasures,
respect, greatness and perfect honor. Remembering His Name, millions of sins are
erased; all His devotees long for the dust of His feet. || 2 || If someone wishes for
the fulfillment of all his hopes and desires, he should serve the one supreme treasure.
He is the Supreme Lord God, infinite Lord and Master; meditating on Him in
remembrance, one is carried across. || 3 || I have found total peace and tranquility in
the Society of the Saints; my honor has been preserved. To gather in the Lord‟s wealth,
and to taste the food of the Lord‟s Name —
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 673 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Nanak has made this his feast. || 4 || 8 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: You have
made it your habit to practice those deeds which will bring you shame. You slander the
Saints, and you worship the faithless cynics; such are the corrupt ways you have
adopted. || 1 || Deluded by your emotional attachment to Maya, you love other
things, like the enchanted city of Hari-chandauree, or the green leaves of the forest —
such is your way of life. || 1 || Pause || Its body may be anointed with sandalwood
oil, but the donkey still loves to roll in the mud. He is not fond of the Ambrosial Nectar;
instead, he loves the poisonous drug of corruption. || 2 || The Saints are noble and
sublime; they are blessed with good fortune. They alone are pure and holy in this
world. The jewel of this human life is passing away uselessly, lost in exchange for mere
glass. || 3 || The sins and sorrows of uncounted incarnations run away, when the
Guru applies the healing ointment of spiritual wisdom to the eyes. In the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy, I have escaped from these troubles; Nanak loves the One
Lord. || 4 || 9 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: I carry the water, wave the fan, and
grind the corn for the Saints; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
With each and every breath, my mind remembers the Naam, the Name of the Lord; in
this way, it finds the treasure of peace. || 1 || Have pity on me, O my Lord and
Master. Bless me with such understanding, O my Lord and Master, that I may forever
and ever meditate on You. || 1 || Pause || By Your Grace, emotional attachment
and egotism are eradicated, and doubt is dispelled. The Lord, the embodiment of bliss,
is pervading and permeating in all; wherever I go, there I see Him. || 2 || You are
kind and compassionate, the treasure of mercy, the Purifier of sinners, Lord of the
world. I obtain millions of joys, comforts and kingdoms, if You inspire me to chant Your
Name with my mouth, even for an instant. || 3 || That alone is perfect chanting,
meditation, penance and devotional worship service, which is pleasing to God‟s Mind.
Chanting the Naam, all thirst and desire is satisfied; Nanak is satisfied and fulfilled. || 4
|| 10 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: She controls the three qualities and the four
directions of the world. She destroys sacrificial feasts, cleansing baths, penances and
sacred places of pilgrimage; what is this poor person to do? || 1 || I grasped God‟s
Support and Protection, and then I was emancipated. By the Grace of the Holy Saints, I
sang the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, and my sins and afflictions were taken
away. || 1 || Pause || She is not heard — she does not speak with a mouth; she is
not seen enticing mortals. She administers her intoxicating drug, and so confuses them;
thus she seems sweet to everyone‟s mind. || 2 || In each and every home, she has
implanted the sense of duality in mother, father, children, friends and siblings. Some
have more, and some have less; they fight and fight, to the death. || 3 || I am a
sacrifice to my True Guru, who has shown me this wondrous play. The world is being
consumed by this hidden fire, but Maya does not cling to the Lord‟s devotees. || 4 ||
By the Grace of the Saints, I have obtained supreme bliss, and all my bonds have been
broken. Nanak has obtained the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; having
earned his profits, he has now returned home. || 5 || 11 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: You are the Giver, O Lord, O Cherisher, my Master, my Husband Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 674 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Each and every moment, You cherish and nurture me; I am Your child, and I rely upon
You alone. || 1 || I have only one tongue — which of Your Glorious Virtues can I
describe? Unlimited, infinite Lord and Master — no one knows Your limits. || 1 ||
Pause || You destroy millions of my sins, and teach me in so many ways. I am so
ignorant — I understand nothing at all. Please honor Your innate nature, and save me!
|| 2 || I seek Your Sanctuary — You are my only hope. You are my companion, and
my best friend. Save me, O Merciful Saviour Lord; Nanak is the slave of Your home. ||
3 || 12 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Worship, fasting, ceremonial marks on one‟s
forehead, cleansing baths, generous donations to charities and self-mortification — the
Lord Master is not pleased with any of these rituals, no matter how sweetly one may
speak. || 1 || Chanting the Name of God, the mind is soothed and pacified. Everyone
searches for Him in different ways, but the search is so difficult, and He cannot be
found. || 1 || Pause || Chanting, deep meditation and penance, wandering over the
face of the earth, the performance of austerities with the arms stretched up to the sky
— the Lord is not pleased by any of these means, though one may follow the path of
Yogis and Jains. || 2 || The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord, and the Praises
of the Lord are priceless; he alone obtains them, whom the Lord blesses with His
Mercy. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak lives in the Love of
God; his life-night passes in peace. || 3 || 13 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Is
there anyone who can release me from my bondage, unite me with God, recite the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and make this mind steady and stable, so that it no longer
wanders around? || 1 || Do I have any such friend? I would give him all my property,
my soul and my heart; I would devote my consciousness to him. || 1 || Pause ||
Others‟ wealth, others‟ bodies, and the slander of others — do not attach your love to
them. Associate with the Saints, speak with the Saints, and keep your mind awake to
the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. || 2 || God is the treasure of virtue, kind and
compassionate, the source of all comfort. Nanak begs for the gift of Your Name; O Lord
of the world, love him, like the mother loves her child. || 3 || 14 || DHANAASAREE,
FIFTH MEHL: The Lord saves His Saints. One who wishes misfortune upon the Lord‟s
slaves, shall be destroyed by the Lord eventually. || 1 || Pause || He Himself is the
help and support of His humble servants; He defeats the slanderers, and chases them
away. Wandering around aimlessly, they die out there; they never return to their homes
again. || 1 || Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Destroyer of pain; he sings the
Glorious Praises of the infinite Lord forever. The faces of the slanderers are blackened
in the courts of this world, and the world beyond. || 2 || 15 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: Now, I contemplate and meditate on the Lord, the Saviour Lord. He purifies
sinners in an instant, and cures all diseases. || 1 || Pause || Talking with the Holy
Saints, my sexual desire, anger and greed have been eradicated. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 675 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Remembering, remembering the Perfect Lord in meditation, I have saved all my
companions. || 1 || The Mul Mantra, the Root Mantra, is the only cure for the mind; I
have installed faith in God in my mind. Nanak ever longs for the dust of the Lord‟s feet;
again and again, he is a sacrifice to the Lord. || 2 || 16 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: I have fallen in love with the Lord. My True Guru is always my help and
support; He has torn down the banner of pain. || 1 || Pause || Giving me His hand,
He has protected me as His own, and removed all my troubles. He has blackened the
faces of the slanderers, and He Himself has become the help and support of His humble
servant. || 1 || The True Lord and Master has become my Saviour; hugging me close
in His embrace, He has saved me. Nanak has become fearless, and he enjoys eternal
peace, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 2 || 17 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: Your Name is the medicine, O Merciful Lord. I am so miserable, I do not know
Your state; You Yourself cherish me, Lord. || 1 || Pause || Take pity on me, O my
Lord and Master, and remove the love of duality from within me. Break my bonds, and
take me as Your own, so that I may never come to lose. || 1 || Seeking Your
Sanctuary, I live, almighty and merciful Lord and Master. Twenty-four hours a day, I
worship God; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. || 2 || 18 ||
RAAG DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL:

O God, please save me! By myself, I cannot do anything, O my Lord and Master; by
Your Grace, please bless me with Your Name. || 1 || Pause || Family and worldly
affairs are an ocean of fire. Through doubt, emotional attachment and ignorance, we
are enveloped in darkness. || 1 || High and low, pleasure and pain. Hunger and thirst
are not satisfied. || 2 || The mind is engrossed in passion, and the disease of
corruption. The five thieves, the companions, are totally incorrigible. || 3 || The
beings and souls and wealth of the world are all Yours. O Nanak, know that the Lord is
always near at hand. || 4 || 1 || 19 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord and
Master destroys the pain of the poor; He preserves and protects the honor of His
servants. The Lord is the ship to carry us across; He is the treasure of virtue — pain
cannot touch Him. || 1 || In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate,
vibrate upon the Lord of the world. I cannot think of any other way; make this effort,
and make it in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. || Pause || In the beginning, and in the
end, there is none other than the perfect, merciful Lord. The cycle of birth and death is
ended, chanting the Lord‟s Name, and remembering the Lord Master in meditation. || 2
|| The Vedas, the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Lord‟s devotees contemplate Him;
liberation is attained in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and the darkness
of ignorance is dispelled. || 3 || The lotus feet of the Lord are the support of His
humble servants. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 676 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They are his only capital and investment. The True Lord is Nanak‟s strength, honor and
support; He alone is his protection. || 4 || 2 || 20 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL:
Wandering and roaming around, I met the Holy Perfect Guru, who has taught me. All
other devices did not work, so I meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 ||
For this reason, I sought the Protection and Support of my Lord, the Cherisher of the
Universe. I sought the Sanctuary of the Perfect Transcendent Lord, and all my
entanglements were dissolved. || Pause || Paradise, the earth, the nether regions of
the underworld, and the globe of the world — all are engrossed in Maya. To save your
soul, and liberate all your ancestors, meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 2
|| O Nanak, singing the Naam, the Name of the Immaculate Lord, all treasures are
obtained. Only that rare person, whom the Lord and Master blesses with His Grace,
comes to know this. || 3 || 3 || 21 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

You shall have to abandon the straw which you have collected. These entanglements
shall be of no use to you. You are in love with those things that will not go with you.
You think that your enemies are friends. || 1 || In such confusion, the world has gone
astray. The foolish mortal wastes this precious human life. || Pause || He does not
like to see Truth and righteousness. He is attached to falsehood and deception; they
seem sweet to him. He loves gifts, but he forgets the Giver. The wretched creature
does not even think of death. || 2 || He cries for the possessions of others. He
forfeits all the merits of his good deeds and religion. He does not understand the
Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, and so he continues coming and going in reincarnation.
He sins, and then regrets and repents. || 3 || Whatever pleases You, Lord, that alone
is acceptable. I am a sacrifice to Your Will. Poor Nanak is Your slave, Your humble
servant. Save me, O my Lord God Master! || 4 || 1 || 22 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: I am meek and poor; the Name of God is my only Support. The Name of the
Lord, Har, Har, is my occupation and earnings. I gather only the Lord‟s Name. It is
useful in both this world and the next. || 1 || Imbued with the Love of the Lord God‟s
Infinite Name, the Holy Saints sing the Glorious Praises of the One Lord, the Formless
Lord. || Pause || The Glory of the Holy Saints comes from their total humility. The
Saints realize that their greatness rests in the Praises of the Lord. Meditating on the
Lord of the Universe, the Saints are in bliss. The Saints find peace, and their anxieties
are dispelled. || 2 || Wherever the Holy Saints gather, there they sing the Praises of
the Lord, in music and poetry. In the Society of the Saints, there is bliss and peace.
They alone obtain this Society, upon whose foreheads such destiny is written. || 3 ||
With my palms pressed together, I offer my prayer. I wash their feet, and chant the
Praises of the Lord, the treasure of virtue. O God, merciful and compassionate, let me
remain in Your Presence. Nanak lives, in the dust of the Saints. || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 677 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
4 || 2 || 23 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: One who contemplates his Lord and
Master — why should he be afraid? The wretched self-willed manmukhs are ruined
through fear and dread. || 1 || Pause || The Divine Guru, my mother and father, is
over my head. His image brings prosperity; serving Him, we become pure. The One
Lord, the Immaculate Lord, is our capital. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, we are illumined and enlightened. || 1 || The Giver of all beings is totally
pervading everywhere. Millions of pains are removed by the Lord‟s Name. All the pains
of birth and death are taken away from the Gurmukh, within whose mind and body the
Lord dwells. || 2 || He alone, whom the Lord has attached to the hem of His robe,
obtains a place in the Court of the Lord. They alone are devotees, who are pleasing to
the True Lord. They are freed from the Messenger of Death. || 3 || True is the Lord,
and True is His Court. Who can contemplate and describe His value? He is within each
and every heart, the Support of all. Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints. || 4 || 3 ||
24 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL:

At home, and outside, I place my trust in You; You are always with Your humble
servant. Bestow Your Mercy, O my Beloved God, that I may chant the Lord‟s Name with
love. || 1 || God is the strength of His humble servants. Whatever You do, or cause to
be done, O Lord and Master, that outcome is acceptable to me. || Pause || The
Transcendent Lord is my honor; the Lord is my emancipation; the glorious sermon of
the Lord is my wealth. Slave Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord‟s feet; from the
Saints, he has learned this way of life. || 2 || 1 || 25 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL:
God has fulfilled all my desires. Holding me close in His embrace, the Guru has saved
me. He has saved me from burning in the ocean of fire, and now, no one calls it
impassible. || 1 || Those who have true faith in their minds, continually behold the
Glory of the Lord; they are forever happy and blissful. || Pause || I seek the
Sanctuary of the feet of the Perfect Transcendent Lord, the Searcher of hearts; I behold
Him ever-present. In His wisdom, the Lord has made Nanak His own; He has preserved
the roots of His devotees. || 2 || 2 || 26 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Wherever
I look, there I see Him present; He is never far away. He is all-pervading, everywhere;
O my mind, meditate on Him forever. || 1 || He alone is called your companion, who
will not be separated from you, here or hereafter. That pleasure, which passes away in
an instant, is trivial. || Pause || He cherishes us, and gives us sustenance; He does
not lack anything. With each and every breath, my God takes care of His creatures. ||
2 || God is undeceiveable, impenetrable and infinite; His form is lofty and exalted.
Chanting and meditating on the embodiment of wonder and beauty, His humble
servants are in bliss. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 678 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Bless me with such understanding, O Merciful Lord God, that I might remember You.
Nanak begs God for the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints. || 4 || 3 || 27 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The One who sent you, has now recalled you; return to
your home now in peace and pleasure. In bliss and ecstasy, sing His Glorious Praises;
by this celestial tune, you shall acquire your everlasting kingdom. || 1 || Come back
to your home, O my friend. The Lord Himself has eliminated your enemies, and your
misfortunes are past. || Pause || God, the Creator Lord, has glorified you, and your
running and rushing around has ended. In your home, there is rejoicing; the musical
instruments continually play, and your Husband Lord has exalted you. || 2 || Remain
firm and steady, and do not ever waver; take the Guru‟s Word as your Support. You
shall be applauded and congratulated all over the world, and your face shall be radiant
in the Court of the Lord. || 3 || All beings belong to Him; He Himself transforms
them, and He Himself becomes their help and support. The Creator Lord has worked a
wondrous miracle; O Nanak, His glorious greatness is true. || 4 || 4 || 28 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, SIXTH HOUSE:

Listen, O Dear Beloved Saints, to my prayer. Without the Lord, no one is liberated. ||
Pause || O mind, do only deeds of purity; the Lord is the only boat to carry you
across. Other entanglements shall be of no use to you. True living is serving the Divine,
Supreme Lord God; the Guru has imparted this teaching to me. || 1 || Do not fall in
love with trivial things; in the end, they shall not go along with you. Worship and adore
the Lord with your mind and body, O Beloved Saint of the Lord; in the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy, you shall be released from bondage. || 2 || In your heart,
hold fast to the Sanctuary of the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord God; do not place your
hopes in any other support. He alone is a devotee, spiritually wise, a meditator, and a
penitent, O Nanak, who is blessed by the Lord‟s Mercy. || 3 || 1 || 29 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: O my dear beloved, it is good, it is better, it is best, to
ask for the Lord‟s Name. Behold, with your eyes wide-open, and listen to the Words of
the Holy Saints; enshrine in your consciousness the Lord of Life — remember that all
must die. || Pause || The application of sandalwood oil, the enjoyment of pleasures
and the practice of many corrupt sins — look upon all of these as insipid and worthless.
The Name of the Lord of the Universe alone is sublime; so say the Holy Saints. You
claim that your body and wealth are your own; you do not chant the Lord‟s Name even
for an instant. Look and see, that none of your possessions or riches shall go along with
you. || 1 || One who has good karma, grasps the Protection of the hem of the Saint‟s
robe; in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Messenger of Death cannot
threaten him. I have obtained the supreme treasure, and my egotism has been
eradicated; Nanak‟s mind is attached to the One Formless Lord. || 2 || 2 || 30 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 679 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, SEVENTH HOUSE:

Meditate in remembrance on the One Lord; meditate in remembrance on the One Lord;
meditate in remembrance on the One Lord, O my Beloved. He shall save you from
strife, suffering, greed, attachment, and the most terrifying world-ocean. || Pause ||
With each and every breath, each and every instant, day and night, dwell upon Him. In
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate on Him fearlessly, and enshrine
the treasure of His Name in your mind. || 1 || Worship His lotus feet, and
contemplate the glorious virtues of the Lord of the Universe. O Nanak, the dust of the
feet of the Holy shall bless you with pleasure and peace. || 2 || 1 || 31 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, EIGHTH HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Remembering, remembering, remembering Him in meditation, I find peace; with each
and every breath, I dwell upon Him. In this world, and in the world beyond, He is with
me, as my help and support; wherever I go, He protects me. || 1 || The Guru‟s Word
abides with my soul. It does not sink in water; thieves cannot steal it, and fire cannot
burn it. || 1 || Pause || It is like wealth to the poor, a cane for the blind, and
mother‟s milk for the infant. In the ocean of the world, I have found the boat of the
Lord; the Merciful Lord has bestowed His Mercy upon Nanak. || 2 || 1 || 32 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord of the Universe has become kind and merciful;
His Ambrosial Nectar permeates my heart. The nine treasures, riches and the
miraculous spiritual powers of the Siddhas cling to the feet of the Lord‟s humble
servant. || 1 || The Saints are in ecstasy everywhere. Within the home, and outside
as well, the Lord and Master of His devotees is totally pervading and permeating
everywhere. || 1 || Pause || No one can equal one who has the Lord of the Universe
on his side. The fear of the Messenger of Death is eradicated, remembering Him in
meditation; Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 2 || 2 || 33 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The rich man gazes upon his riches, and is proud of
himself; the landlord takes pride in his lands. The king believes that the whole kingdom
belongs to him; in the same way, the humble servant of the Lord looks upon the
support of his Lord and Master. || 1 || When one considers the Lord to be his only
support, then the Lord uses His power to help him; this power cannot be defeated. || 1
|| Pause || Renouncing all others, I have sought the Support of the One Lord; I have
come to Him, pleading, “Save me, save me!” By the kindness and the Grace of the
Saints, my mind has been purified; Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 2 ||
3 || 34 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: He alone is called a warrior, who is attached
to the Lord‟s Love in this age. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 680 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Through the Perfect True Guru, he conquers his own soul, and then everything comes
under his control. || 1 || Sing the Praises of the Lord and Master, with the love of
your soul. Those who seek His Sanctuary, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, are blended with the Lord in celestial peace. || 1 || Pause || The feet of the
Lord‟s humble servant abide in my heart; with them, my body is made pure. O treasure
of mercy, please bless Nanak with the dust of the feet of Your humble servants; this
alone brings peace. || 2 || 4 || 35 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: People try to
deceive others, but the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything. They
commit sins, and then deny them, while they pretend to be in Nirvaanaa. || 1 || They
believe that You are far away, but You, O God, are near at hand. Looking around, this
way and that, the greedy people come and go. || Pause || As long as the doubts of
the mind are not removed, liberation is not found. Says Nanak, he alone is a Saint, a
devotee, and a humble servant of the Lord, to whom the Lord and Master is merciful.
|| 2 || 5 || 36 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: My Guru gives the Naam, the Name
of the Lord, to those who have such karma written on their foreheads. He implants the
Naam, and inspires us to chant the Naam; this is Dharma, true religion, in this world. ||
1 || The Naam is the glory and greatness of the Lord‟s humble servant. The Naam is
his salvation, and the Naam is his honor; he accepts whatever comes to pass. || 1 ||
Pause || That humble servant, who has the Naam as his wealth, is the perfect
banker. The Naam is his occupation, O Nanak, and his only support; the Naam is the
profit he earns. || 2 || 6 || 37 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: My eyes have been
purified, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, and touching my
forehead to the dust of His feet. With joy and happiness, I sing the Glorious Praises of
my Lord and Master; the Lord of the World abides within my heart. || 1 || You are my
Merciful Protector, Lord. O beautiful, wise, infinite Father God, be Merciful to me, God.
|| 1 || Pause || O Lord of supreme ecstasy and blissful form, Your Word is so
beautiful, so drenched with Nectar. With the Lord‟s lotus feet enshrined in his heart,
Nanak has tied the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, to the hem of his robe. || 2 ||
7 || 38 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: In His own way, He provides us with our
food; in His own way, He plays with us. He blesses us with all comforts, enjoyments
and delicacies, and he permeates our minds. || 1 || Our Father is the Lord of the
World, the Merciful Lord. Just as the mother protects her children, God nurtures and
cares for us. || 1 || Pause || You are my friend and companion, the Master of all
excellences, O eternal and permanent Divine Lord. Here, there and everywhere, You
are pervading; please, bless Nanak to serve the Saints. || 2 || 8 || 39 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The Saints are kind and compassionate; they burn away
their sexual desire, anger and corruption. My power, wealth, youth, body and soul are a
sacrifice to them. || 1 || With my mind and body, I love the Lord‟s Name. With peace,
poise, pleasure and joy, He has carried me across the terrifying world-ocean. || Pause
|| 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 681 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Blessed is that place, and blessed is that house, in which the Saints dwell. Fulfill this
desire of servant Nanak, O Lord Master, that he may bow in reverence to Your
devotees. || 2 || 9 || 40 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: He has saved me from the
awful power of Maya, by attaching me to His feet. He gave my mind the Mantra of the
Naam, the Name of the One Lord, which shall never perish or leave me. || 1 || The
Perfect True Guru has given this gift. He has blessed me with the Kirtan of the Praises
of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and I am emancipated. || Pause || My God has
made me His own, and saved the honor of His devotee. Nanak has grasped the feet of
his God, and has found peace, day and night. || 2 || 10 || 41 || DHANAASAREE,
FIFTH MEHL: Stealing the property of others, acting in greed, lying and slandering — in
these ways, he passes his life. He places his hopes in false mirages, believing them to
be sweet; this is the support he installs in his mind. || 1 || The faithless cynic passes
his life uselessly. He is like the mouse, gnawing away at the pile of paper, making it
useless to the poor wretch. || Pause || Have mercy on me, O Supreme Lord God,
and release me from these bonds. The blind are sinking, O Nanak; God saves them,
uniting them with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. || 2 || 11 || 42 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Remembering, remembering God, the Lord Master in
meditation, my body, mind and heart are cooled and soothed. The Supreme Lord God is
my beauty, pleasure, peace, wealth, soul and social status. || 1 || My tongue is
intoxicated with the Lord, the source of nectar. I am in love, in love with the Lord‟s
lotus feet, the treasure of riches. || Pause || I am His — He has saved me; this is
God‟s perfect way. The Giver of peace has blended Nanak with Himself; the Lord has
preserved his honor. || 2 || 12 || 43 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: All demons
and enemies are eradicated by You, Lord; Your glory is manifest and radiant. Whoever
harms Your devotees, You destroy in an instant. || 1 || I look to You continually,
Lord. O Lord, Destroyer of ego, please, be the helper and companion of Your slaves;
take my hand, and save me, O my Friend! || Pause || My Lord and Master has heard
my prayer, and given me His protection. Nanak is in ecstasy, and his pains are gone; he
meditates on the Lord, forever and ever. || 2 || 13 || 44 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: He has extended His power in all four directions, and placed His hand upon my
head. Gazing upon me with his Eye of Mercy, He has dispelled the pains of His slave. ||
1 || The Guru, the Lord of the Universe, has saved the Lord‟s humble servant.
Hugging me close in His embrace, the merciful, forgiving Lord has erased all my sins.
|| Pause || Whatever I ask for from my Lord and Master, he gives that to me.
Whatever the Lord‟s slave Nanak utters with his mouth, proves to be true, here and
hereafter. || 2 || 14 || 45 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 682 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: He does not let His devotees see the difficult times; this
is His innate nature. Giving His hand, He protects His devotee; with each and every
breath, He cherishes him. || 1 || My consciousness remains attached to God. In the
beginning, and in the end, God is always my helper and companion; blessed is my
friend. || Pause || My mind is delighted, gazing upon the marvellous, glorious
greatness of the Lord and Master. Remembering, remembering the Lord in meditation,
Nanak is in ecstasy; God, in His perfection, has protected and preserved his honor. || 2
|| 15 || 46 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: One who forgets the Lord of life, the
Great Giver — know that he is most unfortunate. One whose mind is in love with the
Lord‟s lotus feet, obtains the pool of ambrosial nectar. || 1 || Your humble servant
awakes in the Love of the Lord‟s Name. All laziness has departed from his body, and his
mind is attached to the Beloved Lord. || Pause || Wherever I look, the Lord is there;
He is the string, upon which all hearts are strung. Drinking in the water of the Naam,
servant Nanak has renounced all other loves. || 2 || 16 || 47 || DHANAASAREE,
FIFTH MEHL: All the affairs of the Lord‟s humble servant are perfectly resolved. In the
utterly poisonous Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord preserves and protects his honor. ||
1 || Pause || Remembering, remembering God, his Lord and Master in meditation,
the Messenger of Death does not approach him. Liberation and heaven are found in the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; his humble servant finds the home of the
Lord. || 1 || The Lord‟s lotus feet are the treasure of His humble servant; in them, he
finds millions of pleasures and comforts. He remembers the Lord God in meditation, day
and night; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to him. || 2 || 17 || 48 || DHANAASAREE,
FIFTH MEHL: I beg for one gift only from the Lord. May all my desires be fulfilled,
meditating on, and remembering Your Name, O Lord. || 1 || Pause || May Your feet
abide within my heart, and may I find the Society of the Saints. May my mind not be
afflicted by the fire of sorrow; may I sing Your Glorious Praises, twenty-four hours a
day. || 1 || May I serve the Lord in my childhood and youth, and meditate on God in
my middle and old age. O Nanak, one who is imbued with the Love of the Transcendent
Lord, is not reincarnated again to die. || 2 || 18 || 49 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: I beg only from the Lord for all things. I would hesitate to beg from other
people. Remembering God in meditation, liberation is obtained. || 1 || Pause || I
have studied with the silent sages, and carefully read the Simritees, the Puraanas and
the Vedas; they all proclaim that, by serving the Lord, the ocean of mercy, Truth is
obtained, and both this world and the next are embellished. || 1 || All other rituals
and customs are useless, without remembering the Lord in meditation. O Nanak, the
fear of birth and death has been removed; meeting the Holy Saint, sorrow is dispelled.
|| 2 || 19 || 50 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: Desire is quenched, through the
Lord‟s Name. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 683 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Great peace and contentment come through the Guru‟s Word, and one‟s meditation is
perfectly focused upon God. || 1 || Pause || Please shower Your Mercy upon me,
and permit me to ignore the great enticements of Maya, O Lord, Merciful to the meek.
Give me Your Name — chanting it, I live; please bring the efforts of Your slave to
fruition. || 1 || All desires, power, pleasure, joy and lasting bliss, are found by
chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and singing the Kirtan of His Praises. That
humble servant of the Lord, who has such karma pre-ordained by the Creator Lord, O
Nanak — his efforts are brought to perfect fruition. || 2 || 20 || 51 || DHANAASAREE,
FIFTH MEHL: The Supreme Lord God takes care of His humble servant. The slanderers
are not allowed to stay; they are pulled out by their roots, like useless weeds. || 1 ||
Pause || Wherever I look, there I see my Lord and Master; no one can harm me.
Whoever shows disrespect to the Lord‟s humble servant, is instantly reduced to ashes.
|| 1 || The Creator Lord has become my protector; He has no end or limitation. O
Nanak, God has protected and saved His slaves; He has driven out and destroyed the
slanderers. || 2 || 21 || 52 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, NINTH HOUSE, PARTAAL:

O Lord, I seek the Sanctuary of Your feet; Lord of the Universe, Destroyer of pain,
please bless Your slave with Your Name. Be Merciful, God, and bless me with Your
Glance of Grace; take my arm and save me — pull me up out of this pit! || Pause ||
He is blinded by sexual desire and anger, bound by Maya; his body and clothes are
filled with countless sins. Without God, there is no other protector; help me to chant
Your Name, Almighty Warrior, Sheltering Lord. || 1 || Redeemer of sinners, Saving
Grace of all beings and creatures, even those who recite the Vedas have not found Your
limit. God is the ocean of virtue and peace, the source of jewels; Nanak sings the
Praises of the Lover of His devotees. || 2 || 1 || 53 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL:
Peace in this world, peace in the next world and peace forever, remembering Him in
meditation. Chant forever the Name of the Lord of the Universe. The sins of past lives
are erased, by joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; new life is infused
into the dead. || 1 || Pause || In power, youth and Maya, the Lord is forgotten; this
is the greatest tragedy — so say the spiritual sages. Hope and desire to sing the Kirtan
of the Lord‟s Praises — this is the treasure of the most fortunate devotees. || 1 || O
Lord of Sanctuary, all-powerful, imperceptible and unfathomable — Your Name is the
Purifier of sinners. The Inner-knower, the Lord and Master of Nanak is totally pervading
and permeating everywhere; He is my Lord and Master. || 2 || 2 || 54 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, TWELFTH HOUSE:

I bow in reverence to the Lord, I bow in reverence. I sing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, my King. || Pause || By great good fortune, one meets the Divine Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 684 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Millions of sins are erased by serving the Lord. || 1 || One whose mind is imbued with
the Lord‟s lotus feet is not afflicted by the fire of sorrow. || 2 || He crosses over the
world-ocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. He chants the Name of the
Fearless Lord, and is imbued with the Lord‟s Love. || 3 || One who does not steal the
wealth of others, who does not commit evil deeds or sinful acts — the Messenger of
Death does not even approach him. || 4 || God Himself quenches the fires of desire.
O Nanak, in God‟s Sanctuary, one is saved. || 5 || 1 || 55 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH
MEHL: I am satisfied and satiated, eating the food of Truth. With my mind, body and
tongue, I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Life, spiritual life, is in
the Lord. Spiritual life consists of chanting the Lord‟s Name in the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy. || 1 || Pause || He is dressed in robes of all sorts, if he sings
the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Glorious Praises, day and night. || 2 || He rides upon
elephants, chariots and horses, if he sees the Lord‟s Path within his own heart. || 3 ||
Meditating on the Lord‟s Feet, deep within his mind and body, slave Nanak has found
the Lord, the treasure of peace. || 4 || 2 || 56 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The
Guru‟s feet emancipate the soul. They carry it across the world-ocean in an instant. ||
1 || Pause || Some love rituals, and some bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. The
Lord‟s slaves meditate on His Name. || 1 || The Lord Master is the Breaker of bonds.
Servant Nanak meditates in remembrance on the Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher
of hearts. || 2 || 3 || 57 || DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL: The lifestyle of Your slave
is so pure, that nothing can break his love for You. || 1 || Pause || He is more dear
to me than my soul, my breath of life, my mind and my wealth. The Lord is the Giver,
the Restrainer of the ego. || 1 || I am in love with the Lord‟s lotus feet. This alone is
Nanak‟s prayer. || 2 || 4 || 58 ||

DHANAASAREE, NINTH MEHL:
Why do you go looking for Him in the forest? Although he is unattached, he dwells
everywhere. He is always with you as your companion. || 1 || Pause || Like the
fragrance which remains in the flower, and like the reflection in the mirror, the Lord
dwells deep within; search for Him within your own heart, O Siblings of Destiny. || 1 ||
Outside and inside, know that there is only the One Lord; the Guru has imparted this
wisdom to me. O servant Nanak, without knowing one‟s own self, the moss of doubt is
not removed. || 2 || 1 || DHANAASAREE, NINTH MEHL: O Holy people, this world is
deluded by doubt. It has forsaken the meditative remembrance of the Lord‟s Name, and
sold itself out to Maya. || 1 || Pause || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 685 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Mother, father, siblings, children and spouse — he is entangled in their love. In the
pride of youth, wealth and glory, day and night, he remains intoxicated. || 1 || God is
merciful to the meek, and forever the Destroyer of pain, but the mortal does not center
his mind on Him. O servant Nanak, among millions, only a rare few, as Gurmukh,
realize God. || 2 || 2 || DHANAASAREE, NINTH MEHL: That Yogi does not know the
way. Understand that his heart is filled with greed, emotional attachment, Maya and
egotism. || 1 || Pause || One who does not slander or praise others, who looks upon
gold and iron alike, who is free from pleasure and pain — he alone is called a true Yogi.
|| 1 || The restless mind wanders in the ten directions — it needs to be pacified and
restrained. Says Nanak, whoever knows this technique is judged to be liberated. || 2 ||
3 || DHANAASAREE, NINTH MEHL: Now, what efforts should I make? How can I
dispel the anxieties of my mind? How can I cross over the terrifying world-ocean? || 1
|| Pause || Obtaining this human incarnation, I have done no good deeds; this
makes me very afraid! In thought, word and deed, I have not sung the Lord‟s Praises;
this thought worries my mind. || 1 || I listened to the Guru‟s Teachings, but spiritual
wisdom did not well up within me; like a beast, I fill my belly. Says Nanak, O God,
please confirm Your Law of Grace; for only then can I, the sinner, be saved. || 2 || 4 ||
9 || 9 || 13 || 58 || 4 || 93 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

The Guru is the ocean, filled with pearls. The Saints gather in the Ambrosial Nectar;
they do not go far away from there. They taste the subtle essence of the Lord; they are
loved by God. Within this pool, the swans find their Lord, the Lord of their souls. || 1 ||
What can the poor crane accomplish by bathing in the mud puddle? It sinks into the
mire, and its filth is not washed away. || 1 || Pause || After careful deliberation, the
thoughtful person takes a step. Forsaking duality, he becomes a devotee of the
Formless Lord. He obtains the treasure of liberation, and enjoys the sublime essence of
the Lord. His comings and goings end, and the Guru protects him. || 2 || The swan
do not leave this pool. In loving devotional worship, they merge in the Celestial Lord.
The swans are in the pool, and the pool is in the swans. They speak the Unspoken
Speech, and they honor and revere the Guru‟s Word. || 3 || The Yogi, the Primal
Lord, sits within the celestial sphere of deepest Samaadhi. He is not male, and He is not
female; how can anyone describe Him? The three worlds continue to center their
attention on His Light. The silent sages and the Yogic masters seek the Sanctuary of the
True Lord. || 4 || The Lord is the source of bliss, the support of the helpless. The
Gurmukhs worship and contemplate the Celestial Lord. God is the Lover of His
devotees, the Destroyer of fear. Subduing ego, one meets the Lord, and places his feet
on the Path. || 5 || He makes many efforts, but still, the Messenger of Death tortures
him. Destined only to die, he comes into the world. 

He wastes this precious human life through duality. He does not know his own self, and
trapped by doubts, he cries out in pain. || 6 || Speak, read and hear of the One Lord.
The Support of the earth shall bless you with courage, righteousness and protection.
Chastity, purity and self-restraint are infused into the heart, when one centers his mind
in the fourth state. || 7 || They are immaculate and true, and filth does not stick to
them. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, their doubt and fear depart. The form
and personality of the Primal Lord are incomparably beautiful. Nanak begs for the Lord,
the Embodiment of Truth. || 8 || 1 || DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL: That union with
the Lord is acceptable, which is united in intuitive poise. Thereafter, one does not die,
and does not come and go in reincarnation. The Lord‟s slave is in the Lord, and the Lord
is in His slave. Wherever I look, I see none other than the Lord. || 1 || The Gurmukhs
worship the Lord, and find His celestial home. Without meeting the Guru, they die, and
come and go in reincarnation. || 1 || Pause || So make Him your Guru, who
implants the Truth within you, who leads you to speak the Unspoken Speech, and who
merges you in the Word of the Shabad. God‟s people have no other work to do; they
love the True Lord and Master, and they love the Truth. || 2 || The mind is in the
body, and the True Lord is in the mind. Merging into the True Lord, one is absorbed
into Truth. God‟s servant bows at His feet. Meeting the True Guru, one meets with the
Lord. || 3 || He Himself watches over us, and He Himself makes us see. He is not
pleased by stubborn-mindedness, nor by various religious robes. He fashioned the
body-vessels, and infused the Ambrosial Nectar into them; God‟s Mind is pleased only
by loving devotional worship. || 4 || Reading and studying, one becomes confused,
and suffers punishment. By great cleverness, one is consigned to coming and going in
reincarnation. One who chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and eats the food of
the Fear of God becomes Gurmukh, the Lord‟s servant, and remains absorbed in the
Lord. || 5 || He worships stones, dwells at sacred shrines of pilgrimage and in the
jungles, wanders, roams around and becomes a renunciate. But his mind is still filthy —
how can he become pure? One who meets the True Lord obtains honor. || 6 || One
who embodies good conduct and contemplative meditation, his mind abides in intuitive
poise and contentment, since the beginning of time, and throughout the ages. In the
twinkling of an eye, he saves millions. Have mercy on me, O my Beloved, and let me
meet the Guru. || 7 || Unto whom, O God, should I praise You? Without You, there is
no other at all. As it pleases You, keep me under Your Will. Nanak, with intuitive poise
and natural love, sings Your Glorious Praises. || 8 || 2 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, SIXTH HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

Whoever is born into the world, is entangled in it; human birth is obtained only by good
destiny. I look to Your support, O Holy Saint; give me Your hand, and protect me. By
Your Grace, let me meet the Lord, my King. || 1 || I wandered through countless
incarnations, but I did not find stability anywhere. I serve the Guru, and I fall at His
feet, praying, “O Dear Lord of the Universe, please, show me the way.” || 1 || Pause
|| I have tried so many things to acquire the wealth of Maya, and to cherish it in my
mind; 

I have passed my life constantly crying out, “Mine, mine!” Is there any such Saint, who
would meet with me, take away my anxiety, and lead me to enshrine love for my Lord
and Master. || 2 || I have read all the Vedas, and yet the sense of separation in my
mind still has not been removed; the five thieves of my house are not quieted, even for
an instant. Is there any devotee, who is unattached to Maya, who may irrigate my mind
with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the One Lord? || 3 || In spite of the many
places of pilgrimage for people to bathe in, their minds are still stained by their
stubborn ego; the Lord Master is not pleased by this at all. When will I find the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy? There, I shall be always in the ecstasy of the Lord,
Har, Har, and my mind shall take its cleansing bath in the healing ointment of spiritual
wisdom. || 4 || I have followed the four stages of life, but my mind is not satisfied; I
wash my body, but it is totally lacking in understanding. If only I could meet some
devotee of the Supreme Lord God, imbued with the Lord‟s Love, who could eradicate
the filthy evil-mindedness from my mind. || 5 || One who is attached to religious
rituals, does not love the Lord, even for an instant; he is filled with pride, and he is of
no account. One who meets with the rewarding personality of the Guru, continually
sings the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. By Guru‟s Grace, such a rare one beholds the Lord
with his eyes. || 6 || One who acts through stubbornness is of no account at all; like a
crane, he pretends to meditate, but he is still stuck in Maya. Is there any such Giver of
peace, who can recite to me the sermon of God? Meeting him, I would be emancipated.
|| 7 || When the Lord, my King, is totally pleased with me, He will break the bonds of
Maya for me; my mind is imbued with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. I am in ecstasy,
forever and ever, meeting the Fearless Lord, the Lord of the Universe. Falling at the
Lord‟s Feet, Nanak has found peace. || 8 || My Yatra, my life pilgrimage, has become
fruitful, fruitful, fruitful. My comings and goings have ended, since I met the Holy Saint.
|| 1 || Second Pause || 1 || 3 ||
DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL, CHHANT:

Why should I bathe at sacred shrines of pilgrimage? The Naam, the Name of the Lord,
is the sacred shrine of pilgrimage. My sacred shrine of pilgrimage is spiritual wisdom
within, and contemplation on the Word of the Shabad. The spiritual wisdom given by
the Guru is the True sacred shrine of pilgrimage, where the ten festivals are always
observed. I constantly beg for the Name of the Lord; grant it to me, O God, Sustainer of
the world. The world is sick, and the Naam is the medicine to cure it; without the True
Lord, filth sticks to it. The Guru‟s Word is immaculate and pure; it radiates a steady
Light. Constantly bathe in such a true shrine of pilgrimage. || 1 || Filth does not stick
to the true ones; what filth do they have to wash off? If one strings a garland of virtues
for oneself, what is there to cry for? One who conquers his own self through
contemplation is saved, and saves others as well; he does not come to be born again.
The supreme meditator is Himself the philosopher‟s stone, which transforms lead into
gold. The true man is pleasing to the True Lord. He is in ecstasy, truly happy, night and
day; his sorrows and sins are taken away. He finds the True Name, and beholds the
Guru; with the True Name in his mind, no filth sticks to him. || 2 || 

O friend, association with the Holy is the perfect cleansing bath. The singer who sings
the Lord‟s Praises is adorned with the Word of the Shabad. Worship the True Lord, and
believe in the True Guru; this brings the merit of making donations to charity, kindness
and compassion. The soul-bride who loves to be with her Husband Lord bathes at the
Triveni, the sacred place where the Ganges, Jamuna and Saraswaati Rivers converge,
the Truest of the True. Worship and adore the One Creator, the True Lord, who
constantly gives, whose gifts continually increase. Salvation is attained by associating
with the Society of the Saints, O friend; granting His Grace, God unites us in His Union.
|| 3 || Everyone speaks and talks; how great should I say He is? I am foolish, lowly
and ignorant; it is only through the Guru‟s Teachings that I understand. True are the
Teachings of the Guru. His Words are Ambrosial Nectar; my mind is pleased and
appeased by them. Loaded down with corruption and sin, people depart, and then come
back again; the True Shabad is found through my Guru. There is no end to the treasure
of devotion; the Lord is pervading everywhere. Nanak utters this true prayer; one who
purifies his mind is True. || 4 || 1 || DHANAASAREE, FIRST MEHL: I live by Your
Name; my mind is in ecstasy, Lord. True is the Name of the True Lord. Glorious are the
Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Infinite is the spiritual wisdom imparted by the
Guru. The Creator Lord who created, shall also destroy. The call of death is sent out by
the Lord‟s Command; no one can challenge it. He Himself creates, and watches; His
written command is above each and every head. He Himself imparts understanding and
awareness. O Nanak, the Lord Master is inaccessible and unfathomable; I live by His
True Name. || 1 || No one can compare to You, Lord; all come and go. By Your
Command, the account is settled, and doubt is dispelled. The Guru dispels doubt, and
makes us speak the Unspoken Speech; the true ones are absorbed into Truth. He
Himself creates, and He Himself destroys; I accept the Command of the Commander
Lord. True greatness comes from the Guru; You alone are the mind‟s companion in the
end. O Nanak, there is no other than the Lord and Master; greatness comes from Your
Name. || 2 || You are the True Creator Lord, the unknowable Maker. There is only
the One Lord and Master, but there are two paths, by which conflict increases. All follow
these two paths, by the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command; the world is born, only to die.
Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mortal has no friend at all; he carries
loads of sin on his head. By the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, he comes, but he does
not understand this Hukam; the Lord‟s Hukam is the Embellisher. O Nanak, through the
Shabad, the Word of the Lord and Master, the True Creator Lord is realized. || 3 ||
Your devotees look beautiful in Your Court, embellished with the Shabad. They chant
the Ambrosial Word of His Bani, savoring it with their tongues. Savoring it with their
tongues, they thirst for the Naam; they are a sacrifice to the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. Touching the philosopher‟s stone, they become the philosopher‟s stone, which
transforms lead into gold; O Lord, they become pleasing to your mind. They attain the
immortal status and eradicate their self-conceit; how rare is that person, who
contemplates spiritual wisdom. O Nanak, the devotees look beautiful in the Court of the
True Lord; they are dealers in the Truth. || 4 || I am hungry and thirsty for wealth;
how will I be able to go to the Lord‟s Court? 

I shall go and ask the True Guru, and meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I
meditate on the True Name, chant the True Name, and as Gurmukh, I realize the True
Name. Night and day, I chant the Name of the merciful, immaculate Lord, the Master of
the poor. The Primal Lord has ordained the tasks to be done; self-conceit is overcome,
and the mind is subdued. O Nanak, the Naam is the sweetest essence; through the
Naam, thirst and desire are stilled. || 5 || 2 || DHANAASAREE, CHHANT, FIRST
MEHL: Your Husband Lord is with you, O deluded soul-bride, but you do are not aware
of Him. Your destiny is written on your forehead, according to your past actions. This
inscription of past deeds cannot be erased; what do I know about what will happen?
You have not adopted a virtuous lifestyle, and you are not attuned to the Lord‟s Love;
you sit there, crying over your past misdeeds.Wealth and youth are like the shade of
the bitter swallow-wort plant; you are growing old, and your days are coming to their
end. O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you shall end up as a
discarded, divorced bride; your own falsehood shall separate you from the Lord. || 1 ||
You have drowned, and your house is ruined; walk in the Way of the Guru‟s Will.
Meditate on the True Name, and you shall find peace in the Mansion of the Lord‟s
Presence. Meditate on the Lord‟s Name, and you shall find peace; your stay in this
world shall last only four days. Sit in the home of your own being, and you shall find
Truth; night and day, be with your Beloved. Without loving devotion, you cannot dwell
in your own home — listen, everyone! O Nanak, she is happy, and she obtains her
Husband Lord, if she is attuned to the True Name. || 2 || If the soul-bride is pleasing
to her Husband Lord, then the Husband Lord will love His bride. Imbued with the love
of her Beloved, she contemplates the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. She contemplates the
Guru‟s Shabads, and her Husband Lord loves her; in deep humility, she worships Him in
loving devotion. She burns away her emotional attachment to Maya, and in love, she
loves her Beloved. She is imbued and drenched with the Love of the True Lord; she has
become beautiful, by conquering her mind. O Nanak, the happy soul-bride abides in
Truth; she loves to love her Husband Lord. || 3 || The soul-bride looks so beautiful in
the home of her Husband Lord, if she is pleasing to Him. It is of no use at all to speak
false words. If she speaks false, it is of no use to her, and she does not see her
Husband Lord with her eyes. Worthless, forgotten and abandoned by her Husband Lord,
she passes her life-night without her Lord and Master. Such a wife does not believe in
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; she is caught in the net of the world, and does not
obtain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. O Nanak, if she understands her own self,
then, as Gurmukh, she merges in celestial peace. || 4 || Blessed is that soul-bride,
who knows her Husband Lord. Without the Naam, she is false, and her actions are false
as well. Devotional worship of the Lord is beautiful; the True Lord loves it. So immerse
yourself in loving devotional worship of God. My Husband Lord is playful and innocent;
imbued with His Love, I enjoy Him. She blossoms forth through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad; she ravishes her Husband Lord, and obtains the most noble reward. O Nanak,
in Truth, she obtains glory; in her Husband‟s home, the soul-bride looks beautiful. || 5
|| 3 || 


DHANAASAREE, CHHANT, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

When the Dear Lord grants His Grace, one meditates on the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. Meeting the True Guru, through loving faith and devotion, one intuitively sings the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. Singing His Glorious Praises continually, night and day, one
blossoms forth, when it is pleasing to the True Lord. Egotism, self-conceit and Maya are
forsaken, and he is intuitively absorbed into the Naam. The Creator Himself acts; when
He gives, then we receive. When the Dear Lord grants His Grace, we meditate on the
Naam. || 1 || Deep within, I feel true love for the Perfect True Guru. I serve Him day
and night; I never forget Him. I never forget Him; I remember Him night and day.
When I chant the Naam, then I live. With my ears, I hear about Him, and my mind is
satisfied. As Gurmukh, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. If He bestows His Glance of
Grace, then I shall meet the True Guru; my discriminating intellect would contemplate
Him, night and day. Deep within, I feel true love for the Perfect True Guru. || 2 || By
great good fortune, one joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; then, one comes
to savor the subtle essence of the Lord. Night and day, he remains lovingly focused on
the Lord; he merges in celestial peace. Merging in celestial peace, he becomes pleasing
to the Lord‟s Mind; he remains forever unattached and untouched. He receives honor in
this world and the next, lovingly focused on the Lord‟s Name. He is liberated from both
pleasure and pain; he is pleased by whatever God does. By great good fortune, one
joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and then, one comes to savor the subtle
essence of the Lord. || 3 || In the love of duality, there is pain and suffering; the
Messenger of Death eyes the self-willed manmukhs. They cry and howl, day and night,
caught by the pain of Maya. Caught by the pain of Maya, provoked by his ego, he
passes his life crying out, “Mine, mine!”. He does not remember God, the Giver, and in
the end, he departs regretting and repenting. Without the Name, nothing shall go along
with him; not his children, spouse or the enticements of Maya. In the love of duality,
there is pain and suffering; the Messenger of Death eyes the self-willed manmukhs. ||
4 || Granting His Grace, the Lord has merged me with Himself; I have found the
Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. I remain standing with my palms pressed together; I
have become pleasing to God‟s Mind. When one is pleasing to God‟s Mind, then he
merges in the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command; surrendering to His Hukam, he finds
peace. Night and day, he chants the Lord‟s Name, day and night; intuitively, naturally,
he meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Through the Naam, the glorious
greatness of the Naam is obtained; the Naam is pleasing to Nanak‟s mind. Granting His
Grace, the Lord has merged me with Himself; I have found the Mansion of the Lord‟s
Presence. || 5 || 1 || 



DHANAASAREE, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT:

The True Guru is merciful to the meek; in His Presence, the Lord‟s Praises are sung.
The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is chanted in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. Vibrating, and worshipping the One Lord in the Company of the Holy, the pains of
birth and death are removed. Those who have such karma pre-ordained, study and
learn the Truth; the noose of Death is removed from their necks. Their fears and doubts
are dispelled, the knot of death is untied, and they never have to walk on Death‟s path.
Prays Nanak, shower me with Your Mercy, Lord; let me sing Your Glorious Praises
forever. || 1 || The Name of the One, Immaculate Lord is the Support of the
unsupported. You are the Giver, the Great Giver, the Dispeller of all sorrow. O
Destroyer of pain, Creator Lord, Master of peace and bliss, I have come seeking the
Sanctuary of the Holy; please, help me to cross over the terrifying and difficult worldocean in an instant. I saw the Lord pervading and permeating everywhere, when the
healing ointment of the Guru‟s wisdom was applied to my eyes. Prays Nanak, remember
Him forever in meditation, the Destroyer of all sorrow and fear. || 2 || He Himself has
attached me to the hem of His robe; He has showered me with His Mercy. I am
worthless, lowly and helpless; God is unfathomable and infinite. My Lord and Master is
always merciful, kind and compassionate; He uplifts and establishes the lowly. All
beings and creatures are under Your power; You take care of all. He Himself is the
Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer; He Himself is the Contemplator of all. Prays
Nanak, singing Your Glorious Praises, I live, chanting the Chant of the Lord, the Lord of
the world-forest. || 3 || The Blessed Vision of Your Darshan is incomparable; Your
Name is utterly priceless. You dwell on the tongues of the Saints, by Your own
pleasure; they are intoxicated with Your sublime essence, O Lord. Those who are
attached to Your feet are very blessed; night and day, they remain always awake and
aware. Forever and ever, meditate in remembrance on the Lord and Master; with each
and every breath, speak His Glorious Praises. Prays Nanak, let me become the dust of
the feet of the Saints. God‟s Name is invaluable. || 4 || 1 ||
RAAG DHANAASAREE, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE KABEER JEE:

Beings like Sanak, Sanand, Shiva and Shaysh-naaga — none of them know Your
mystery, Lord. || 1 || In the Society of the Saints, the Lord dwells within the heart. ||
1 || Pause || Beings like Hanumaan, Garura, Indra the King of the gods and the
rulers of humans — none of them know Your Glories, Lord. || 2 || The four Vedas,
the Simritees and the Puraanas, Vishnu the Lord of Lakshmi and Lakshmi herself —
none of them know the Lord. || 3 || 

Says Kabeer, one who falls at the Lord‟s feet, and remains in His Sanctuary, does not
wander around lost. || 4 || 1 || Day by day, hour by hour, life runs its course, and the
body withers away. Death, like a hunter, a butcher, is on the prowl; tell me, what can
we do? || 1 || That day is rapidly approaching. Mother, father, siblings, children and
spouse — tell me, who belongs to whom? || 1 || Pause || As long as the light
remains in the body, the beast does not understand himself. He acts in greed to
maintain his life and status, and sees nothing with his eyes. || 2 || Says Kabeer,
listen, O mortal: Renounce the doubts of your mind. Chant only the One Naam, the
Name of the Lord, O mortal, and seek the Sanctuary of the One Lord. || 3 || 2 || That
humble being, who knows even a little about loving devotional worship — what
surprises are there for him? Like water, dripping into water, which cannot be separated
out again, so is the weaver Kabeer, with softened heart, merged into the Lord. || 1 ||
O people of the Lord, I am just a simple-minded fool. If Kabeer were to leave his body
at Benares, and so liberate himself, what obligation would he have to the Lord? || 1 ||
Pause || Says Kabeer, listen, O people — do not be deluded by doubt. What is the
difference between Benares and the barren land of Maghar, if the Lord is within one‟s
heart? || 2 || 3 || Mortals may go to the Realm of Indra, or the Realm of Shiva, but
because of their hypocrisy and false prayers, they must leave again. || 1 || What
should I ask for? Nothing lasts forever. Enshrine the Lord‟s Name within your mind. ||
1 || Pause || Fame and glory, power, wealth and glorious greatness — none of these
will go with you or help you in the end. || 2 || Children, spouse, wealth and Maya —
who has ever obtained peace from these? || 3 || Says Kabeer, nothing else is of any
use. Within my mind is the wealth of the Lord‟s Name. || 4 || 4 || Remember the
Lord, remember the Lord, remember the Lord in meditation, O Siblings of Destiny.
Without remembering the Lord‟s Name in meditation, a great many are drowned. || 1
|| Pause || Your spouse, children, body, house and possessions — you think these
will give you peace. But none of these shall be yours, when the time of death comes. ||
1 || Ajaamal, the elephant, and the prostitute committed many sins, but still, they
crossed over the world-ocean, by chanting the Lord‟s Name. || 2 || You have
wandered in reincarnation, as pigs and dogs — did you feel no shame? Forsaking the
Ambrosial Name of the Lord, why do you eat poison? || 3 || Abandon your doubts
about do‟s and dont‟s, and take to the Lord‟s Name. By Guru‟s Grace, O servant Kabeer,
love the Lord. || 4 || 5 ||

DHANAASAREE, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE NAAM DAYV JEE:

They dig deep foundations, and build lofty palaces. Can anyone live longer than
Markanda, who passed his days with only a handful of straw upon his head? || 1 ||
The Creator Lord is our only friend. O man, why are you so proud? This body is only
temporary — it shall pass away. || 1 || Pause || 

The Kaurvas, who had brothers like Duryodhan, used to proclaim, “This is ours! This is
ours!” Their royal procession extended over sixty miles, and yet their bodies were eaten
by vultures. || 2 || Sri Lanka was totally rich with gold; was anyone greater than its
ruler Raavan? What happened to the elephants, tethered at his gate? In an instant, it all
belonged to someone else. || 3 || The Yaadvas deceived Durbaasaa, and received
their rewards. The Lord has shown mercy to His humble servant, and now Naam Dayv
sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 4 || 1 || I have brought the ten sensory
organs under my control, and erased every trace of the five thieves. I have filled the
seventy-two thousand nerve channels with Ambrosial Nectar, and drained out the
poison. || 1 || I shall not come into the world again. I chant the Ambrosial Bani of the
Word from the depths of my heart, and I have instructed my soul. || 1 || Pause || I
fell at the Guru‟s feet and begged of Him; with the mighty axe, I have chopped off
emotional attachment. Turning away from the world, I have become the servant of the
Saints; I fear no one except the Lord‟s devotees. || 2 || I shall be released from this
world, when I stop clinging to Maya. Maya is the name of the power which causes us to
be born; renouncing it, we obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan. || 3 ||
That humble being, who performs devotional worship in this way, is rid of all fear. Says
Naam Dayv, why are you wandering around out there? This is the way to find the Lord.
|| 4 || 2 || As water is very precious in the desert, and the creeper weeds are dear to
the camel, and the tune of the hunter‟s bell at night is enticing to the deer, so is the
Lord to my mind. || 1 || Your Name is so beautiful! Your form is so beautiful! Your
Love is so very beautiful, O my Lord. || 1 || Pause || As rain is dear to the earth,
and the flower‟s fragrance is dear to the bumble bee, and the mango is dear to the
cuckoo, so is the Lord to my mind. || 2 || As the sun is dear to the chakvi duck, and
the lake of Man Sarovar is dear to the swan, and the husband is dear to his wife, so is
the Lord to my mind. || 3 || As milk is dear to the baby, and the raindrop is dear to
the mouth of the sparrow-hawk, as as water is dear to the fish, so is the Lord to my
mind. || 4 || All the seekers, Siddhas and silent sages seek Him, but only a rare few
behold Him. Just as Your Name is dear to all the Universe, so is the Lord dear to Naam
Dayv‟s mind. || 5 || 3 || First of all, the lotuses bloomed in the woods; from them, all
the swan-souls came into being. Know that, through Krishna, the Lord, Har, Har, the
dance of creation dances. || 1 || First of all, there was only the Primal Being. From
that Primal Being, Maya was produced. All that is, is His. In this Garden of the Lord, we
all dance, like water in the pots of the Persian wheel. || 1 || Pause || Women and
men both dance. There is no other than the Lord. Don‟t dispute this, and don‟t doubt
this. 

The Lord says, “This creation and I are one and the same.” || 2 || Like the pots on
the Persian wheel, sometimes the world is high, and sometimes it is low. Wandering
and roaming around, I have come at last to Your Door. “Who are you?” “I am Naam
Dayv, Sir.” O Lord, please save me from Maya, the cause of death. || 3 || 4 || O Lord,
You are the Purifier of sinners — this is Your innate nature. Blessed are those silent
sages and humble beings, who meditate on my Lord God. || 1 || I have applied to my
forehead the dust of the feet of the Lord of the Universe. This is something which is far
away from the gods, mortal men and silent sages. || 1 || Pause || O Lord, Merciful
to the meek, Destroyer of pride — Naam Dayv seeks the Sanctuary of Your feet; he is a
sacrifice to You. || 2 || 5 ||
DHANAASAREE, DEVOTEE RAVI DAAS JEE:

There is none as forlorn as I am, and none as Compassionate as You; what need is
there to test us now? May my mind surrender to Your Word; please, bless Your humble
servant with this perfection. || 1 || I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Lord. O Lord,
why are You silent? || Pause || For so many incarnations, I have been separated
from You, Lord; I dedicate this life to You. Says Ravi Daas: placing my hopes in You, I
live; it is so long since I have gazed upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. || 2 || 1
|| In my consciousness, I remember You in meditation; with my eyes, I behold You; I
fill my ears with the Word of Your Bani, and Your Sublime Praise. My mind is the
bumble bee; I enshrine Your feet within my heart, and with my tongue, I chant the
Ambrosial Name of the Lord. || 1 || My love for the Lord of the Universe does not
decrease. I paid for it dearly, in exchange for my soul. || 1 || Pause || Without the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, love for the Lord does not well up; without
this love, Your devotional worship cannot be performed. Ravi Daas offers this one
prayer unto the Lord: please preserve and protect my honor, O Lord, my King. || 2 || 2
|| Your Name, Lord, is my adoration and cleansing bath. Without the Name of the
Lord, all ostentatious displays are useless. || 1 || Pause || Your Name is my prayer
mat, and Your Name is the stone to grind the sandalwood. Your Name is the saffron
which I take and sprinkle in offering to You. Your Name is the water, and Your Name is
the sandalwood. The chanting of Your Name is the grinding of the sandalwood. I take it
and offer all this to You. || 1 || Your Name is the lamp, and Your Name is the wick.
Your Name is the oil I pour into it. Your Name is the light applied to this lamp, which
enlightens and illuminates the entire world. || 2 || Your Name is the thread, and Your
Name is the garland of flowers. The eighteen loads of vegetation are all too impure to
offer to You. Why should I offer to You, that which You Yourself created? Your Name is
the fan, which I wave over You. || 3 || The whole world is engrossed in the eighteen
Puraanas, the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and the four sources of creation.
Says Ravi Daas, Your Name is my Aartee, my lamp-lit worship-service. The True Name,
Sat Naam, is the food which I offer to You. || 4 || 3 || 

DHANAASAREE, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE TRILOCHAN JEE:

Why do you slander the Lord? You are ignorant and deluded. Pain and pleasure are the
result of your own actions. || 1 || Pause || The moon dwells in Shiva‟s forehead; it
takes its cleansing bath in the Ganges. Among the men of the moon‟s family, Krishna
was born; even so, the stains from its past actions remain on the moon‟s face. || 1 ||
Aruna was a charioteer; his master was the sun, the lamp of the world. His brother was
Garuda, the king of birds; and yet, Aruna was made a cripple, because of the karma of
his past actions. || 2 || Shiva, the destroyer of countless sins, the Lord and Master of
the three worlds, wandered from sacred shrine to sacred shrine; he never found an end
to them. And yet, he could not erase the karma of cutting off Brahma‟s head. || 3 ||
Through the nectar, the moon, the wish-fulfilling cow, Lakshmi, the miraculous tree of
life, Sikhar the sun‟s horse, and Dhanavantar the wise physician — all arose from the
ocean, the lord of rivers; and yet, because of its karma, its saltiness has not left it. || 4
|| Hanuman burnt the fortress of Sri Lanka, uprooted the garden of Raawan, and
brought healing herbs for the wounds of Lachhman, pleasing Lord Raamaa; and yet,
because of his karma, he could not be rid of his loin cloth. || 5 || The karma of past
actions cannot be erased, O wife of my house; this is why I chant the Name of the
Lord. So prays Trilochan, Dear Lord. || 6 || 1 || SRI SAIN: With incense, lamps and
ghee, I offer this lamp-lit worship service. I am a sacrifice to the Lord of Lakshmi. || 1
|| Hail to You, Lord, hail to You! Again and again, hail to You, Lord King, Ruler of all!
|| 1 || Pause || Sublime is the lamp, and pure is the wick. You are immaculate and
pure, O Brilliant Lord of Wealth! || 2 || Raamaanand knows the devotional worship of
the Lord. He says that the Lord is all-pervading, the embodiment of supreme joy. || 3
|| The Lord of the world, of wondrous form, has carried me across the terrifying
world-ocean. Says Sain, remember the Lord, the embodiment of supreme joy! || 4 || 2
|| PEEPAA: Within the body, the Divine Lord is embodied. The body is the temple, the
place of pilgrimage, and the pilgrim. Within the body are incense, lamps and offerings.
Within the body are the flower offerings. || 1 || I searched throughout many realms,
but I found the nine treasures within the body. Nothing comes, and nothing goes; I
pray to the Lord for Mercy. || 1 || Pause || The One who pervades the Universe also
dwells in the body; whoever seeks Him, finds Him there. Peepaa prays, the Lord is the
supreme essence; He reveals Himself through the True Guru. || 2 || 3 || DHANNAA:
O Lord of the world, this is Your lamp-lit worship service. You are the Arranger of the
affairs of those humble beings who perform Your devotional worship service. || 1 ||
Pause || Lentils, flour and ghee — these things, I beg of You. My mind shall ever be
pleased. Shoes, fine clothes, and grain of seven kinds — I beg of You. || 1 || A milk
cow, and a water buffalo, I beg of You, and a fine Turkestani horse. A good wife to care
for my home — Your humble servant Dhanna begs for these things, Lord. || 2 || 4 || 





JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

The Jewel of the Lord‟s Name abides within my heart; the Guru has placed His hand on
my forehead. The sins and pains of countless incarnations have been cast out. The
Guru has blessed me with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and my debt has been paid
off. || 1 || O my mind, vibrate the Lord‟s Name, and all your affairs shall be resolved.
The Perfect Guru has implanted the Lord‟s Name within me; without the Name, life is
useless. || Pause || Without the Guru, the self-willed manmukhs are foolish and
ignorant; they are forever entangled in emotional attachment to Maya. They never
serve the feet of the Holy; their lives are totally useless. || 2 || Those who serve at
the feet of the Holy, the feet of the Holy, their lives are made fruitful, and they belong
to the Lord. Make me the slave of the slave of the slaves of the Lord; bless me with
Your Mercy, O Lord of the Universe. || 3 || I am blind, ignorant and totally without
wisdom; how can I walk on the Path? I am blind — O Guru, please let me grasp the
hem of Your robe, so that servant Nanak may walk in harmony with You. || 4 || 1 ||
JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL: A jewel or a diamond may be very valuable and heavy, but
without a purchaser, it is worth only straw. When the Holy Guru, the Purchaser, saw
this jewel, He purchased it for hundreds of thousands of dollars. || 1 || The Lord has
kept this jewel hidden within my mind. The Lord, merciful to the meek, led me to meet
the Holy Guru; meeting the Guru, I came to appreciate this jewel. || Pause || The
rooms of the self-willed manmukhs are dark with ignorance; in their homes, the jewel is
not visible. Those fools die, wandering in the wilderness, eating the poison of the
snake, Maya. || 2 || O Lord, Har, Har, let me meet the humble, holy beings; O Lord,
keep me in the Sanctuary of the Holy. O Lord, make me Your own; O God, Lord and
Master, I have hurried to Your side. || 3 || What Glorious Virtues of Yours can I speak
and describe? You are great and unfathomable, the Greatest Being. The Lord has
bestowed His Mercy on servant Nanak; 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 697 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He has saved the sinking stone. || 4 || 2 || JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL: I am Your
child; I know nothing about Your state and extent; I am foolish, idiotic and ignorant. O
Lord, shower me with Your Mercy; bless me with an enlightened intellect; I am foolish
— make me clever. || 1 || My mind is lazy and sleepy. The Lord, Har, Har, has led me
to meet the Holy Guru; meeting the Holy, the shutters have been opened wide. ||
Pause || O Guru, each and every instant, fill my heart with love; the Name of my
Beloved is my breath of life. Without the Name, I would die; the Name of my Lord and
Master is to me like the drug to the addict. || 2 || Those who enshrine love for the
Lord within their minds fulfill their pre-ordained destiny. I worship their feet, each and
every instant; the Lord seems very sweet to them. || 3 || My Lord and Master, Har,
Har, has showered His Mercy upon His humble servant; separated for so long, he is
now re-united with the Lord. Blessed, blessed is the True Guru, who has implanted the
Naam, the Name of the Lord within me; servant Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. || 4 || 3 ||
JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL: I have found the True Guru, my Friend, the Greatest
Being. Love and affection for the Lord has blossomed forth. Maya, the snake, has seized
the mortal; through the Word of the Guru, the Lord neutralizes the venom. || 1 || My
mind is attached to the sublime essence of the Lord‟s Name. The Lord has purified the
sinners, uniting them with the Holy Guru; now, they taste the Lord‟s Name, and the
sublime essence of the Lord. || Pause || Blessed, blessed is the good fortune of
those who meet the Holy Guru; meeting with the Holy, they lovingly center themselves
in the state of absolute absorption. The fire of desire within them is quenched, and they
find peace; they sing the Glorious Praises of the Immaculate Lord. || 2 || Those who
do not obtain the Blessed Vision of the True Guru‟s Darshan, have misfortune preordained for them. In the love of duality, they are consigned to reincarnation through
the womb, and they pass their lives totally uselessly. || 3 || O Lord, please, bless me
with pure understanding, that I may serve the Feet of the Holy Guru; the Lord seems
sweet to me. Servant Nanak begs for the dust of the feet of the Holy; O Lord, be
Merciful, and bless me with it. || 4 || 4 || JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL: The Lord‟s
Name does not abide within their hearts — their mothers should have been sterile.
These bodies wander around, forlorn and abandoned, without the Name; their lives
waste away, and they die, crying out in pain. || 1 || O my mind, chant the Name of
the Lord, the Lord within you. The Merciful Lord God, Har, Har, has showered me with
His Mercy; the Guru has imparted spiritual wisdom to me, and my mind has been
instructed. || Pause || In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praise
brings the most noble and exalted status; the Lord is found through the True Guru. I
am a sacrifice to my True Guru, who has revealed the Lord‟s hidden Name to me. || 2
|| By great good fortune, I obtained the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy; it
removes all stains of sin. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 698 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I have found the True Guru, the great, all-knowing King; He has shared with me the
many Glorious Virtues of the Lord. || 3 || Those, unto whom the Lord, the Life of the
world, has shown Mercy, enshrine Him within their hearts, and cherish Him in their
minds. The Righteous Judge of Dharma, in the Court of the Lord, has torn up my
papers; servant Nanak‟s account has been settled. || 4 || 5 || JAITSREE, FOURTH
MEHL: In the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I found the Holy, by great good
fortune; my restless mind has been quieted. The unstruck melody ever vibrates and
resounds; I have taken in the sublime essence of the Lord‟s Ambrosial Nectar,
showering down. || 1 || O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the beauteous Lord.
The True Guru has drenched my mind and body with the Love of the Lord, who has met
me and lovingly embraced me. || Pause || The faithless cynics are bound and
gagged in the chains of Maya; they are actively engaged, gathering in the poisonous
wealth. They cannot spend this in harmony with the Lord, and so they must endure the
pain which the Messenger of Death inflicts upon their heads. || 2 || The Holy Guru
has dedicated His Being to the Lord‟s service; with great devotion, apply the dust of His
feet to your face. In this world and the next, you shall receive the Lord‟s honor, and
your mind shall be imbued with the permanent color of the Lord‟s Love. || 3 || O
Lord, Har, Har, please unite me with the Holy; compared to these Holy people, I am
just a worm. Servant Nanak has enshrined love for the feet of the Holy Guru; meeting
with this Holy One, my foolish, stone-like mind has blossomed forth in lush profusion.
|| 4 || 6 ||
JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

Remember in meditation the Lord, Har, Har, the unfathomable, infinite Lord.
Remembering Him in meditation, pains are dispelled. O Lord, Har, Har, lead me to meet
the True Guru; meeting the Guru, I am at peace. || 1 || Sing the Glorious Praises of
the Lord, O my friend. Cherish the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in your heart. Read the
Ambrosial Words of the Lord, Har, Har; meeting with the Guru, the Lord is revealed. ||
2 || The Lord, the Slayer of demons, is my breath of life. His Ambrosial Amrit is so
sweet to my mind and body. O Lord, Har, Har, have mercy upon me, and lead me to
meet the Guru, the immaculate Primal Being. || 3 || The Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
is forever the Giver of peace. My mind is imbued with the Lord‟s Love. O Lord Har, Har,
lead me to meet the Guru, the Greatest Being; through the Name of Guru Nanak, I
have found peace. || 4 || 1 || 7 || JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL: Chant the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. As Gurmukh, ever earn the profit of the Naam. Implant
within yourself devotion to the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har; sincerely dedicate yourself to
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Meditate on the Name of the Merciful Lord,
Har, Har. WIth love, forever sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Dance to the Praises
of the Lord, Har, Har, Har; meet with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, with
sincerity. || 2 || Come, O companions — let us unite in the Lord‟s Union. Listening to
the sermon of the Lord, earn the profit of the Naam. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 699 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Lord, Har, Har, be merciful to me, and lead me to meet the Guru; meeting the Guru,
a sincere yearning for the Lord wells up in me. || 3 || Praise Him, the unfathomable
and inaccessible Lord. Each and every moment, sing the Lord‟s Name. Be merciful, and
meet me, O Guru, Great Giver; Nanak yearns for the Lord‟s devotional worship. || 4 ||
2 || 8 || JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL: With love and energetic affection, praise the
Lord, the storehouse of Nectar. My mind is drenched with the Lord‟s Name, and so it
earns this profit. Each and every moment, worship Him in devotion, day and night;
through the Guru‟s Teachings, sincere love and devotion well up. || 1 || Chant the
Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, Har, Har. Conquering mind and body, I
have earned the profit of the Shabad. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the five demons
are over-powered, and the mind and body are filled with a sincere yearning for the
Lord. || 2 || The Name is a jewel — chant the Lord‟s Name. Sing the Glorious Praises
of the Lord, and forever earn this profit. O Lord, merciful to the meek, be kind to me,
and bless me with sincere longing for the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || Meditate
on the Lord of the world — meditate within your mind. The Lord of the Universe, Har,
Har, is the only real profit in this world. Blessed, blessed, is my Great Lord and Master
God; O Nanak, meditate on Him, worship Him with sincere love and devotion. || 4 || 3
|| 9 || JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL: He Himself is the Yogi, and the way throughout
the ages. The Fearless Lord Himself is absorbed in Samaadhi. He Himself, all by
Himself, is all-pervading; He Himself blesses us with sincere love for the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. || 1 || He Himself is the lamp, and the Light pervading all the
worlds. He Himself is the True Guru; He Himself churns the ocean. He Himself churns
it, churning up the essence; meditating on the jewel of the Naam, sincere love comes to
the surface. || 2 || O my companions, let us meet and join together, and sing His
Glorious Praises. As Gurmukh, chant the Naam, and earn the profit of the Lord‟s Name.
Devotional worship of the Lord, Har, Har, has been implanted within me; it is pleasing
to my mind. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, brings a sincere love. || 3 || He Himself
is supremely wise, the greatest King. As Gurmukh, purchase the merchandise of the
Naam. O Lord God, Har, Har, bless me with such a gift, that Your Glorious Virtues seem
pleasing to me; Nanak is filled with sincere love and yearning for the Lord. || 4 || 4 ||
10 || JAITSREE, FOURTH MEHL: Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, and
associating with the Guru, the Gurmukh gathers in the merchandise of the Naam. O
Lord, Har, Har, Destroyer of demons, have mercy upon me; bless me with a sincere
yearning to join the Sat Sangat. || 1 || Let me hear with my ears the Banis, the
Hymns, in praise of the Lord; be merciful, and let me meet the True Guru. I sing His
Glorious Praises, I speak the Bani of His Word; chanting His Glorious Praises, a sincere
yearning for the Lord wells up. || 2 || I have tried visiting all the sacred shrines of
pilgrimage, fasting, ceremonial feasts and giving to charities. They do not measure up
to the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Lord‟s Name is unweighable, utterly heavy in
weight; through the Guru‟s Teachings, a sincere yearning to chant the Name has welled
up in me. || 3 || All good karma and righteous living are found in meditation on the
Lord‟s Name. It washes away the stains of sins and mistakes. Be merciful to meek,
humble Nanak; bless him with sincere love and yearning for the Lord. || 4 || 5 || 11 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 700 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

Does anyone know, who is our friend in this world? He alone understands this, whom
the Lord blesses with His Mercy. Immaculate and unstained is his way of life. || 1 ||
Pause || Mother, father, spouse, children, relatives, lovers, friends and siblings meet,
having been associated in previous lives; but none of them will be your companion and
support in the end. || 1 || Pearl necklaces, gold, rubies and diamonds please the
mind, but they are only Maya. Possessing them, one passes his life in agony; he obtains
no contentment from them. || 2 || Elephants, chariots, horses as fast as the wind,
wealth, land, and armies of four kinds — none of these will go with him; he must get up
and depart, naked. || 3 || The Lord‟s Saints are the beloved lovers of God; sing of the
Lord, Har, Har, with them. O Nanak, in the Society of the Saints, you shall obtain peace
in this world, and in the next world, your face shall be radiant and bright. || 4 || 1 ||
JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Give me a message from my Beloved — tell me, tell me! I am wonder-struck, hearing
the many reports of Him; tell them to me, O my happy sister soul-brides. || 1 || Pause
|| Some say that He is beyond the world — totally beyond it, while others say that He
is totally within it. His color cannot be seen, and His pattern cannot be discerned. O
happy soul-brides, tell me the truth! || 1 || He is pervading everywhere, and He
dwells in each and every heart; He is not stained — He is unstained. Says Nanak, listen,
O people: He dwells upon the tongues of the Saints. || 2 || 1 || 2 || JAITSREE,
FIFTH MEHL: I am calmed, calmed and soothed, hearing of God. || 1 || Pause || I
dedicate my soul, my breath of life, my mind, body and everything to Him: I behold
God near, very near. || 1 || Beholding God, the inestimable, infinite and Great Giver, I
cherish Him in my mind. || 2 || Whatever I wish for, I receive; my hopes and desires
are fulfilled, meditating on God. || 3 || By Guru‟s Grace, God dwells in Nanak‟s mind;
he never suffers or grieves, having realized God. || 4 || 2 || 3 || JAITSREE, FIFTH
MEHL: I seek my Friend the Lord. In each and every home, sing the sublime songs of
rejoicing; He abides in each and every heart. || 1 || Pause || In good times, worship
and adore Him; in bad times, worship and adore Him; do not ever forget Him. Chanting
the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the light of millions of suns shines forth, and the
darkness of doubt is dispelled. || 1 || In all the spaces and interspaces, everywhere,
whatever we see is Yours. One who finds the Society of the Saints, O Nanak, is not
consigned to reincarnation again. || 2 || 3 || 4 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 701 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Now, I have found peace, bowing before the Guru. I have abandoned cleverness,
quieted my anxiety, and renounced my egotism. || 1 || Pause || When I looked, I
saw that everyone was enticed by emotional attachment; then, I hurried to the Guru‟s
Sanctuary. In His Grace, the Guru engaged me in the Lord‟s service, and then, the
Messenger of Death gave up pursuing me. || 1 || I swam across the ocean of fire,
when I met the Saints, through great good fortune. O servant Nanak, I have found total
peace; my consciousness is attached to the Lord‟s feet. || 2 || 1 || 5 || JAITSREE,
FIFTH MEHL: Within my mind, I cherish and meditate on the True Guru. He has
implanted within me spiritual wisdom and the Mantra of the Lord‟s Name; Dear God has
shown mercy to me. || 1 || Pause || Death‟s noose and its mighty entanglements
have vanished, along with the fear of death. I have come to the Sanctuary of the
Merciful Lord, the Destroyer of pain; I am holding tight to the Support of His feet. || 1
|| The Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, has assumed the form of a boat, to
cross over the terrifying world-ocean. I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, and my doubts
are shattered; says Nanak, I can bear the unbearable. || 2 || 2 || 6 || JAITSREE,
FIFTH MEHL: One who has the Lord of the Universe as his help and support is blessed
with all peace, poise and bliss; no afflictions cling to him. || 1 || Pause || He appears
to keep company with everyone, but he remains detached, and Maya does not cling to
him. He is absorbed in love of the One Lord; he understands the essence of reality, and
he is blessed with wisdom by the True Guru. || 1 || Those whom the Lord and Master
blesses with His kindness, compassion and mercy are the sublime and sanctified Saints.
Associating with them, Nanak is saved; with love and exuberant joy, they sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 2 || 3 || 7 || JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord of
the Universe is my existence, my breath of life, wealth and beauty. The ignorant are
totally intoxicated with emotional attachment; in this darkness, the Lord is the only
lamp. || 1 || Pause || Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Beloved God;
Your lotus feet are incomparably beautiful! So many times, I bow in reverence to Him,
offering my mind as incense to Him. || 1 || Exhausted, I have fallen at Your Door, O
God; I am holding tight to Your Support. Please, lift Your humble servant Nanak up, out
of the pit of fire of the world. || 2 || 4 || 8 || JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL: If only
someone would unite me with the Lord! I hold tight to His feet, and utter sweet words
with my tongue; I make my breath of life an offering to Him. || 1 || Pause || I make
my mind and body into pure little gardens, and irrigate them with the sublime essence
of the Lord. I am drenched with this sublime essence by His Grace, and the powerful
hold of Maya‟s corruption has been broken. || 1 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 702 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Destroyer of the suffering of the innocent; I keep my
consciousness focused on You. Bless me with the gifts of the state of fearlessness, and
meditative remembrance, Lord and Master; O Nanak, God is the Breaker of bonds. || 2
|| 5 || 9 || JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL: The sparrow-hawk longs for the rain to fall. O
God, ocean of mercy, shower Your mercy on me, that I may yearn for loving devotional
worship of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || The chakvi duck does not desire many
comforts, but it is filled with bliss upon seeing the dawn. The fish cannot survive any
other way — without water, it dies. || 1 || I am a helpless orphan — I seek Your
Sanctuary, O My Lord and Master; please bless me with Your mercy. Nanak worships
and adores the Lord‟s lotus feet; without Him, there is no other at all. || 2 || 6 || 10 ||
JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord, my very breath of life, abides in my mind and
body. Bless me with Your mercy, and unite me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, O perfect, all-knowing Lord God. || 1 || Pause || Those, unto whom You
give the intoxicating herb of Your Love, drink in the supreme sublime essence. I cannot
describe their value; what power do I have? || 1 || The Lord attaches His humble
servants to the hem of His robe, and they swim across the world-ocean. Meditating,
meditating, meditating in remembrance on God, peace is obtained; Nanak seeks the
Sanctuary of Your Door. || 2 || 7 || 11 || JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL: After wandering
through so many incarnations, I have come to Your Sanctuary. Save me — lift my body
up out of the deep, dark pit of the world, and attach me to Your feet. || 1 || Pause ||
I do not know anything about spiritual wisdom, meditation or karma, and my way of life
is not clean and pure. Please attach me to the hem of the robe of the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy; help me to cross over the terrible river. || 1 || Comforts,
riches and the sweet pleasures of Maya — do not implant these within your mind. Slave
Nanak is satisfied and satiated by the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan; his only
ornamentation is the love of the Lord‟s Name. || 2 || 8 || 12 || JAITSREE, FIFTH
MEHL: O humble servants of the Lord, remember the Lord in meditation within your
heart. Misfortune does not even approach the Lord‟s humble servant; the works of His
slave are perfectly fulfilled. || 1 || Pause || Millions of obstacles are removed, by
serving the Lord, and one enters into the eternal dwelling of the Lord of the Universe.
The Lord‟s devotee is very fortunate; he has absolutely no fear. Even the Messenger of
Death pays homage to him. || 1 || Forsaking the Lord of the world, he does other
deeds, but these are temporary and transitory. Grasp the Lord‟s lotus feet, and hold
them in your heart, O Nanak; you shall obtain absolute peace and bliss. || 2 || 9 || 13
||
JAITSREE, NINTH MEHL:

My mind is deluded, entangled in Maya. Whatever I do, while engaged in greed, only
serves to bind me down. || 1 || Pause || I have no understanding at all; I am
engrossed in the pleasures of corruption, and I have forgotten the Praises of the Lord.
The Lord and Master is with me, but I do not know Him. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 703 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Instead, I run into the forest, looking for Him. || 1 || The Jewel of the Lord is deep
within my heart, but I do not have any knowledge of Him. O servant Nanak, without
vibrating, meditating on the Lord God, human life is uselessly wasted and lost. || 2 || 1
|| JAITSREE, NINTH MEHL: O Dear Lord, please, save my honor! The fear of death
has entered my heart; I cling to the Protection of Your Sanctuary, O Lord, ocean of
mercy. || 1 || Pause || I am a great sinner, foolish and greedy; but now, at last, I
have grown weary of committing sins. I cannot forget the fear of dying; this anxiety is
consuming my body. || 1 || I have been trying to liberate myself, running around in
the ten directions. The pure, immaculate Lord abides deep within my heart, but I do not
understand the secret of His mystery. || 2 || I have no merit, and I know nothing
about meditation or austerities; what should I do now? O Nanak, I am exhausted; I
seek the shelter of Your Sanctuary; O God, please bless me with the gift of
fearlessness. || 3 || 2 || JAITSREE, NINTH MEHL: O mind, embrace true
contemplation. Without the Lord‟s Name, know that this whole world is false. || 1 ||
Pause || The Yogis are tired of searching for Him, but they have not found His limit.
You must understand that the Lord and Master is near at hand, but He has no form or
feature. || 1 || The Naam, the Name of the Lord is purifying in the world, and yet you
never remember it. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the One, before whom the
whole world bows down; please, preserve and protect me, by Your innate nature. || 2
|| 3 ||
JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT, FIRST HOUSE:

SHALOK: I am thirsty for the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, day and night; I
yearn for Him constantly, night and day. Opening the door, O Nanak, the Guru has led
me to meet with the Lord, my Friend. || 1 || CHHANT: Listen, O my intimate friend
— I have just one prayer to make. I have been wandering around, searching for that
enticing, sweet Beloved. Whoever leads me to my Beloved — I would cut off my head
and offer it to him, even if I were granted the Blessed Vision of His Darshan for just an
instant. My eyes are drenched with the Love of my Beloved; without Him, I do not have
even a moment‟s peace. My mind is attached to the Lord, like the fish to the water, and
the sparrow-hawk, thirsty for the raindrops. Servant Nanak has found the Perfect Guru;
his thirst is totally quenched. || 1 || O intimate friend, my Beloved has all these loving
companions; I cannot compare to any of them. O intimate friend, each of them is more
beautiful than the others; who could consider me? Each of them is more beautiful than
the others; countless are His lovers, constantly enjoying bliss with Him. Beholding them,
desire wells up in my mind; when will I obtain the Lord, the treasure of virtue? I
dedicate my mind to those who please and attract my Beloved. Says Nanak, hear my
prayer, O happy soul-brides; tell me, what does my Husband Lord look like? || 2 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 704 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O intimate friend, my Husband Lord does whatever He pleases; He is not dependent on
anyone. O intimate friend, you have enjoyed your Beloved; please, tell me about Him.
They alone find their Beloved, who eradicate self-conceit; such is the good destiny
written on their foreheads. Taking me by the arm, the Lord and Master has made me
His own; He has not considered my merits or demerits. She, whom You have adorned
with the necklace of virtue, and dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love —
everything looks beautiful on her. O servant Nanak, blessed is that happy soul-bride,
who dwells with her Husband Lord. || 3 || O intimate friend, I have found that peace
which I sought. My sought-after Husband Lord has come home, and now,
congratulations are pouring in. Great joy and happiness welled up, when my Husband
Lord, of ever-fresh beauty, showed mercy to me. By great good fortune, I have found
Him; the Guru has united me with Him, through the Saadh Sangat, the True
Congregation of the Holy. My hopes and desires have all been fulfilled; my Beloved
Husband Lord has hugged me close in His embrace. Prays Nanak, I have found that
peace which I sought, meeting with the Guru. || 4 || 1 ||
JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, CHHANT:

SHALOK: God is lofty, unapproachable and infinite. He is indescribable — He cannot be
described. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God, who is all-powerful to save us. || 1 ||
CHHANT: Save me, any way You can; O Lord God, I am Yours. My demerits are
uncountable; how many of them should I count? The sins and crimes I committed are
countless; day by day, I continually make mistakes. I am intoxicated by emotional
attachment to Maya, the treacherous one; by Your Grace alone can I be saved.
Secretly, I commit hideous sins of corruption, even though God is the nearest of the
near. Prays Nanak, shower me with Your Mercy, Lord, and lift me up, out of the
whirlpool of the terrifying world-ocean. || 1 || SHALOK: Countless are His virtues;
they cannot be enumerated. God‟s Name is lofty and exalted. This is Nanak‟s humble
prayer, to bless the homeless with a home. || 2 || CHHANT: There is no other place
at all — where else should I go? Twenty-four hours a day, with my palms pressed
together, I meditate on God. Meditating forever on my God, I receive the fruits of my
mind‟s desires. Renouncing pride, attachment, corruption and duality, I lovingly center
my attention on the One Lord. Dedicate your mind and body to God; eradicate all your
self-conceit. Prays Nanak, shower me with Your mercy, Lord, that I may be absorbed in
Your True Name. || 2 || SHALOK: O mind, meditate on the One, who holds
everything in His hands. Gather the wealth of the Lord‟s Name; O Nanak, it shall always
be with You. || 3 || CHHANT: God is our only True Friend; there is not any other. In
the places and interspaces, in the water and on the land, He Himself is pervading
everywhere. He is totally permeating the water, the land and the sky; God is the Great
Giver, the Lord and Master of all. The Lord of the world, the Lord of the universe has no
limit; His Glorious Virtues are unlimited — how can I count them? I have hurried to the
Sanctuary of the Lord Master, the Bringer of peace; without Him, there is no other at
all. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 705 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Prays Nanak, that being, unto whom the Lord shows mercy — he alone obtains the
Naam. || 3 || SHALOK: Whatever I wish for, that I receive. Meditating on the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, Nanak has found total peace. || 4 || CHHANT: My mind is now
emancipated; I have joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. As Gurmukh, I
chant the Naam, and my light has merged into the Light. Remembering the Lord‟s
Name in meditation, my sins have been erased; the fire has been extinguished, and I
am satisfied. He has taken me by the arm, and blessed me with His kind mercy; He has
accepted me His own. The Lord has hugged me in His embrace, and merged me with
Himself; the pains of birth and death have been burnt away. Prays Nanak, He has
blessed me with His kind mercy; in an instant, He unites me with Himself. || 4 || 2 ||
JAITSREE, CHHANT, FIFTH MEHL: The world is like a temporary way-station, but it is
filled with pride. People commit countless sins; they are dyed in the color of the love of
Maya. In greed, emotional attachment and egotism, they are drowning; they do not
even think of dying. Children, friends, worldly occupations and spouses — they talk of
these things, while their lives are passing away. When their pre-ordained days have run
their course, O mother, they behold the Messengers of the Righteous Judge of Dharma,
and they suffer. The karma of their past deeds cannot be erased, O Nanak, if they have
not earned the wealth of the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || He makes all sorts of efforts, but he
does not sing the Lord‟s Name. He wanders around in countless incarnations; he dies,
only to be born again. As beasts, birds, stones and trees — their number cannot be
known. As are the seeds he plants, so are the pleasures he enjoys; he receives the
consequences of his own actions. He loses the jewel of this human life in the gamble,
and God is not pleased with him at all. Prays Nanak, wandering in doubt, he does not
find any rest, even for an instant. || 2 || Youth has passed, and old age has taken its
place. The hands tremble, the head shakes, and the eyes do not see. The eyes do not
see, without vibrating and meditating on the Lord; he must leave behind the attractions
of Maya, and depart. He burnt his mind and body for his relatives, but now, they do not
listen to him, and they throw dust on his head. Love for the infinite, Perfect Lord does
not abide in his mind, even for an instant. Prays Nanak, the fort of paper is false — it is
destroyed in an instant. || 3 || Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of the Lord‟s lotus
feet. God Himself has carried Him across the impassable, terrifying world-ocean. Joining
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I vibrate and meditate on the Lord; God
has made me His own, and saved me. The Lord has approved of me, and blessed me
with His Name; He did not take anything else into consideration. I have found the
infinite Lord and Master, the treasure of virtue, which my mind had yearned for. Prays
Nanak, I am satisfied forever; I have eaten the food of the Lord‟s Name. || 4 || 2 || 3
||
JAITSREE, FIFTH MEHL, VAAR WITH SHALOKS:

SHALOK: In the beginning, He was pervading; in the middle, He is pervading; in the
end, He will be pervading. He is the Transcendent Lord. The Saints remember in
meditation the all-pervading Lord God. 

O Nanak, He is the Destroyer of sins, the Lord of the universe. || 1 || See, hear,
speak and implant the True Lord within your mind. He is all-pervading, permeating
everywhere; O Nanak, be absorbed in the Lord‟s Love. || 2 || PAUREE: Sing the
Praise of the One, the Immaculate Lord; He is contained within all. The Cause of
causes, the Almighty Lord God; whatever He wills, comes to pass. In an instant, He
establishes and disestablishes; without Him, there is no other. He pervades the
continents, solar systems, nether worlds, islands and all worlds. He alone understands,
whom the Lord Himself instructs; he alone is a pure and unstained being. || 1 ||
SHALOK: Creating the soul, the Lord places this creation in the womb of the mother.
With each and every breath, it meditates in remembrance on the Lord, O Nanak; it is
not consumed by the great fire. || 1 || With its head down, and feet up, it dwells in
that slimy place. O Nanak, how could we forget the Master? Through His Name, we are
saved. || 2 || PAUREE: From egg and sperm, you were conceived, and placed in the
fire of the womb. Head downwards, you abided restlessly in that dark, dismal, terrible
hell. Remembering the Lord in meditation, you were not burnt; enshrine Him in your
heart, mind and body. In that treacherous place, He protected and preserved you; do
not forget Him, even for an instant. Forgetting God, you shall never find peace; you
shall forfeit your life, and depart. || 2 || SHALOK: He grants our hearts‟ desires, and
fulfills all our hopes. He destroys pain and suffering; remember God in meditation, O
Nanak — He is not far away. || 1 || Love Him, with whom you enjoy all pleasures. Do
not forget that Lord, even for an instant; O Nanak, He fashioned this beautiful body. ||
2 || PAUREE: He gave you your soul, breath of life, body and wealth; He gave you
pleasures to enjoy. He gave you households, mansions, chariots and horses; He
ordained your good destiny. He gave you your children, spouse, friends and servants;
God is the all-powerful Great Giver. Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the body
and mind are rejuvenated, and sorrow departs. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, chant the Praises of the Lord, and all your sickness shall vanish. || 3 ||
SHALOK: For his family, he works very hard; for the sake of Maya, he makes countless
efforts. But without loving devotional worship of the Lord, O Nanak, he forgets God, and
then, he is a mere ghost. || 1 || That love shall break, which is established with any
other than the Lord. O Nanak, that way of life is true, which inspires love of the Lord.
|| 2 || PAUREE: Forgetting Him, one‟s body turns to dust, and everyone calls him a
ghost. And those, with whom he was so much in love — they do not let him stay in
their home, even for an instant. Practicing exploitation, he gathers wealth, but what use
will it be in the end? As one plants, so does he harvest; the body is the field of actions.
The ungrateful wretches forget the Lord, and wander in reincarnation. || 4 ||
SHALOK: The benefits of millions of charitable donations and cleansing baths, and
countless ceremonies of purification and piety, O Nanak, are obtained by chanting the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har with one‟s tongue; all sins are washed away. || 1 || I
gathered together a great stack of firewood, and applied a tiny flame to light it. 

When the True Lord and Master abides in one‟s mind, O Nanak, all sins are dispelled. ||
2 || PAUREE: Millions of sins are totally erased, by meditating on the Lord‟s Name.
The fruits of one‟s heart‟s desires are obtained, by singing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord. The fear of birth and death is eradicated, and one‟s eternal, unchanging true
home is obtained. If it is so pre-ordained, one is absorbed in the Lord‟s lotus feet. Bless
me with Your mercy, God — please preserve and save me! Nanak is a sacrifice to You.
|| 5 || SHALOK: They are involved in their beautiful houses, and the pleasures of the
mind‟s desires. They never remember the Lord in meditation; O Nanak, they are like
maggots in manure. || 1 || They are engrossed in ostentatious displays, lovingly
attached to all their possessions. That body which forgets the Lord, O Nanak, shall be
reduced to ashes. || 2 || PAUREE: He may enjoy a beautiful bed, countless pleasures
and all sorts of enjoyments. He may possess mansions of gold, studded with pearls and
rubies, plastered with fragrant sandalwood oil. He may relish in the pleasures of his
mind‟s desires, and have no anxiety at all. But if he does not remember God, he is like a
maggot in manure. Without the Lord‟s Name, there is no peace at all. How can the mind
be comforted? || 6 || SHALOK: One who loves the Lord‟s lotus feet searches for Him
in the ten directions. He renounces the deceptive illusion of Maya, and joins the blissful
form of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. || 1 || The Lord is in my mind,
and with my mouth I chant His Name; I seek Him in all the lands of the world. O
Nanak, all ostentatious displays are false; hearing the Praises of the True Lord, I live. ||
2 || PAUREE: He dwells in a broken-down shack, in tattered clothes, with no social
status, no honor and no respect; he wanders in the wilderness, with no friend or lover,
without wealth, beauty, relatives or relations. Even so, he is the king of the whole
world, if his mind is imbued with the Lord‟s Name. With the dust of his feet, men are
redeemed, because God is very pleased with him. || 7 || SHALOK: The various sorts
of pleasures, powers, joys, beauty, canopies, cooling fans and thrones to sit on — the
foolish, ignorant and blind are engrossed in these things. O Nanak, desire for Maya is
just a dream. || 1 || In a dream, he enjoys all sorts of pleasures, and emotional
attachment seems so sweet. O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the
beauty of Maya‟s illusion is fake. || 2 || PAUREE: The fool attaches his consciousness
to the dream. When he awakes, he forgets the power, pleasures and enjoyments, and
he is sad. He passes his life chasing after worldly affairs. His works are not completed,
because he is enticed by Maya. What can the poor helpless creature do? The Lord
Himself has deluded him. || 8 || SHALOK: They may live in heavenly realms, and
conquer the nine regions of the world, but if they forget the Lord of the world, O
Nanak, they are just wanderers in the wilderness. || 1 || In the midst of millions of
games and entertainments, the Lord‟s Name does not come to their minds. O Nanak,
their home is like a wilderness, in the depths of hell. || 2 || PAUREE: He sees the
terrible, awful wilderness as a city. 

Gazing upon the false objects, he believes them to be real. Engrossed in sexual desire,
anger and egotism, he wanders around insane. When the Messenger of Death hits him
on the head with his club, then he regrets and repents. Without the Perfect, Divine
Guru, he roams around like Satan. || 9 || SHALOK: Power is fraudulent, beauty is
fraudulent, and wealth is fraudulent, as is pride of ancestry. One may gather poison
through deception and fraud, O Nanak, but without the Lord, nothing shall go along
with him in the end. || 1 || Beholding the bitter melon, he is deceived, since it
appears so pretty. But it is not worth even a shell, O Nanak; the riches of Maya will not
go along with anyone. || 2 || PAUREE: It shall not go along with you when you
depart — why do you bother to collect it? Tell me, why do you try so hard to acquire
that which you must leave behind in the end? Forgetting the Lord, how can you be
satisfied? Your mind cannot be pleased. One who forsakes God, and attaches himself to
another, shall be immersed in hell. Be kind and compassionate to Nanak, O Lord, and
dispel his fear. || 10 || SHALOK: Princely pleasures are not sweet; sensual
enjoyments are not sweet; the pleasures of Maya are not sweet. The Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, is sweet, O slave Nanak; the Blessed Vision of God‟s Darshan is
sweet. || 1 || I have enshrined that love which drenches my soul. I have been
pierced by the Truth, O Nanak; the Master seems so sweet to me. || 2 || PAUREE:
Nothing seems sweet to His devotees, except the Lord. All other tastes are bland and
insipid; I have tested them and seen them. Ignorance, doubt and suffering are
dispelled, when the Guru becomes one‟s advocate. The Lord‟s lotus feet have pierced
my mind, and I am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love. My soul, breath of life,
body and mind belong to God; all falsehood has left me. || 11 || SHALOK: Leaving
the water, the fish cannot live; the sparrow-hawk cannot live without the raindrops from
the clouds. The deer is enticed by the sound of the hunter‟s bell, and shot through with
the arrow; the bumble bee is entangled in the fragrance of the flowers. The Saints are
entranced by the Lord‟s lotus feet; O Nanak, they desire nothing else. || 1 || Show
me Your face, for even an instant, Lord, and I will not give my consciousness to any
other. My life is with the Lord Master, O Nanak, the Friend of the Saints. || 2 ||
PAUREE: How can the fish live without water? Without the raindrops, how can the
sparrow-hawk be satisfied? The deer, entranced by the sound of the hunter‟s bell, runs
straight to him; the bumble bee is greedy for the flower‟s fragrance; finding it, he traps
himself in it. Just so, the humble Saints love the Lord; beholding the Blessed Vision of
His Darshan, they are satisfied and satiated. || 12 || SHALOK: They contemplate the
Lord‟s lotus feet; they worship and adore Him with each and every breath. They do not
forget the Name of the imperishable Lord; O Nanak, the Transcendent Lord fulfills their
hopes. || 1 || He is woven into the fabric of my mind; He is not outside of it, even for
an instant. O Nanak, the True Lord and Master fulfills my hopes, and always watches
over me. || 2 || PAUREE: My hopes rest in You, O Lord of the universe; please, fulfill
them. Meeting with the Lord of the world, the Lord of the universe, I shall never grieve.
Grant me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, the desire of my mind, and my worries
shall be over. 

By body is sanctified, by the dust of Your feet. O Supreme Lord God, Divine Guru, You
are always with me, ever-present. || 13 || SHALOK: With my tongue, I chant the
Lord‟s Name; with my ears, I listen to the Ambrosial Word of His Shabad. Nanak is
forever a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Supreme Lord God. || 1 || All
concerns are false, except those of the One Lord. O Nanak, blessed are those, who are
in love with their True Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: I am forever a sacrifice to those who
listen to the sermon of the Lord. Those who bow their heads before God are perfect
and distinguished. Those hands, which write the Praises of the infinite Lord are
beautiful. Those feet which walk on God‟s Path are pure and holy. In the Society of the
Saints, they are emancipated; all their sorrows depart. || 14 || SHALOK: One‟s
destiny is activated, when one chants the Lord‟s Name, through perfect good fortune.
Fruitful is that moment, O Nanak, when one obtains the Blessed Vision of the Darshan
of the Lord of the Universe. || 1 || Its value cannot be estimated; it brings peace
beyond measure. O Nanak, that time alone is approved, when my Beloved meets with
me. || 2 || PAUREE: Tell me, what is that time, when I shall find God? Blessed and
auspicious is that moment, and that destiny, when I shall find the Lord of the Universe.
Meditating on the Lord, twenty-four hours a day, my mind‟s desires are fulfilled. By
great good fortune, I have found the Society of the Saints; I bow and touch their feet.
My mind thirsts for the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan; Nanak is a sacrifice to
Him. || 15 || SHALOK: The Lord of the Universe is the Purifier of sinners; He is the
Dispeller of all distress. The Lord God is Mighty, giving His Protective Sanctuary; Nanak
chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Renouncing all self-conceit, I hold tight
to the Lord‟s Feet. My sorrows and troubles have departed, O Nanak, beholding God. ||
2 || PAUREE: Unite with me, O Merciful Lord; I have fallen at Your Door. It is Your
very nature to love Your devotees, and save sinners. Without You, there is no other at
all; I offer this prayer to You. Take me by the hand, O Merciful Lord, and carry me
across the world-ocean. || 16 || SHALOK: The Merciful Lord is the Savior of the
Saints; their only support is to sing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. One becomes
immaculate and pure, by associating with the Saints, O Nanak, and taking the
Protection of the Transcendent Lord. || 1 || The burning of the heart is not dispelled
at all, by sandalwood paste, the moon, or the cold season. It only becomes cool, O
Nanak, by chanting the Name of the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: Through the Protection
and Support of the Lord‟s lotus feet, all beings are saved. Hearing of the Glory of the
Lord of the Universe, the mind becomes fearless. Nothing at all is lacking, when one
gathers the wealth of the Naam. The Society of the Saints is obtained, by very good
deeds. Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on the Lord, and listen continually to the
Lord‟s Praises. || 17 || SHALOK: The Lord grants His Grace, and dispels the pains of
those who sing the Kirtan of the Praises of His Name. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 710 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When the Lord God shows His Kindness, O Nanak, one is no longer engrossed in Maya.
|| 1 || The burning fire has been put out; God Himself has saved me. Meditate on that
God, O Nanak, who created the universe. || 2 || PAUREE: When God becomes
merciful, Maya does not cling. Millions of sins are eliminated, by meditating on the
Naam, the Name of the One Lord. The body is made immaculate and pure, bathing in
the dust of the feet of the Lord‟s humble servants. The mind and body become
contented, finding the Perfect Lord God. One is saved, along with his family, and all his
ancestors. || 18 || SHALOK: The Guru is the Lord of the Universe; the Guru is the
Lord of the world; the Guru is the Perfect Pervading Lord God. The Guru is
compassionate; the Guru is all-powerful; the Guru, O Nanak, is the Saving Grace of
sinners. || 1 || The Guru is the boat, to cross over the dangerous, treacherous,
unfathomable world-ocean. O Nanak, by perfect good karma, one is attached to the
feet of the True Guru. || 2 || PAUREE: Blessed, blessed is the Divine Guru;
associating with Him, one meditates on the Lord. When the Guru becomes merciful,
then all one‟s demerits are dispelled. The Supreme Lord God, the Divine Guru, uplifts
and exalts the lowly. Cutting away the painful noose of Maya, He makes us His own
slaves. With my tongue, I sing the Glorious Praises of the infinite Lord God. || 19 ||
SHALOK: I see only the One Lord; I hear only the One Lord; the One Lord is allpervading. Nanak begs for the gift of the Naam; O Merciful Lord God, please grant Your
Grace. || 1 || I serve the One Lord, I contemplate the One Lord, and to the One Lord,
I offer my prayer. Nanak has gathered in the wealth, the merchandise of the Naam; this
is the true capital. || 2 || PAUREE: God is merciful and infinite. The One and Only is
all-pervading. He Himself is all-in-all. Who else can we speak of? God Himself grants His
gifts, and He Himself receives them. Coming and going are all by the Hukam of Your
Will; Your place is steady and unchanging. Nanak begs for this gift; by Your Grace,
Lord, please grant me Your Name. || 20 || 1 ||

JAITSREE, THE WORD OF THE DEVOTEES:

O my Lord and Master, I know nothing. My mind has sold out, and is in Maya‟s hands.
|| 1 || Pause || You are called the Lord and Master, the Guru of the World. I am
called a lustful being of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga. || 1 || The five vices have
corrupted my mind. Moment by moment, they lead me further away from the Lord. ||
2 || Wherever I look, I see loads of pain and suffering. I do not have faith, even
though the Vedas bear witness to the Lord. || 3 || Shiva cut off Brahma‟s head, and
Gautam‟s wife and the Lord Indra mated; Brahma‟s head got stuck to Shiva‟s hand, and
Indra came to bear the marks of a thousand female organs. || 4 || These demons
have fooled, bound and destroyed me. I am very shameless — even now, I am not tired
of them. || 5 || Says Ravi Daas, what am I to do now? Without the Sanctuary of the
Lord‟s Protection, who else‟s should I seek? || 6 || 1 ||
