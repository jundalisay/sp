RAAG TODEE, CHAU-PADAS, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

Without the Lord, my mind cannot survive. If the Guru unites me with my Beloved Lord God, my breath of life, then I shall not have to face the wheel of reincarnation again in the terrifying world-ocean. || 1 || Pause || My heart is gripped by a yearning for my
Lord God, and with my eyes, I behold my Lord God. The merciful True Guru has
implanted the Name of the Lord within me; this is the Path leading to my Lord God. ||
1 || Through the Lord‟s Love, I have found the Naam, the Name of my Lord God, the
Lord of the Universe, the Lord my God. The Lord seems so very sweet to my heart,
mind and body; upon my face, upon my forehead, my good destiny is inscribed. || 2 ||
Those whose minds are attached to greed and corruption forget the Lord, the good
Lord God. Those self-willed manmukhs are called foolish and ignorant; misfortune and
bad destiny are written on their foreheads. || 3 || From the True Guru, I have
obtained a discriminating intellect; the Guru has revealed the spiritual wisdom of God.
Servant Nanak has obtained the Naam from the Guru; such is the destiny inscribed
upon his forehead. || 4 || 1 ||

TODEE, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

The Saints do not know any other. They are carefree, ever in the Lord‟s Love; the Lord
and Master is on their side. || Pause || Your canopy is so high, O Lord and Master;
no one else has any power. Such is the immortal Lord and Master the devotees have
found; the spiritually wise remain absorbed in His Love. || 1 || Disease, sorrow, pain,
old age and death do not even approach the humble servant of the Lord. They remain
fearless, in the Love of the One Lord; O Nanak, they have surrendered their minds to
the Lord. || 2 || 1 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: Forgetting the Lord, one is ruined
forever. 

How can anyone be deceived, who has Your Support, O Lord? || Pause || Without
meditating in remembrance on the Lord, life is like a burning fire, even if one lives long,
like a snake. One may rule over the nine regions of the earth, but in the end, he shall
have to depart, losing the game of life. || 1 || He alone sings the Glorious Praises of
the Lord, the treasure of virtue, upon whom the Lord showers His Grace. He is at
peace, and his birth is blessed; Nanak is a sacrifice to him. || 2 || 2 ||

TODEE, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

The mind wanders, wandering in the ten directions. It is intoxicated by Maya, enticed
by the taste of greed. God Himself has deluded it. || Pause || He does not focus his
mind, even for a moment, on the Lord‟s sermon, or the Lord‟s Praises, or the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy. He is excited, gazing on the transitory color of the
safflower, and looking at other men‟s wives. || 1 || He does not love the Lord‟s lotus
feet, and he does not please the True Lord. He runs around chasing the fleeting objects
of the world, in all directions, like the ox around the oil press. || 2 || He does not
practice the Naam, the Name of the Lord; nor does he practice charity or inner
cleansing. He does not sing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises, even for an instant.
Clinging to his many falsehoods, he does not please his own mind, and he does not
understand his own self. || 3 || He never does good deeds for others; he does not
serve or meditate on the True Guru. He is entangled in the company and the advice of
the five demons, intoxicated by the wine of Maya. || 4 || I offer my prayer in the
Saadh Sangat; hearing that the Lord is the Lover of His devotees, I have come. Nanak
runs after the Lord, and pleads, “Protect my honor, Lord, and make me Your own.” || 5
|| 1 || 3 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: Without understanding, his coming into the world is
useless. He puts on various ornaments and many decorations, but it is like dressing a
corpse. || Pause || With great effort and exertion, the miser works to gather in the
riches of Maya. He does not give anything in charity or generosity, and he does not
serve the Saints; his wealth does not do him any good at all. || 1 || The soul-bride
puts on her ornaments, embellishes her bed, and fashions decorations. But if she does
not obtain the company of her Husband Lord, the sight of these decorations only brings
her pain. || 2 || The man works all day long, threshing the husks with the pestle. He
is depressed, like a forced laborer, and so he is of no use to his own home. || 3 || But
when God shows His Mercy and Grace, He implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
within the heart. Search the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, and find
the sublime essence of the Lord. || 4 || 2 || 4 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: O Lord,
ocean of mercy, please abide forever in my heart. Please awaken such understanding
within me, that I may be in love with You, God. || Pause || Please, bless me with
the dust of the feet of Your slaves; I touch it to my forehead. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 713 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I was a great sinner, but I have been made pure, singing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s
Glorious Praises. || 1 || Your Will seems so sweet to me; whatever You do, is pleasing
to me. Whatever You give me, with that I am satisfied; I shall chase after no one else.
|| 2 || I know that my Lord and Master God is always with me; I am the dust of all
men‟s feet. If I find the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I shall obtain God. ||
3 || Forever and ever, I am Your child; You are my God, my King. Nanak is Your child;
You are my mother and father; please, give me Your Name, like milk in my mouth. || 4
|| 3 || 5 ||
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

I beg for the Gift of Your Name, O my Lord and Master. Nothing else shall go along with
me in the end; by Your Grace, please allow me to sing Your Glorious Praises. || 1 ||
Pause || Power, wealth, various pleasures and enjoyments, all are just like the
shadow of a tree. He runs, runs, runs around in many directions, but all of his pursuits
are useless. || 1 || Except for the Lord of the Universe, everything he desires appears
transitory. Says Nanak, I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saints, so that my mind
may find peace and tranquility. || 2 || 1 || 6 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Naam, the
Name of the Dear Lord, is the Support of my mind. It is my life, my breath of life, my
peace of mind; for me, it is an article of daily use. || 1 || Pause || The Naam is my
social status, the Naam is my honor; the Naam is my family. The Naam is my
companion; it is always with me. The Lord‟s Name is my emancipation. || 1 || Sensual
pleasures are talked about a lot, but none of them goes along with anyone in the end.
The Naam is Nanak‟s dearest friend; the Lord‟s Name is my treasure. || 2 || 2 || 7 ||
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: Sing the sublime Praises of the Lord, and your disease shall be
eradicated. Your face shall become radiant and bright, and your mind shall be
immaculately pure. You shall be saved here and hereafter. || 1 || Pause || I wash
the Guru‟s feet and serve Him; I dedicate my mind as an offering to Him. Renounce
self-conceit, negativity and egotism, and accept what comes to pass. || 1 || He alone
commits himself to the service of the Saints, upon whose forehead such destiny is
inscribed. Says Nanak, other than the One Lord, there is not any other able to act. || 2
|| 3 || 8 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: O True Guru, I have come to Your Sanctuary. Grant
me the peace and glory of the Lord‟s Name, and remove my anxiety. || 1 || Pause ||
I cannot see any other place of shelter; I have grown weary, and collapsed at Your
door. Please ignore my account; only then may I be saved. I am worthless — please,
save me! || 1 || You are always forgiving, and always merciful; You give support to
all. Slave Nanak follows the Path of the Saints; save him, O Lord, this time. || 2 || 4 ||
9 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: My tongue sings the Praises of the Lord of the world, the
ocean of virtue. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 714 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Peace, tranquility, poise and delight well up in my mind, and all sorrows run away. || 1
|| Pause || Whatever I ask for, I receive; I serve at the Lord‟s feet, the source of
nectar. I am released from the bondage of birth and death, and so I cross over the
terrifying world-ocean. || 1 || Searching and seeking, I have come to understand the
essence of reality; the slave of the Lord of the Universe is dedicated to Him. If you
desire eternal bliss, O Nanak, ever remember the Lord in meditation. || 2 || 5 || 10 ||
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: The slanderer, by Guru‟s Grace, has been turned away. The
Supreme Lord God has become merciful; with Shiva‟s arrow, He shot his head off. || 1
|| Pause || Death, and the noose of death, cannot see me; I have adopted the Path
of Truth. I have earned the wealth, the jewel of the Lord‟s Name; eating and spending,
it is never used up. || 1 || In an instant, the slanderer was reduced to ashes; he
received the rewards of his own actions. Servant Nanak speaks the truth of the
scriptures; the whole world is witness to it. || 2 || 6 || 11 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: O
miser, your body and mind are full of sin. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, vibrate, meditate on the Lord and Master; He alone can cover your sins. || 1 ||
Pause || When many holes appear in your boat, you cannot plug them with your
hands. Worship and adore the One, to whom your boat belongs; He saves the
counterfeit along with the genuine. || 1 || People want to lift up the mountain with
mere words, but it just stays there. Nanak has no strength or power at all; O God,
please protect me — I seek Your Sanctuary. || 2 || 7 || 12 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL:
Meditate on the lotus feet of the Lord within your mind. The Name of the Lord is the
medicine; it is like an axe, which destroys the diseases caused by anger and egotism.
|| 1 || Pause || The Lord is the One who removes the three fevers; He is the
Destroyer of pain, the warehouse of peace. No obstacles block the path of one who
prays before God. || 1 || By the Grace of the Saints, the Lord has become my
physician; God alone is the Doer, the Cause of causes. He is the Giver of perfect peace
to the innocent-minded people; O Nanak, the Lord, Har, Har, is my support. || 2 || 8 ||
13 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, forever and ever.
Showering His Kind Mercy, the Supreme Lord God Himself has blessed the town. || 1 ||
Pause || The One who owns me, has again taken care of me; my sorrow and
suffering is past. He gave me His hand, and saved me, His humble servant; the Lord is
my mother and father. || 1 || All beings and creatures have become kind to me; my
Lord and Master blessed me with His Kind Mercy. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the
Lord, the Destroyer of pain; His glory is so great! || 2 || 9 || 14 || TODEE, FIFTH
MEHL: O Lord and Master, I seek the Sanctuary of Your Court. Destroyer of millions of
sins, O Great Giver, other than You, who else can save me? || 1 || Pause ||
Searching, searching in so many ways, I have contemplated all the objects of life. In
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the supreme state is attained. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 715 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
But those who are engrossed in the bondage of Maya, lose the game of life. || 1 ||
My mind is in love with the Lord‟s lotus feet; I have met the Beloved Guru, the noble,
heroic being. Nanak celebrates in bliss; chanting and meditating on the Lord, all
sickness has been cured. || 2 || 10 || 15 ||
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

Oh! Oh! You cling to Maya, you fool; this is not a trivial matter. That which you consider
to be yours, is not yours. || Pause || You do not remember your Lord, even for an
instant. That which belongs to others, you believe to be your own. || 1 || The Naam,
the Name of the Lord, is always with you, but you do not enshrine it within your mind.
You have attached your consciousness to that which you must eventually abandon. || 2
|| You collect that which will bring you only hunger and thirst. You have not obtained
the supplies of the Ambrosial Naam. || 3 || You have fallen into the pit of sexual
desire, anger and emotional attachment. By Guru‟s Grace, O Nanak, a rare few are
saved. || 4 || 1 || 16 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: I have only the One Lord, my God. I
do not recognize any other. || Pause || By great good fortune, I have found my
Guru. The Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord within me. || 1 || The Name of
the Lord, Har, Har, is my meditation, austerity, fasting and daily religious practice.
Meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, I have found total joy and bliss. || 2 || The Praises
of the Lord are my good conduct, occupation and social class. Listening to the Kirtan of
the Lord‟s Praises, I am in absolute ecstasy. || 3 || Says Nanak, everything comes to
the homes of those who have found their Lord and Master. || 4 || 2 || 17 ||
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

My beautiful mind longs for the Love of the Lord. By mere words, the Lord‟s Love does
not come. || Pause || I have searched for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, looking
in each and every street. Meeting with the Guru, my doubts have been dispelled. || 1
|| I have obtained this wisdom from the Holy Saints, according to the pre-ordained
destiny inscribed upon my forehead. In this way, Nanak has seen the Lord with his
eyes. || 2 || 1 || 18 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: My foolish heart is in the grip of pride.
By the Will of my Lord God, Maya, like a witch, has swallowed by soul. || Pause ||
More and more, he continually yearns for more; but unless he is destined to receive,
how can he obtain it? He is entangled in wealth, bestowed by the Lord God; the
unfortunate one attaches himself to the fire of desires. || 1 || Listen, O mind, to the
Teachings of the Holy Saints, and all your sins shall be totally washed away. One who is
destined to receive from the Lord, O servant Nanak, shall not be cast into the womb of
reincarnation again. || 2 || 2 || 19 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 716 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Such is the blessing my God has bestowed upon me. He has totally banished the five
evils and the illness of egotism from my body. || Pause || Breaking my bonds, and
releasing me from vice and corruption, He has enshrined the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad within my heart. The Lord has not considered my beauty or ugliness; instead,
He has held me with love. I am drenched with His Love. || 1 || I behold my Beloved,
now that the curtain has been torn away. My mind is happy, pleased and satisfied. My
house is His; He is my God. Nanak is obedient to His Lord and Master. || 2 || 1 || 20 ||
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: O my mother, my mind is in love. This is my karma and my
Dharma; this is my meditation. The Lord‟s Name is my immaculate, unstained way of
life. || Pause || The Support of my breath of life, the wealth of my life, is to gaze
upon the Blessed Vision of God‟s Darshan. On the road, and on the river, these supplies
are always with me. I have made my mind the Lord‟s companion. || 1 || By the Grace
of the Saints, my mind has become immaculate and pure. In His mercy, He has made
me His own. Remembering, remembering Him in meditation, Nanak has found peace.
From the very beginning, and throughout the ages, He is the friend of His devotees. ||
2 || 2 || 21 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: Dear God, please meet me; You are my breath
of life. Do not let me forget You from my heart, even for an instant; please, bless Your
devotee with Your gift of perfection. || Pause || Dispel my doubt, and save me, O
my Beloved, all-knowing Lord, O Inner-knower, O Searcher of hearts. The wealth of the
Naam is worth millions of kingdoms to me; O God, please bless me with Your Ambrosial
Glance of Grace. || 1 || Twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. They
totally satisfy my ears, O my all-powerful Lord. I seek Your Sanctuary, O Lord, O Giver
of life to the soul; forever and ever, Nanak is a sacrifice to You. || 2 || 3 || 22 ||
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: O God, I am the dust of Your feet. O merciful to the meek,
Beloved mind-enticing Lord, by Your Kind Mercy, please fulfill my yearning. || Pause
|| In the ten directions, Your Praises are permeating and pervading, O Inner-knower,
Searcher of hearts, O Lord ever-present. Those who sing Your Praises, O Creator Lord,
those humble beings never die or grieve. || 1 || The worldly affairs and
entanglements of Maya disappear, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; all
sorrows are taken away. The comforts of wealth and the enjoyments of the soul — O
Nanak, without the Lord, know them to be false. || 2 || 4 || 23 || TODEE, FIFTH
MEHL: O my mother, my mind is so thirsty. I cannot survive, even for an instant,
without my Beloved. My mind is filled with the desire to behold the Blessed Vision of His
Darshan. || Pause || I meditate in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the
immaculate Creator Lord; all the sins and errors of my mind and body are washed
away. The Perfect Supreme Lord God, the eternal, imperishable Giver of peace —
spotless and pure are His Praises. || 1 || By the Grace of the Saints, my desires have
been fulfilled; in His Mercy, the Lord, the treasure of virtue, has met me. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 717 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Peace and tranquility, poise and pleasure, have welled up within my mind; millions of
suns, O Nanak, illuminate me. || 2 || 5 || 24 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord, Har,
Har, is the Purifier of sinners; He is the soul, the breath of life, the Giver of peace and
honor, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; He is pleasing to my mind. || Pause
|| He is beautiful and wise, clever and all-knowing. He dwells within the hearts of His
slaves; His devotees sing His Glorious Praises. His form is immaculate and pure; He is
the incomparable Lord and Master. Upon the field of actions and karma, whatever one
plants, one eats. || 1 || I am amazed, and wonder-struck by His wonder. There is
none other than Him. Meditating in remembrance on His Praises with my tongue, I live;
slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. || 2 || 6 || 25 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: O
my mother, Maya is so misleading and deceptive. Without meditating on the Lord of the
Universe, it is like straw on fire, or the shadow of a cloud, or the running of the floodwaters. || Pause || Renounce your cleverness and all your mental tricks; with your
palms pressed together, walk on the Path of the Holy Saints. Remember the Lord, the
Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; this is the most sublime reward of this human
incarnation. || 1 || The Holy Saints preach the teachings of the Vedas, but the
unfortunate fools do not understand them. Servant Nanak is absorbed in loving
devotional worship; meditating in remembrance on the Lord, one‟s dirt is burnt away.
|| 2 || 7 || 26 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: O mother, the Guru‟s feet are so sweet. By
great good fortune, the Transcendent Lord has blessed me with them. Millions of
rewards come from the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan. || Pause || Singing
the Glorious Praises of the imperishable, indestructible Lord, sexual desire, anger and
stubborn pride vanish. Those who are imbued with the Love of the True Lord become
permanent and eternal; birth and death do not grind them down any more. || 1 ||
Without the Lord‟s meditation, all joys and pleasures are totally false and worthless; by
the Kind Mercy of the Saints, I know this. Servant Nanak has found the jewel of the
Naam; without the Naam, all must depart, cheated and plundered. || 2 || 8 || 27 ||
TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I contemplate
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. I am in peaceful poise and bliss, day and night; the
seed of my destiny has sprouted. || Pause || I have met the True Guru, by great
good fortune; He has no end or limitation. Taking His humble servant by the hand, He
pulls him out of the poisonous world-ocean. || 1 || Birth and death are ended for me,
by the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings; I shall no longer pass through the door of pain
and suffering. Nanak holds tight to the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master; again and
again, he bows in humility and reverence to Him. || 2 || 9 || 28 || TODEE, FIFTH
MEHL: O my mother, my mind is at peace. I enjoy the ecstasy of millions of princely
pleasures; remembering the Lord in meditation, all pains have been dispelled. || 1 ||
Pause || The sinful residues of millions of lifetimes are erased, by meditating on the
Lord; becoming pure, my mind and body have found peace. Gazing upon the Lord‟s
form of perfect beauty, my hopes have been fulfilled; attaining the Blessed Vision of His
Darshan, my hunger has been appeased. || 1 || The four great blessings, the eight
supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, the wish-fulfilling Elysian cow, and the
wish-fulfilling tree of life — all these come from the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak, holding
tight to the Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of peace, you shall not suffer the pains of
birth and death, or fall into the womb of reincarnation again. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 718 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 2 || 10 || 29 || TODEE, FIFTH MEHL: I have enshrined the Lord‟s Feet within my
heart. Contemplating my Lord and Master, my True Guru, all my affairs have been
resolved. || 1 || Pause || The merits of giving donations to charity and devotional
worship come from the Kirtan of the Praises of the Transcendent Lord; this is the true
essence of wisdom. Singing the Praises of the unapproachable, infinite Lord and Master,
I have found immeasurable peace. || 1 || The Supreme Lord God does not consider
the merits and demerits of those humble beings whom He makes His own. Hearing,
chanting and meditating on the jewel of the Naam, I live; Nanak wears the Lord as his
necklace. || 2 || 11 || 30 ||
TODEE, NINTH MEHL:

What can I say about my base nature? I am entangled in the love of gold and women,
and I have not sung the Kirtan of God‟s Praises. || 1 || Pause || I judge the false
world to be true, and I have fallen in love with it. I have never contemplated the friend
of the poor, who shall be my companion and helper in the end. || 1 || I remain
intoxicated by Maya, night and day, and the filth of my mind will not depart. Says
Nanak, now, without the Lord‟s Sanctuary, I cannot find salvation in any other way. ||
2 || 1 || 31 ||
TODEE, THE WORD OF THE DEVOTEES:

Some say that He is near, and others say that He is far away. We might just as well say
that the fish climbs out of the water, up the tree. || 1 || Why do you speak such
nonsense? One who has found the Lord, keeps quiet about it. || 1 || Pause || Those
who become Pandits, religious scholars, recite the Vedas, but foolish Naam Dayv knows
only the Lord. || 2 || 1 || Whose blemishes remain, when one chants the Lord‟s
Name? Sinners become pure, chanting the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || Pause || With the
Lord, servant Naam Dayv has come to have faith. I have stopped fasting on the
eleventh day of each month; why should I bother to go on pilgrimages to sacred
shrines? || 1 || Prays Naam Dayv, I have become a man of good deeds and good
thoughts. Chanting the Lord‟s Name, under Guru‟s Instructions, who has not gone to
heaven? || 2 || 2 || Here is a verse with a three-fold play on words. || 1 || Pause ||
In the potter‟s home there are pots, and in the king‟s home there are camels. In the
Brahmin‟s home there are widows. So here they are: haandee, saandee, raandee. || 1
|| In the home of the grocer there is asafoetida; on the forehead of the buffalo there
are horns. In the temple of Shiva there are lingams. So here they are: heeng, seeng,
leeng. || 2 || In the house of the oil-presser there is oil; in the forest there are vines.
In the gardener‟s home there are bananas. So here they are: tayl, bayl, kayl. || 3 ||
The Lord of the Universe, Govind, is within His Saints; Krishna, Shyaam, is in Gokal. The
Lord, Raam, is in Naam Dayv. So here they are: Raam, Shyaam, Govind. || 4 || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 719 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
RAAG BAIRAAREE, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Listen, O mind, to the Unspoken Speech of the Lord‟s Name. Riches, wisdom,
supernatural spiritual powers and peace are obtained, by vibrating, meditating on the
Lord God, under Guru‟s Instruction. || 1 || Pause || Numerous legends, the
Puraanas, and the six Shaastras, sing the sublime Praises of the Lord. Shiva and the
thirty-three million gods meditate on the Lord, but they do not know the secret of His
mystery. || 1 || The angelic and divine beings, and the celestial singers sing His
Praises; all Creation sings of Him. O Nanak, those whom the Lord blesses with His Kind
Mercy, become the good Saints of the Lord God. || 2 || 1 || BAIRAAREE, FOURTH
MEHL: O mind, those who meet the Lord‟s humble servants, sing His Praises. They are
blessed with the gift of the jewel of the Lord, Har, Har, the sublime jewel of the Lord,
by the Guru, the True Guru. || 1 || Pause || I offer my mind, body and everything to
that humble being who recites the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. I offer my wealth, the
riches of Maya and my property to that one who leads me to meet the Lord, my friend.
|| 1 || When the Lord of the world bestowed just a tiny bit of His Mercy, for just an
instant, then I meditated on the Praise of the Lord, Har, Har, Har. The Lord and Master
has met servant Nanak, and the pain of the sickness of egotism has been eliminated. ||
2 || 2 || BAIRAAREE, FOURTH MEHL: The Lord‟s humble servant sings the Glorious
Praises of the Lord‟s Name. Even if someone slanders the Lord‟s humble servant, he
does not give up his own goodness. || 1 || Pause || Whatever the Lord and Master
does, He does by Himself; the Lord Himself does the deeds. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 720 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Lord and Master Himself imparts understanding; the Lord Himself inspires us to
speak. || 1 || The Lord Himself directs the evolution of the world of the five elements;
He Himself infuses the five senses into it. O servant Nanak, the Lord Himself unites us
with the True Guru; He Himself resolves the conflicts. || 2 || 3 || BAIRAAREE,
FOURTH MEHL: Chant the Name of the Lord, O mind, and you shall be emancipated.
The Lord shall destroy all the sins of millions upon millions of incarnations, and carry
you across the terrifying world-ocean. || 1 || Pause || In the body-village, the Lord
Master abides; the Lord is without fear, without vengeance, and without form. The Lord
is dwelling near at hand, but He cannot be seen. By the Guru‟s Teachings, the Lord is
obtained. || 1 || The Lord Himself is the banker, the jeweller, the jewel, the gem; the
Lord Himself created the entire expanse of the creation. O Nanak, one who is blessed
by the Lord‟s Kind Mercy, trades in the Lord‟s Name; He alone is the true banker, the
true trader. || 2 || 4 || BAIRAAREE, FOURTH MEHL: Meditate, O mind, on the
immaculate, formless Lord. Forever and ever, meditate on the Lord, the Giver of peace;
He has no end or limitation. || 1 || Pause || In the fiery pit of the womb, when you
were hanging upside-down, the Lord absorbed You in His Love, and preserved You. So
serve such a Lord, O my mind; the Lord shall deliver you in the end. || 1 || Bow down
in reverence to that humble being, within whose heart the Lord, Har, Har, abides. By
the Lord‟s Kind Mercy, O Nanak, one obtains the Lord‟s meditation, and the support of
the Naam. || 2 || 5 || BAIRAAREE, FOURTH MEHL: O my mind, chant the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har; meditate on it continually. You shall obtain the fruits of your heart‟s
desires, and pain shall never touch you again. || 1 || Pause || That is chanting, that
is deep meditation and austerity, that is fasting and worship, which inspires love for the
Lord. Without the Lord‟s Love, every other love is false; in an instant, it is all forgotten.
|| 1 || You are infinite, the Master of all power; Your value cannot be described at all.
Nanak has come to Your Sanctuary, O Dear Lord; as it pleases You, save him. || 2 || 6
||
RAAG BAIRAAREE, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

Meeting with the humble Saints, sing the Praises of the Lord. The pains of millions of
incarnations shall be eradicated. || 1 || Pause || Whatever your mind desires, that
you shall obtain. By His Kind Mercy, the Lord blesses us with His Name. || 1 || All
happiness and greatness are in the Lord‟s Name. By Guru‟s Grace, Nanak has gained
this understanding. || 2 || 1 || 7 ||
