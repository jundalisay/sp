MARU, FIRST MEHL, DAKHANEE: Deep within the body-village is the fortress. The dwelling of the True Lord
is within the city of the Tenth Gate. This place is permanent and forever immaculate.
He Himself created it. || 1 || Within the fortress are balconies and bazaars. He
Himself takes care of His merchandise. The hard and heavy doors of the Tenth Gate are
closed and locked. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they are thrown open. || 2
|| Within the fortress is the cave, the home of the self. He established the nine gates
of this house, by His Command and His Will. In the Tenth Gate, the Primal Lord, the
unknowable and infinite dwells; the unseen Lord reveals Himself. || 3 || Within the
body of air, water and fire, the One Lord dwells. He Himself stages His wondrous
dramas and plays. By His Grace, water puts out the burning fire; He Himself stores it up
in the watery ocean. || 4 || Creating the earth, He established it as the home of
Dharma. Creating and destroying, He remains unattached. He stages the play of the
breath everywhere. Withdrawing His power, He lets the beings crumble. || 5 || Your
gardener is the vast vegetation of nature. The wind blowing around is the chauree, the
fly-brush, waving over You. The Lord placed the two lamps, the sun and the moon; the
sun merges in the house of the moon. || 6 || The five birds do not fly wild. The tree
of life is fruitful, bearing the fruit of Ambrosial Nectar. The Gurmukh intuitively sings the
Glorious Praises of the Lord; he eats the food of the Lord‟s sublime essence. || 7 ||
The dazzling light glitters, although neither the moon nor the stars are shining; neither
the sun‟s rays nor the lightning flashes across the sky. I describe the indescribable
state, which has no sign, where the all-pervading Lord is still pleasing to the mind. || 8
|| The rays of Divine Light have spread out their brilliant radiance. Having created the
creation, the Merciful Lord Himself gazes upon it. The sweet, melodious, unstruck sound
current vibrates continuously in the home of the fearless Lord. 

|| 9 || When the unstruck sound current resounds, doubt and fear run away. God is
all-pervading, giving shade to all. All belong to You; to the Gurmukhs, You are known.
Singing Your Praises, they look beautiful in Your Court. || 10 || He is the Primal Lord,
immaculate and pure. I know of no other at all. The One Universal Creator Lord dwells
within, and is pleasing to the mind of those who banishe egotism and pride. || 11 || I
drink in the Ambrosial Nectar, given by the True Guru. I do not know any other second
or third. He is the One, Unique, Infinite and Endless Lord; He evaluates all beings and
places some in His treasury. || 12 || Spiritual wisdom and meditation on the True
Lord are deep and profound. No one knows Your expanse. All that are, beg from You;
You are attained only by Your Grace. || 13 || You hold karma and Dharma in Your
hands, O True Lord. O Independent Lord, Your treasures are inexhaustible. You are
forever kind and compassionate, God. You unite in Your Union. || 14 || You Yourself
see, and cause Yourself to be seen. You Yourself establish, and You Yourself
disestablish. The Creator Himself unites and separates; He Himself kills and
rejuvenates. || 15 || As much as there is, is contained within You. You gaze upon
Your creation, sitting within Your royal palace. Nanak offers this true prayer; gazing
upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, I have found peace. || 16 || 1 || 13 ||
MARU, FIRST MEHL: If I am pleasing to You, Lord, then I obtain the Blessed Vision of
Your Darshan. In loving devotional worship, O True Lord, I sing Your Glorious Praises.
By Your Will, O Creator Lord, You have become pleasing to me, and so sweet to my
tongue. || 1 || The devotees look beautiful in the Darbaar, the Court of God. Your
slaves, Lord, are liberated. Eradicating self-conceit, they are attuned to Your Love; night
and day, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 2 || Shiva, Brahma,
gods and goddesses, Indra, ascetics and silent sages serve You. Celibates, givers of
charity and the many forest-dwellers have not found the Lord‟s limits. || 3 || No one
knows You, unless You let them know You. Whatever is done, is by Your Will. You
created the 8.4 million species of beings; by Your Will, they draw their breath. || 4 ||
Whatever is pleasing to Your Will, undoubtedly comes to pass. The self-willed manmukh
shows off, and comes to grief. Forgetting the Name, he finds no place of rest; coming
and going in reincarnation, he suffers in pain. || 5 || Pure is the body, and
immaculate is the swan-soul; within it is the immaculate essence of the Naam. Such a
being drinks in all his pains like Ambrosial Nectar; he never suffers sorrow again. || 6 ||
For his excessive indulgences, he receives only pain; from his enjoyments, he contracts
diseases, and in the end, he wastes away. His pleasure can never erase his pain;
without accepting the Lord‟s Will, he wanders lost and confused. || 7 || Without
spiritual wisdom, they all just wander around. The True Lord is pervading and
permeating everywhere, lovingly engaged. The Fearless Lord is known through the
Shabad, the Word of the True Guru; one‟s light merges into the Light. || 8 || He is
the eternal, unchanging, immeasurable Lord. In an instant, He destroys, ang then
reconstructs. He has no form or shape, no limit or value. 

Pierced by the Shabad, one is satisfied. || 9 || I am the slave of Your slaves, O my
Beloved. The seekers of Truth and goodness contemplate You. Whoever believes in the
Name, wins; He Himself implants Truth within. || 10 || The Truest of the True has the
Truth is His lap. The True Lord is pleased with those who love the Shabad. Exerting His
power, the Lord has established Truth throughout the three worlds; with Truth He is
pleased. || 11 || Everyone calls Him the greatest of the great. Without the Guru, no
one understands Him. The True Lord is pleased with those who merge in Truth; they
are not separated again, and they do not suffer. || 12 || Separated from the Primal
Lord, they loudly weep and wail. They die and die, only to be reborn, when their time
has passed. He blesses those whom He forgives with glorious greatness; united with
Him, they do not regret or repent. || 13 || He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself
is the Enjoyer. He Himself is satisfied, and He Himself is liberated. The Lord of liberation
Himself grants liberation; He eradicates possessiveness and attachment. || 14 || I
consider Your gifts to be the most wonderful gifts. You are the Cause of causes,
Almighty Infinite Lord. Creating the creation, You gaze upon what You have created;
You cause all to do their deeds. || 15 || They alone sing Your Glorious Praises, who
are pleasing to You, O True Lord. They issue forth from You, and merge again into You.
Nanak offers this true prayer; meeting with the True Lord, peace is obtained. || 16 || 2
|| 14 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: For endless eons, there was only utter darkness. There
was no earth or sky; there was only the infinite Command of His Hukam. There was no
day or night, no moon or sun; God sat in primal, profound Samaadhi. || 1 || There
were no sources of creation or powers of speech, no air or water. There was no
creation or destruction, no coming or going. There were no continents, nether regions,
seven seas, rivers or flowing water. || 2 || There were no heavenly realms, earth or
nether regions of the underworld. There was no heaven or hell, no death or time. There
was no hell or heaven, no birth or death, no coming or going in reincarnation. || 3 ||
There was no Brahma, Vishnu or Shiva. No one was seen, except the One Lord. There
was no female or male, no social class or caste of birth; no one experienced pain or
pleasure. || 4 || There were no people of celibacy or charity; no one lived in the
forests. There were no Siddhas or seekers, no one living in peace. There were no Yogis,
no wandering pilgrims, no religious robes; no one called himself the master. || 5 ||
There was no chanting or meditation, no self-discipline, fasting or worship. No one
spoke or talked in duality. He created Himself, and rejoiced; He evaluates Himself. || 6
|| There was no purification, no self-restraint, no malas of basil seeds. There were no
Gopis, no Krishna, no cows or cowherds. There were no tantras, no mantras and no
hypocrisy; no one played the flute. || 7 || There was no karma, no Dharma, no
buzzing fly of Maya. Social class and birth were not seen with any eyes. There was no
noose of attachment, no death inscribed upon the forehead; no one meditated on
anything. || 8 || There was no slander, no seed, no soul and no life. There was no
Gorakh and no Maachhindra. 

There was no spiritual wisdom or meditation, no ancestry or creation, no reckoning of
accounts. || 9 || There were no castes or social classes, no religious robes, no
Brahmin or Kh‟shaatriya. There were no demi-gods or temples, no cows or Gaayatri
prayer. There were no burnt offerings, no ceremonial feasts, no cleansing rituals at
sacred shrines of pilgrimage; no one worshipped in adoration. || 10 || There was no
Mullah, there was no Qazi. There was no Shaykh, or pilgrims to Mecca. There was no
king or subjects, and no worldly egotism; no one spoke of himself. || 11 || There was
no love or devotion, no Shiva or Shakti — no energy or matter. There were no friends
or companions, no semen or blood. He Himself is the banker, and He Himself is the
merchant. Such is the Pleasure of the Will of the True Lord. || 12 || There were no
Vedas, Korans or Bibles, no Simritees or Shaastras. There was no recitation of the
Puraanas, no sunrise or sunset. The Unfathomable Lord Himself was the speaker and
the preacher; the unseen Lord Himself saw everything. || 13 || When He so willed,
He created the world. Without any supporting power, He sustained the universe. He
created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva; He fostered enticement and attachment to Maya. ||
14 || How rare is that person who listens to the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. He
created the creation, and watches over it; the Hukam of His Command is over all. He
formed the planets, solar systems and nether regions, and brought what was hidden to
manifestation. || 15 || No one knows His limits. This understanding comes from the
Perfect Guru. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Truth are wonderstruck; singing
His Glorious Praises, they are filled with wonder. || 16 || 3 || 15 || MARU, FIRST
MEHL: He Himself created the creation, remaining unattached. The Merciful Lord has
established His True Home. Binding together air, water and fire, He created the fortress
of the body. || 1 || The Creator established the nine gates. In the Tenth Gate, is the
dwelling of the infinite, unseen Lord. The seven seas are overflowing with the Ambrosial
Water; the Gurmukhs are not stained with filth. || 2 || The lamps of the sun and the
moon fill all with light. Creating them, He beholds His own glorious greatness. The Giver
of peace is forever the embodiment of Light; from the True Lord, glory is obtained. || 3
|| Within the fortress are the stores and markets; the business is transacted there.
The Supreme Merchant weighs with the perfect weights. He Himself buys the jewel,
and He Himself appraises its value. || 4 || The Appraiser appraises its value. The
Independent Lord is overflowing with His treasures. He holds all powers, He is allpervading; how few are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this. || 5 || When He
bestows His Glance of Grace, one meets the Perfect Guru. The tyrannical Messenger of
Death cannot strike him then. He blossoms forth like the lotus flower in the water; he
blossoms forth in joyful meditation. || 6 || He Himself rains down the Ambrosial
Stream of jewels, diamonds, and rubies of priceless value. When they meet the True
Guru, then they find the Perfect Lord; they obtain the treasure of Love. || 7 ||
Whoever receives the priceless treasure of Love — his weight never decreases; he has
perfect weight. The trader of Truth becomes true, and obtains the merchandise. || 8 ||
How rare are those who obtain the true merchandise. 

Meeting the Perfect True Guru, one meets with the Lord. One who becomes Gurmukh
realizes the Hukam of His command; surrendering to His Command, one merges in the
Lord. || 9 || By His Command we come, and by His command we merge into Him
again. By His Command, the world was formed. By His Command, the heavens, this
world and the nether regions were created; by His Command, His Power supports them.
|| 10 || The Hukam of His Command is the mythical bull which supports the burden of
the earth on its head. By His Hukam, air, water and fire came into being. By His Hukam,
one dwells in the house of matter and energy — Shiva and Shakti. By His Hukam, He
plays His plays. || 11 || By the Hukam of His command, the sky is spread above. By
His Hukam, His creatures dwell in the water, on the land and throughout the three
worlds. By His Hukam, we draw our breath and receive our food; by His Hukam, He
watches over us, and inspires us to see. || 12 || By His Hukam, He created His ten
incarnations, and the uncounted and infinite gods and devils. Whoever obeys the
Hukam of His Command, is robed with honor in the Court of the Lord; united with the
Truth, He merges in the Lord. || 13 || By the Hukam of His Command, the thirty-six
ages passed. By His Hukam, the Siddhas and seekers contemplate Him. The Lord
Himself has brought all under His control. Whoever He forgives, is liberated. || 14 ||
In the strong fortress of the body with its beautiful doors, is the king, with his special
assistants and ministers. Those gripped by falsehood and greed do not dwell in the
celestial home; engrossed in greed and sin, they come to regret and repent. || 15 ||
Truth and contentment govern this body-village. Chastity, truth and self-control are in
the Sanctuary of the Lord. O Nanak, one intuitively meets the Lord, the Life of the
World; the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad brings honor. || 16 || 4 || 16 || MARU, FIRST
MEHL: In the Primal Void, the Infinite Lord assumed His Power. He Himself is
unattached, infinite and incomparable. He Himself exercised His Creative Power, and He
gazes upon His creation; from the Primal Void, He formed the Void. || 1 || From this
Primal Void, He fashioned air and water. He created the universe, and the king in the
fortress of the body. Your Light pervades fire, water and souls; Your Power rests in the
Primal Void. || 2 || From this Primal Void, Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva issued forth.
This Primal Void is pervasive throughout all the ages. That humble being who
contemplates this state is perfect; meeting with him, doubt is dispelled. || 3 || From
this Primal Void, the seven seas were established. The One who created them, Himself
contemplates them. That human being who becomes Gurmukh, who bathes in the pool
of Truth, is not cast into the womb of reincarnation again. || 4 || From this Primal
Void, came the moon, the sun and the earth. His Light pervades all the three worlds.
The Lord of this Primal Void is unseen, infinite and immaculate; He is absorbed in the
Primal Trance of Deep Meditation. || 5 || From this Primal Void, the earth and the
Akaashic Ethers were created. He supports them without any visible support, by
exercising His True Power. He fashioned the three worlds, and the rope of Maya; He
Himself creates and destroys. || 6 || From this Primal Void, came the four sources of
creation, and the power of speech. They were created from the Void, and they will
merge into the Void. The Supreme Creator created the play of Nature; through the
Word of His Shabad, He stages His Wondrous Show. || 7 || From this Primal Void, He
made both night and day; creation and destruction, pleasure and pain. The Gurmukh is
immortal, untouched by pleasure and pain. 

He obtains the home of his own inner being. || 8 || The Saam Veda, the Rig Veda,
the Jujar Veda and the At‟harva Veda form the mouth of Brahma; they speak of the
three gunas, the three qualities of Maya. None of them can describe His worth. We
speak as He inspires us to speak. || 9 || From the Primal Void, He created the seven
nether regions. From the Primal Void, He established this world to lovingly dwell upon
Him. The Infinite Lord Himself created the creation. Everyone acts as You make them
act, Lord. || 10 || Your Power is diffused through the three gunas: raajas, taamas and
satva. Through egotism, they suffer the pains of birth and death. Those blessed by His
Grace become Gurmukh; they attain the fourth state, and are liberated. || 11 || From
the Primal Void, the ten incarnations welled up. Creating the Universe, He made the
expanse. He fashioned the demi-gods and demons, the heavenly heralds and celestial
musicians; everyone acts according to their past karma. || 12 || The Gurmukh
understands, and does not suffer the disease. How rare are those who understand this
ladder of the Guru. Throughout the ages, they are dedicated to liberation, and so they
become liberated; thus they are honored. || 13 || From the Primal Void, the five
elements became manifest. They joined to form the body, which engages in actions.
Both bad and good are written on the forehead, the seeds of vice and virtue. || 14 ||
The True Guru, the Primal Being, is sublime and detached. Attuned to the Word of the
Shabad, He is intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord. Riches, intellect,
miraculous spiritual powers and spiritual wisdom are obtained from the Guru; through
perfect destiny, they are received. || 15 || This mind is so in love with Maya. Only a
few are spiritually wise enough to understand and know this. In hope and desire,
egotism and skepticism, the greedy man acts falsely. || 16 || From the True Guru,
contemplative meditation is obtained. And then, one dwells with the True Lord in His
celestial home, the Primal State of Absorption in Deepest Samaadhi. O Nanak, the
immaculate sound current of the Naad, and the Music of the Shabad resound; one
merges into the True Name of the Lord. || 17 || 5 || 17 || MARU, FIRST MEHL:
Wherever I look, I see the Lord, merciful to the meek. God is compassionate; He does
not come or go in reincarnation. He pervades all beings in His mysterious way; the
Sovereign Lord remains detached. || 1 || The world is a reflection of Him; He has no
father or mother. He has not acquired any sister or brother. There is no creation or
destruction for Him; He has no ancestry or social status. The Ageless Lord is pleasing to
my mind. || 2 || You are the Deathless Primal Being. Death does not hover over Your
head. You are the unseen inaccessible and detached Primal Lord. You are true and
content; the Word of Your Shabad is cool and soothing. Through it, we are lovingly,
intuitively attuned to You. || 3 || The three qualities are pervasive; the Lord dwells in
His home, the fourth state. He has made death and birth into a bite of food. The
immaculate Light is the Life of the whole world. The Guru reveals the unstruck melody
of the Shabad. || 4 || Sublime and good are those humble Saints, the Beloveds of the
Lord. They are intoxicated with the sublime essence of the Lord, and are carried across
to the other side. Nanak is the dust of the Society of the Saints; by Guru‟s Grace, he
finds the Lord. || 5 || 

You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. All beings belong to You. You are the
Great Giver; I am Your slave. Please be merciful and bless me with Your Ambrosial
Naam, and the jewel, the lamp of the Guru‟s spiritual wisdom. || 6 || From the union
of the five elements, this body was made. Finding the Lord, the Supreme Soul, peace is
established. The good karma of past actions brings fruitful rewards, and man is blessed
with the jewel of the Lord‟s Name. || 7 || His mind does not feel any hunger or thirst.
He knows the Immaculate Lord to be everywhere, in each and every heart. Imbued
with the Lord‟s Ambrosial essence, he becomes a pure, detached renunciate; he is
lovingly absorbed in the Guru‟s Teachings. || 8 || Whoever does the deeds of the
soul, day and night, sees the immaculate Divine Light deep within. Enraptured with the
delightful essence of the Shabad, the source of nectar, my tongue plays the sweet
music of the flute. || 9 || He alone plays the sweet music of this flute, who knows the
three worlds. O Nanak, know this, through the Guru‟s Teachings, and lovingly focus
yourself on the Lord‟s Name. || 10 || Rare are those beings in this world, who
contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and remain detached. They save
themselves, and save all their associates and ancestors; fruitful is their birth and coming
into this world. || 11 || He alone knows the home of his own heart, and the door to
the temple, who obtains perfect understanding from the Guru. In the body-fortress is
the palace; God is the True Master of this Palace. The True Lord established His True
Throne there. || 12 || The fourteen realms and the two lamps are the witnesses. The
Lord‟s servants, the self-elect, do not taste the poison of corruption. Deep within, is the
priceless, incomparable commodity; meeting with the Guru, the wealth of the Lord is
obtained. || 13 || He alone sits on the throne, who is worthy of the throne. Following
the Guru‟s Teachings, he subdues the five demons, and becomes the Lord‟s foot soldier.
He has existed from the very beginning of time and throughout the ages; He exists
here and now, and will always exist. Meditating on Him, skepticism and doubt are
dispelled. || 14 || The Lord of the Throne is greeted and worshipped day and night.
This true glorious greatness comes to those who love the Guru‟s Teachings. O Nanak,
meditate on the Lord, and swim across the river; they find the Lord, their best friend, in
the end. || 15 || 1 || 18 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: Gather in the wealth of the Lord, O
humble Siblings of Destiny. Serve the True Guru, and remain in His Sanctuary. This
wealth cannot be stolen; the celestial melody of the Shabad wells up and keeps us
awake and aware. || 1 || You are the One Universal Creator, the Immaculate King.
You Yourself arrange and resolve the affairs of Your humble servant. You are immortal,
immovable, infinite and priceless; O Lord, Your place is beautiful and eternal. || 2 ||
In the body-village, the most sublime place, the supremely noble people dwell. Above
them is the Immaculate Lord, the One Universal Creator; they are lovingly absorbed in
the profound, primal state of Samaadhi. || 3 || There are nine gates to the bodyvillage; the Creator Lord fashioned them for each and every person. Within the Tenth
Gate, dwells the Primal Lord, detached and unequalled. The unknowable reveals
Himself. || 4 || The Primal Lord cannot be held to account; True is His Celestial Court.
The Hukam of His Command is in effect; True is His Insignia. 

O Nanak, search and examine your own home, and you shall find the Supreme Soul,
and the Name of the Lord. || 5 || The Primal Lord is everywhere, immaculate and allknowing. He administers justice, and is absorbed in the spiritual wisdom of the Guru.
He seizes sexual desire and anger by their necks, and kills them; He eradicates egotism
and greed. || 6 || In the True Place, the Formless Lord abides. Whoever understands
his own self, contemplates the Word of the Shabad. He comes to abide deep within the
True Mansion of His Presence, and his comings and goings are ended. || 7 || His
mind does not waver, and he is not buffeted by the winds of desire. Such a Yogi
vibrates the unstruck sound current of the Shabad. God Himself plays the pure music of
the Panch Shabad, the five primal sounds to hear. || 8 || In the Fear of God, in
detachment, one intuitively merges into the Lord. Renouncing egotism, he is imbued
with the unstruck sound current. With the ointment of enlightenment, the Immaculate
Lord is known; the Immaculate Lord King is pervading everywhere. || 9 || God is
eternal and imperishable; He is the Destroyer of pain and fear. He cures the disease,
and cuts away the noose of death. O Nanak, the Lord God is the Destroyer of fear;
meeting the Guru, the Lord God is found. || 10 || One who knows the Immaculate
Lord chews up death. One who understands karma, realizes the Word of the Shabad.
He Himself knows, and He Himself realizes. This whole world is all His play. || 11 ||
He Himself is the Banker, and He Himself is the Merchant. The Appraiser Himself
appraises. He Himself tests upon His Touchstone, and He Himself estimates the value.
|| 12 || God Himself, the Merciful Lord, grants His Grace. The Gardener pervades and
permeates each and every heart. The pure, primal, detached Lord abides within all. The
Guru, the Lord Incarnate, leads us to meet the Lord God. || 13 || God is wise and allknowing; He purges men of their pride. Eradicating duality, the One Lord reveals
Himself. Such a being remains unattached amidst hope, singing the Praise of the
Immaculate Lord, who has no ancestry. || 14 || Eradicating egotism, he obtains the
peace of the Shabad. He alone is spiritually wise, who contemplates his own self. O
Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the true profit is obtained; in the Sat
Sangat, the True Congregation, the fruit of Truth is obtained. || 15 || 2 || 19 ||
MARU, FIRST MEHL: Speak the Truth, and remain in the home of Truth. Remain dead
while yet alive, and cross over the terrifying world-ocean. The Guru is the boat, the
ship, the raft; meditating on the Lord in your mind, you shall be carried across to the
other side. || 1 || Eliminating egotism, possessiveness and greed, one is liberated
from the nine gates, and obtains a place in the Tenth Gate. Lofty and high, the farthest
of the far and infinite, He created Himself. || 2 || Receiving the Guru‟s Teachings, and
lovingly attuned to the Lord, one crosses over. Singing the Praises of the absolute Lord,
why should anyone be afraid of death? Wherever I look, I see only You; I do not sing of
any other at all. || 3 || True is the Lord‟s Name, and True is His Sanctuary. True is
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, grasping it, one is carries across. Speaking the
Unspoken, one sees the Infinite Lord, and then, he does not have to enter the womb of
reincarnation again. || 4 || Without the Truth, no one finds sincerity or contentment.
Without the Guru, no one is liberated; coming and going in reincarnation continue.
Chanting the Mool Mantra, and the Name of the Lord, the source of nectar, says Nanak,
I have found the Perfect Lord. 

|| 5 || Without the Truth, the terrifying world-ocean cannot be crossed. This ocean is
vast and unfathomable; it is overflowing with the worst poison. One who receives the
Guru‟s Teachings, and remains aloof and detached, obtains a place in the home of the
Fearless Lord. || 6 || False is the cleverness of loving attachment to the world. In no
time at all, it comes and goes. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the proud
egotistical people depart; in creation and destruction they are wasted away. || 7 || In
creation and destruction, they are bound in bondage. The noose of egotism and Maya is
around their necks. Whoever does not accept the Guru‟s Teachings, and does not dwell
upon the Lord‟s Name, is bound and bagged, and dragged into the City of Death. || 8
|| Without the Guru, how can anyone be emancipated or liberated? Without the Guru,
how can anyone meditate on the Lord‟s Name? Accepting the Guru‟s Teachings, cross
over the arduous, terrifying world-ocean; you shall be emancipated, and find peace. ||
9 || Through the Guru‟s Teachings, Krishna lifted up the mountain of Govardhan.
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, Rama floated stones across the ocean. Accepting the
Guru‟s Teachings, the supreme status is obtained; O Nanak, the Guru eradicates doubt.
|| 10 || Accepting the Guru‟s Teachings, cross over to the other side through Truth. O
soul, remember the Lord within your heart. The noose of death is cut away, meditating
on the Lord; you shall obtain the Immaculate Lord, who has no ancestry. || 11 ||
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Holy become one‟s friends and Siblings of Destiny.
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the inner fire is subdued and extinguished. Chant the
Naam with your mind and mouth; know the unknowable Lord, the Life of the World,
deep within the nucleus of your heart. || 12 || The Gurmukh understands, and is
pleased with the Word of the Shabad. Who does he praise or slander? Know yourself,
and meditate on the Lord of the Universe; let your mind be pleased with the Lord, the
Master of the Universe. || 13 || Know the One who pervades all the realms of the
universe. As Gurmukh, understand and realize the Shabad. The Enjoyer enjoys each
and every heart, and yet He remains detached from all. || 14 || Through the Guru‟s
Teachings, chant the Pure Praises of the Lord. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, behold
the lofty Lord with your eyes. Whoever listens to the Lord‟s Name, and the Word of His
Bani, O Nanak, is imbued with the color of the Lord‟s Love. || 15 || 3 || 20 || MARU,
FIRST MEHL: Leave behind sexual desire, anger and the slander of others. Renounce
greed and possessiveness, and become carefree. Break the chains of doubt, and remain
unattached; you shall find the Lord, and the Lord‟s sublime essence, deep within
yourself. || 1 || As one sees the flash of lightning in the night, see the Divine Light
deep within your nucleus, day and night. The Lord, the embodiment of bliss,
incomparably beautiful, reveals the Perfect Guru. || 2 || So meet with the True Guru,
and God Himself will save you. He placed the lamps of the sun and the moon in the
home of the sky. See the invisible Lord, and remain absorbed in loving devotion. God is
all throughout the three worlds. || 3 || Obtaining the sublime ambrosial essence,
desire and fear are dispelled. The state of inspired illumination is obtained, and selfconceit is eradicated. The lofty and exalted state, the highest of the high is obtained,
practicing the immaculate Word of the Shabad. || 4 || The Naam, the Name of the
invisible and unfathomable Lord, is infinite. 

The sublime essence of the Beloved Naam is utterly sweet. O Lord, please bless Nanak
with Your Praise in each and every age; meditating on the Lord, I cannot find His limits.
|| 5 || With the Naam deep within the nucleus of the self, the jewel is obtained.
Meditating on the Lord, the mind is comforted and consoled by the mind itself. On that
most difficult path, the Destroyer of fear is found, and one does not have to enter the
womb of reincarnation again. || 6 || Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
inspiration for loving devotional worship wells up. I beg for the treasure of the Naam,
and the Lord‟s Praise. When it pleases the Lord, He unites me in Union with the Guru;
the Lord saves the whole world. || 7 || One who chants the Lord‟s Chant, attains the
Wisdom of the True Guru. The tyrant, the Messenger of Death, becomes a servant at
his feet. In the noble congregation of the Sangat, one‟s state and way of life become
noble as well, and one crosses over the terrifying world-ocean. || 8 || Through the
Shabad, one crosses over this terrifying world-ocean. The duality within is burnt away
from within. Taking up the five arrows of virtue, Death is killed, drawing the Bow of the
Tenth Gate in the Mind‟s Sky. || 9 || How can the faithless cynics attain enlightened
awareness of the Shabad? Without awareness of the Shabad, they come and go in
reincarnation. O Nanak, the Gurmukh obtains the support of liberation; by perfect
destiny, he meets the Lord. || 10 || The Fearless True Guru is our Savior and
Protector. Devotional worship is obtained through the Guru, the Lord of the world. The
blissful music of the unstruck sound current vibrates and resounds; through the Word
of the Guru‟s Shabad, the Immaculate Lord is obtained. || 11 || He alone is fearless,
who has no destiny written on His head. God Himself is unseen; He reveals Himself
through His wondrous creative power. He Himself is unattached, unborn and selfexistent. O Nanak, through the Guru‟s Teachings, He is found. || 12 || The True Guru
knows the state of one‟s inner being. He alone is fearless, who realizes the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. He looks within his own inner being, and realizes the Lord within all; his
mind does not waver at all. || 13 || He alone is fearless, within whose being the Lord
abides. Day and night, he is delighted with the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the
Lord. O Nanak, in the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, the Lord‟s Praise is obtained, and
one easily, intuitively meets the Lord. || 14 || One who knows God, within the self
and beyond, remains detached, and brings his wandering mind back to its home. The
True Primal Lord is over all the three worlds; O Nanak, His Ambrosial Nectar is
obtained. || 15 || 4 || 21 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: The Creator Lord is infinite; His
creative power is wondrous. Created beings have no power over Him. He formed the
living beings, and He Himself sustains them; the Hukam of His Command controls each
and every one. || 1 || The all-pervading Lord orchestrates all through His Hukam.
Who is near, and who is far away? Behold the Lord, both hidden and manifest, in each
and every heart; the unique Lord is permeating all. || 2 || One whom the Lord unites
with Himself, merges in conscious awareness. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
meditate on the Lord‟s Name. God is the embodiment of bliss, incomparably beautiful
and unfathomable; meeting with the Guru, doubt is dispelled. || 3 || The Naam, the
Name of the Lord, is more dear to me than my mind, body and wealth. In the end,
when I must depart, it shall be my only help and support. 

In this world of love and attachment, no one is anyone else‟s friend or companion;
without the Lord, without the Guru, who has ever found peace? || 4 || He, unto
whom the Perfect Guru grants His Grace, is merged in the Word of the Shabad, through
the Teachings of the brave, heroic Guru. O Nanak, dwell upon, and serve at the Guru‟s
feet; He places those who wander back on the Path. || 5 || The wealth of the Lord‟s
Praise is very dear to the humble Saints. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, I have obtained
Your Name, Lord. The beggar serves at the Lord‟s door, and in the Court of the Lord,
sings His Praises. || 6 || When one meets the True Guru, he is called into the
Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. In the True Court, he is blessed with salvation and
honor. The faithless cynic has no place of rest in the Lord‟s palace; he suffers the pains
of birth and death. || 7 || So serve the True Guru, the unfathomable ocean, and you
shall obtain the profit, the wealth, the jewel of the Naam. The filth of corruption is
washed away, by bathing in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar. In the Guru‟s pool,
contentment is obtained. || 8 || So serve the Guru without hesitation. And in the
midst of hope, remain unmoved by hope. Serve the Eradicator of cynicism and
suffering, and you shall never again be afflicted by the disease. || 9 || One who is
pleasing to the True Lord is blessed with glorious greatness. Who else can teach him
anything? The Lord and the Guru are pervading in one form. O Nanak, the Lord loves
the Guru. || 10 || Some read scriptures, the Vedas and the Puraanas. Some sit and
listen, and read to others. Tell me, how can the heavy, rigid doors be opened? Without
the True Guru, the essence of reality is not realized. || 11 || Some collect dust, and
smear their bodies with ashes; but deep within them are the outcasts of anger and
egotism. Practicing hypocrisy, Yoga is not obtained; without the True Guru, the unseen
Lord is not found. || 12 || Some make vows to visit sacred shrines of pilgrimage, keep
fasts and live in the forest. Some practice chastity, charity and self-discipline, and speak
of spiritual wisdom. But without the Lord‟s Name, how can anyone find peace? Without
the True Guru, doubt is not dispelled. || 13 || Inner cleansing techniques, channeling
the energy to raise the Kundalini to the Tenth Gate, inhaling, exhaling and holding the
breath by the force of the mind — by empty hypocritical practices, Dharmic love for the
Lord is not produced. Only through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is the sublime,
supreme essence obtained. || 14 || Seeing the Lord‟s creative power, my mind
remains satisfied. Through the Guru‟s Shabad, I have realized that all is God. O Nanak,
the Lord, the Supreme Soul, is in all. The Guru, the True Guru, has inspired me to see
the unseen Lord. || 15 || 5 || 22 ||
MARU, SOLHAY, THIRD MEHL:

By the Hukam of His Command, He effortlessly created the Universe. Creating the
creation, He gazes upon His own greatness. He Himself acts, and inspires all to act; in
His Will, He pervades and permeates all. || 1 || The world is in the darkness of love
and attachment to Maya. How rare is that Gurmukh who contemplates, and
understands. 

He alone attains the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace. He Himself unites in His
Union. || 2 || Uniting with Himself, He bestows glorious greatness. By Guru‟s Grace,
one comes to know the Lord‟s worth. The self-willed manmukh wanders everywhere,
weeping and wailing; he is utterly ruined by the love of duality. || 3 || Egotism was
instilled into the illusion of Maya. The self-willed manmukh is deluded, and loses his
honor. But one who becomes Gurmukh is absorbed in the Name; he remains immersed
in the True Lord. || 4 || Spiritual wisdom is obtained from the Guru, along with the
jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Desires are subdued, and one remains
immersed in the mind. The Creator Himself stages all His plays; He Himself bestows
understanding. || 5 || One who serves the True Guru eradicates self-conceit. Meeting
with his Beloved, he finds peace through the Word of the Shabad. Deep within his inner
being, he is imbued with loving devotion; intuitively, he becomes one with the Lord. ||
6 || The Destroyer of pain is known through the Guru. The Great Giver, the Life of the
world, Himself has met me. He alone understands, whom the Lord joins with Himself.
Fear and doubt are taken away from his body. || 7 || He Himself is the Gurmukh, and
He Himself bestows His blessings. Through the True Word of the Shabad, serve the
True Guru. Old age and death cannot even touch one who is in harmony with the True
Lord. || 8 || The world is burning up in the fire of desire. It burns and burns, and is
destroyed in all its corruption. The self-willed manmukh finds no place of rest
anywhere. The True Guru has imparted this understanding. || 9 || Those who serve
the True Guru are very fortunate. They remain lovingly focused on the True Name
forever. The Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord, permeates the nucleus of their
inner being; through the Shabad, their desires are quenched. || 10 || True is the
Word of the Shabad, and True is the Bani of His Word. How rare is that Gurmukh who
realizes this. Those who are imbued with the True Shabad are detached. Their comings
and goings in reincarnation are ended. || 11 || One who realizes the Shabad is
cleansed of impurities. The Immaculate Naam abides within his mind. He serves his
True Guru forever, and egotism is eradicated from within. || 12 || If one comes to
understand, through the Guru, then he comes to know the Lord‟s Door. But without the
Naam, one babbles and argues in vain. The glory of serving the True Guru is that it
eradicates hunger and thirst. || 13 || When the Lord unites them with Himself, then
they come to understand. Without spiritual wisdom, they understand nothing at all. One
whose mind is filled with the Guru‟s gift forever — his inner being resounds with the
Shabad, and the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. || 14 || He acts according to his preordained destiny. No one can erase the Command of the Primal Lord. They alone dwell
in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, who have such pre-ordained destiny. || 15 ||
He alone finds the Lord, unto whom He grants His Grace. He links his consciousness to
the deep meditative state of the True Shabad. Nanak, Your slave, offers this humble
prayer; I stand at Your Door, begging for Your Name. || 16 || 1 || MARU, THIRD
MEHL: The One and only Lord is pervading and permeating everywhere. How rare is
that person, who as Gurmukh, understands this. The One Lord is permeating and
pervading, deep within the nucleus of all. Without Him, there is no other at all. || 1 ||
He created the 8.4 millions species of beings. 

The spiritual teachers and meditators proclaim this. He Himself nourishes all; no one
else can estimate His value. || 2 || Love and attachment to Maya are utter darkness.
Egotism and possessiveness have spread throughout the expanse of the universe. Night
and day, they burn, day and night; without the Guru, there is no peace or tranquility. ||
3 || He Himself unites, and He Himself separates. He Himself establishes, and He
Himself disestablishes. True is the Hukam of His Command, and True is the expanse of
His universe. No one else can issue any Command. || 4 || He alone is attached to the
Lord, whom the Lord attaches to Himself. By Guru‟s Grace, the fear of death runs away.
The Shabad, the Giver of peace, dwells forever deep within the nucleus of the self. One
who is Gurmukh understands. || 5 || God Himself unites those united in His Union.
Whatever is pre-ordained by destiny, cannot be erased. Night and day, His devotees
worship Him, day and night; one who becomes Gurmukh serves Him. || 6 || Serving
the True Guru, lasting peace is experienced. He Himself, the Giver of all, has come and
met me. Subduing egotism, the fire of thirst has been extinguished; contemplating the
Word of the Shabad, peace is found. || 7 || One who is attached to his body and
family, does not understand. But one who becomes Gurmukh, sees the Lord with his
eyes. Night and day, he chants the Naam, day and night; meeting with his Beloved, he
finds peace. || 8 || The self-willed manmukh wanders distracted, attached to duality.
That unfortunate wretch — why didn‟t he just die as soon as he was born? Coming and
going, he wastes away his life in vain. Without the Guru, liberation is not obtained. || 9
|| That body which is stained with the filth of egotism is false and impure. It may be
washed a hundred times, but its filth is still not removed. But if it is washed with the
Word of the Shabad, then it is truly cleansed, and it shall never be soiled again. || 10 ||
The five demons destroy the body. He dies and dies again, only to be reincarnated; he
does not contemplate the Shabad. The darkness of emotional attachment to Maya is
within his inner being; as if in a dream, he does not understand. || 11 || Some
conquer the five demons, by being attached to the Shabad. They are blessed and very
fortunate; the True Guru comes to meet them. Within the nucleus of their inner being,
they dwell upon the Truth; attuned to the Lord‟s Love, they intuitively merge in Him. ||
12 || The Guru‟s Way is known through the Guru. His perfect servant attains
realization through the Shabad. Deep within his heart, he dwells forever upon the
Shabad; he tastes the sublime essence of the True Lord with his tongue. || 13 ||
Egotism is conquered and subdued by the Shabad. I have enshrined the Name of the
Lord within my heart. Other than the One Lord, I know nothing at all. Whatever will be,
will automatically be. || 14 || Without the True Guru, no one obtains intuitive wisdom.
The Gurmukh understands, and is immersed in the True Lord. He serves the True Lord,
and is attuned to the True Shabad. The Shabad banishes egotism. || 15 || He Himself
is the Giver of virtue, the Contemplative Lord. The Gurmukh is given the winning dice.
O Nanak, immersed in the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one becomes true; from the
True Lord, honor is obtained. || 16 || 2 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: One One True Lord
is the Life of the World, the Great Giver. 

Serving the Guru, through the Word of the Shabad, He is realized. There is only One
Command, and there is only One Supreme King. In each and every age, He links each
to their tasks. || 1 || That humble being is immaculate, who knows his own self. The
Lord, the Giver of peace, Himself comes and meets him. His tongue is imbued with the
Shabad, and he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord; he is honored in the Court of the
True Lord. || 2 || The Gurmukh is blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam.
The self-willed manmukh, the slanderer, loses his honor. Attuned to the Naam, the
supreme soul-swans remain detached; in the home of the self, they remain absorbed in
deep meditative trance. || 3 || That humble being who dies in the Shabad is perfect.
The brave, heroic True Guru chants and proclaims this. Deep within the body is the true
pool of Ambrosial Nectar; the mind drinks it in with loving devotion. || 4 || The
Pandit, the religious scholar, reads and instructs others, but he does not realize that his
own home is on fire. Without serving the True Guru, the Naam is not obtained. You can
read until you are exhausted, but you shall not find peace and tranquility. || 5 ||
Some smear their bodies with ashes, and wander around in religious disguises. Without
the Word of the Shabad, who has ever subdued egotism? Night and day, they continue
burning, day and night; they are deluded and confused by their doubt and religious
costumes. || 6 || Some, in the midst of their household and family, remain always
unattached. They die in the Shabad, and dwell in the Lord‟s Name. Night and day, they
remain forever attuned to His Love; they focus their consciousness on loving devotion
and the Fear of God. || 7 || The self-willed manmukh indulges in slander, and is
ruined. The dog of greed barks within him. The Messenger of Death never leaves him,
and in the end, he leaves, regretting and repenting. || 8 || Through the True Word of
the Shabad, true honor is obtained. Without the Name, no one attains liberation.
Without the True Guru, no one finds the Name. Such is the making which God has
made. || 9 || Some are Siddhas and seekers, and great contemplators. Some remain
imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord, day and night. He alone
understands, whom the Lord unites with Himself; through loving devotional worship,
fear is dispelled. || 10 || Some take cleansing baths and give donations to charities,
but they do not understand. Some struggle with their minds, and conquer and subdue
their minds. Some are imbued with love for the True Word of the Shabad; they merge
with the True Shabad. || 11 || He Himself creates and bestows glorious greatness. By
the Pleasure of His Will, He bestows union. Bestowing His Grace, He comes to dwell in
the mind; such is the Command ordained by my God. || 12 || Those humble beings
who serve the True Guru are true. The false, self-willed manmukhs do not know how to
serve the Guru. The Creator Himself creates the creation and watches over it; he
attaches all according to the Pleasure of His Will. || 13 || In each and every age, the
True Lord is the one and only Giver. Through perfect destiny, one realizes the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad. Those who are immersed in the Shabad are not separated again. By
His Grace, they are intuitively immersed in the Lord. || 14 || Acting in egotism, they
are stained with the filth of Maya. They die and die again, only to be reborn in the love
of duality. Without serving the True Guru, no one finds liberation. O mind, tune into
this, and see. || 15 || 

He does whatever He pleases. No one has done, or can do anything by himself. O
Nanak, through the Name, one is blessed with glorious greatness, and obtains honor in
the Court of the True Lord. || 16 || 3 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: All who come shall
have to depart. In the love of duality, they are caught by the noose of the Messenger of
Death. Those humble beings who are protected by the True Guru, are saved. They
merge into the Truest of the True. || 1 || The Creator Himself creates the creation,
and watches over it. Thay alone are acceptable, upon whom He bestows His Glance of
Grace. The Gurmukh attains spiritual wisdom, and understands everything. The
ignorant ones act blindly. || 2 || The self-willed manmukh is cynical; he doesn‟t
understand. He dies and dies again, only to be reborn, and loses his life uselessly again.
The Gurmukh is imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he find peace, and is
intuitively immersed in the True Lord. || 3 || Chasing after worldly affairs, the mind
has become corroded and rusty. But meeting with the Perfect Guru, it is transmuted
into gold once again. When the Lord Himself grants forgiveness, then peace is
obtained; through the Perfect Word of the Shabad, one is united with Him. || 4 || The
false and evil-minded are the most wicked of the wicked. They are the most unworthy
of the unworthy. With false intellect, and insipid words of mouth, evil-minded, they do
not obtain the Naam. || 5 || The unworthy soul-bride is not pleasing to her Husband
Lord. False-minded, her actions are false. The foolish person does not know the
excellence of her Husband Lord. Without the Guru, she does not understand at all. || 6
|| The evil-minded, wicked soul-bride practices wickedness. She decorates herself, but
her Husband Lord is not pleased. The virtuous soul-bride enjoys and ravishes her
Husband Lord forever; the True Guru unites her in His Union. || 7 || God Himself
issues the Hukam of His Command, and beholds all. Some are forgiven, according to
their pre-ordained destiny. Night and day, they are imbued with the Naam, and they
find the True Lord. He Himself unites them in His Union. || 8 || Egotism attaches
them to the juice of emotional attachment, and makes them run around. The Gurmukh
is intuitively immersed in the True Love of the Lord. He Himself unites, He Himself acts,
and beholds. Without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained. || 9 || Some
contemplate the Word of the Shabad; these humble beings remain always awake and
aware. Some are attached to the love of Maya; these unfortunate ones remain asleep.
He Himself acts, and inspires all to act; no one else can do anything. || 10 || Through
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, death is conquered and killed. Keep the Name of the
Lord enshrined within your heart. Serving the True Guru, peace is obtained, and one
merges in the Name of the Lord. || 11 || In the love of duality, the world wanders
around insane. Immersed in love and attachment to Maya, it suffers in pain. Wearing all
sorts of religious robes, He is not obtained. Without the True Guru, peace is not found.
|| 12 || Who is to blame, when He Himself does everything? As He wills, so is the path
we take. He Himself is the Merciful Giver of peace; as He wills, so do we follow. || 13
|| He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. He Himself is detached,
and He Himself is attached. He Himself is immaculate, compassionate, the lover of
nectar; the Hukam of His Command cannot be erased. || 14 || Those who know the
One Lord are very fortunate. 

He dwells in each and every heart, the Great Giver, the Life of the world. At the same
time, He is both hidden and revealed. For the Gurmukh, doubt and fear are dispelled.
|| 15 || The Gurmukh knows the One, the Dear Lord. Deep within the nucleus of his
inner being, is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; he realizes the Word of the Shabad. He
alone receives it, unto whom You give it. O Nanak, the Naam is glorious greatness. ||
16 || 4 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: I praise the true, profound and unfathomable Lord.
All the world is in His power. He enjoys all hearts forever, day and night; He Himself
dwells in peace. || 1 || True is the Lord and Master, and True is His Name. By Guru‟s
Grace, I enshrine Him in my mind. He Himself has come to dwell deep within the
nucleus of my heart; the noose of death has been snapped. || 2 || Whom should I
serve, and whom should I praise? I serve the True Guru, and praise the Word of the
Shabad. Through the True Shabad, the intellect is exalted and ennobled forever, and
the lotus deep within blossoms forth. || 3 || The body is frail and perishable, like
paper. When the drop of water falls upon it, it crumbles and dissolves instantaneously.
But the body of the Gurmukh, who understands, is like gold; the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, dwells deep within. || 4 || Pure is that kitchen, which is enclosed by spiritual
awareness. The Lord‟s Name is my food, and Truth is my support. Forever satisfied,
sanctified and pure is that person, within whose heart the Lord‟s Name abides. || 5 ||
I am a sacrifice to those who are attached to the Truth. They sing the Glorious Praises
of the Lord, and remain awake and aware night and day. True peace fills them forever,
and their tongues savor the sublime essence of the Lord. || 6 || I remember the
Lord‟s Name, and no other at all. I serve the One Lord, and no other at all. The Perfect
Guru has revealed the whole Truth to me; I dwell in the True Name. || 7 ||
Wandering, wandering in reincarnation, again and again, he comes into the world. He is
deluded and confused, when the Lord and Master confuses him. He meets with the
Dear Lord, when, as Gurmukh, he understands; he remembers the Shabad, the Word of
the immortal, eternal Lord God. || 8 || I am a sinner, overflowing with sexual desire
and anger. With what mouth should I speak? I have no virtue, and I have rendered no
service. I am a sinking stone; please, Lord, unite me with Yourself. Your Name is
eternal and imperishable. || 9 || No one does anything; no one is able to do anything.
That alone happens, which the Lord Himself does, and causes to be done. Those whom
He Himself forgives, find peace; they dwell forever in the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
|| 10 || This body is the earth, and the infinite Shabad is the seed. Deal and trade with
the True Name alone. The True wealth increases; it is never exhausted, when the Naam
dwells deep within. || 11 || O Dear Lord, please bless me, the worthless sinner, with
virtue. Forgive me, and bless me with Your Name. One who becomes Gurmukh, is
honored; he dwells in the Name of the One Lord alone. || 12 || The wealth of the
Lord is deep within one‟s inner being, but he does not realize it. By Guru‟s Grace, one
comes to understand. One who becomes Gurmukh is blessed with this wealth; he lives
forever in the Naam. || 13 || Fire and wind lead him into delusions of doubt. 

In love and attachment to Maya, he has no understanding at all. The blind, self-willed
manmukh sees nothing; through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Naam is gloriously revealed.
|| 14 || The manmukhs are asleep in egotism and Maya. They do not watch over their
own homes, and are ruined in the end. They slander others, and burn in great anxiety;
they dwell in pain and suffering. || 15 || The Creator Himself has created the
creation. He blesses the Gurmukh with understanding. O Nanak, those who are attuned
to the Naam — their minds become immaculate; they dwell in the Naam, and only the
Naam. || 16 || 5 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: I serve the One Lord, who is eternal,
stable and True. Attached to duality, the whole world is false. Following the Guru‟s
Teachings, I praise the True Lord forever, pleased with the Truest of the True. || 1 ||
Your Glorious Virtues are so many, Lord; I do not know even one. The Life of the world,
the Great Giver, attaches us to himself. He Himself forgives, and bestows glorious
greatness. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, this mind is delighted. || 2 || The Word of
the Shabad has subdued the waves of Maya. Egotism has been conquered, and this
mind has become immaculate. I intuitively sing His Glorious Praises, imbued with the
Lord‟s Love. My tongue chants and savors the Lord‟s Name. || 3 || Crying out, “Mine,
mine!” he spends his life. The self-willed manmukh does not understand; he wanders
around in ignorance. The Messenger of Death watches over him every moment, every
instant; night and day, his life is wasting away. || 4 || He practices greed within, and
does not understand. He does not see the Messenger of Death hovering over his head.
Whatever one does in this world, will come to face him in the hereafter; what can he do
at that very last moment? || 5 || Those who are attached to the Truth are true. The
self-willed manmukhs, attached to duality, weep and wail. He is the Lord and Master of
both worlds; He Himself delights in virtue. || 6 || Through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, His humble servant is exalted forever. This mind is enticed by the Naam, the
source of nectar. It is not stained at all by the dirt of attachment to Maya; through the
Guru‟s Teachings, it is pleased and saturated with the Lord‟s Name. || 7 || The One
Lord is contained within all. By Guru‟s Grace, He is revealed. One who subdues his ego,
finds lasting peace; he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the True Name. || 8 || God is
the Destroyer of sin and pain. The Gurmukh serves Him, and contemplates the Word of
the Shabad. He Himself is pervading everything. The Gurmukh‟s body and mind are
saturated and pleased. || 9 || The world is burning in the fire of Maya. The Gurmukh
extinguishes this fire, by contemplating the Shabad. Deep within are peace and
tranquility, and lasting peace is obtained. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, one is
blessed with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 10 || Even Indra, seated upon his
throne, is caught in the fear of death. The Messenger of Death will not spare them,
even though they try all sorts of things. When one meets with the True Guru, one is
liberated, drinking in and savoring the sublime essence of the Lord, Har, Har. || 11 ||
There is no devotion within the self-willed manmukh. Through devotional worship, the
Gurmukh obtains peace and tranquility. Forever pure and sanctified is the Word of the
Guru‟s Bani; following the Guru‟s Teachings, one‟s inner being is drenched in it. || 12 ||
I have considered Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. 

They are bound by the three qualities — the three gunas; they are far away from
liberation. The Gurmukh knows the spiritual wisdom of the One Lord. Night and day, he
chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 13 || He may read the Vedas, but he does
not realize the Lord‟s Name. For the sake of Maya, he reads and recites and argues.
The ignorant and blind person is filled with filth within. How can he cross over the
impassable world-ocean? || 14 || He voices all the controversies of the Vedas, but his
inner being is not saturated or satisfied, and he does not realize the Word of the
Shabad. The Vedas tell all about virtue and vice, but only the Gurmukh drinks in the
Ambrosial Nectar. || 15 || The One True Lord is all by Himself. There is no one else
except Him. O Nanak, true is the mind of one who is attuned to the Naam; he speaks
Truth, and nothing but Truth. || 16 || 6 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: The True Lord has
established the Throne of Truth. He dwells in His own home deep within the self, where
there is no emotional attachment to Maya. The True Lord dwells deep within the
nucleus of the Gurmukh‟s heart forever; his actions are excellent. || 1 || True is his
merchandise, and true is his trade. There is no doubt within him, and no expanse of
duality. He has earned the true wealth, which is never exhausted. How few are those
who contemplate this, and understand. || 2 || They alone are attached to the True
Name, whom the Lord Himself attaches. The Word of the Shabad is deep within the
nucleus of the self; good fortune is recorded upon their foreheads. Through the True
Word of the Shabad, they sing the True Praises of the Lord; they are attuned to
contemplative meditation on the Shabad. || 3 || I praise the True Lord, the Truest of
the True. I see the One Lord, and no other. The Guru‟s Teachings are the ladder to
reach the highest of the high. the jewel of spiritual wisdom conquers egotism. || 4 ||
Emotional attachment to Maya is burnt away by the Word of the Shabad. The True One
comes to dwell in the mind, when it pleases You, O Lord. True are all the actions of the
truthful; the thirst of egotism is subdued. || 5 || All by Himself, God created
emotional attachment to Maya. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize the Lord.
One who becomes Gurmukh practices Truth; true and excellent are his actions. || 6 ||
He does those deeds which are pleasing to my God; through the Shabad, he burns
away egotism and the thirst of desire. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, he remains
forever cool and calm deep within; he conquers and subdues his ego. || 7 || Those
who are attached to the Truth are pleased with everything. They are embellished with
the True Word of the Shabad. Those who are true in this world, are true in the Court of
the Lord. The Merciful Lord adorns them with His Mercy. || 8 || Those who are
attached to duality, and not the Truth, are trapped in emotional attachment to Maya;
they totally suffer in pain. Without the Guru, they do not understand pain and pleasure;
attached to Maya, they suffer in terrible pain. || 9 || Those whose minds are pleased
with the True Word of the Shabad act according to pre-ordained destiny. They serve the
True Lord, and meditate on the True Lord; they are imbued with contemplative
meditation on the True Lord. || 10 || Service to the Guru seems sweet to them. Night
and day, they are intuitively immersed in celestial peace. Chanting the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har, their minds become immaculate; they love to serve the Guru. || 11 ||
Those humble beings are at peace, whom the True Guru attaches to the Truth. He
Himself, in His Will, merges them into Himself. Those humble beings, whom the True
Guru protects, are saved. 

The rest are ruined through emotional attachment to Maya. || 12 || The Gurmukh
realizes the True Word of the Shabad. He has no family, and he has no mother. The
One and Only Lord is pervading and permeating deep within the nucleus of all. He is
the Support of all beings. || 13 || Egotism, possessiveness, and the love of duality —
none of these shall go along with you; such is the pre-ordained will of our Lord and
Master. Through the True Guru, practice Truth, and the True Lord shall take away your
pains. || 14 || If You so bless me, then I shall find lasting peace. Through the True
Word of the Shabad, I live the Truth. The True Lord is within me, and my mind and
body have become True. I am blessed with the overflowing treasure of devotional
worship. || 15 || He Himself watches, and issues His Command. He Himself inspires
us to obey His Will. O Nanak, only those who are attuned to the Naam are detached;
their minds, bodies and tongues are embellished with the Naam. || 16 || 7 || MARU,
THIRD MEHL: He Himself created Himself, and came into being. The One Lord is
pervading in all, remaining hidden. The Lord, the Life of the world, takes care of all.
Whoever knows his own self, realizes God. || 1 || He who created Brahma, Vishnu
and Shiva, links each and every being to its tasks. He merges into Himself, whoever is
pleasing to His Will. The Gurmukh knows the One Lord. || 2 || The world is coming
and going in reincarnation. Attached to Maya, it dwells on its many sins. One who
realizes the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, praises forever the eternal, unchanging True
Lord. || 3 || Some are attached to the root — they find peace. But those who are
attached to the branches, waste their lives away uselessly. Those humble beings, who
chant the Name of the Ambrosial Lord, produce the ambrosial fruit. || 4 || I have no
virtues; what words should I speak? You see all, and weigh them on Your scale. By
Your will, You preserve me, and so do I remain. The Gurmukh knows the One Lord. ||
5 || According to Your Will, You link me to my true tasks. Renouncing vice, I am
immersed in virtue. The One Immaculate True Lord abides in virtue; through the Word
of the Guru‟s Shabad, He is realized. || 6 || Wherever I look, there I see Him. Duality
and evil-mindedness are destroyed through the Shabad. The One Lord God is immersed
in His Oneness. He is attuned forever to His own delight. || 7 || The body-lotus is
withering away, but the ignorant, self-willed manmukh does not understand the
Shabad. By Guru‟s Grace, he searches his body, and finds the Great Giver, the Life of
the world. || 8 || The Lord frees up the body-fortress, which was seized by sins, when
one keeps the Dear Lord enshrined forever in the heart. The fruits of his desires are
obtained, and he is dyed in the permanent color of the Lord‟s Love. || 9 || The selfwilled manmukh speaks of spiritual wisdom, but does not understand. Again and again,
he comes into the world, but he finds no place of rest. The Gurmukh is spiritually wise,
and praises the Lord forever. Throughout each and every age, the Gurmukh knows the
One Lord. || 10 || All the deeds which the manmukh does bring pain — nothing but
pain. The Word of the Shabad is not within him; how can he go to the Court of the
Lord? The True Shabad dwells deep within the mind of the Gurmukh; he serves the
Giver of peace forever. 

|| 11 || Wherever I look, I see You, everywhere. Through the Perfect Guru, all this is
known. I meditate forever and ever on the Naam; this mind is imbued with the Naam.
|| 12 || Imbued with the Naam, the body is sanctified. Without the Naam, they are
drowned and die without water. They come and go, but do not understand the Naam.
Some, as Gurmukh, realize the Word of the Shabad. || 13 || The Perfect True Guru
has imparted this understanding. Without the Name, no one attains liberation. Through
the Naam, the Name of the Lord, one is blessed with glorious greatness; he remains
intuitively attuned to the Lord‟s Love. || 14 || The body-village crumbles and collapses
into a pile of dust. Without the Shabad, the cycle of reincarnation is not brought to an
end. One who knows the One Lord, through the True Guru, praises the True Lord, and
remains immersed in the True Lord. || 15 || The True Word of the Shabad comes to
dwell in the mind, when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace. O Nanak, those who are
attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Formless Lord, realize the True Lord in His True
Court. || 16 || 8 || MARU, SOLHAY, THIRD MEHL: O Creator, it is You Yourself who
does all. All beings and creatures are under Your Protection. You are hidden, and yet
permeating within all; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, You are realized. || 1 ||
Devotion to the Lord is a treasure overflowing. He Himself blesses us with
contemplative meditation on the Shabad. You do whatever You please; my mind is
attuned to the True Lord. || 2 || You Yourself are the priceless diamond and jewel. In
Your Mercy, You weigh with Your scale. All beings and creatures are under Your
protection. One who is blessed by Your Grace realizes his own self. || 3 || One who
receives Your Mercy, O Primal Lord, does not die, and is not reborn; he is released from
the cycle of reincarnation. He sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord, day and night,
and, throughout the ages, he knows the One Lord. || 4 || Emotional attachment to
Maya wells up throughout the whole world, from Brahma, Vishnu and all the demi-gods.
Those who are pleasing to Your Will, are attached to the Naam; through spiritual
wisdom and understanding, You are recognized. || 5 || The world is engrossed in vice
and virtue. Happiness and misery are totally loaded with pain. One who becomes
Gurmukh finds peace; such a Gurmukh recognizes the Naam. || 6 || No one can
erase the record of one‟s actions. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, one finds
the door of salvation. One who conquers self-conceit and recognizes the Lord, obtains
the fruits of his pre-destined rewards. || 7 || Emotionally attached to Maya, one‟s
consciousness is not attached to the Lord. In the love of duality, he will suffer terrible
agony in the world hereafter. The hypocritical, self-willed manmukhs are deluded by
doubt; at the very last moment, they regret and repent. || 8 || In accordance with
the Lord‟s Will, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. He is rid of all sinful residues,
and all suffering. The Lord is immaculate, and immaculate is the Word of His Bani. My
mind is imbued with the Lord. || 9 || One who is blessed with the Lord‟s Glance of
Grace, obtains the Lord, the treasure of virtue. Egotism and possessiveness are brought
to an end. The One Lord is the only Giver of virtue and vice, merits and demerits; how
rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this. || 10 || My God is immaculate, and
utterly infinite. God unites with Himself, through contemplation of the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. 

He Himself forgives, and implants the Truth. The mind and body are then attuned to
the True Lord. || 11 || Within the polluted mind and body is the Light of the Infinite
Lord. One who understands the Guru‟s Teachings, contemplates this. Conquering
egotism, the mind becomes immaculate forever; with his tongue, he serves the Lord,
the Giver of peace. || 12 || In the fortress of the body there are many shops and
bazaars; within them is the Naam, the Name of the utterly infinite Lord. In His Court,
one is embellished forever with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; he conquers egotism
and realizes the Lord. || 13 || The jewel is priceless, inaccessible and infinite. How
can the poor wretch estimate its worth? Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, it is
weighed, and so the Shabad is realized deep within. || 14 || The great volumes of the
Simritees and the Shaastras only extend the extension of attachment to Maya. The fools
read them, but do not understand the Word of the Shabad. How rare are those who, as
Gurmukh, understand. || 15 || The Creator Himself acts, and causes all to act.
Through the True Word of His Bani, Truth is implanted deep within. O Nanak, through
the Naam, one is blessed with glorious greatness, and throughout the ages, the One
Lord is known. || 16 || 9 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: Serve the True Creator Lord. The
Word of the Shabad is the Destroyer of pain. He is inaccessible and unfathomable; He
cannot be evaluated. He Himself is inaccessible and immeasurable. || 1 || The True
Lord Himself makes Truth pervasive. He attaches some humble beings to the Truth.
They serve the True Lord and practice Truth; through the Name, they are absorbed in
the True Lord. || 2 || The Primal Lord unites His devotees in His Union. He attaches
them to true devotional worship. One who sings forever the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, through the True Word of His Bani, earns the profit of this life. || 3 || The
Gurmukh trades, and understands his own self. He knows no other than the One Lord.
True is the banker, and True are His traders, who buy the merchandise of the Naam. ||
4 || He Himself fashions and creates the Universe. He inspires a few to realize the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Those humble beings who serve the True Guru are true. He
snaps the noose of death from around their necks. || 5 || He destroys, creates,
embellishes and fashions all beings, and attaches them to duality, attachment and
Maya. The self-willed manmukhs wander around forever, acting blindly. Death has
strung his noose around their necks. || 6 || He Himself forgives, and enjoins us to
serve the Guru. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Naam comes to dwell within the
mind. Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the True Lord, and earn the
profit of the Naam in this world. || 7 || He Himself is True, and True is His Name. The
Gurmukh bestows it, and enshrines it within the mind. Noble and exalted are those,
within whose mind the Lord abides. Their heads are free of strife. || 8 || He is
inaccessible and unfathomable; His value cannot be appraised. By Guru‟s Grace, He
dwells within the mind. No one calls that person to account, who praises the Word of
the Shabad, the Giver of virtue. || 9 || Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva serve Him. Even
they cannot find the limits of the unseen, unknowable Lord. Those who are blessed by
Your Glance of Grace, become Gurmukh, and comprehend the incomprehensible. 

|| 10 || The Perfect True Guru has imparted this understanding. I have enshrined the
Naam, the One Name, within my mind. I chant the Naam, and meditate on the Naam.
Singing His Glorious Praises, I enter the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. || 11 || The
servant serves, and obeys the Command of the Infinite Lord. The self-willed manmukhs
do not know the value of the Lord‟s Command. By the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command,
one is exalted; by His Hukam, one is glorified; by His Hukam, one becomes carefree. ||
12 || By Guru‟s Grace, one recognizes the Lord‟s Hukam. The wandering mind is
restrained, and brought back to the home of the One Lord. Imbued with the Naam, one
remains forever detached; the jewel of the Naam rests within the mind. || 13 || The
One Lord is pervasive throughout all the world. By Guru‟s Grace, He is revealed. Those
humble beings who praise the Shabad are immaculate; they dwell within the home of
their own inner self. || 14 || The devotees abide forever in Your Sanctuary, Lord. You
are inaccessible and unfathomable; Your value cannot be estimated. As it pleases Your
Will, You keep us; the Gurmukh meditates on the Naam. || 15 || Forever and ever, I
sing Your Glorious Praises. O my True Lord and Master, may I become pleasing to Your
Mind. Nanak offers this true prayer: O Lord, please bless me with Truth, that I may
merge in the Truth. || 16 || 1 || 10 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: Those who serve the
True Guru are very fortunate. Night and day, they remain lovingly attuned to the True
Name. The Lord, the Giver of peace, abides forever deep within their hearts; they
delight in the True Word of the Shabad. || 1 || When the Lord grants His Grace, one
meets with the Guru. The Name of the Lord is enshrined within the mind. The Lord, the
Giver of peace, abides forever within the mind; the mind is delighted with the Word of
the Shabad. || 2 || When the Lord bestows His Mercy, He unites in His Union.
Egotism and attachment are burned away by the Shabad. In the Love of the One Lord,
one remains liberated forever; he is not in conflict with anyone. || 3 || Without
serving the True Guru, there is only pitch-black darkness. Without the Shabad, no one
crosses over to the other side. Those who are imbued with the Shabad, are very
detached. They earn the profit of the True Word of the Shabad. || 4 || Pain and
pleasure are pre-ordained by the Creator. He Himself has caused the love of duality to
be pervasive. One who becomes Gurmukh remains detached; how can anyone trust the
self-willed manmukh? || 5 || Those who do not recognize the Shabad are manmukhs.
They do not know the essence of the Fear of the Guru. Without this Fear, how can
anyone find the Fearless True Lord? The Messenger of Death will pull the breath out. ||
6 || The invulnerable Messenger of Death cannot be killed. The Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad prevents him from approaching. When he hears the Word of the Shabad, he
runs far away. He is afraid that the self-sufficient Dear Lord will kill him. || 7 || The
Dear Lord is the Ruler above all. What can this wretched Messenger of Death do? As
slave to the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, the mortal acts according to His Hukam.
According to His Hukam, he is deprived of his breath. || 8 || The Gurmukh realizes
that the True Lord created the creation. The Gurmukh knows that the Lord has
expanded the entire expanse. One who becomes Gurmukh, understands the True Lord.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, he finds peace. || 9 || The Gurmukh knows
that the Lord is the Architect of karma. 

Throughout the four ages, he recognizes the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The Gurmukh
does not die, the Gurmukh is not reborn; the Gurmukh is immersed in the Shabad. ||
10 || The Gurmukh praises the Naam, and the Shabad. God is inaccessible,
unfathomable and self-sufficient. The Naam, the Name of the One Lord, saves and
redeems throughout the four ages. Through the Shabad, one trades in the Naam. || 11
|| The Gurmukh obtains eternal peace and tranqulity. The Gurmukh enshrines the
Naam within his heart. One who becomes Gurmukh recognizes the Naam, and the
noose of evil-mindedness is snapped. || 12 || The Gurmukh wells up from, and then
merges back into Truth. He does not die and take birth, and is not consigned to
reincarnation. The Gurmukh remains forever imbued with the color of the Lord‟s Love.
Night and day, he earns a profit. || 13 || The Gurmukhs, the devotees, are exalted
and beautified in the Court of the Lord. They are embellished with the True Word of His
Bani, and the Word of the Shabad. Night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, day and night, and they intuitively go to their own home. || 14 || The Perfect
True Guru proclaims the Shabad; night and day, remain lovingly attuned to devotional
worship. One who sings forever the Glorious Praises of the Lord, becomes immaculate;
Immaculate are the Glorious Praises of the Sovereign Lord . || 15 || The True Lord is
the Giver of virtue. How rare are those who, as Gurmukh, understand this. Servant
Nanak praises the Naam; he blossoms forth in the ecstasy of the Name of the selfsufficient Lord. || 16 || 2 || 11 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: Serve the Dear Lord, the
inaccessible and infinite. He has no end or limitation. By Guru‟s Grace, one who dwells
upon the Lord deep within his heart — his heart is filled with infinite wisdom. || 1 ||
The One Lord is pervading and permeating amidst all. By Guru‟s Grace, He is revealed.
The Life of the world nurtures and cherishes all, giving sustenance to all. || 2 || The
Perfect True Guru has imparted this understanding. By the Hukam of His Command, He
created the entire Universe. Whoever submits to His Command, finds peace; His
Command is above the heads of kings and emperors. || 3 || True is the True Guru.
Infinite is the Word of His Shabad. Through His Shabad, the world is saved. The Creator
Himself created the creation; He gazes upon it, and blesses it with breath and
nourishment. || 4 || Out of millions, only a few understand. Imbued with the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, they are colored in His Love. They praise the Lord, the Giver of
peace forever; the Lord forgives His devotees, and blesses them with His Praise. || 5 ||
Those humble beings who serve the True Guru are true. The falsest of the false die,
only to be reborn. The inaccessible, unfathomable, self-sufficient, incomprehensible
Lord is the Lover of His devotees. || 6 || The Perfect True Guru implants Truth within.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, they sing His Glorious Praises forever. The Giver
of virtue is pervading deep within the nucleus of all beings; He inscribes the time of
destiny upon each and every person‟s head. || 7 || The Gurmukh knows that God is
always ever-present. That humble being who serves the Shabad, is comforted and
fulfilled. Night and day, he serves the True Word of the Guru‟s Bani; he delights in the
True Word of the Shabad. || 8 || The ignorant and blind cling to all sorts of rituals.
They stubborn-mindedly perform these rituals, and are consigned to reincarnation. 

For the sake of poison, they act in greed and possessiveness, and evil-minded duality.
|| 9 || The Perfect True Guru implants devotional worship within. Through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, he lovingly centers his consciousness on the Lord‟s Name. The Lord
pervades his mind, body and heart; deep within, his mind is drenched with devotional
worship and praise of the Lord. || 10 || My True Lord God is the Destroyer of
demons. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, His devotees are saved. My True
Lord God is forever True. He is the Emperor over the heads of kings. || 11 || True are
those devotees, who are pleasing to Your Mind. They sing the Kirtan of His Praises at
His Door; they are embellished and exalted by the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Night
and day, they sing the True Word of His Bani. The Naam is the wealth of the poor. ||
12 || Those whom You unite, Lord, are never separated again. Through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, they praise You forever. You are the One Lord and Master over all.
Through the Shabad, the Naam is praised. || 13 || Without the Shabad, no one knows
You. You Yourself speak the Unspoken Speech. You Yourself are the Shabad forever,
the Guru, the Great Giver; chanting the Lord‟s Name, You bestow Your treasure. || 14
|| You Yourself are the Creator of the Universe. No one can erase what You have
written. You Yourself bless the Gurmukh with the Naam, who is no longer skeptical, and
is not held to account. || 15 || Your true devotees stand at the Door of Your Court.
They serve the Shabad with love and affection. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the
Naam remain detached; through the Naam, their affairs are resolved. || 16 || 3 || 12 ||
MARU, THIRD MEHL: My True Lord God has staged a play. He has created no one like
anyone else. He made them different, and he gazes upon them with pleasure; he
placed all the flavors in the body. || 1 || You Yourself vibrate the beat of the breath.
Shiva and Shakti, energy and matter — You have placed them into the body. By Guru‟s
Grace, one turns away from the world, and attains the jewel of spiritual wisdom, and
the Word of the Shabad. || 2 || He Himself created darkness and light. He alone is
pervasive; there is no other at all. One who realizes his own self — by Guru‟s Grace, the
lotus of his mind blossoms forth. || 3 || Only He Himself knows His depth and extent.
Other people can only listen and hear what is spoken and said. One who is spiritually
wise, understands himself as Gurmukh; he praises the True Lord. || 4 || Deep within
the body is the priceless object. He Himself opens the doors. The Gurmukh intuitively
drings in the Ambrosial Nectar, and the fire of desire is quenched. || 5 || He placed all
the flavors within the body. How rare are those who understand, through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad. So search within yourself, and praise the Shabad. Why run around
outside your self? || 6 || Without tasting, no one enjoys the flavor. Through the Word
of the Guru‟s Shabad, one drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. The Ambrosial Nectar is
drunk, and the immoral status is obtained, when one obtains the sublime essence of
the Guru‟s Shabad. || 7 || One who realizes himself, knows all virtues. 

Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, he chants the Name of the Lord. Night and
day, he remains imbued with the Naam, day and night; he is rid of emotional
attachment to Maya. || 8 || Serving the Guru, all things are obtained; egotism,
possessiveness and self-conceit are taken away. The Lord, the Giver of peace Himself
grants His Grace; He exalts and adorns with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 9 ||
The Guru‟s Shabad is the Ambrosial Bani. Night and day, chant the Name of the Lord.
That heart becomes immaculate, which is filled with the True Lord, Har, Har. || 10 ||
His servants serve, and praise His Shabad. Imbued forever with the color of His Love,
they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. He Himself forgives, and unites them with
the Shabad; the fragrance of sandalwood permeates their minds. || 11 || Through the
Shabad, they speak the Unspoken, and praise the Lord. My True Lord God is selfsufficient. The Giver of virtue Himself unites them with the Shabad; they enjoy the
sublime essence of the Shabad. || 12 || The confused, self-willed manmukhs find no
place of rest. They do those deeds which they are pre-destined to do. Imbued with
poison, they search out poison, and suffer the pains of death and rebirth. || 13 || He
Himself praises Himself. Your Glorious Virtues are within You alone, God. You Yourself
are True, and True is the Word of Your Bani. You Yourself are invisible and unknowable.
|| 14 || Without the Guru, the Giver, no one finds the Lord, though one may make
hundreds of thousands and millions of attempts. By Guru‟s Grace, He dwells deep within
the heart; through the Shabad, praise the True Lord. || 15 || They alone meet Him,
whom the Lord unites with Himself. They are adorned and exalted with the True Word
of His Bani, and the Shabad. Servant Nanak continually sings the Glorious Praises of the
True Lord; singing His Glories, he is immersed in the Glorious Lord of Virtue. || 16 || 4
|| 13 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: The One Lord is eternal and unchanging, forever True.
Through the Perfect Guru, this understanding is obtained. Those who are drenched with
the sublime essence of the Lord, meditate forever on Him; following the Guru‟s
Teachings, they obtain the armor of humility. || 1 || Deep within, they love the True
Lord forever. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they love the Lord‟s Name. The
Naam, the embodiment of the nine treasures, abides within their hearts; they renounce
the profit of Maya. || 2 || Both the king and his subjects are involved in evilmindedness and duality. Without serving the True Guru, they do not become one with
the Lord. Those who meditate on the One Lord find eternal peace. Their power is
eternal and unfailing. || 3 || No one can save them from coming and going. Birth and
death come from Him. The Gurmukh meditates forever on the True Lord. Emancipation
and liberation are obtained from Him. || 4 || Truth and self-control are found through
the Door of the True Guru. Egotism and anger are silenced through the Shabad. Serving
the True Guru, lasting peace is found; humility and contentment all come from Him. ||
5 || Out of egotism and attachment, the Universe welled up. Forgetting the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, all the world perishes. Without serving the True Guru, the Naam is
not obtained. The Naam is the True profit in this world. || 6 || True is His Will,
beauteous and pleasing through the Word of the Shabad. The Panch Shabad, the five
primal sounds, vibrate and resonate. 

Through the True Name, one‟s actions are forever embellished. Without the Shabad,
what can anyone do? || 7 || One instant, he laughs, and the next instant, he cries.
Because of duality and evil-mindedness, his affairs are not resolved. Union and
separation are pre-ordained by the Creator. Actions already committed cannot be taken
back. || 8 || One who lives the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad becomes Jivan Mukta —
liberated while yet alive. He remains forever immersed in the Lord. By Guru‟s Grace,
one is blessed with glorious greatness; he is not afflicted by the disease of egotism. ||
9 || Eating tasty delicacies, he fattens up his body and wears religious robes, but he
does not live to the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Deep with the nucleus of his being is
the great disease; he suffers terrible pain, and eventually sinks into the manure. || 10
|| He reads and studies the Vedas, and argues about them; God is within his own
heart, but he does not recognize the Word of the Shabad. One who becomes Gurmukh
churns the essence of reality; his tongue savors the sublime essence of the Lord. || 11
|| Those who forsake the object within their own hearts, wander outside. The blind,
self-willed manmukhs do not taste the flavor of God. Imbued with the taste of another,
their tongues speak tasteless, insipid words. They never taste the sublime essence of
the Lord. || 12 || The self-willed manmukh has doubt as his spouse. He dies of evilmindedness, and suffers forever. His mind is attached to sexual desire, anger and
duality, and he does not find peace, even in dreams. || 13 || The body becomes
golden, with the Word of the Shabad as its spouse. Night and day, enjoy the
enjoyments, and be in love with the Lord. Deep within the mansion of the self, one
finds the Lord, who transcends this mansion. Realizing His Will, we merge in Him. || 14
|| The Great Giver Himself gives. No one has any power to stand against Him. He
Himself forgives, and unites us with the Shabad; The Word of His Shabad is
unfathomable. || 15 || Body and soul, all belong to Him. The True Lord is my only
Lord and Master. O Nanak, through the Word of the Guru‟s Bani, I have found the Lord.
Chanting the Lord‟s Chant, I merge in Him. || 16 || 5 || 14 || MARU, THIRD MEHL:
The Gurmukh contemplates the sound current of the Naad instead of the Vedas. The
Gurmukh attains infinite spiritual wisdom and meditation. The Gurmukh acts in harmony
with God‟s Will; the Gurmukh finds perfection. || 1 || The mind of the Gurmukh turns
away from the world. The Gurmukh vibrates the Naad, the sound current of the Guru‟s
Bani. The Gurmukh, attuned to the Truth, remains detached, and dwells in the home of
the self deep within. || 2 || I speak the Ambrosial Teachings of the Guru. I lovingly
chant the Truth, through the True Word of the Shabad. My mind remains forever
imbued with the Love of the True Lord. I am immersed in the Truest of the True. || 3
|| Immaculate and pure is the mind of the Gurmukh, who bathes in the Pool of Truth.
No filth attaches to him; he merges in the True Lord. He truly practices Truth forever;
true devotion is implanted within him. || 4 || True is the speech of the Gurmukh; true
are the eyes of the Gurmukh. The Gurmukh practices and lives the Truth. He speaks
the Truth forever, day and night, and inspires others to speak the Truth. || 5 || True
and exalted is the speech of the Gurmukh. The Gurmukh speaks Truth, only Truth. 

The Gurmukh serves the Truest of the True forever; the Gurmukh proclaims the Word
of the Shabad. || 6 || One who becomes Gurmukh understands. He rids himself of
egotism, Maya and doubt. He ascends the sublime, exalted ladder of the Guru, and he
sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord at His True Door. || 7 || The Gurmukh practices
true self-control, and acts in excellence. The Gurmukh obtains the gate of salvation.
Through loving devotion, he remains forever imbued with the Lord‟s Love; eradicating
self-conceit, he merges in the Lord. || 8 || One who becomes Gurmukh examines his
own mind, and instructs others. He is lovingly attuned to the True Name forever. They
act in harmony with the Mind of the True Lord. || 9 || As it pleases His Will, He unites
us with the True Guru. As it pleases His Will, He comes to dwell within the mind. As it
pleases His Will, He imbues us with His Love; as it pleases His Will, He comes to dwell
in the mind. || 10 || Those who act stubborn-mindedly are destroyed. Wearing all
sorts of religious robes, they do not please the Lord. Tinged by corruption, they earn
only pain; they are immersed in pain. || 11 || One who becomes Gurmukh earns
peace. He comes to understand death and birth. One who looks alike upon death and
birth, is pleasing to my God. || 12 || The Gurmukh, while remaining dead, is
respected and approved. He realizes that coming and going are according to God‟s Will.
He does not die, he is not reborn, and he does not suffer in pain; his mind merges in
the Mind of God. || 13 || Very fortunate are those who find the True Guru. They
eradicate egotism and attachment from within. Their minds are immaculate, and they
are never again stained with filth. They are honored at the Door of the True Court. ||
14 || He Himself acts, and inspires all to act. He Himself watches over all; He
establishes and disestablishes. The service of the Gurmukh is pleasing to my God; one
who listens to the Truth is approved. || 15 || The Gurmukh practices Truth, and only
Truth. The Gurmukh is immaculate; no filth attaches to him. O Nanak, those who
contemplate the Naam are imbued with it. They merge in the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. || 16 || 1 || 15 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: He Himself fashioned the Universe,
through the Hukam of His Command. He Himself establishes and disestablishes, and
embellishes with grace. The True Lord Himself administers all justice; through Truth, we
merge in the True Lord. || 1 || The body takes the form of a fortress. Emotional
attachment to Maya has expanded throughout its expanse. Without the Word of the
Shabad, the body is reduced to a pile of ashes; in the end, dust mingles with dust. || 2
|| The body is the infinite fortress of gold; it is permeated by the Infinite Word of the
Shabad. The Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the True Lord forever; meeting his
Beloved, he finds peace. || 3 || The body is the temple of the Lord; the Lord Himself
embellishes it. The Dear Lord dwells within it. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
the merchants trade, and in His Grace, the Lord merges them with Himself. || 4 || He
alone is pure, who eradicates anger. He realizes the Shabad, and reforms himself. The
Creator Himself acts, and inspires all to act; He Himself abides in the mind. || 5 ||
Pure and unique is devotional worship. 

The mind and body are washed clean, contemplating the Shabad. One who remains
forever imbued with His Love, night and day — in His Mercy, the Lord inspires him to
perform devotional worship service. || 6 || In this temple of the mind, the mind
wanders around. Discarding joy like straw, it suffers in terrible pain. Without meeting
the True Guru, it finds no place of rest; He Himself has staged this play. || 7 || He
Himself is infinite; He contemplates Himself. He Himself bestows Union through actions
of excellence. What can the poor creatures do? Granting forgiveness, He unites them
with Himself. || 8 || The Perfect Lord Himself unites them with the True Guru.
Through the True Word of the Shabad, he makes them brave spiritual heroes. Uniting
them with Himself, He bestows glorious greatness; He inspires them to focus their
consciousness on the True Lord. || 9 || The True Lord is deep within the heart. How
rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize this. The treasure of the Naam abides deep
within their hearts; they meditate on the Naam with their tongues. || 10 || He
wanders through foreign lands, but does not look within himself. Attached to Maya, he
is bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death. The noose of death around his neck
will never be untied; in the love of duality, he wanders in reincarnation. || 11 || There
is no real chanting, meditation, penance or self-control, as long as one does not live to
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Accepting the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, one obtains
Truth; through Truth, one merges in the True Lord. || 12 || Sexual desire and anger
are very powerful in the world. They lead to all sorts of actions, but these only add to
all the pain. Those who serve the True Guru find peace; they are united with the True
Shabad. || 13 || Air, water and fire make up the body. Emotional attachment to Maya
rules deep within all. When one realizes the One who created him, emotional
attachment to Maya is dispelled. || 14 || Some are engrossed in emotional
attachment to Maya and pride. They are self-conceited and egotistical. They never think
about the Messenger of Death; in the end, they leave, regretting and repenting. || 15
|| He alone knows the Way, who created it. The Gurmukh, who is blessed with the
Shabad, realizes Him. Slave Nanak offers ths prayer; O Lord, let my consciousness be
attached to the True Name. || 16 || 2 || 16 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: From the very
beginning of time, and throughout the ages, the Merciful Lord has been the Great Giver.
Through the Shabad, the Word of the Perfect Guru, He is realized. Those who serve
You are immersed in You. You unite them in Union with Yourself. || 1 || You are
inaccessible and unfathomable; Your limits cannot be found. All beings and creatures
seek Your Sanctuary. As is pleases Your Will, You guide us along; You Yourself place us
on the Path. || 2 || The True Lord is, and shall always be. He Himself creates — there
is no other at all. The Giver of peace takes care of all; He Himself sustains them. || 3 ||
You are inaccessible, unfathomable, invisible and infinite; no one knows Your extent.
You Yourself realize Yourself. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, You reveal Yourself. || 4

Your Almighty Command prevails throughout the nether worlds, realms and worlds of
form. By the Hukam of Your Command, You create, and by Your Command, You
destroy. By Your Command, You unite in Union. || 5 || One who realizes Your
Command, praises Your Command. You are Inaccessible, Unfathomable and SelfSufficient. As is the understanding You give, so do I become. You Yourself reveal the
Shabad. || 6 || Night and day, the days of our lives wear away. Night and day both
bear witness to this loss. The blind, foolish, self-willed manmukh is not aware of this;
death is hovering over his head. || 7 || The mind and body are cooled and soothed,
holding tight to the Guru‟s Feet. Doubt is eliminated from within, and fear runs away.
One is in bliss forever, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord, and speaking the
True Word of His Bani. || 8 || One who knows You as the Architect of Karma, has the
good fortune of perfect destiny, and recognizes the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The
Lord, the Truest of the True, is his social class and honor. Conquering his ego, he is
united with the Lord. || 9 || The stubborn and insensitive mind is attached to the love
of duality. Deluded by doubt, the unfortunate wander around in confusion. But if they
are blessed by God‟s Grace, they serve the True Guru, and easily obtain peace. || 10 ||
He Himself created the 8.4 million species of beings. Only in this human life, is
devotional worship to the Guru implanted within. Without devotion, one lives in
manure; he falls into manure again and again. || 11 || If one is blessed with His
Grace, devotional worship to the Guru is implanted within. Without God‟s Grace, how
can anyone find Him? The Creator Himself acts, and inspires all to act; as He wills, he
leads us on. || 12 || The Simritees and the Shaastras do not know His limits. The
blind fool does not recognize the essence of reality. The Creator Himself acts, and
inspires all to act; He Himself deludes with doubt. || 13 || He Himself causes
everything to be done. He Himself joins each and every person to his tasks. He Himself
establishes and disestablishes, and watches over all; He reveals Himself to the
Gurmukh. || 14 || The True Lord and Master is profoundly deep and unfathomable.
Praising Him forever, the mind is comforted and consoled. He is inaccessible and
unfathomable; His value cannot be estimated. He dwells in the mind of the Gurmukh.
|| 15 || He Himself is detached; all others are entangled in their affairs. By Guru‟s
Grace, one comes to understand Him. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
comes to dwell deep within the heart; through the Guru‟s Teachings, one is united in
His Union. || 16 || 3 || 17 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: For thirty-six ages, utter darkness
prevailed. Only You Yourself know this, O Creator Lord. What can anyone else say?
What can anyone explain? Only You Yourself can estimate Your worth. || 1 || The
One Universal Creator created the entire Universe. All the plays and dramas are to Your
glory and greatness. The True Lord Himself makes all distinctions; He Himself breaks
and builds. || 2 || The Juggler has staged His juggling show. Through the Perfect
Guru, one comes to behold it. One who remains forever detached in the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad — his consciousness is attuned to the True Lord. || 3 || The musical
instruments of the body vibrate and resound. The Player Himself plays them. The
breath flows equally through the hearts of each and every being. 

Receiving the breath, all the instruments sing. || 4 || Whatever the Creator does,
surely comes to pass. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, egotism is consumed.
By Guru‟s Grace, some are blessed with glorious greatness; they meditate on the Naam,
the Name of the Lord. || 5 || There is no other profit as great as service to the Guru.
The Naam abides within my mind, and I praise the Naam. The Naam is forever the
Giver of peace. Through the Naam, we earn the profit. || 6 || Without the Name, all
the world suffers in misery. The more actions one does, the more the corruption
increases. Without serving the Naam, how can anyone find peace? Without the Naam,
one suffers in pain. || 7 || He Himself acts, and inspires all to act. By Guru‟s Grace,
He reveals Himself to a few. One who becomes Gurmukh breaks his bonds, and attains
the home of liberation. || 8 || One who calculates his accounts, burns in the world.
His skepticism and corruption are never dispelled. One who becomes Gurmukh
abandons his calculations; through Truth, we merge in the True Lord. || 9 || If God
grants Truth, then we may attain it. By Guru‟s Grace, it is revealed. One who praises
the True Name, and remains imbued with the Lord‟s Love, by Guru‟s Grace, finds peace.
|| 10 || The Beloved Naam, the Name of the Lord, is chanting, meditation, penance
and self-control. God, the Destroyer, destroys sins. Through the Name of the Lord, the
body and mind are cooled and soothed, and one is intuitively, easily absorbed into the
Celestial Lord. || 11 || With greed within them, their minds are filthy, and they spread
filth around. They do filthy deeds, and suffer in pain. They deal in falsehood, and
nothing but falsehood; telling lies, they suffer in pain. || 12 || Rare is that person who
enshrines the Immaculate Bani of the Guru‟s Word within his mind. By Guru‟s Grace, his
skepticism is removed. He walks in harmony with the Guru‟s Will, day and night;
remembering the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds peace. || 13 || The True Lord
Himself is the Creator. He Himself creates and destroys. One who becomes Gurmukh,
praises the Lord forever. Meeting the True Lord, he finds peace. || 14 || Making
countless efforts, sexual desire is not overcome. Everyone is burning in the fires of
sexuality and anger. Serving the True Guru, one brings his mind under control;
conquering his mind, he merges in the Mind of God. || 15 || You Yourself created the
sense of „mine‟ and „yours.‟ All creatures are Yours; You created all beings. O Nanak,
contemplate the Naam forever; through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Lord abides in the
mind. || 16 || 4 || 18 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: The Dear Lord is the Giver,
inaccessible and unfathomable. He does not have even an iota of greed; He is selfsufficient. No one can reach up to Him; He Himself unites in His Union. || 1 ||
Whatever He does, surely comes to pass. There is no other Giver, except for Him.
Whoever the Lord blesses with His gift, obtains it. Through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, He unites him with Himself. || 2 || The fourteen worlds are Your markets.
The True Guru reveals them, along with one‟s inner being. 

One who deals in the Name, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, obtains it. || 3 ||
Serving the True Guru, one obtains intuitive bliss. The Lord of the Universe comes to
dwell within the heart. He intuitively practices devotional worship day and night; God
Himself practices devotional worship. || 4 || Those who are separated from the True
Guru, suffer in misery. Night and day, they are punished, and they suffer in total agony.
Their faces are blackened, and they do not obtain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence.
They suffer in sorrow and agony. || 5 || Those who serve the True Guru are very
fortunate. They intuitively enshrine love for the True Lord. They practice Truth, forever
Truth; they are united in Union with the True Lord. || 6 || He alone obtains the Truth,
unto whom the True Lord gives it. His inner being is filled with Truth, and his doubt is
dispelled. The True Lord Himself is the Giver of Truth; he alone obtains the Truth, unto
whom He gives it. || 7 || He Himself is the Creator of all. Only one whom He
instructs, understands Him. He Himself forgives, and grants glorious greatness. He
himself unites in His Union. || 8 || Acting egotistically, one loses his life. Even in the
world hereafter, emotioal attachment to Maya does not leave him. In the world
hereafter, the Messenger of Death calls him to account, and crushes him like sesame
seeds in the oil-press. || 9 || By perfect destiny, one serves the Guru. If God grants
His Grace, then one serves. The Messenger of Death cannot even approach him, and in
the Mansion of the True Lord‟s Presence, he finds peace. || 10 || They alone find
peace, who are pleasing to Your Will. By perfect destiny, they are attached to the
Guru‟s service. All glorious greatness rests in Your Hands; he alone obtains it, unto
whom You give it. || 11 || Through the Guru, one‟s inner being is enlightened and
illumined. The wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell in the mind.
The jewel of spiritual wisdom ever illumines the heart, and the darkness of spiritual
ignorance is dispelled. || 12 || The blind and ignorant are attached to duality. The
unfortunates are drowned without water, and die. When they depart from the world,
they do not find the Lord‟s door and home; bound and gagged at Death‟s door, they
suffer in pain. || 13 || Without serving the True Guru, no one finds liberation. Go ask
any spiritual teacher or meditator. Whoever serves the True Guru is blessed with
glorious greatness, and honored in the Court of the True Lord. || 14 || One who
serves the True Guru, the Lord merges into Himself. Cutting away attachment, one
lovingly focuses on the True Lord. The merchants deal forever in Truth; they earn the
profit of the Naam. || 15 || The Creator Himself acts, and inspires all to act. He alone
is liberated, who dies in the Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, the Naam dwells deep
within the mind; meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 16 || 5 || 19 ||
MARU, THIRD MEHL: Whatever You do, is done. How rare are those who walk in
harmony with the Lord‟s Will. One who surrenders to the Lord‟s Will finds peace; he
finds peace in the Lord‟s Will. || 1 || Your Will is pleasing to the Gurmukh. Practicing
Truth, he intuitively finds peace. Many long to walk in harmony with the Lord‟s Will; He
Himself inspires us to surrender to His Will. || 2 || One who surrenders to Your Will,
meets with You, Lord. 

One who is pleased with Your Will is immersed in You. Glorious greatness rests in God‟s
Will; rare are those who accept it. || 3 || When it pleases His Will, He leads us to
meet the Guru. The Gurmukh finds the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. By
Your Will, You created the whole Universe; those whom You bless with Your favor are
pleased with Your Will. || 4 || The blind, self-willed manmukhs practice cleverness.
They do not surrender to the Lord‟s Will, and suffer terrible pain. Deluded by doubt,
they come and go in reincarnation; they never find the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence.
|| 5 || The True Guru brings Union, and grants glorious greatness. The Primal Lord
ordained service to the True Guru. Serving the True Guru, the Naam is obtained.
Through the Naam, one finds peace. || 6 || Everything wells up from the Naam, and
through the Naam, perishes. By Guru‟s Grace, the mind and body are pleased with the
Naam. Meditating on the Naam, the tongue is drenched with the Lord‟s sublime
essence. Through this essence, the Essence is obtained. || 7 || Rare are those who
find the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence within the mansion of their own body. Through
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they lovingly focus their consciousness on the True
Lord. Whoever the Lord blesses with Truth obtains Truth; he merges in Truth, and only
Truth. || 8 || Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind and body suffer in
pain. Attached to the love of Maya, he earns nothing but disease. Without the Name,
his mind and body are afflicted with leprosy, and he obtains his home in hell. || 9 ||
Those who are imbued with the Naam — their bodies are immaculate and pure. Their
soul-swan is immaculate, and in the Lord‟s Love, they find eternal peace. Praising the
Naam, they find eternal peace, and dwell in the home of their own inner being. || 10 ||
Everyone deals and trades. Without the Name, all the world loses. Naked they come,
and naked they go; without the Name, they suffer in pain. || 11 || He alone obtains
the Naam, unto whom the Lord gives it. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the
Lord comes to dwell in the mind. By Guru‟s Grace, the Naam dwells deep within the
heart, and one meditates upon the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 12 || Everyone
who comes into the world, longs for the Name. They alone are blessed with the Name,
whose past actions were so ordained by the Primal Lord. Those who obtain the Name
are very fortunate. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they are united with God.
|| 13 || Utterly incomparable is the fortress of the body. Within it, God sits in
contemplation. He administers true justice, and trades in Truth; through Him, one finds
the eternal, unchanging dwelling. || 14 || Deep within the inner self are glorious
homes and beautiful places. But rare is that person who, as Gurmukh, finds these
places. If one stays in these places, and praises the True Lord, the True Lord comes to
dwell in the mind. || 15 || My Creator Lord has formed this formation. He has placed
everything within this body. O Nanak, those who deal in the Naam are imbued with His
Love. The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 16 || 6 || 20 ||
MARU, THIRD MEHL: Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, the body becomes
golden. The Lord abides there; He has no end or limitation. Night and day, serve the
Lord, and chant the True Word of the Guru‟s Bani. 

Through the Shabad, meet the Dear Lord. || 1 || I am a sacrifice to those who
remember the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I unite in Union with the
Lord. I touch the dust of their feet to my face and forehead; sitting in the Society of the
Saints, I sing His Glorious Praises. || 2 || I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, as I
am pleasing to the Lord God. With the Lord‟s Name deep within my inner being, I am
adorned with the Word of the Shabad. The Word of the Guru‟s Bani is heard throughout
the four corners of the world; through it, we merge in the True Name. || 3 || That
humble being, who searches within himself, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
sees the Lord with his eyes. Through the Guru‟s Shabad, he applies the ointment of
spiritual wisdom to his eyes; the Gracious Lord, in His Grace, unites him with Himself.
|| 4 || By great good fortune, I obtained this body; in this human life, I have focused
my consciousness on the Word of the Shabad. Without the Shabad, everything is
enveloped in utter darkness; only the Gurmukh understands. || 5 || Some merely
waste away their lives — why have they even come into the world? The self-willed
manmukhs are attached to the love of duality. This opportunity shall not into their
hands again; their foot slips, and they come to regret and repent. || 6 || Through the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the body is sanctified. The True Lord, the ocean of virtue,
dwells within it. One who sees the Truest of the True everywhere, hears the Truth, and
enshrines it within his mind. || 7 || Egotism and mental calculations are relieved
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Keep the Dear Lord close, and enshrine Him in
your heart. One who praises the Lord forever, through the Guru‟s Shabad, meets with
the True Lord, and finds peace. || 8 || He alone remembers the Lord, whom the Lord
inspires to remember. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He comes to dwell in
the mind. He Himself sees, and He Himself understands; He merges all into Himself. ||
9 || He alone knows, who has placed the object within his mind. Through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, he comes to understand himself. That humble being who
understands himself is immaculate. He proclaims the Guru‟s Bani, and the Word of the
Shabad. || 10 || This body is sanctified and purified; through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, it contemplates the Lord, the ocean of virtue. One who chants the Glorious
Praises of the Lord night and day, and remains attuned to His Love, chants His Glorious
Virtues, immersed in the Glorious Lord. || 11 || This body is the source of all Maya; in
love with duality, it is deluded by doubt. It does not remember the Lord, and suffers in
eternal pain. Without remembering the Lord, it suffers in pain. || 12 || One who
serves the True Guru is approved and respected. His body and soul-swan are
immaculate and pure; in the Court of the Lord, he is known to be true. He serves the
Lord, and enshrines the Lord in his mind; he is exalted, singing the Glorious Praises of
the Lord. || 13 || Without good destiny, no one can serve the True Guru. The selfwilled manmukhs are deluded, and die weeping and wailing. Those who are blessed by
the Guru‟s Glance of Grace — the Dear Lord unites them with Himself. || 14 || In the
body fortress, are the solidly-constructed markets. The Gurmukh purchases the object,
and takes care of it. Meditating on the Name of the Lord, day and night, he attains the
sublime, exalted status. || 15 || The True Lord Himself is the Giver of peace. Through
the Shabad of the Perfect Guru, He is realized. Nanak praises the Naam, the True Name
of the Lord; through perfect destiny, He is found. 

|| 16 || 7 || 21 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: The Formless Lord created the universe of
form. By the Hukam of His Command, He created attachment to Maya. The Creator
Himself stages all the plays; hearing of the True Lord, enshrine Him in your mind. || 1
|| Maya, the mother, gave birth to the three gunas, the three qualities, and proclaimed
the four Vedas to Brahma. Creating the years, months, days and dates, He infused
intelligence into the world. || 2 || Service to the Guru is the most excellent action.
Enshrine the Lord‟s Name within your heart. The Word of the Guru‟s Bani prevails
throughout the world; through this Bani, the Lord‟s Name is obtained. || 3 || He reads
the Vedas, but he starts arguments night and day. He does not remember the Naam,
the Name of the Lord; he is bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death. In the love
of duality, he suffers in pain forever; he is deluded by doubt, and confused by the three
gunas. || 4 || The Gurmukh is in love with the One Lord alone; he submerges in his
mind the three-phased desire. Through the True Word of the Shabad, he is liberated
forever; he renounces emotional attachment to Maya. || 5 || Those who are so preordained to be imbued, are imbued with love for the Lord. By Guru‟s Grace, they are
intuitively intoxicated. Serving the True Guru forever, they find God; He Himself unites
them with Himself. || 6 || In attachment to Maya and doubt, the Lord is not found.
Attached to the love of duality, one suffers in pain. The crimson color lasts for only a
few days; all too soon, it fades away. || 7 || So color this mind in the Fear and the
Love of God. Dyed in this color, one merges in the True Lord. By perfect destiny, some
may obtain this color. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, this color is applied. || 8 || The
self-willed manmukhs take great pride in themselves. In the Court of the Lord, they are
never honored. Attached to duality, they waste their lives; without understanding, they
suffer in pain. || 9 || My God has hidden Himself deep within the self. By Guru‟s
Grace, one is united in the Lord‟s Union. God is True, and True is His trade, through
which the priceless Naam is obtained. || 10 || No one has found this body‟s value. My
Lord and Master has worked His handiwork. One who becomes Gurmukh purifies his
body, and then the Lord unites him with Himself. || 11 || Within the body, one loses,
and within the body, one wins. The Gurmukh seeks the self-sustaining Lord. The
Gurmukh trades, and finds peace forever; he intuitively merges in the Celestial Lord. ||
12 || True is the Lord‟s Mansion, and True is His treasure. The Great Giver Himself
gives. The Gurmukh praises the Giver of peace; his mind is united with the Lord, and he
comes to know His worth. || 13 || Within the body is the object; its value cannot be
estimated. He Himself grants glorious greatness to the Gurmukh. He alone knows this
object, to whom this store belongs; the Gurmukh is blessed with it, and does not come
to regret. || 14 || The Dear Lord is pervading and permeating all. By Guru‟s Grace, He
is found. He Himself unites in His Union; through the Word of the Shabad, one
intuitively merges with Him. || 15 || 

The True Lord Himself unites us in the Word of His Shabad. Within the Shabad, doubt is
driven out. O Nanak, He blesses us with His Naam, and throgh the Naam, peace is
found. || 16 || 8 || 22 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: He is inaccessible, unfathomable and
self-sustaining. He Himself is merciful, inaccessible and unlimited. No one can reach up
to Him; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He is met. || 1 || He alone serves
You, who pleases You. Through the Guru‟s Shabad, he merges in the True Lord. Night
and day, he chants the Lord‟s Praises, day and night; his tongue savors and delights in
the sublime essence of the Lord. || 2 || Those who die in the Shabad — their death is
exalted and glorified. They enshrine the Lord‟s Glories in their hearts. Holding tight to
the Guru‟s feet, their lives becomes prosperous, and they are rid of the love of duality.
|| 3 || The Dear Lord unites them in Union with Himself. Through the Guru‟s Shabad,
self-conceit is dispelled. Those who remain attuned to devotional worship to the Lord,
night and day, earn the profit in this world. || 4 || What Glorious Virtues of Yours
should I describe? I cannot describe them. You have no end or limitation. Your value
cannot be estimated. When the Giver of peace Himself bestows His Mercy, the virtuous
are absorbed in virtue. || 5 || In this world, emotional attachment is spread all over.
The ignorant, self-willed manmukh is immersed in utter darkness. Chasing after worldly
affairs, he wastes away his life in vain; without the Name, he suffers in pain. || 6 || If
God grants His Grace, then one finds the True Guru. Through the Shabad, the filth of
egotism is burned away. The mind becomes immaculate, and the jewel of spiritual
wisdom brings enlightenment; the darkness of spiritual ignorance is dispelled. || 7 ||
Your Names are countless; Your value cannot be estimated. I enshrine the Lord‟s True
Name within my heart. Who can estimate Your value, God? You are immersed and
absorbed in Yourself. || 8 || The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is priceless,
inaccessible and infinite. No one can weigh it. You Yourself weigh, and estimate all;
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, You unite, when the weight is perfect. || 9 ||
Your servant serves, and offers this prayer. Please, let me sit near You, and unite me
with Yourself. You are the Giver of peace to all beings; by perfect karma, we meditate
on You. || 10 || Chastity, truth and self-control come by practicing and living the
Truth. This mind becomes immaculate and pure, singing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord. In this world of poison, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained, if it pleases my Dear
Lord. || 11 || He alone understands, whom God inspires to understand. Singing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord, one‟s inner being is awakened. Egotism and
possessiveness are silenced and subdued, and one intuitively finds the True Lord. || 12
|| Without good karma, countless others wander around. They die, and die again, only
to be reborn; they cannot escape the cycle of reincarnation. Imbued with poison, they
practice poison and corruption, and they never find peace. || 13 || Many disguise
themselves with religious robes. Without the Shabad, no one has conquered egotism.
One who remains dead while yet alive is liberated, and merges in the True Name. || 14
|| Spiritual ignorance and desire burn this human body. 

He alone puts out this fire, who practices and lives the Guru‟s Shabad. His body and
mind are cooled and soothed, and his anger is silenced; conquering egotism, he merges
in the Lord. || 15 || True is the Lord and Master, and True is His glorious greatness.
By Guru‟s Grace, a rare few attain this. Nanak offers this one prayer: through the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, may I merge in the Lord. || 16 || 1 || 23 || MARU,
THIRD MEHL: By Your Grace, please unite with Your devotees. Your devotees ever
praise You, lovingly focusing on You. In Your Sanctuary, they are saved, O Creator
Lord; You unite them in Union with Yourself. || 1 || Sublime and exalted is devotion
to the Perfect Word of the Shabad. Peace prevails within; they are pleasing to Your
Mind. One whose mind and body are imbued with true devotion, focuses his
consciousness on the True Lord. || 2 || In egotism, the body is forever burning. When
God grants His Grace, one meets the Perfect Guru. The Shabad dispels the spiritual
ignorance within, and through the True Guru, one finds peace. || 3 || The blind, selfwilled manmukh acts blindly. He is in terrible trouble, and wanders in reincarnation. He
can never snap the noose of Death, and in the end, he suffers in horrible pain. || 4 ||
Through the Shabad, one‟s comings and goings in reincarnation are ended. He keeps
the True Name enshrined within his heart. He dies in the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
and conquers his mind; stilling his egotism, he merges in the Lord. || 5 || Coming and
going, the people of the world are wasting away. Without the True Guru, no one finds
permanence and stability. The Shabad shines its Light deep within the self, and one
dwells in peace; one‟s light merges into the Light. || 6 || The five demons think of evil
and corruption. The expanse is the manifestation of emotional attachment to Maya.
Serving the True Guru, one is liberated, and the five demons are put under his control.
|| 7 || Without the Guru, there is only the darkness of attachment. Over and over,
time and time again, they are drowned. Meeting the True Guru, Truth is implanted
within, and the True Name becomes pleasing to the mind. || 8 || True is His Door,
and True is His Court, His Royal Darbaar. The true ones serve Him, through the Beloved
Word of the Shabad. Singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord, in the true melody, I
am immersed and absorbed in Truth. || 9 || Deep within the home of the self, one
finds the home of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, one easily,
intuitively finds it. There, one is not afflicted with sorrow or separation; merge into the
Celestial Lord with intuitive ease. || 10 || The evil people live in the love of duality.
They wander around, totally attached and thirsty. They sit in evil gatherings, and suffer
in pain forever; they earn pain, nothing but pain. || 11 || Without the True Guru,
there is no Sangat, no Congregation. Without the Shabad, no one can cross over to the
other side. One who intuitively chants God‟s Glorious Praises day and night — his light
merges into the Light. || 12 || The body is the tree; the bird of the soul dwells within
it. It drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar, resting in the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. It never
flies away, and it does not come or go; it dwells within the home of its own self. || 13
|| Purify the body, and contemplate the Shabad. Remove the poisonous drug of
emotional attachment, and eradicate doubt. 

The Giver of peace Himself bestows His Mercy, and unites us in Union with Himself. ||
14 || He is always near at hand; He is never far away. Through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, realize that He is very near. Your heart-lotus shall blossom forth, and the ray of
God‟s Divine Light shall illuminate your heart; He shall be revealed to You. || 15 ||
The True Lord is Himself the Creator. He Himself kills, and gives life; there is no other
at all. O Nanak, through the Naam, the Name of the Lord, glorious greatness is
obtained. Eradicating self-conceit, peace is found. || 16 || 2 || 24 ||
MARU, SOLAHAS, FOURTH MEHL:

The Lord Lord Himself is the One who exalts and embellishes. Do not consider any
other work. The True Lord abides deep within the heart of the Gurmukh, who intuitively
merges in the True Lord. || 1 || The True Lord dwells within the minds of all. By
Guru‟s Grace, they are intuitively absorbed in Him. Calling out, “Guru, Guru”, I have
found eternal peace; my consciousness is focused on the Guru‟s feet. || 2 || The True
Guru is spiritual wisdom; the True Guru is worship and adoration. I serve the True
Guru, and no other. From the True Guru, I have obtained the wealth, the jewel of the
Naam. Service to the True Guru is pleasing to me. || 3 || Without the True Guru,
those who are attached to duality come and go, and wander in reincarnation; these
unfortunate ones die. O Nanak, even after they are emancipated, those who become
Gurmukh remain in the Guru‟s Sanctuary. || 4 || The love of the Gurmukh is forever
true. I beg for the invaluable Naam, the Name of the Lord, from the Guru. O Dear Lord,
please be kind, and grant Your Grace; please keep me in the Guru‟s Sanctuary. || 5 ||
The True Guru trickles the Ambrosial Nectar into my mouth. My Tenth Gate has been
opened and revealed. The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds
there, with the melody of the Guru‟s Bani; one is easily, intuitively absorbed in the Lord.
|| 6 || Those who are so pre-ordained by the Creator, pass their nights and days
calling on the Guru. Without the True Guru, no one understands; focus your
consciousness on the Guru‟s Feet. || 7 || The Lord Himself blesses those with whom
He is pleased. The Gurmukh receives the wealth of the Naam. When the Lord grants
His Grace, He bestows the Naam; Nanak is immersed and absorbed in the Naam. || 8
|| The jewel of spiritual wisdom is revealed within the mind. The wealth of the Naam
is easily, intuitively received. This glorious greatness is obtained from the Guru; I am
forever a sacrifice to the True Guru. || 9 || With the rising of the sun, the darkness of
the night is dispelled. Spiritual ignorance is eradicated, by the priceless jewel of the
Guru. The True Guru is the fantastically valuable jewel of spiritual wisdom; blessed by
God‟s Mercy, peace is found. || 10 || The Gurmukh obtains the Naam, and his good
reputation increases. Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he finds peace. He
remains lovingly focused on the Naam. || 11 || The Gurmukh receives the Naam. In
intuitive peace he wakes, and in intuitive peace he sleeps. 

The Gurmukh is immersed and absorbed in the Naam; Nanak meditates on the Naam.
|| 12 || The Ambrosial Nectar of the Guru‟s Bani is in the mouth of the devotees. The
Gurmukhs chant and repeat the Lord‟s Name. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
their minds forever blossom forth; they focus their minds on the Lord‟s Feet. || 13 || I
am foolish and ignorant; I have no wisdom at all. From the True Guru, I have obtained
understanding in my mind. O Dear Lord, please be kind to me, and grant Your Grace;
let me be committed to serving the True Guru. || 14 || Those who know the True
Guru realize the One Lord. The Giver of peace is all-pervading, permeating everywhere.
Understanding my own soul, I have obtained the Supreme Status; my awareness is
immersed in selfless service. || 15 || Those who are blessed with glorious greatness
by the Primal Lord God are lovingly focused on the True Guru, who dwells within their
minds. The Giver of life to the world Himself meets them; O Nanak, they are absorbed
in His Being. || 16 || 1 || MARU, FOURTH MEHL: The Lord is inaccessible and
unfathomable; He is eternal and imperishable. He dwells in the heart, and is allpervading, permeating everywhere. There is no other Giver except Him; worship the
Lord, O mortals. || 1 || No one can kill anyone who is saved by the Savior Lord. So
serve such a Lord, O Saints, whose Bani is exalted and sublime. || 2 || When it seems
that a place is empty and void, there, the Creator Lord is permeating and pervading. He
causes the dried-up branch to blossom forth in greenery again; so meditate on the Lord
— wondrous are His ways! || 3 || The One who knows the anguish of all beings —
unto that Lord and Master, I am a sacrifice. Offer your prayers to the One who is the
Giver of all peace and joy. || 4 || But one who does not know the state of the soul —
do not say anything to such an ignorant person. Do not argue with fools, O mortals.
Meditate on the Lord, in the state of Nirvaanaa. || 5 || Don‟t worry — let the Creator
take care of it. The Lord gives to all creatures in the water and on the land. My God
bestows His blessings without being asked, even to worms in soil and stones. || 6 ||
Do not place your hopes in friends, children and siblings. Do not place your hopes in
kings or the business of others. Without the Lord‟s Name, no one will be your helper; so
meditate on the Lord, the Lord of the world. || 7 || Night and day, chant the Naam.
All your hopes and desires shall be fulfilled. O servant Nanak, chant the Naam, the
Name of the Destroyer of fear, and your life-night shall pass in intuitive peace and
poise. || 8 || Those who serve the Lord find peace. They are intuitively absorbed in
the Lord‟s Name. The Lord preserves the honor of those who seek His Sanctuary; go
and consult the Vedas and the Puraanas. || 9 || That humble being is attached to the
Lord‟s service, whom the Lord so attaches. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
doubt and fear are dispelled. In his own home, he remains unattached, like the lotus
flower in the water. 

|| 10 || One who serves in egotism is not accepted or approved. Such a person is
born, only to die again, and come and go in reincarnation. Perfect is that penance and
that service, which is pleasing to the Mind of my Lord. || 11 || What Glorious Virtues
of Yours should I chant, O my Lord and Master? You are the Inner-knower, the
Searcher of all souls. I beg for blessings from You, O Creator Lord; I repeat Your Name
night and day. || 12 || Some speak in egotistical power. Some have the power of
authority and Maya. I have no other Support at all, except the Lord. O Creator Lord,
please save me, meek and dishonored. || 13 || You bless the meek and dishonored
with honor, as it pleases You, O Lord. Many others argue in conflict, coming and going
in reincarnation. Those people, whose side You take, O Lord and Master, are elevated
and successful. || 14 || Those who meditate forever on the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, by Guru‟s Grace, obtain the supreme status. Those who serve the Lord find peace;
without serving Him, they regret and repent. || 15 || You are pervading all, O Lord of
the world. He alone meditates on the Lord, upon whose forehead the Guru places His
hand. Entering the Sanctuary of the Lord, I meditate on the Lord; servant Nanak is the
slave of His slaves. || 16 || 2 ||
MARU, SOLAHAS, FIFTH MEHL:

He infused His power into the earth. He suspends the heavens upon the feet of His
Command. He created fire and locked it into wood. That God protects all, O Siblings of
Destiny. || 1 || He gives nourishment to all beings and creatures. He Himself is the
all-powerful Creator, the Cause of causes. In an instant, He establishes and
disestablishes; He is your help and support. || 2 || He cherished you in your mother‟s
womb. With every breath and morsel of food, He is with you, and takes care of you.
Forever and ever, meditate on that Beloved; Great is His glorious greatness! || 3 ||
The sultans and nobles are reduced to dust in an instant. God cherishes the poor, and
makes them into rulers. He is the Destroyer of egotistical pride, the Support of all. His
value cannot be estimated. || 4 || He alone is honorable, and he alone is wealthy,
within whose mind the Lord God abides. He alone is my mother, father, child, relative
and sibling, who created this Universe. || 5 || I have come to God‟s Sanctuary, and so
I fear nothing. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I am sure to be saved.
One who adores the Creator in thought, word and deed, shall never be punished. || 6
|| One whose mind and body are permeated with the Lord, the treasure of virtue,
does not wander in birth, death and reincarnation. Pain vanishes and peace prevails,
when one is satisfied and fulfilled. || 7 || My Lord and Master is my best friend. 

The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, is in all places and interspaces. Meditating,
meditating in remembrance on the Perfect Transcendent Lord, I am rid of all anxieties
and calculations. || 8 || One who has the Name of the Lord has hundreds of
thousands and millions of arms. The wealth of the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises is with
him. In His Mercy, God has blessed me with the sword of spiritual wisdom; I have
attacked and killed the demons. || 9 || Chant the Chant of the Lord, the Chant of
Chants. You shall not see the 8.4 million types of hell; sing His Glorious Praises and
remain saturated with loving devotion || 10 || He is the Savior of worlds and galaxies.
He is lofty, unfathomable, inaccessible and infinite. That humble being, unto whom God
grants His Grace, meditates on Him. || 11 || God has broken my bonds, and united
me with Himself. In His Mercy, He has made me the slave of His home. The unstruck
celestial sound current resounds and vibrates, when one performs acts of true service.
|| 12 || O God, I have enshrined faith in You within my mind. My egotistical intellect
has been driven out. God has made me His own, and now I have a glorious reputation
in this world. || 13 || Proclaim His Glorious Victory, and meditate on the Lord of the
Universe. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my Lord God. I do not see any other except
Him. The One Lord pervades the whole world. || 14 || True, True, True is God. By
Guru‟s Grace, my mind is attuned to Him forever. Your humble servants live by
meditating, meditating in remembrance on You, merging in You, O One Universal
Creator. || 15 || The Dear Lord is the Beloved of His humble devotees. My Lord and
Master is the Savior of all. Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, all desires are fulfilled. He has saved the honor of servant Nanak. || 16 || 1 ||
MARU, SOLAHAS, FIFTH MEHL:

The body-bride is attached to the Yogi, the husband-soul. She is involved with him,
enjoying pleasure and delights. As a consequence of past actions, they have come
together, enjoying pleasurable play. Whatever the husband does, the bride willingly
accepts. The husband adorns his bride, and keeps her with himself. Joining together,
they live in harmony day and night; the husband comforts his wife. || 2 || When the
bride asks, the husband runs around in all sorts of ways. Whatever he finds, he brings
to show his bride. But there is one thing he cannot reach, and so his bride remains
hungry and thirsty. || 3 || With her palms pressed together, the bride offers her
prayer, “O my beloved, do not leave me and go to foreign lands; please stay here with
me. Do such business within our home, that my hunger and thirst may be relieved.” ||
4 || All sorts of religious rituals are performed in this age, but without the sublime
essence of the Lord, not an iota of peace is found. 

When the Lord becomes Merciful, O Nanak, then in the Sat Sangat, the True
Congregation, the bride and the husband enjoy ecstasy and bliss. || 5 || The bodybride is blind, and the groom is clever and wise. The creation was created of the five
elements. That merchandise, for which you have come into the world, is received only
from the True Guru. || 6 || The body-bride says, “Please live with me, O my beloved,
peaceful, young lord. Without you, I am of no account. Please give me your word, that
you will not leave me”. || 7 || The soul-husband says, “I am the slave of my
Commander. He is my Great Lord and Master, who is not dependent on anyone. As long
as He keeps me, I will remain with Him. When He summons me, I shall arise and
depart.” || 8 || The husband speaks words of Truth to the bride, but the bride is
restless and inexperienced, and she does not understand anything. Again and again,
she begs her husband to stay; she thinks that he is just joking when he answers her. ||
9 || The Order comes, and the husband-soul is called. He does not consult with his
bride, and does not ask her opinion. He gets up and marches off, and the discarded
body-bride mingles with dust. O Nanak, behold the illusion of emotional attachment and
hope. || 10 || O greedy mind — listen, O my mind! Serve the True Guru day and
night forever. Without the True Guru, the faithless cynics rot away and die. The noose
of Death is around the necks of those who have no guru. || 11 || The self-willed
manmukh comes, and the self-willed manmukh goes. The manmukh suffers beatings
again and again. The manmukh endures as many hells as there are; the Gurmukh is not
even touched by them. || 12 || He alone is Gurmukh, who is pleasing to the Dear
Lord. Who can destroy anyone who is robed in honor by the Lord? The blissful one is
forever in bliss; he is dressed in robes of honor. || 13 || I am a sacrifice to the Perfect
True Guru. He is the Giver of Sanctuary, the Heroic Warrior who keeps His Word. Such
is the Lord God, the Giver of peace, whom I have met; He shall never leave me or go
anywhere else. || 14 || He is the treasure of virtue; His value cannot be estimated.
He is perfectly permeating each and every heart, prevailing everywhere. Nanak seeks
the Sanctuary of the Destroyer of the pains of the poor; I am the dust of the feet of
Your slaves. || 15 || 1 || 2 ||
MARU, SOLAHAS, FIFTH MEHL:

My Blissful Lord is forever in bliss. He fills each and every heart, and judges each and
everyone. The True Lord and Master is above the heads of all kings; there is none other
than Him. || 1 || He is joyful, blissful and merciful. God‟s Light is manifest
everywhere. He creates forms, and gazing upon them, He enjoys them; He Himself
worships Himself. || 2 || He contemplates His own creative power. The True Lord
Himself creates the expanse of the Universe. He Himself stages the play, day and night;
He Himself listens, and hearing, rejoices. || 3 || True is His throne, and True is His
kingdom. 

True is the treasure of the True Banker. He Himself is True, and true is all that He has
established. True is the prevailing Order of the True Lord. || 4 || True is the justice of
the True Lord. Your place is forever True, O God. True is Your Creative Power, and True
is the Word of Your Bani. True is the peace which You give, O my Lord and Master. ||
5 || You alone are the greatest king. By the Hukam of Your Command, O True Lord,
our affairs are fulfilled. Inwardly and outwardly, You know everything; You Yourself are
pleased with Yourself. || 6 || You are the great party-goer, You are the great enjoyer.
You are detached in Nirvaanaa, You are the Yogi. All celestial comforts are in Your
home; Your Glance of Grace rains Nectar. || 7 || You alone give Your gifts. You grant
Your gifts unto all the beings of the world. Your treasures are overflowing, and are
never exhausted; through them, we remain satisfied and fulfilled. || 8 || The Siddhas,
seekers and forest-dwellers beg from You. The celibates and abstainers, and those who
abide in peace beg from You. You alone are the Great Giver; all are beggars of You.
You bless all the world with Your gifts. || 9 || Your devotees worship You with infinite
love. In an instant, You establish and disestablish. Your weight is so heavy, O my
infinite Lord and Master. Your devotees surrender to the Hukam of Your Command. ||
10 || They alone know You, whom You bless with Your Glance of Grace. Through the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they enjoy Your Love forever. They alone are clever,
handsome and wise, who are pleasing to Your Mind. || 11 || One who keeps You in
his consciousness, becomes carefree and independent. One who keeps You in his
consciousness, is the true king. One who keeps You in his consciousness — what does
he have to fear? And what else does he need to do? || 12 || Thirst and desire are
quenched, and one‟s inner being is cooled and soothed. The True Guru has mended the
broken one. Awareness of the Word of the Shabad has awakened within my heart.
Shaking it and vibrating it, I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. || 13 || I shall not die; I
shall live forever and ever. I have become immortal; I am eternal and imperishable. I
do not come, and I do not go. The Guru has driven out my doubts. || 14 || Perfect is
the Word of the Perfect Guru. One who is attached to the Perfect Lord, is immersed in
the Perfect Lord. His love increases day by day, and when it is weighed, it does not
decrease. || 15 || When the gold is made one hundred percent pure, its color is true
to the jeweller‟s eye. Assaying it, it is placed in the treasury by God the Jeweller, and it
is not melted down again. || 16 || Your Naam is Ambrosial Nectar, O my Lord and
Master. Nanak, Your slave, is forever a sacrifice to You. In the Society of the Saints, I
have found great peace; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, this
mind is pleased and satisfied. || 17 || 1 || 3 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL, SOLHAS:

The Guru is the Lord of the World, the Guru is the Master of the Universe. The Guru is
merciful, and always forgiving. The Guru is the Shaastras, the Simritees and the six
rituals. 

The Guru is the Holy Shrine. || 1 || Meditating in remembrance on the Guru, all sinful
residues are erased. Meditating in remembrance on the Guru, one is not strangled by
the noose of Death. Meditating in remembrance on the Guru, the mind becomes
immaculate; the Guru eliminates egotistical pride. || 2 || The Guru‟s servant is not
consigned to hell. The Guru‟s servant meditates on the Supreme Lord God. The Guru‟s
servant joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; the Guru ever gives the life
of the soul. || 3 || At the Gurdwara, the Guru‟s Gate, the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises
are sung. Meeting with the True Guru, one chants the Lord‟s Praises. The True Guru
eradicates sorrow and suffering, and bestows honor in the Court of the Lord. || 4 ||
The Guru has revealed the inaccessible and unfathomable Lord. The True Guru returns
to the Path, those who have wandered away. No obstacles stand in the way of devotion
to the Lord, for one who serves the Guru. The Guru implants perfect spiritual wisdom.
|| 5 || The Guru has revealed the Lord everywhere. The Lord of the Universe is
permeating and pervading the water and the land. The high and the low are all the
same to Him. Focus your mind‟s meditation intuitively on Him. || 6 || Meeting with
the Guru, all thirst is quenched. Meeting with the Guru, one is not watched by Maya.
The Perfect Guru bestows truth and contentment; I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the
Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 7 || The Word of the Guru‟s Bani is contained in all.
He Himself hears it, and He Himself repeats it. Those who meditate on it, are all
emancipated; they attain the eternal and unchanging home. || 8 || The Glory of the
True Guru is known only to the True Guru. Whatever He does, is according to the
Pleasure of His Will. Your humble servants beg for the dust of the feet of the Holy;
Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. || 9 || 1 || 4 ||
MARU, SOLAHAS, FIFTH MEHL:

The Primal, Immaculate Lord God is formless. The Detached Lord is Himself prevailing
in all. He has no race or social class, no identifying mark. By the Hukam of His Will, He
created the entire universe. || 1 || Out of all the 8.4 million species of beings, God
blessed mankind with glory. That human who misses this chance, shall suffer the pains
of coming and going in reincarnation. || 2 || What should I say, to one who has been
created. The Gurmukh receives the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He
alone is confused, whom the Lord Himself confuses. He alone understands, whom the
Lord inspires to understand. || 3 || This body has been made the village of joy and
sorrow. They alone are emancipated, who seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru. One
who remains untouched by the three qualities, the three gunas — such a Gurmukh is
blessed with glory. || 4 || You can do anything, but whatever you do, only serves to
tie your feet. The seed which is planted out of season does not sprout, and all one‟s
capital and profits are lost. || 5 || In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Kirtan of the
Lord‟s Praises are most sublime and exalted. Become Gurmukh, chant and focus your
meditation. 

You shall save yourself, and save all your generations as well. You shall go to the Court
of the Lord with honor. || 6 || All the continents, nether worlds, islands and worlds —
God Himself has made them all subject to death. The One Imperishable Lord Himself is
unmoving and unchanging. Meditating on Him, one becomes unchanging. || 7 || The
Lord‟s servant becomes like the Lord. Do not think that, because of his human body, he
is different. The waves of the water rise up in various ways, and then the water merges
again in water. || 8 || A beggar begs for charity at His Door. When God pleases, He
takes pity on him. Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, to satisfy
my mind, O Lord. Through the Kirtan of Your Praises, my mind is held steady. || 9 ||
The Beauteous Lord and Master is not controlled in any way. The Lord does that which
pleases the Saints of the Lord. He does whatever they wish to be done; nothing blocks
their way at His Door. || 10 || Wherever the mortal is confronted with difficulty, there
he should meditate on the Lord of the Universe. Where there are no children, spouse or
friends, there the Lord Himself comes to the rescue. || 11 || The Great Lord and
Master is inaccessible and unfathomable. How can anyone meet with God, the selfsuficient One? Those who have had the noose cut away from around their necks, whom
God has set back upon the Path, obtain a place in the Sangat, the Congregation. || 12
|| One who realizes the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command is said to be His servant. He
endures both bad and good equally. When egotism is silenced, then one comes to know
the One Lord. Such a Gurmukh intuitively merges in the Lord. || 13 || The devotees
of the Lord dwell forever in peace. With a child-like, innocent nature, they remain
detached, turning away from the world. They enjoy various pleasures in many ways;
God caresses them, like a father caressing his son. || 14 || He is inaccessible and
unfathomable; His value cannot be estimated. We meet Him, only when He causes us
to meet. The Lord is revealed to those humble Gurmukhs, who have such pre-ordained
destiny inscribed upon their foreheads. || 15 || You Yourself are the Creator Lord, the
Cause of causes. You created the Universe, and You support the whole earth. Servant
Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of Your Door, O Lord; if it is Your Will, please preserve his
honor. || 16 || 1 || 5 ||
MARU, SOLAHAS, FIFTH MEHL:

Whatever is seen is You, O One Lord. What the ears hear is the Word of Your Bani.
There is nothing else to be seen at all. You give support to all. || 1 || You Yourself are
conscious of Your Creation. You Yourself established Yourself, O God. Creating Yourself,
You formed the expanse of the Universe; You Yourself cherish and sustain each and
every heart. || 2 || You created some to hold great and royal courts. Some turn away
from the world in renunciation, and some maintain their households. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1077 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Some are hungry and some are satisfied and satiated, but all lean on Your Support. ||
3 || The True Lord Himself is True, True, True. He is woven into the essence of His
devotees, through and through. He Himself is hidden, and He Himself is revealed. He
Himself spreads Himself out. || 4 || Forever, forever and ever, He shall always exist.
He is lofty, inaccessible, unfathomable and infinite. He fills the empty, and empties out
the filled; such are the plays and dramas of my Lord and Master. || 5 || With my
mouth, I praise my True Lord King. With my eyes, I behold the inaccessible and
unfathomable Lord. Listening, listening with my ears, my mind and body are
rejuvenated; my Lord and Master saves all. || 6 || He created the creation, and gazes
upon what He has created. All beings and creatures meditate on Him. He Himself knows
His creative power; He blesses with His Glance of Grace. || 7 || Where the Saints
gather together and sit, God dwells close at hand. They abide in bliss and joy,
beholding the Lord‟s wondrous play. They sing the Glories of the Lord, and the unstruck
sound current of His Bani; O Nanak, His slaves remain conscious of Him. || 8 ||
Coming and going is all Your wondrous play. Creating the Creation, You gaze upon Your
infinite play. Creating the Creation, You Yourself cherish and nurture it. || 9 ||
Listening, listening to Your Glory, I live. Forever and ever, I am a sacrifice to You. With
my palms pressed together, I meditate in remembrance on You, day and night, O my
inaccessible, infinite Lord and Master. || 10 || Other than You, who else should I
praise? I meditate on the One and Only Lord within my mind. Realizing the Hukam of
Your Will, Your humble servants are enraptured; this is the achievement of Your
devotees. || 11 || Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I meditate on the True Lord within
my mind. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I am immersed in the Lord‟s Love. Following
the Guru‟s Teachings, all bonds are broken, and this doubt and emotional attachment
are burnt away. || 12 || Wherever He keeps me, is my place of rest. Whatever
naturally happens, I accept that as good. Hatred is gone — I have no hatred at all; I
see the One Lord in all. || 13 || Fear has been removed, and darkness has been
dispelled. The all-powerful, primal, detached Lord God has been revealed. Forsaking
self-conceit, I have entered His Sanctuary, and I work for Him. || 14 || Rare are those
few, very blessed people, who come into the world, and meditate on their Lord and
Master, twenty-four hours a day. Associating with such humble people, all are saved,
and their families are saved as well. || 15 || This is the blessing which I have received
from my Lord and Master. Twenty-four hours a day, with my palms pressed together, I
meditate on Him. I chant the Naam, and through the Naam, I intuitively merge into the
Lord; O Nanak, may I be blessed with the Naam, and ever repeat it. || 16 || 1 || 6 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Do not be fooled by appearances, you fool. This is a false
attachment to the expanse of an illusion. No one can remain in this world; only the One
Lord is permanent and unchanging. || 1 || Seek the Sanctuary of the Perfect Guru.
He shall eradicate all emotional attachment, sorrow and doubt. He shall administer the
medicine, the Mantra of the One Name. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1078 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Sing the True Name within your heart. || 2 || So many gods yearn for the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. All the devotees serve Him. He is the Master of the masterless, the
Destroyer of the pains of the poor. His Name is obtained from the Perfect Guru. || 3 ||
I cannot conceive of any other door. One who wanders through the three worlds,
understands nothing. The True Guru is the banker, with the treasure of the Naam. This
jewel is obtained from Him. || 4 || The dust of His feet purifies. Even the angelic
beings and gods cannot obtain it, O friend. The True Guru is the True Primal Being, the
Transcendent Lord God; meeting with Him, one is carried across to the other side. || 5
|| O my beloved mind, if you wish for the „tree of life‟; if you wish for Kaamadhayna,
the wish-fulfilling cow to adorn your court; if you wish to be satisfied and contented,
then serve the Perfect Guru, and practice the Naam, the source of nectar. || 6 ||
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the five thieves of desire are conquered. In
the Fear of the Supreme Lord God, you shall become immaculate and pure. When one
meets the Perfect Guru, the Philosopher‟s Stone, His touch reveals the Lord, the
Philosopher‟s Stone. || 7 || Myriads of heavens do not equal the Lord‟s Name. The
spiritually wise forsake mere liberation. The One Universal Creator Lord is found
through the True Guru. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s
Darshan. || 8 || No one knows how to serve the Guru. The Guru is the unfathomable,
Supreme Lord God. He alone is the Guru‟s servant, whom the Guru Himself links to His
service, and upon whose forehead such blessed destiny is inscribed. || 9 || Even the
Vedas do not know the Guru‟s Glory. They narrate only a tiny bit of what is heard. The
True Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Incomparable One; meditating in
remembrance on Him, the mind is cooled and soothed. || 10 || Hearing of Him, the
mind comes to life. When He dwells within the heart, one becomes peaceful and cool.
Chanting the Guru‟s Name with the mouth, one obtains glory, and does not have to
walk on the Path of Death. || 11 || I have entered the Sanctuary of the Saints, and
placed before them my soul, my breath of life and wealth. I know nothing about service
and awareness; please take pity upon this worm. || 12 || I am unworthy; please
merge me into Yourself. Please bless me with Your Grace, and link me to Your service. I
wave the fan, and grind the corn for the Saints; washing their feet, I find peace. || 13
|| After wandering around at so many doors, I have come to Yours, O Lord. By Your
Grace, I have entered Your Sanctuary. Forever and ever, keep me in the Company of
the Saints; please bless me with this Gift of Your Name. || 14 || My World-Lord has
become merciful, and I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Perfect
True Guru. I have found eternal peace, poise and bliss; Nanak is the slave of Your
slaves. || 15 || 2 || 7 ||
MARU, SOLAHAS, FIFTH MEHL:

The earth and the Akaashic ethers meditate in remembrance. The moon and the sun
meditate in remembrance on You, O treasure of virtue. Air, water and fire meditate in
remembrance. 

All creation meditates in remembrance. || 1 || All the continents, islands and worlds
meditate in remembrance. The nether worlds and spheres meditate in remembrance on
that True Lord. The sources of creation and speech meditate in remembrance; all the
Lord‟s humble servants meditate in remembrance. || 2 || Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva
meditate in remembrance. The thirty-three million gods meditate in remembrance. The
titans and demons all meditate in remembrance; Your Praises are uncountable — they
cannot be counted. || 3 || All the beasts, birds and demons meditate in
remembrance. The forests, mountains and hermits meditate in remembrance. All the
vines and branches meditate in remembrance; O my Lord and Master, You are
permeating and pervading all minds. || 4 || All beings, both subtle and gross,
meditate in remembrance. The Siddhas and seekers meditate in remembrance on the
Lord‟s Mantra. Both the visible and the invisible meditate in remembrance on my God;
God is the Master of all worlds. || 5 || Men and women, throughout the four stages of
life, meditate in remembrance on You. All social classes and souls of all races meditate
in remembrance on You. All the virtuous, clever and wise people meditate in
remembrance; night and day meditate in remembrance. || 6 || Hours, minutes and
seconds meditate in remembrance. Death and life, and thoughts of purification,
meditate in remembrance. The Shaastras, with their lucky signs and joinings, meditate
in remembrance; the invisible cannot be seen, even for an instant. || 7 || The Lord
and Master is the Doer, the Cause of causes. He is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of all
hearts. That person, whom You bless with Your Grace, and link to Your devotional
service, wins this invaluable human life. || 8 || He, within whose mind God dwells,
has perfect karma, and chants the Chant of the Guru. One who realizes God pervading
deep within all, does not wander crying in reincarnation again. || 9 || Pain, sorrow
and doubt run away from that one, within whose mind the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad
abides. Intuitive peace, poise and bliss come from the sublime essence of the Naam;
the unstruck sound current of the Guru‟s Bani intuitively vibrates and resounds. || 10 ||
He alone is wealthy, who meditates on God. He alone is honorable, who joins the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy. That person, within whose mind the Supreme Lord
God abides, has perfect karma, and becomes famous. || 11 || The Lord and Master is
pervading the water, land and sky. There is no other said to be so. The ointment of the
Guru‟s spiritual wisdom has eradicated all doubts; except the One Lord, I do not see
any other at all. || 12 || The Lord‟s Court is the highest of the high. His limit and
extent cannot be described. The Lord and Master is profoundly deep, unfathomable and
unweighable; how can He be measured? || 13 || You are the Creator; all is created by
You. Without You, there is no other at all. You alone, God, are in the beginning, the
middle and the end. You are the root of the entire expanse. || 14 || The Messenger
of Death does not even approach that person who sings the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises
in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. All desires are fulfilled, for one who
listens with his ears to the Praises of God. || 15 || You belong to all, and all belong to
You, O my true, deep and profound Lord and Master. 

Says Nanak, those humble beings are exalted, who are pleasing to Your Mind, O my
Lord and Master. || 16 || 1 || 8 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: God is the almighty Giver of
all peace and joy. Be merciful to me, that I may meditate in remembrance on Your
Name. The Lord is the Great Giver; all beings and creatures are beggars; His humble
servants yearn to beg from Him. || 1 || I beg for the dust of the feet of the humble,
that I may be blessed with the supreme status, and the filth of countless lifetimes may
be erased. The chronic diseases are cured by the medicine of the Lord‟s Name; I beg to
be imbued with the Immaculate Lord. || 2 || With my ears, I listen to the Pure Praises
of my Lord and Master. With the Support of the One Lord, I have abandoned
corruption, sexuality and desire. I humbly bow and fall at the feet of Your slaves; I do
not hesitate to do good deeds. || 3 || O Lord, with my tongue I sing Your Glorious
Praises. The sins which I have committed are erased. Meditating, meditating in
remembrance on my Lord and Master, my mind lives; I am rid of the five oppressive
demons. || 4 || Meditating on Your lotus feet, I have come aboard Your boat. Joining
the Society of the Saints, I cross over the world-ocean. My flower-offering and worship
is to realize that the Lord is dwelling alike in all; I shall not be reincarnated naked again.
|| 5 || Please make me the slave of Your slaves, O Lord of the world. You are the
treasure of Grace, merciful to the meek. Meet with your companion and helper, the
Perfect Transcendent Lord God; you shall never be separated from Him again. || 6 ||
I dedicate my mind and body, and place them in offering before the Lord. Asleep for
countless lifetimes, I have awakened. He, to whom I belong, is my cherisher and
nurturer. I have killed and discarded my murderous self-conceit. || 7 || The Innerknower, the Searcher of hearts, is pervading the water and the land. The undeceivable
Lord and Master is permeating each and every heart. The Perfect Guru has demolished
the wall of doubt, and now I see the One Lord pervading everywhere. || 8 ||
Wherever I look, there I see God, the ocean of peace. The Lord‟s treasure is never
exhausted; He is the storehouse of jewels. He cannot be seized; He is inaccessible, and
His limits cannot be found. He is realized when the Lord bestows His Grace. || 9 || My
heart is cooled, and my mind and body are calmed and soothed. The craving for birth
and death is quenched. Grasping hold of my hand, He has lifted me up and out; He has
blessed me with His Ambrosial Glance of Grace. || 10 || The One and Only Lord is
permeating and pervading everywhere. There is none other than Him at all. God
permeates the beginning, the middle and the end; He has subdued my desires and
doubts. || 11 || The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Guru is the Lord of the
Universe. The Guru is the Creator, the Guru is forever forgiving. Meditating, chanting
the Guru‟s Chant, I have obtained the fruits and rewards; in the Company of the Saints,
I have been blessed with the lamp of spiritual wisdom. || 12 || Whatever I see, is my
Lord and Master God. Whatever I hear, is the Bani of God‟s Word. Whatever I do, You
make me do; You are the Sanctuary, the help and support of the Saints, Your children.
|| 13 || The beggar begs, and worships You in adoration. You are the Purifier of the
sinners, O Perfectly Holy Lord God. Please bless me with this one gift, O treasure of all
bliss and virtue; I do not ask for anything else. || 14 || 

God is the Creator of the body-vessel. In the Society of the Saints, the dye is produced.
Through the Word of the Lord‟s Bani, one‟s reputation becomes immaculate, and the
mind is colored by the dye of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 15 || The sixteen
powers, absolute perfection and fruitful rewards are obtained, when the Lord and
Master of infinite power is revealed. The Lord‟s Name is Nanak‟s bliss, play and peace;
he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord. || 16 || 2 || 9 ||
MARU, SOLHAS, FIFTH MEHL:

You are my Lord and Master; You have made me Your servant. My soul and body are all
gifts from You. You are the Creator, the Cause of causes; nothing belongs to me. || 1
|| When You sent me, I came into the world. Whatever is pleasing to Your Will, I do.
Without You, nothing is done, so I am not anxious at all. || 2 || In the world
hereafter, the Hukam of Your Command is heard. In this world, I chant Your Praises,
Lord. You Yourself write the account, and You Yourself erase it; no one can argue with
You. || 3 || You are our father; we are all Your children. We play as You cause us to
play. The wilderness and the path are all made by You. No one can take the wrong
path. || 4 || Some remain seated within their homes. Some wander across the
country and through foreign lands. Some are grass-cutters, and some are kings. Who
among these can be called false? || 5 || Who is liberated, and who will land in hell?
Who is worldly, and who is a devotee? Who is wise, and who is shallow? Who is aware,
and who is ignorant? || 6 || By the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, one is liberated,
and by His Hukam, one falls into hell. By His Hukam, one is worldly, and by His Hukam,
one is a devotee. By His Hukam, one is shallow, and by His Hukam, one is wise. There
is no other side except His. || 7 || You made the ocean vast and huge. You made
some into foolish self-willed manmukhs, and dragged them into hell. Some are carried
across, in the ship of Truth of the True Guru. || 8 || You issue Your Command for this
amazing thing, death. You create all beings and creatures, and absorb them back into
Yourself. You gaze in delight upon the one arena of the world, and enjoy all the
pleasures. || 9 || Great is the Lord and Master, and Great is His Name. He is the
Great Giver; Great is His place. He is inaccessible and unfathomable, infinite and
unweighable. He cannot be measureed. || 10 || No one else knows His value. Only
You Yourself, O Immaculate Lord, are equal to Yourself. You Yourself are the spiritual
teacher, You Yourself are the One who meditates. You Yourself are the great and
immense Being of Truth. || 11 || For so many days, You were absorbed in silent
absorption. For so many days, there was only pitch darkness, and then the Creator
revealed Himself. || 12 || You Yourself are called the God of Supreme Power. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1082 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
You Yourself are the hero, exerting Your regal power. You Yourself spread peace
within; You are cool and icy calm. || 13 || One whom You bless and make Gurmukh
— the Naam abides within him, and the unstruck sound current vibrates for him. He is
peaceful, and he is the master of all; the Messenger of Death does not even approach
him. || 14 || His value cannot be described on paper. Says Nanak, the Lord of the
world is infinite. In the beginning, in the middle and in the end, God exists. Judgement
is in His Hands alone. || 15 || No one is equal to Him. No one can stand up against
Him by any means. Nanak‟s God is Himself all-in-all. He creates and stages and watches
His wondrous plays. || 16 || 1 || 10 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: The Supreme Lord God
is imperishable, the Transcendent Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. He is
the Slayer of demons, our Supreme Lord and Master. The Supreme Rishi, the Master of
the sensory organs, the uplifter of mountains, the joyful Lord playing His enticing flute.
|| 1 || The Enticer of Hearts, the Lord of wealth, Krishna, the Enemy of ego. The Lord
of the Universe, the Dear Lord, the Destroyer of demons. The Life of the World, our
eternal and ever-stable Lord and Master dwells within each and every heart, and is
always with us. || 2 || The Support of the Earth, the man-lion, the Supreme Lord
God. The Protector who tears apart demons with His teeth, the Upholder of the earth. O
Creator, You assumed the form of the pygmy to humble the demons; You are the Lord
God of all. || 3 || You are the Great Raam Chand, who has no form or feature.
Adorned with flowers, holding the chakra in Your hand, Your form is incomparably
beautiful. You have thousands of eyes, and thousands of forms. You alone are the
Giver, and all are beggars of You. || 4 || You are the Lover of Your devotees, the
Master of the masterless. The Lord and Master of the milk-maids, You are the
companion of all. O Lord, Immacuate Great Giver, I cannot describe even an iota of
Your Glorious Virtues. || 5 || Liberator, Enticing Lord, Lord of Lakshmi, Supreme Lord
God. Savior of Dropadi‟s honor. Lord of Maya, miracle-worker, absorbed in delightful
play, unattached. || 6 || The Blessed Vision of His Darshan is fruitful and rewarding;
He is not born, He is self-existent. His form is undying; it is never destroyed. O
imperishable, eternal, unfathomable Lord, everything is attached to You. || 7 || The
Lover of greatness, who dwells in heaven. By the Pleasure of His Will, He took
incarnation as the great fish and the tortoise. The Lord of beauteous hair, the Worker of
miraculous deeds, whatever He wishes, comes to pass. || 8 || He is beyond need of
any sustenance, free of hate and all-pervading. He has staged His play; He is called the
four-armed Lord. He assumed the beautiful form of the blue-skinned Krishna; hearing
His flute, all are fascinated and enticed. || 9 || He is adorned with garlands of flowers,
with lotus eyes. His ear-rings, crown and flute are so beautiful. He carries the conch,
the chakra and the war club; He is the Great Charioteer, who stays with His Saints. ||
10 || The Lord of yellow robes, the Master of the three worlds. The Lord of the
Universe, the Lord of the world; with my mouth, I chant His Name. The Archer who
draws the bow, the Beloved Lord God; I cannot count all His limbs. || 11 || He is said
to be free of anguish, and absolutely immaculate. The Lord of prosperity, pervading the
water, the land and the sky. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1083 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He is near this world and the nether regions of the underworld; His Place is permanent,
ever-stable and imperishable. || 12 || The Purifier of sinners, the Destroyer of pain
and fear. The Eliminator of egotism, the Eradicator of coming and going. He is pleased
with devotional worship, and merciful to the meek; He cannot be appeased by any
other qualities. || 13 || The Formless Lord is undeceivable and unchanging. He is the
Embodiment of Light; through Him, the whole world blossoms forth. He alone unites
with Him, whom He unites with Himself. No one can attain the Lord by himself. || 14 ||
He Himself is the milk-maid, and He Himself is Krishna. He Himself grazes the cows in
the forest. You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy. Not even a particle of filth
attaches to You. || 15 || Which of Your Glorious Virtues can I chant with my one
tongue? Even the thousand-headed serpent does not know Your limit. One may chant
new names for You day and night, but even so, O God, no one can describe even one
of Your Glorious Virtues. || 16 || I have grasped the Support, and entered the
Sanctuary of the Lord, the Father of the world. The Messenger of Death is terrifying and
horrendous, and sea of Maya is impassable. Please be merciful, Lord, and save me, if it
is Your Will; please lead me to join with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. ||
17 || All that is seen is an illusion. I beg for this one gift, for the dust of the feet of the
Saints, O Lord of the Universe. Applying it to my forehead, I obtain the supreme status;
he alone obtains it, unto whom You give it. || 18 || Those, unto whom the Lord, the
Giver of peace, grants His Mercy, grasp the feet of the Holy, and weave them into their
hearts. They obtain all the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unstruck
sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds within their minds. || 19 || With
my tongue I chant the Names given to You. „Sat Naam‟ is Your perfect, primal Name.
Says Nanak, Your devotees have entered Your Sanctuary. Please bestow the Blessed
Vision of Your Darshan; their minds are filled with love for You. || 20 || You alone
know Your state and extent. You Yourself speak, and You Yourself describe it. Please
make Nanak the slave of Your slaves, O Lord; as it pleases Your Will, please keep him
with Your slaves. || 21 || 2 || 11 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: O slave of the inaccessible
Lord God Allah, forsake thoughts of worldly entanglements. Become the dust of the feet
of the humble fakeers, and consider yourself a traveller on this journey. O saintly
dervish, you shall be approved in the Court of the Lord. || 1 || Let Truth be your
prayer, and faith your prayer-mat. Subdue your desires, and overcome your hopes. Let
your body be the mosque, and your mind the priest. Let true purity be God‟s Word for
you. || 2 || Let your practice be to live the spiritual life. Let your spiritual cleansing be
to renounce the world and seek God. Let control of the mind be your spiritual wisdom,
O holy man; meeting with God, you shall never die again. || 3 || Practice within your
heart the teachings of the Koran and the Bible; restrain the ten sensory organs from
straying into evil. Tie up the five demons of desire with faith, charity and contentment,
and you shall be acceptable. || 4 || Let compassion be your Mecca, and the dust of
the feet of the holy your fast. Let Paradise be your practice of the Prophet‟s Word. God
is the beauty, the light and the fragrance. Meditation on Allah is the secluded
meditation chamber. || 5 || 

He alone is a Qazi, who practices the Truth. He alone is a Haji, a pilgrim to Mecca, who
purifies his heart. He alone is a Mullah, who banishes evil; he alone is a saintly dervish,
who takes the Support of the Lord‟s Praise. || 6 || Always, at every moment,
remember God, the Creator within your heart. Let your meditation beads be the
subjugation of the ten senses. Let good conduct and self-restraint be your circumcision.
|| 7 || You must know in your heart that everything is temporary. Family, household
and siblings are all entanglements. Kings, rulers and nobles are mortal and transitory;
only God‟s Gate is the permanent place. || 8 || First, is the Lord‟s Praise; second,
contentment; third, humility, and fourth, giving to charities. Fifth is to hold one‟s desires
in restraint. These are the five most sublime daily prayers. || 9 || Let your daily
worship be the knowledge that God is everywhere. Let renunciation of evil actions be
the water-jug you carry. Let realization of the One Lord God be your call to prayer; be a
good child of God — let this be your trumpet. || 10 || Let what is earned righteously
be your blessed food. Wash away pollution with the river of your heart. One who
realizes the Prophet attains heaven. Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, does not cast
him into hell. || 11 || Let good deeds be your body, and faith your bride. Play and
enjoy the Lord‟s love and delight. Purify what is impure, and let the Lord‟s Presence be
your religious tradition. Let your total awareness be the turban on your head. || 12 ||
To be Muslim is to be kind-hearted, and wash away pollution from within the heart. He
does not even approach worldly pleasures; he is pure, like flowers, silk, ghee and the
deer-skin. || 13 || One who is blessed with the mercy and compassion of the Merciful
Lord, is the manliest man among men. He alone is a Shaykh, a preacher, a Haji, and he
alone is God‟s slave, who is blessed with God‟s Grace. || 14 || The Creator Lord has
Creative Power; the Merciful Lord has Mercy. The Praises and the Love of the Merciful
Lord are unfathomable. Realize the True Hukam, the Command of the Lord, O Nanak;
you shall be released from bondage, and carried across. || 15 || 3 || 12 || MARU,
FIFTH MEHL: The Abode of the Supreme Lord God is above all. He Himself establishes,
establishes and creates. Holding tight to the Sanctuary of God, peace is found, and one
is not afflicted by the fear of Maya. || 1 || He saved you from the fire of the womb,
and did not destroy you, when you were an egg in your mother‟s ovary. Blessing you
with meditative remembrance upon Himself, He nurtured you and cherished you; He is
the Master of all hearts. || 2 || I have come to the Sanctuary of His lotus feet. In the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I sing the Praises of the Lord. I have erased all
the pains of birth and death; meditating on the Lord, Har, Har, I have no fear of death.
|| 3 || God is all-powerful, indescribable, unfathomable and divine. All beings and
creatures serve Him. In so many ways, He cherishes those born from eggs, from the
womb, from sweat and from the earth. || 4 || He alone obtains this wealth, who
savors and enjoys, deep within his mind, the Name of the Lord. Grasping hold of his
arm, God lifts him up and pulls him out of the deep, dark pit. 

Such a devotee of the Lord is very rare. || 5 || God exists in the beginning, in the
middle and in the end. Whatever the Creator Lord Himself does, comes to pass. Doubt
and fear are erased, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and then one is not
afflicted by deadly pain. || 6 || I sing the most Sublime Bani, the Word of the Lord of
the Universe. I beg for the dust of the feet of the Saadh Sangat. Eradicating desire, I
have become free of desire; I have burnt away all my sins. || 7 || This is the unique
way of the Saints; they behold the Supreme Lord God with them. With each and every
breath, they worship and adore the Lord, Har, Har. How could anyone be too lazy to
meditate on Him? || 8 || Wherever I look, there I see the Inner-knower, the Searcher
of hearts. I never forget God, my Lord and Master, even for an instant. Your slaves live
by meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Lord; You are permeating the woods,
the water and the land. || 9 || Even the hot wind does not touch one who remains
awake in meditative remembrance, night and day. He delights and enjoys meditative
remembrance on the Lord; he has no attachment to Maya. || 10 || Disease, sorrow
and pain do not affect him; he sings the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises in the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Please bless me with Your Name, O my Beloved Lord
God; please listen to my prayer, O Creator. || 11 || Your Name is a jewel, O my
Beloved Lord. Your slaves are imbued with Your Infinite Love. Those who are imbued
with Your Love, become like You; it is so rare that they are found. || 12 || My mind
longs for the dust of the feet of those who never forget the Lord. Associating with
them, I obtain the supreme status; the Lord, my Companion, is always with me. || 13
|| He alone is my beloved friend and companion, who implants the Name of the One
Lord within, and eradicates evil-mindedness. Immaculate are the teachings of that
humble servant of the Lord, who casts out sexual desire, anger and egotism. || 14 ||
Other than You, O Lord, no one is mine. The Guru has led me to grasp the feet of God.
I am a sacrifice to the Perfect True Guru, who has destroyed the illusion of duality. ||
15 || With each and every breath, I never forget God. Twenty-four hours a day, I
meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak, the Saints are imbued with Your Love; You
are the great and all-powerful Lord. || 16 || 4 || 13 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL:

I enshrine the Lord‟s lotus feet continually within my heart. Each and every moment, I
humbly bow to the Perfect Guru. I dedicate my body, mind and everything, and place it
in offering before the Lord. His Name is the most beautiful in this world. || 1 || Why
forget the Lord and Master from your mind? He blessed you with body and soul,
creating and embellishing you. With every breath and morsel of food, the Creator takes
care of His beings, who receive according to what they have done. || 2 || No one
returns empty-handed from Him; twenty-four hours a day, keep the Lord in your mind. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1086 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, meditate and vibrate upon your
imperishable Lord and Master, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. || 3
|| The four great blessings, and the eighteen miraculous spiritual powers, are found in
the treasure of the Naam, which brings celestial peace and poise, and the nine
treasures. If you yearn in your mind for all joys, then join the Saadh Sangat, and dwell
upon your Lord and Master. || 4 || The Shaastras, the Simritees and the Vedas
proclaim that the mortal must be victorious in this priceless human life. Forsaking
sexual desire, anger and slander, sing of the Lord with your tongue, O Nanak. || 5 ||
He has no form or shape, no ancestry or social class. The Perfect Lord is perfectly
pervading day and night. Whoever meditates on Him is very fortunate; he is not
consigned to reincarnation again. || 6 || One who forgets the Primal Lord, the
Architect of karma, wanders around burning, and remains tormented. No one can save
such an ungrateful person; he is thrown into the most horrible hell. || 7 || He blessed
you with your soul, the breath of life, your body and wealth; He preserved and nurtured
you in your mother‟s womb. Forsaking His Love, you are imbued with another; you shall
never achieve your goals like this. || 8 || Please shower me with Your Merciful Grace,
O my Lord and Master. You dwell in each and every heart, and are near everyone.
Nothing is in my hands; he alone knows, whom You inspire to know. || 9 || One who
has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead, that person is not afflicted
by Maya. Slave Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary forever; there is no other equal to You. ||
10 || In His Will, He made all pain and pleasure. How rare are those who remember
the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. His value cannot be described. He is
prevailing everywhere. || 11 || He is the devotee; He is the Great Giver. He is the
Perfect Primal Lord, the Architect of karma. He is your help and support, since infancy;
He fulfills your mind‟s desires. || 12 || Death, pain and pleasure are ordained by the
Lord. They do not increase or decrease by anyone‟s efforts. That alone happens, which
is pleasing to the Creator; speaking of himself, the mortal ruins himself. || 13 || He
lifts us up and pulls us out of the deep dark pit; He unites with Himself, those who were
separated for so many incarnations. Showering them with His Mercy, He protects them
with His own hands. Meeting with the Holy Saints, they meditate on the Lord of the
Universe. || 14 || Your worth cannot be described. Wondrous is Your form, and Your
glorious greatness. Your humble servant begs for the gift of devotional worship. Nanak
is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to You. || 15 || 1 || 14 || 22 || 24 || 2 || 14 || 62 ||
VAAR OF MARU, THIRD MEHL:

SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: If virtue is sold when there is no buyer, then it is sold very
cheap. But if one meets a buyer of virtue, then virtue sells for hundreds of thousands. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1087 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Meeting with a virtuous person, virtue is obtained, and one is immersed in the True
Guru. Priceless virtues are not obtained for any price; they cannot be purchased in a
store. O Nanak, their weight is full and perfect; it never decreases at all. || 1 ||
FOURTH MEHL: Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, they wander around,
continually coming and going in reincarnation. Some are in bondage, and some are set
free; some are happy in the Love of the Lord. O Nanak, believe in the True Lord, and
practice Truth, through the lifestyle of Truth. || 2 || PAUREE: From the Guru, I have
obtained the supremely powerful sword of spiritual wisdom. I have cut down the
fortress of duality and doubt, attachment, greed and egotism. The Name of the Lord
abides within my mind; I contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Through Truth,
self-discipline and sublime understanding, the Lord has become very dear to me. Truly,
truly, the True Creator Lord is all-pervading. || 1 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Among
the ragas, Kaydaaraa Raga is known as good, O Siblings of Destiny, if through it, one
comes to love the Word of the Shabad, and if one remains in the Soceity of the Saints,
and enshrines love for the True Lord. Such a person washes away the pollution from
within, and saves his generations as well. He gathes in the capital of virtue, and
destroys and drives out unvirtuous sins. O Nanak, he alone is known as united, who
does not forsake his Guru, and who does not love duality. || 1 || FOURTH MEHL:
Gazing upon the world-ocean, I am afraid of death; but if I live in the Fear of You, God,
then I am not afraid. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I am content; O Nanak, I
blossom forth in the Name. || 2 || FOURTH MEHL: I get on board the boat and set
out, but the ocean is churning with waves. The boat of Truth encounters no
obstruction, if the Guru gives encouragement. He takes us across to the door on the
other side, as the Guru keeps watch. O Nanak, if I am blessed with His Grace, I shall go
to His Court with honor. || 3 || PAUREE: Enjoy your kingdom of bliss; as Gurmukh,
practice Truth. Sitting upon the throne of Truth, the Lord administers justice; He unites
us in Union with the Society of the Saints. Meditating on the Lord, through the True
Teachings, we become just like the Lord. If the Lord, the Giver of peace, abides in the
mind, in this world, then in the end, He becomes our help and support. Love for the
Lord wells up, when the Guru imparts understanding. || 2 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL:
Confused and deluded, I wander around, but no one shows me the way. I go and ask
the clever people, if there is there anyone who can rid me of my pain. If the True Guru
abides within my mind, then I see the Lord, my best friend, there. O Nanak, my mind is
satisfied and fulfilled, contemplating the Praises of the True Name. || 1 || THIRD
MEHL: He Himself is the Doer, and He is the deed; He Himself issues the Command.
He Himself forgives some, and He Himself does the deed. O Nanak, receiving the Divine
Light from the Guru, suffering and corruption are burnt away, through the Name. || 2
|| PAUREE: Don‟t be fooled by gazing at the riches of Maya, you foolish self-willed
manmukh. It shall not go along with you when you must depart; all the wealth you see
is false. The blind and ignorant do not understand, that the sword of death is hanging
over their heads. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1088 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
By Guru‟s Grace, those who drink in the sublime essence of the Lord are saved. He
Himself is the Doer, and He Himself is the Cause; the Lord Himself is our Saving Grace.
|| 3 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Those who do not meet with the Guru, who have no
Fear of God at all, continue coming and going in reincarnation, and suffer terrible pain;
their anxiety is never relieved. They are beaten like clothes being washed on the rocks,
and struck every hour like chimes. O Nanak, without the True Name, these
entanglements are not removed from hanging over one‟s head. || 1 || THIRD MEHL:
I have searched throughout the three worlds, O my friend; egotism is bad for the world.
Don‟t worry, O my soul; speak the Truth, O Nanak, the Truth, and only the Truth. || 2
|| PAUREE: The Lord Himself forgives the Gurmukhs; they are absorbed and
immersed in the Lord‟s Name. He Himself links them to devotional worship; they bear
the Insignia of the Guru‟s Shabad. Those who turn towards the Guru, as sunmukh, are
beautiful. They are famous in the Court of the True Lord. In this world, and in the world
hereafter, they are liberated; they realize the Lord. Blessed, blessed are those humble
beings who serve the Lord. I am a sacrifice to them. || 4 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL:
The rude, ill-mannered bride is encased in the body-tomb; she is blackened, and her
mind is impure. She can enjoy her Husband Lord, only if she is virtuous. O Nanak, the
soul-bride is unworthy, and without virtue. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: She has good
conduct, true self-discipline, and a perfect family. O Nanak, day and night, she is always
good; she loves her Beloved Husband Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: One who realizes his
own self, is blessed with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Granting His
Mercy, the Guru merges him in the Word of His Shabad. The Word of the Guru‟s Bani is
immaculate and pure; through it, one drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord. Those
who taste the sublime essence of the Lord, forsake other flavors. Drinking in the
sublime essence of the Lord, they remain satisfied forever; their hunger and thirst are
quenched. || 5 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Her Husband Lord is pleased, and He
enjoys His bride; the soul-bride adorns her heart with the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
O Nanak, that bride who stands before Him, is the most noble and respected woman.
|| 1 || FIRST MEHL: In her father-in-law‟s home hereafter, and in her parents‟ home
in this world, she belongs to her Husband Lord. Her Husband is inaccessible and
unfathomable. O Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her carefree,
independent Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: That king sits upon the throne, who is worthy of
that throne. Those who realize the True Lord, they alone are the true kings. These
mere earthly rulers are not called kings; in the love of duality, they suffer. Why should
someone praise someone else who is also created? They depart in no time at all. The
One True Lord is eternal and imperishable. One who, as Gurmukh, understands
becomes eternal as well. || 6 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The One Lord is the
Husband of all. No one is without the Husband Lord. O Nanak, they are the pure soulbrides, who merge in the True Guru. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The mind is churning with
so many waves of desire. How can one be emancipated in the Court of the Lord? Be
absorbed in the Lord‟s True Love, and imbued with the deep color of the Lord‟s Infinite
Love. O Nanak, by Guru‟s Grace, one is emancipated, if the consciousness is attached to
the True Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: The Name of the Lord is priceless. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1089 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
How can its value be estimated? He Himself created the entire universe, and He Himself
is pervading it. The Gurmukhs praise the Lord forever, and through the Truth, they
assess Him. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the heart-lotus blossoms forth,
and in this way, one drinks in the sublime essence of the Lord. Coming and going in
reincarnation ceases, and one sleeps in peace and poise. || 7 || SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: Neither dirty, nor dull, nor saffron, nor any color that fades. O Nanak, crimson
— deep crimson is the color of one who is imbued with the True Lord. || 1 || THIRD
MEHL: The bumble bee intuitively and fearlessly dwells among the vegetation, flowers
and fruits. O Nanak, there is only one tree, one flower, and one bumble bee. || 2 ||
PAUREE: Those humble beings who struggle with their minds are brave and
distinguished heroes. Those who realize their own selves, remain forever united with
the Lord. This is the glory of the spiritual teachers, that they remain absorbed in their
mind. They attain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, and focus their meditation on the
True Lord. Those who conquer their own minds, by Guru‟s Grace, conquer the world. ||
8 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: If I were to become a Yogi, and wander around the
world, begging from door to door, then, when I am summoned to the Court of the Lord,
what answer could I give? The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is the charity I beg for;
contentment is my temple. The True Lord is always with me. Nothing is obtained by
wearing religious robes; all will be seized by the Messenger of Death. O Nanak, talk is
false; contemplate the True Name. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Through that door, you will
be called to account; do not serve at that door. Seek and find such a True Guru, who
has no equal in His greatness. In His Sanctuary, one is released, and no one calls him
to account. Truth is implanted within Him, and He implants Truth within others. He
bestows the blessing of the True Shabad. One who has Truth within his heart — his
body and mind are also true. O Nanak, if one submits to the Hukam, the Command of
the True Lord God, he is blessed with true glory and greatness. He is immersed and
merged in the True Lord, who blesses him with His Glance of Grace. || 2 || PAUREE:
They are not called heroes, who die of egotism, suffering in pain. The blind ones do not
realize their own selves; in the love of duality, they rot. They struggle with great anger;
here and hereafter, they suffer in pain. The Dear Lord is not pleased by egotism; the
Vedas proclaim this clearly. Those who die of egotism, shall not find salvation. They die,
and are reborn in reincarnation. || 9 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The crow does not
become white, and an iron boat does not float across. One who puts his faith in the
treasure of his Beloved Lord is blessed; he exalts and embellishes others as well. One
who realizes the Hukam of God‟s Command — his face is radiant and bright; he floats
across, like iron upon wood. Forsake thirst and desire, and abide in the Fear of God; O
Nanak, these are the most excellent actions. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The ignorant
people who go to the desert to conquer their minds, are not able to conquer them. O
Nanak, if this mind is to be conquered, one must contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. This mind is not conquered by conquering it, even though everyone longs to
do so. O Nanak, the mind itself conquers the mind, if one meets with the True Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1090 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 2 || PAUREE: He created both sides; Shiva dwells within Shakti (the soul dwells
within the material universe). Through the material universe of Shakti, no one has ever
found the Lord; they continue to be born and die in reincarnation. Serving the Guru,
peace is found, meditating on the Lord with every breath and morsel of food. Searching
and looking through the Simritees and the Shaastras, I have found that the most
sublime person is the slave of the Lord. O Nanak, without the Naam, nothing is
permanent and stable; I am a sacrifice to the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 10 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: I might become a Pandit, a religious scholar, or an astrologer,
and recite the four Vedas with my mouth; I might be worshipped throughout the nine
regions of the earth for my wisdom and thought; let me not forget the Word of Truth,
that no one can touch my sacred cooking square. Such cooking squares are false, O
Nanak; only the One Lord is True. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: He Himself creates and He
Himself acts; He bestows His Glance of Grace. He Himself grants glorious greatness;
says Nanak, He is the True Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: Only death is painful; I cannot
conceive of anything else as painful. It is unstoppable; it stalks and pervades the world,
and fights with the sinners. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, one is immersed in
the Lord. Meditating on the Lord, one comes to realize the Lord. He alone is
emancipated in the Sanctuary of the Lord, who struggles with his own mind. One who
contemplates and meditates on the Lord in his mind, succeeds in the Court of the Lord.
|| 11 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Submit to the Will of the Lord Commander; in His
Court, only Truth is accepted. Your Lord and Master shall call you to account; do not go
astray on beholding the world. One who keeps watch over his heart, and keeps his
heart pure, is a dervish, a saintly devotee. Love and affection, O Nanak, are in the
accounts placed before the Creator. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: One who is unattached like
the bumble bee, sees the Lord of the world everywhere. The diamond of his mind is
pierced through with the Diamond of the Lord‟s Name; O Nanak, his neck is embellished
with it. || 2 || PAUREE: The self-willed manmukhs are afflicted by death; they cling
to Maya in emotional attachment. In an instant, they are thrown to the ground and
killed; in the love of duality, they are deluded. This opportunity shall not come into their
hands again; they are beaten by the Messenger of Death with his stick. But Death‟s
stick does not even strike those who remain awake and aware in the Love of the Lord.
All are Yours, and cling to You; only You can save them. || 12 || SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: See the imperishable Lord everywhere; attachment to wealth brings only great
pain. Loaded with dust, you have to cross over the world-ocean; you are not carrying
the profit and capital of the Name with you. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: My capital is Your
True Name, O Lord; this wealth is inexhaustible and infinite. O Nanak, this merchandise
is immaculate; blessed is the banker who trades in it. || 2 || FIRST MEHL: Know and
enjoy the primal, eternal Love of the Great Lord and Master. Blessed with the Naam, O
Nanak, you shall strike down the Messenger of Death, and push his face to the ground.
|| 3 || PAUREE: He Himself has embellished the body, and placed the nine treasures
of the Naam within it. He confuses some in doubt; fruitless are their actions. Some, as
Gurmukh, realize their Lord, the Supreme Soul. Some listen to the Lord, and obey Him;
sublime and exalted are their actions. Love for the Lord wells up deep within, singing
the Glorious Praises of the Lord‟s Name. || 13 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1091 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Fear of God abides in the mind of the innocent; this is the straight path to the One
Lord. Jealousy and envy bring terrible pain, and one is cursed throughout the three
worlds. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: The drum of the Vedas vibrates, bringing dispute and
divisiveness. O Nanak, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord; there is none
except Him. || 2 || FIRST MEHL: The world-ocean of the three qualities is
unfathomably deep; how can its bottom be seen? If I meet with the great, selfsufficient True Guru, then I am carried across. This ocean is filled up with pain and
suffering. O Nanak, without the True Name, no one‟s hunger is appeased. || 3 ||
PAUREE: Those who search their inner beings, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
are exalted and adorned. They obtain what they wish for, meditating on the Lord‟s
Name. One who is blessed by God‟s Grace, meets with the Guru; he sings the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. The Righteous Judge of Dharma is his friend; he does not have to
walk on the Path of Death. He meditates on the Lord‟s Name, day and night; he is
absorbed and immersed in the Lord‟s Name. || 14 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Listen
to and speak the Name of the One Lord, who permeates the heavens, this world and
the nether regions of the underworld. The Hukam of His Command cannot be erased;
whatever He has written, shall go with the mortal. Who has died, and who kills? Who
comes and who goes? Who is enraptured, O Nanak, and whose consciousness merges
in the Lord? || 1 || FIRST MEHL: In egotism, he dies; possessiveness kills him, and
the breath flows out like a river. Desire is exhausted, O Nanak, only when the mind is
imbued with the Name. His eyes are imbued with the eyes of the Lord, and his ears ring
with celestial consciousness. His tongue drinks in the sweet nectar, dyed crimson by
chanting the Name of the Beloved Lord. His inner being is drenched with the Lord‟s
fragrance; his worth cannot be described. || 2 || PAUREE: In this age, the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, is the treasure. Only the Naam goes along in the end. It is
inexhaustible; it is never empty, no matter how much one may eat, consume or spend.
The Messenger of Death does not even approach the humble servant of the Lord. They
alone are the true bankers and traders, who have the wealth of the Lord in their laps.
By the Lord‟s Mercy, one finds the Lord, only when the Lord Himself sends for him. ||
15 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The self-willed manmukh does not appreciate the
excellence of trading in Truth. He deals in poison, collects poison, and is in love with
poison. Outwardly, they call themselves Pandits, religious scholars, but in their minds
they are foolish and ignorant. They do not focus their consciousness on the Lord; they
love to engage in arguments. They speak to cause arguments, and earn their living by
telling lies. In this world, only the Lord‟s Name is immaculate and pure. All other objects
of creation are polluted. O Nanak, those who do not remember the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, are polluted; they die in ignorance. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Without serving
the Lord, he suffers in pain; accepting the Hukam of God‟s Command, pain is gone. He
Himself is the Giver of peace; He Himself awards punishment. O Nanak, know this well;
all that happens is according to His Will. || 2 || PAUREE: Without the Lord‟s Name,
the world is poor. Without the Name, no one is satisfied. He is deluded by duality and
doubt. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1092 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
In egotism, he suffers in pain. Without good karma, he does not obtain anything, no
matter how much he may wish for it. Coming and going in reincarnation, and birth and
death are ended, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. He Himself acts, so unto
whom should we complain? There is no other at all. || 16 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL:
In this world, the Saints earn the wealth; they come to meet God through the True
Guru. The True Guru implants the Truth within; the value of this wealth cannot be
described. Obtaining this wealth, hunger is relieved, and peace comes to dwell in the
mind. Only those who have such pre-ordained destiny, come to receive this. The world
of the self-willed manmukh is poor, crying out for Maya. Night and day, it wanders
continually, and its hunger is never relieved. It never finds calm tranquility, and peace
never comes to dwell in its mind. It is always plagued by anxiety, and its cynicism never
departs. O Nanak, without the True Guru, the intellect is perverted; if one meets the
True Guru, then one practices the Word of the Shabad. Forever and ever, he dwells in
peace, and merges in the True Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The One who created the
world, takes care of it. Meditate in remembrance on the One Lord, O Siblings of
Destiny; there is none other than Him. So eat the food of the Shabad and goodness;
eating it, you shall remain satisfied forever. Dress yourself in the Praise of the Lord.
Forever and ever, it is radiant and bright; it is never polluted. I have intuitively earned
the true wealth, which never decreases. The body is adorned with the Shabad, and is at
peace forever and ever. O Nanak, the Gurmukh realizes the Lord, who reveals Himself.
|| 2 || PAUREE: Deep within the self are meditation and austere self-discipline, when
one realizes the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Meditating on the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, egotism and ignorance are eliminated. One‟s inner being is overflowing with
Ambrosial Nectar; tasting it, the flavor is known. Those who taste it become fearless;
they are satisfied with the sublime essence of the Lord. Those who drink it in, by the
Grace of the Lord, are never again afflicted by death. || 17 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL:
People tie up bundles of demerits; no one deals in virtue. Rare is that person, O Nanak,
who purchases virtue. By Guru‟s Grace, one is blessed with virtue, when the Lord
bestows His Glance of Grace. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Merits and demerits are the
same; they are both created by the Creator. O Nanak, one who obeys the Hukam of the
Lord‟s Command, finds peace, contemplating the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The King sits on the throne within the self; He Himself administers justice.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the Lord‟s Court is known; within the self is
the Sanctuary, the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. The coins are assayed, and the
genuine coins are placed in His treasury, while the counterfeit ones find no place. The
Truest of the True is all-pervading; His justice is forever True. One comes to enjoy the
Ambrosial essence, when the Name is enshrined in the mind. || 18 || SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: When one acts in egotism, then You are not there, Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1093 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Wherever You are, there is no ego. O spiritual teachers, understand this: the Unspoken
Speech is in the mind. Without the Guru, the essence of reality is not found; the
Invisible Lord dwells everywhere. One meets the True Guru, and then the Lord is
known, when the Word of the Shabad comes to dwell in the mind. When self-conceit
departs, doubt and fear also depart, and the pain of birth and death is removed.
Following the Guru‟s Teachings, the Unseen Lord is seen; the intellect is exalted, and
one is carried across. O Nanak, chant the chant of „Sohang hansaa‟ — „He is me, and I
am Him.‟ The three worlds are absorbed in Him. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Some assay
their mind-jewel, and contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Only a few of those
humble beings are known in this world, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. One‟s self
remains blended with the Lord‟s Self, when egotism and duality are conquered. O
Nanak, those who are imbued with the Naam cross over the difficult, treacherous and
terrifying world-ocean. || 2 || PAUREE: The self-willed manmukhs do not search
within their own selves; they are deluded by their egotistical pride. Wandering in the
four directions, they grow weary, tormented by burning desire within. They do not
study the Simritees and the Shaastras; the manmukhs waste away and are lost.
Without the Guru, no one finds the Naam, the Name of the True Lord. One who
contemplates the essence of spiritual wisdom and meditates on the Lord is saved. || 19
|| SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: He Himself knows, He Himself acts, and He Himself does
it right. So stand before Him, O Nanak, and offer your prayers. || 1 || FIRST MEHL:
He who created the creation, watches over it; He Himself knows. Unto whom should I
speak, O Nanak, when everything is contained within the home of the heart? || 2 ||
PAUREE: Forget everything, and be friends with the One Lord alone. Your mind and
body shall be enraptured, and the Lord shall burn away your sins. Your comings and
goings in reincarnation shall cease; you shall not be reborn and die again. The True
Name shall be your Support, and you shall not burn in sorrow and attachment. O
Nanak, gather in the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your mind. ||
20 || SHALOK, FIFTH MEHL: You do not forget Maya from your mind; you beg for it
with each and every breath. You do not even think of that God; O Nanak, it is not in
your karma. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: Maya and its wealth shall not go along with you, so
why do you cling to it — are you blind? Meditate on the Guru‟s Feet, and the bonds of
Maya shall be cut away from you. || 2 || PAUREE: By the Pleasure of His Will, the
Lord inspires us to obey the Hukam of His Command; by the Pleasure of His Will, we
find peace. By the Pleasure of His Will, He leads us to meet the True Guru; by the
Pleasure of His Will, we meditate on the Truth. There is no other gift as great as the
Pleasure of His Will; this Truth is spoken and proclaimed. Those who have such preordained destiny, practice and live the Truth. Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; He
created the world. || 21 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Those who do not have spiritual
wisdom within, do not have even an iota of the Fear of God. O Nanak, why kill those
who are already dead? The Lord of the Universe Himself has killed them. || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: To read the horoscope of the mind, is the most sublime joyful peace. He
alone is called a good Brahmin, who understands God in contemplative meditation. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1094 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He praises the Lord, and reads of the Lord, and contemplates the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. Celebrated and approved is the coming into the world of such a person, who
saves all his generations as well. Hereafter, no one is questioned about social status;
excellent and sublime is the practice of the Word of the Shabad. Other study is false,
and other actions are false; such people are in love with poison. They do not find any
peace within themselves; the self-willed manmukhs waste away their lives. O Nanak,
those who are attuned to the Naam are saved; they have infinite love for the Guru. || 2
|| PAUREE: He Himself creates the creation, and gazes upon it; He Himself is totally
True. One who does not understand the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master,
is false. By the Pleasure of His Will, the True Lord joins the Gurmukh to Himself. He is
the One Lord and Master of all; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, we are blended
with Him. The Gurmukhs praise Him forever; all are beggars of Him. O Nanak, as He
Himself makes us dance, we dance. || 22 || 1 || SUDH ||
VAAR OF MARU, FIFTH MEHL, DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL:

If You tell me to, O my Friend, I will cut off my head and give it to You. My eyes long
for You; when will I see Your Vision? || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: I am in love with You; I
have seen that other love is false. Even clothes and food are frightening to me, as long
as I do not see my Beloved. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: I rise early, O my Husband Lord, to
behold Your Vision. Eye make-up, garlands of flowers, and the flavor of betel leaf, are
all nothing but dust, without seeing You. || 3 || PAUREE: You are True, O my True
Lord and Master; You uphold all that is true. You created the world, making a place for
the Gurmukhs. By the Will of the Lord, the Vedas came into being; they discriminate
between sin and virtue. You created Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, and the expanse of the
three qualities. Creating the world of the nine regions, O Lord, You have embellished it
with beauty. Creating the beings of various kinds, You infused Your power into them.
No one knows Your limit, O True Creator Lord. You Yourself know all ways and means;
You Yourself save the Gurmukhs. || 1 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: If You are my
friend, then don‟t separate Yourself from me, even for an instant. My soul is fascinated
and enticed by You; when will I see You, O my Love? || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: Burn in
the fire, you evil person; O separation, be dead. O my Husband Lord, please sleep upon
my bed, that all my sufferings may be gone. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: The evil person is
engrossed in the love of duality; through the disease of egotism, he suffers separation.
The True Lord King is my friend; meeting with Him, I am so happy. || 3 || PAUREE:
You are inaccessible, merciful and infinite; who can estimate Your worth? You created
the entire universe; You are the Master of all the worlds. No one knows Your creative
power, O my all-pervading Lord and Master. No one can equal You; You are
imperishable and eternal, the Savior of the world. 

You established the four ages; You are the Creator of all worlds. You created the
comings and goings of reincarnation; not even a particle of filth sticks to You. As you
are merciful, You attach us to the Feet of the True Guru. You cannot be found by any
other efforts; You are the eternal, imperishable Creator of the Universe. || 2 ||
DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: If You come into my courtyard, all the earth becomes
beautiful. Other than the One Lord, my Husband, no one else cares for me. || 1 ||
FIFTH MEHL: All my adornments become beautiful, when You, O Lord, sit in my
courtyard and make it Yours. Then no traveller who comes to my home shall leave
empty-handed. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: I have spread out my bed for You, O my
Husband Lord, and applied all my decorations. But even this is not pleasing to me, to
wear a garland around my neck. || 3 || PAUREE: O Supreme Lord God, O
Transcendent Lord, You do not take birth. By the Hukam of Your Command, You
formed the Universe; forming it, You merge into it. Your Form cannot be known; how
can one meditate on You? You are pervading and permeating all; You Yourself reveal
Your creative potency. Your treasures of devotional worship are overflowing; they never
decrease. These gems, jewels and diamonds — their value cannot be estimated. As You
Yourself become merciful, Lord, You link us to the service of the True Guru. One who
sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, never suffers any deficiency. || 3 ||
DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: When I look within my being, I find that my Beloved is with
me. All pains are relieved, O Nanak, when He bestows His Glance of Grace. || 1 ||
FIFTH MEHL: Nanak sits, waiting for news of the Lord, and stands at the Lord‟s Door;
serving Him for so long. O my Beloved, only You know my objective; I stand, waiting to
see the Lord‟s face. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: What should I say to you, you fool? Don‟t
look at the vines of others — be a true husband. O Nanak, the entire world is blooming,
like a garden of flowers. || 3 || PAUREE: You are Wise, all-knowing and beautiful;
You are pervading and permeating all. You Yourself are the Lord and Master, and the
servant; You worship and adore Yourself. You are all-wise and all-seeing; You Yourself
are true and pure. The Immaculate Lord, my Lord God, is celibate and True. God
spreads out the expanse of the entire universe, and He Himself plays in it. He created
this coming and going of reincarnation; creating the wondrous play, He gazes upon it.
One who is blessed with the Guru‟s Teachings, is not consigned to the womb of
reincarnation, ever again. All walk as He makes them walk; nothing is under the control
of the created beings. || 4 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: You are walking along the
river-bank, but the land is giving way beneath you. Watch out! Your foot might slip, and
you‟ll fall in and die. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: You believe what is false and temporary to
be true, and so you run on and on. O Nanak, like butter in the fire, it shall melt away; it
shall fade away like the water-lily. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: O my foolish and silly soul,
why are you too lazy to serve? Such a long time has passed. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1096 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When will this opportunity come again? || 3 || PAUREE: You have no form or shape,
no social class or race. These humans believe that You are far away; but You are quite
obviously apparent. You enjoy Yourself in every heart, and no filth sticks to You. You
are the blissful and infinite Primal Lord God; Your Light is all-pervading. Among all
divine beings, You are the most divine, O Creator-architect, Rejuvenator of all. How can
my single tongue worship and adore You? You are the eternal, imperishable, infinite
Lord God. One whom You Yourself unite with the True Guru — all his generations are
saved. All Your servants serve You; Nanak is a humble servant at Your Door. || 5 ||
DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: He builds a hut of straw, and the fool lights a fire in it. Only
those who have such pre-ordained destiny on their foreheads, find Shelter with the
Master. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: O Nanak, he grinds the corn, cooks it and places it
before himself. But without his True Guru, he sits and waits for his food to be blessed.
|| 2 || FIFTH MEHL: O Nanak, the loaves of bread are baked and placed on the plate.
Those who obey their Guru, eat and are totally satisfied. || 3 || PAUREE: You have
staged this play in the world, and infused egotism into all beings. In the one temple of
the body are the five thieves, who continually misbehave. The ten brides, the sensory
organs were created, and the one husband, the self; the ten are engrossed in flavors
and tastes. This Maya fascinates and entices them; they wander continually in doubt.
You created both sides, spirit and matter, Shiva and Shakti. Matter loses out to spirit;
this is pleasing to the Lord. You enshrined spirit within, which leads to merger with the
Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Within the bubble, You formed the bubble, which
shall once again merge into the water. || 6 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: Look
ahead; don‟t turn your face backwards. O Nanak, be successful this time, and you shall
not be reincarnated again. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: My joyful friend is called the friend of
all. All think of Him as their own; He never breaks anyone‟s heart. || 2 || FIFTH
MEHL: The hidden jewel has been found; it has appeared on my forehead. Beautiful
and exalted is that place, O Nanak, where You dwell, O my Dear Lord. || 3 ||
PAUREE: When You are on my side, Lord, what do I need to worry about? You
entrusted everything to me, when I became Your slave. My wealth is inexhaustible, no
matter how much I spend and consume. The 8.4 million species of beings all work to
serve me. All these enemies have become my friends, and no one wishes me ill. No one
calls me to account, since God is my forgiver. I have become blissful, and I have found
peace, meeting with the Guru, the Lord of the Universe. All my affairs have been
resolved, since You are pleased with me. || 7 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: I am so
eager to see You, O Lord; what does Your face look like? 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1097 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I wandered around in such a miserable state, but when I saw You, my mind was
comforted and consoled. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: The miserable endure so much
suffering and pain; You alone know their pain, Lord. I may know hundreds of thousands
of remedies, but I shall live only if I see my Husband Lord. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: I
have seen the river-bank washed away by the raging waters of the river. They alone
remain intact, who meet with the True Guru. || 3 || PAUREE: No pain afflicts that
humble being who hungers for You, Lord. That humble Gurmukh who understands, is
celebrated in the four directions. Sins run away from that man, who seeks the
Sanctuary of the Lord. The filth of countless incarnations is washed away, bathing in the
dust of the Guru‟s feet. Whoever submits to the Lord‟s Will does not suffer in sorrow. O
Dear Lord, You are the friend of all; all believe that You are theirs. The glory of the
Lord‟s humble servant is as great as the Glorious Radiance of the Lord. Among all, His
humble servant is pre-eminent; through His humble servant, the Lord is known. || 8 ||
DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: Those whom I followed, now follow me. Those in whom I
placed my hopes, now place their hopes in me. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: The fly flies
around, and comes to the wet lump of molasses. Whoever sits on it, is caught; they
alone are saved, who have good destiny on their foreheads. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: I
see Him within all. No one is without Him. Good destiny is inscribed on the forehead of
that companion, who who enjoys the Lord, my Friend. || 3 || PAUREE: I am a
minstrel at His Door, singing His Glorious Praises, to please to my Lord God. My God is
permanent and stable; others continue coming and going. I beg for that gift from the
Lord of the World, which will satisfy my hunger. O Dear Lord God, please bless Your
minstrel with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, that I might be satisfied and fulfilled.
God, the Great Giver, hears the prayer, and summons the minstrel to the Mansion of
His Presence. Gazing upon God, the minstrel is rid of pain and hunger; he does not
think to ask for anything else. All desires are fulfilled, touching the feet of God. I am His
humble, unworthy minstrel; the Primal Lord God has forgiven me. || 9 || DAKHANAY,
FIFTH MEHL: When the soul leaves, you shall become dust, O vacant body; why do
you not realize your Husband Lord? You are in love with evil people; by what virtues will
you enjoy the Lord‟s Love? || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: O Nanak, without Him, you cannot
survive, even for an instant; you cannot afford to forget Him, even for a moment. Why
are you alienated from Him, O my mind? He takes care of you. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL:
Those who are imbued with the Love of the Supreme Lord God, their minds and bodies
are colored deep crimson. O Nanak, without the Name, other thoughts are polluted and
corrupt. || 3 || PAUREE: O Dear Lord, when You are my friend, what sorrow can
afflict me? You have beaten off and destroyed the cheats that cheat the world. The
Guru has carried me across the terrifying world-ocean, and I have won the battle.
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, I enjoy all the pleasures in the great world-arena. The
True Lord has brought all my senses and organs under my control. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1098 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Wherever I join them, there they are joined; they do not struggle against me. I obtain
the fruits of my desires; the Guru has directed me within. When Guru Nanak is pleased,
O Siblings of Destiny, the Lord is seen to be dwelling near at hand. || 10 ||
DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: When You come into my consciousness, then I obtain all
peace and comfort. Nanak: with Your Name within my mind, O my Husband Lord, I am
filled with delight. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: Enjoyment of clothes and corrupt pleasures —
all these are nothing more than dust. I long for the dust of the feet of those who are
imbued with the Lord‟s Vision. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: Why do you look in other
directions? O my heart, take the Support of the Lord alone. Become the dust of the feet
of the Saints, and find the Lord, the Giver of peace. || 3 || PAUREE: Without good
karma, the Dear Lord is not found; without the True Guru, the mind is not joined to
Him. Only the Dharma remains stable in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; these sinners will
not last at all. Whatever one does with this hand, he obtains with the other hand,
without a moment‟s delay. I have examined the four ages, and without the Sangat, the
Holy Congregation, egotism does not depart. Egotism is never eradicated without the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. As long as one‟s mind is torn away from his
Lord and Master, he finds no place of rest. That humble being, who, as Gurmukh,
serves the Lord, has the Support of the Imperishable Lord in the home of his heart. By
the Lord‟s Grace, peace is obtained, and one is attached to the feet of the Guru, the
True Guru. || 11 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: I have searched everywhere for the
King over the heads of kings. That Master is within my heart; I chant His Name with my
mouth. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: O my mother, the Master has blessed me with the jewel.
My heart is cooled and soothed, chanting the True Name with my mouth. || 2 ||
FIFTH MEHL: I have become the bed for my Beloved Husband Lord; my eyes have
become the sheets. If You look at me, even for an instant, then I obtain peace beyond
all price. || 3 || PAUREE: My mind longs to meet the Lord; how can I obtain the
Blessed Vision of His Darshan? I obtain hundreds of thousands, if my Lord and Master
speaks to me, even for an instant. I have searched in four directions; there is no other
as great as You, Lord. Show me the Path, O Saints. How can I meet God? I dedicate my
mind to Him, and renounce my ego. This is the Path which I shall take. Joining the Sat
Sangat, the True Congregation, I serve my Lord and Master continually. All my hopes
are fulfilled; the Guru has ushered me into the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. I cannot
conceive of any other as great as You, O my Friend, O Lord of the World. || 12 ||
DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: I have become the throne for my Beloved Lord King. If You
place Your foot on me, I blossom forth like the lotus flower. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: If
my Beloved becomes hungry, I will become food, and place myself before Him. I may
be crushed, again and again, but like sugarcane, I do not stop yielding sweet juice. || 2
|| FIFTH MEHL: Break off your love with the cheaters; realize that it is a mirage. Your
pleasure lasts for only two moments; this traveller wanders through countless homes.
|| 3 || PAUREE: God is not found by intellectual devices; He is unknowable and
unseen. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1099 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The followers of the six orders wander and roam around wearing religious robes, but
they do not meet God. They keep the lunar fasts, but they are of no account. Those
who read the Vedas in their entirety, still do not see the sublime essence of reality.
They apply ceremonial marks to their foreheads, and take cleansing baths, but they are
blackened within. They wear religious robes, but without the True Teachings, God is not
found. One who had strayed, finds the Path again, if such pre-ordained destiny is
written on his forehead. One who sees the Guru with his eyes, embellishes and exalts
his human life. || 13 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: Focus on that which will not pass
away. Abandon your false actions, and meditate on the True Master. || 1 || FIFTH
MEHL: God‟s Light is permeating all, like the moon reflected in the water. He Himself is
revealed, O Nanak, to one who has such destiny inscribed upon his forehead. || 2 ||
FIFTH MEHL: One‟s face becomes beautiful, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
and singing His Glorious Praises, twenty-four hours a day. O Nanak, in the Court of the
Lord, you shall be accepted; even the homeless find a home there. || 3 || PAUREE:
By wearing religious robes outwardly, God, the Inner-knower is not found. Without the
One Dear Lord, all wander around aimlessly. Their minds are imbued with attachment
to family, and so they continually wander around, puffed up with pride. The arrogant
wander around the world; why are they so proud of their wealth? Their wealth shall not
go with them when they depart; in an instant, it is gone. They wander around in the
world, according to the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command. When one‟s karma is activated,
one finds the Guru, and through Him, the Lord and Master is found. That humble being,
who serves the Lord, has his affairs resolved by the Lord. || 14 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH
MEHL: All speak with their mouths, but rare are those one who realize death. Nanak is
the dust of the feet of those who have faith in the One Lord. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL:
Know that He dwells within all; rare are those who realize this. There is no obscuring
veil on the body of that one, O Nanak, who meets the Guru. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: I
drink in the water which has washed the feet of those who share the Teachings. My
body is filled with infinite love to see my True Master. || 3 || PAUREE: Forgetting the
Naam, the Name of the Fearless Lord, he becomes attached to Maya. He comes and
goes, and wanders, dancing in countless incarnations. He gives his word, but then
backs out. All that he says is false. The false person is hollow within; he is totally
engrossed in falsehood. He tries to take vengeance upon the Lord, who bears no
vengeance; such a person is trapped by falsehood and greed. The True King, the Primal
Lord God, kills him when He sees what he has done. The Messenger of Death sees him,
and he rots away in pain. Even-handed justice is administered, O Nanak, in the Court of
the True Lord. || 15 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: In the early hours of the morning,
chant the Name of God, and meditate on the Feet of the Guru. The filth of birth and
death is erased, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL:
The body is dark, blind and empty, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord. O Nanak,
fruitful is the birth of one, within whose heart the True Master dwells. || 2 || FIFTH
MEHL: With my eyes, I have seen the Light; my great thirst for Him is not quenched. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1100 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, these are not the eyes which can see my Beloved Husband Lord. || 3 ||
PAUREE: That humble being, who, as Gurmukh, serves the Lord, obtains all peace and
pleasure. He Himself is saved, along with his family, and all the world is saved as well.
He collects the wealth of the Lord‟s Name, and all his thirst is quenched. He renounces
worldly greed, and his inner being is lovingly attuned to the Lord. Forever and ever, the
home of his heart is filled with bliss; the Lord is his companion, help and support. He
looks alike upon enemy and friend, and wishes well to all. He alone is fulfilled in this
world, who meditates on the spiritual wisdom of the Guru. He obtains what is preordained for him, according to the Lord. || 16 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: The true
person is said to be beautiful; false is the reputation of the false. O Nanak, rare are
those who have Truth in their laps. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: The face of my friend, the
Lord, is incomparably beautiful; I would watch Him, twenty-four hours a day. In sleep, I
saw my Husband Lord; I am a sacrifice to that dream. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: O my
friend, realize the True Lord. Just to talk about Him is useless. See Him within your
mind; your Beloved is not far away. || 3 || PAUREE: The earth, the Akaashic ethers
of the sky, the nether regions of the underworld, the moon and the sun shall pass
away. Emperors, bankers, rulers and leaders shall depart, and their homes shall be
demolished. The poor and the rich, the humble and the intoxicated, all these people
shall pass away. The Qazis, Shaykhs and preachers shall all arise and depart. The
spiritual teachers, prophets and disciples — none of these shall remain permanently.
Fasts, calls to prayer and sacred scriptures — without understanding, all these shall
vanish. The 8.4 million species of beings of the earth shall all continue coming and
going in reincarnation. The One True Lord God is eternal and unchanging. The Lord‟s
slave is also eternal. || 17 || DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: I have seen and examined
all; without the One Lord, there is none at all. Come, and show me Your face, O my
friend, so that my body and mind may be cooled and soothed. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL:
The lover is without hope, but within my mind, there is great hope. In the midst of
hope, only You, O Lord, remain free of hope; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to
You. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: Even if I just hear of separation from You, I am in pain;
without seeing You, O Lord, I die. Without her Beloved, the separated lover takes no
comfort. || 3 || PAUREE: River-banks, sacred shrines, idols, temples, and places of
pilgrimage like Kaydarnaat‟h, Mat‟huraa and Benares, the thirty-three million gods,
along with Indra, shall all pass away. The Simritees, Shaastras, the four Vedas and the
six systems of philosophy shall vanish. Prayer books, Pandits, religious scholars, songs,
poems and poets shall also depart. Those who are celibate, truthful and charitiable, and
the Sannyaasee hermits are all subject to death. The silent sages, the Yogis and the
nudists, along with the Messengers of Death, shall pass away. Whatever is seen shall
perish; all will dissolve and disappear. Only the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent
Lord, is permanent. His servant becomes permanent as well. || 18 || DAKHANAY,
FIFTH MEHL: Hundreds of times naked does not make the person naked; tens of
thousands of hungers do not make him hungry; millions of pains do not cause him pain.
O Nanak, the Husband Lord blesses him with his Glance of Grace. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1101 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || FIFTH MEHL: Even if one were to enjoy all pleasures, and be master of the
entire earth, O Nanak, all of that is just a disease. Without the Naam, he is dead. || 2
|| FIFTH MEHL: Yearn for the One Lord, and make Him your friend. O Nanak, He
alone fulfills your hopes; you should feel embarrassed, visiting other places. || 3 ||
PAUREE: The One and only Lord is eternal, imperishable, inaccessible and
incomprehensible. The treasure of the Naam is eternal and imperishable. Meditating in
remembrance on Him, the Lord is attained. The Kirtan of His Praises is eternal and
imperishable; the Gurmukh sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe.
Truth, righteousness, Dharma and intense meditation are eternal and imperishable. Day
and night, worship the Lord in adoration. Compassion, righteousness, Dharma and
intense meditation are eternal and imperishable; they alone obtain these, who have
such pre-ordained destiny. The inscription inscribed upon one‟s forehead is eternal and
imperishable; it cannot be avoided by avoidance. The Congregation, the Company of
the Holy, and the word of the humble, are eternal and imperishable. The Holy Guru is
eternal and imperishable. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny worship and adore
the Lord, forever and ever. || 19 || SHALOK, DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: One who
himself has drowned — how can he carry anyone else across? One who is imbued with
the Love of the Husband Lord — O Nanak, he himself is saved, and he saves others as
well. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: Wherever someone speaks and hears the Name of my
Beloved Lord, that is where I go, O Nanak, to see Him, and blossom forth in bliss. || 2
|| FIFTH MEHL: You are in love with your children and your wife; why do you keep
calling them your own? O Nanak, without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the human
body has no foundation. || 3 || PAUREE: With my eyes, I gaze upon the Blessed
Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan; I touch my forehead to the Guru‟s feet. With my feet I
walk on the Guru‟s Path; with my hands, I wave the fan over Him. I meditate on Akaal
Moorat, the undying form, within my heart; day and night, I meditate on Him. I have
renounced all possessiveness, and have placed my faith in the all-powerful Guru. The
Guru has blessed me with the treasure of the Naam; I am rid of all sufferings. Eat and
enjoy the Naam, the Name of the indescribable Lord, O Siblings of Destiny. Confirm
your faith in the Naam, charity and self-purification; chant the Guru‟s sermon forever.
Blessed with intuitive poise, I have found God; I am rid of the fear of the Messenger of
Death. || 20 || SHALOK, DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: I am centered and focused on
my Beloved, but I am not satisfied, even by seeing Him. The Lord and Master is within
all; I do not see any other. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: The sayings of the Saints are the
paths of peace. O Nanak, they alone obtain them, upon whose foreheads such destiny
is written. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: He is totally permeating the mountains, oceans,
deserts, lands, forests, orchards, caves, the nether regions of the underworld, the
Akaashic ethers of the skies, and all hearts. Nanak sees that they are all strung on the
same thread. || 3 || PAUREE: The Dear Lord is my mother, the Dear Lord is my
father; the Dear Lord cherishes and nurtures me. The Dear Lord takes care of me; I am
the child of the Lord. Slowly and steadily, He feeds me; He never fails. He does not
remind me of my faults; He hugs me close in His embrace. Whatever I ask for, He give
me; the Lord is my peace-giving father. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1102 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He has blessed me with the capital, the wealth of spiritual wisdom; He has made me
worthy of this merchandise. He has made me a partner with the Guru; I have obtained
all peace and comforts. He is with me, and shall never separate from me; the Lord, my
father, is potent to do everything. || 21 || SHALOK, DAKHANAY, FIFTH MEHL: O
Nanak, break away from the false, and seek out the Saints, your true friends. The false
shall leave you, even while you are still alive; but the Saints shall not forsake you, even
when you are dead. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: O Nanak, the lightning flashes, and thunder
echoes in the dark black clouds. The downpour from the clouds is heavy; O Nanak, the
soul-brides are exalted and embellished with their Beloved. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: The
ponds and the lands are overflowing with water, and the cold wind is blowing. Her bed
is adorned with gold, diamonds and rubies; she is blessed with beautiful gowns and
delicacies, O Nanak, but without her Beloved, she burns in agony. || 3 || PAUREE:
He does the dees which the Creator causes him to do. Even if you run in hundreds of
directions, O mortal, you shall still receive what you are pre-destined to receive.
Without good karma, you shall obtain nothing, even if you wander across the whole
world. Meeting with the Guru, you shall know the Fear of God, and other fears shall be
taken away. Through the Fear of God, the attitude of detachment wells up, and one
sets out in search of the Lord. Searching and searching, intuitive wisdom wells up, and
then, one is not born to die again. Practicing meditation within my heart, I have found
the Sanctuary of the Holy. Whoever the Lord places on the boat of Guru Nanak, is
carried across the terrifying world-ocean. || 22 || SHALOK, FIFTH MEHL: First,
accept death, and give up any hope of life. Become the dust of the feet of all, and then,
you may come to me. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: See, that only one who has died, truly
lives; one who is alive, consider him dead. Those who are in love with the One Lord,
are the supreme people. || 2 || FIFTH MEHL: Pain does not even approach that
person, within whose mind God abides. Hunger and thirst do not affect him, and the
Messenger of Death does not approach him. || 3 || PAUREE: Your worth cannot be
estimated, O True, Unmoving Lord God. The Siddhas, seekers, spiritual teachers and
meditators — who among them can measure You? You are all-powerful, to form and
break; You create and destroy all. You are all-powerful to act, and inspire all to act;
You speak through each and every heart. You give sustanance to all; why should
mankind waver? You are deep, profound and unfathomable; Your virtuous spiritual
wisdom is priceless. They do the deeds which they are pre-ordained to do. Without You,
there is nothing at all; Nanak chants Your Glorious Praises. || 23 || 1 || 2 ||

RAAG MARU, THE WORD OF KABEER JEE:

O Pandit, O religious scholar, in what foul thoughts are you engaged? You shall be
drowned, along with your family, if you do not meditate on the Lord, you unfortunate
person. || 1 || Pause || 

What is the use of reading the Vedas and the Puraanas? It is like loading a donkey with
sandalwood. You do not know the exalted state of the Lord‟s Name; how will you ever
cross over? || 1 || You kill living beings, and call it a righteous action. Tell me,
brother, what would you call an unrighteous action? You call yourself the most excellent
sage; then who would you call a butcher? || 2 || You are blind in your mind, and do
not understand your own self; how can you make others understand, O brother? For
the sake of Maya and money, you sell knowledge; your life is totally worthless. || 3 ||
Naarad and Vyaasa say these things; go and ask Suk Dayv as well. Says Kabeer,
chanting the Lord‟s Name, you shall be saved; otherwise, you shall drown, brother. || 4
|| 1 || Living in the forest, how will you find Him? Not until you remove corruption
from your mind. Those who look alike upon home and forest, are the most perfect
people in the world. || 1 || You shall find real peace in the Lord, if you lovingly dwell
on the Lord within your being. || 1 || Pause || What is the use of wearing matted
hair, smearing the body with ashes, and living in a cave? Conquering the mind, one
conquers the world, and then remains detached from corruption. || 2 || They all apply
make-up to their eyes; there is little difference between their objectives. But those
eyes, to which the ointment of spiritual wisdom is applied, are approved and supreme.
|| 3 || Says Kabeer, now I know my Lord; the Guru has blessed me with spiritual
wisdom. I have met the Lord, and I am emancipated within; now, my mind does not
wander at all. || 4 || 2 || You have riches and miraculous spiritual powers; so what
business do you have with anyone else? What should I say about the reality of your
talk? I am embarrassed even to speak to you. || 1 || One who has found the Lord,
does not wander from door to door. || 1 || Pause || The false world wanders all
around, in hopes of finding wealth to use for a few days. That humble being, who
drinks in the Lord‟s water, never becomes thirsty again. || 2 || Whoever understands,
by Guru‟s Grace, becomes free of hope in the midst of hope. One comes to see the Lord
everywhere, when the soul becomes detached. || 3 || I have tasted the sublime
essence of the Lord‟s Name; the Lord‟s Name carries everyone across. Says Kabeer, I
have become like gold; doubt is dispelled, and I have crossed over the world-ocean. ||
4 || 3 || Like drops of water in the water of the ocean, and like waves in the stream, I
merge in the Lord. Merging my being into the Absolute Being of God, I have become
impartial and transparent, like the air. || 1 || Why should I come into the world
again? Coming and going is by the Hukam of His Command; realizing His Hukam, I shall
merge in Him. || 1 || Pause || When the body, formed of the five elements,
perishes, then any such doubts shall end. Giving up the different schools of philosophy,
I look upon all equally; I meditate only on the One Name. || 2 || Whatever I am
attached to, to that I am attached; such are the deeds I do. When the Dear Lord grants
His Grace, then I am merged in the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1104 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Die while yet alive, and by so dying, be alive; thus you shall not be reborn again. Says
Kabeer, whoever is absorbed in the Naam remains lovingly absorbed in the Primal,
Absolute Lord. || 4 || 4 || If You keep me far away from You, then tell me, what is
liberation? The One has many forms, and is contained within all; how can I be fooled
now? || 1 || O Lord, where will You take me, to save me? Tell me where, and what
sort of liberation shall You give me? By Your Grace, I have already obtained it. || 1 ||
Pause || People talk of salvation and being saved, as long as they do not understand
the essence of reality. I have now become pure within my heart, says Kabeer, and my
mind is pleased and appeased. || 2 || 5 || Raawan made castles and fortresses of
gold, but he had to abandon them when he left. || 1 || Why do you act only to please
your mind? When Death comes and grabs you by the hair, then only the Name of the
Lord will save you. || 1 || Pause || Death, and deathlessness are the creations of
our Lord and Master; this show, this expanse, is only an entanglement. Says Kabeer,
those who have the sublime essence of the Lord in their hearts — in the end, they are
liberated. || 2 || 6 || The body is a village, and the soul is the owner and farmer; the
five farm-hands live there. The eyes, nose, ears, tongue and sensory organs of touch
do not obey any order. || 1 || O father, now I shall not live in this village. The
accountants summoned Chitar and Gupat, the recording scribes of the conscious and
the unconscious, to ask for an account of each and every moment. || 1 || Pause ||
When the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls for my account, there shall be a very heavy
balance against me. The five farm-hands shall then run away, and the bailiff shall arrest
the soul. || 2 || Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: settle your accounts in this farm. O
Lord, please forgive Your slave now, in this life, so that he may not have to return again
to this terrifying world-ocean. || 3 || 7 ||
RAAG MARU, THE WORD OF KABEER JEE:

No one has seen the Fearless Lord, O renunciate. Without the Fear of God, how can the
Fearless Lord be obtained? || 1 || If one sees the Presence of his Husband Lord near
at hand, then he feels the Fear of God, O renunciate. If he realizes the Hukam of the
Lord‟s Command, then he becomes fearless. || 2 || Don‟t practice hypocrisy with the
Lord, O renunciate! The whole world is filled with hypocrisy. || 3 || Thirst and desire
do not just go away, O renunciate. The body is burning in the fire of worldly love and
attachment. || 4 || Anxiety is burned, and the body is burned, O renunciate, only if
one lets his mind become dead. || 5 || Without the True Guru, there can be no
renunciation, even though all the people may wish for it. || 6 || When God grants His
Grace, one meets the True Guru, O renunciate, and automatically, intuitively finds that
Lord. || 7 || Says Kabeer, I offer this one prayer, O renunciate. Carry me across the
terrifying world-ocean. 

|| 8 || 1 || 8 || O king, who will come to you? I have seen such love from Bidur, that
the poor man is pleasing to me. || 1 || Pause || Gazing upon your elephants, you
have gone astray in doubt; you do not know the Great Lord God. I judge Bidur‟s water
to be like ambrosial nectar, in comparison with your milk. || 1 || I find his rough
vegetables to be like rice pudding; the night of my life passes singing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. Kabeer‟s Lord and Master is joyous and blissful; He does not care
about anyone‟s social class. || 2 || 9 || SHALOK, KABEER: The battle-drum beats in
the sky of the mind; aim is taken, and the wound is inflicted. The spiritual warriors
enter the field of battle; now is the time to fight! || 1 || He alone is known as a
spiritual hero, who fights in defense of religion. He may be cut apart, piece by piece,
but he never leaves the field of battle. || 2 || 2 ||
SHABAD OF KABEER, RAAG MARU, THE WORD OF NAAM DAYV JEE :

I have obtained the four kinds of liberation, and the four miraculous spiritual powers, in
the Sanctuary of God, my Husband Lord. I am liberated, and famous throughout the
four ages; the canopy of praise and fame waves over my head. || 1 || Meditating on
the Sovereign Lord God, who has not been saved? Whoever follows the Guru‟s
Teachings and joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is called the most
devoted of the devotees. || 1 || Pause || He is adorned with the conch, the chakra,
the mala and the ceremonial tilak mark on his forehead; gazing upon his radiant glory,
the Messenger of Death is scared away. He becomes fearless, and the power of the
Lord thunders through him; the pains of birth and death are taken away. || 2 || The
Lord blessed Ambreek with fearless dignity, and elevated Bhabhikhan to become king.
Sudama‟s Lord and Master blessed him with the nine treasures; he made Dhroo
permanent and unmoving; as the north star, he still hasn‟t moved. || 3 || For the
sake of His devotee Prahlaad, God assumed the form of the man-lion, and killed
Harnaakhash. Says Naam Dayv, the beautiful-haired Lord is in the power of His
devotees; He is standing at Balraja‟s door, even now! || 4 || 1 || MARU, KABEER JEE:
You have forgotten your religion, O madman; you have forgotten your religion. You fill
your belly, and sleep like an animal; you have wasted and lost this human life. || 1 ||
Pause || You never joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. You are
engrossed in false pursuits. You wander like a dog, a pig, a crow; soon, you shall have
to get up and leave. || 1 || You believe that you yourself are great, and that others
are small. Those who are false in thought, word and deed, I have seen them going to
hell. || 2 || The lustful, the angry, the clever, the deceitful and the lazy waste their
lives in slander, and never remember their Lord in meditation. || 3 || Says Kabeer,
the fools, the idiots and the brutes do not remember the Lord. They do not know the
Lord‟s Name; how can they be carried across? || 4 || 1 || 



RAAG MARU, THE WORD OF JAI DAYV JEE:

The breath is drawn in through the left nostril; it is held in the central channel of the
Sushmanaa, and exhaled through the right nostril, repeating the Lord‟s Name sixteen
times. I am powerless; my power has been broken. My unstable mind has been
stabliized, and my unadorned soul has been adorned. I drink in the Ambrosial Nectar.
|| 1 || Within my mind, I chant the Name of the Primal Lord God, the Source of virtue.
My vision, that You are I are separate, has melted away. || 1 || Pause || I worship
the One who is worthy of being worshipped. I trust the One who is worthy of being
trusted. Like water merging in water, I merge in the Lord. Says Jai Dayv, I meditate and
contemplate the Luminous, Triumphant Lord. I am lovingly absorbed in the Nirvaanaa
of God. || 2 || 1 || KABEER, MARU: Meditate in remembrance on the Lord, or else
you will regret it in the end, O mind. O sinful soul, you act in greed, but today or
tomorrow, you will have to get up and leave. || 1 || Pause || Clinging to greed, you
have wasted your life, deluded in the doubt of Maya. Do not take pride in your wealth
and youth; you shall crumble apart like dry paper. || 1 || When the Messenger of
Death comes and grabs you by the hair, and knocks you down, on that day, you shall
be powerless. You do not remember the Lord, or vibrate upon Him in meditation, and
you do not practice compassion; you shall be beaten on your face. || 2 || When the
Righteous Judge of Dharma calls for your account, what face will you show Him then?
Says Kabeer, listen, O Saints: in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, you shall
be saved. || 3 || 1 ||
RAAG MARU, THE WORD OF RAVI DAAS JEE:
