MARU, KAAFEE, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

The double-minded person comes and goes, and has numerous friends. The soul-bride
is separated from her Lord, and she has no place of rest; how can she be comforted?
|| 1 || My mind is attuned to the Love of my Husband Lord. I am devoted, dedicated,
a sacrifice to the Lord; if only He would bless me with His Glance of Grace, even for an
instant! || 1 || Pause || I am a rejected bride, abandoned in my parents‟ home; how
can I go to my in-laws now? I wear my faults around my neck; without my Husband
Lord, I am grieving, and wasting away to death. || 2 || But if, in my parents‟ home, I
remember my Husband Lord, then I will come to dwell in the home of my in-laws yet.
The happy soul-brides sleep in peace; they find their Husband Lord, the treasure of
virtue. || 3 || Their blankets and mattresses are made of silk, and so are the clothes
on their bodies. The Lord rejects the impure soul-brides. 

Their life-night passes in misery. || 4 || I have tasted many flavors, and worn many
robes, but without my Husband Lord, my youth is slipping away uselessly; I am
separated from Him, and I cry out in pain. || 5 || I have heard the True Lord‟s
message, contemplating the Guru. True is the home of the True Lord; by His Gracious
Grace, I love Him. || 6 || The spiritual teacher applies the ointment of Truth to his
eyes, and sees God, the Seer. The Gurmukh comes to know and understand; ego and
pride are subdued. || 7 || O Lord, You are pleased with those who are like Yourself;
there are many more like me. O Nanak, the Husband does not separate from those who
are imbued with Truth. || 8 || 1 || 9 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: Neither the sisters, nor
the sisters-in-law, nor the mothers-in-law, shall remain. The true relationship with the
Lord cannot be broken; it was established by the Lord, O sister soul-brides. || 1 || I
am a sacrifice to my Guru; I am forever a sacrifice to Him. Wandering so far without the
Guru, I grew weary; now, the Guru has united me in Union with my Husband Lord. || 1
|| Pause || Aunts, uncles, grandparents and sisters-in-law — they all come and go;
they cannot remain. They are like boatloads of passengers embarking. || 2 || Uncles,
aunts, and cousins of all sorts, cannot remain. The caravans are full, and great crowds
of them are loading up at the riverbank. || 3 || O sister-friends, my Husband Lord is
dyed in the color of Truth. She who lovingly remembers her True Husband Lord is not
separated from Him again. || 4 || All the seasons are good, in which the soul-bride
falls in love with the True Lord. That soul-bride, who knows her Husband Lord, sleeps in
peace, night and day. || 5 || At the ferry, the ferryman announces, “O travellers,
hurry up and cross over.” I have seen them crossing over there, on the boat of the True
Guru. || 6 || Some are getting on board, and some have already set out; some are
weighed down with their loads. Those who deal in Truth, remain with their True Lord
God. || 7 || I am not called good, and I see none who are bad. O Nanak, one who
conquers and subdues his ego, becomes just like the True Lord. || 8 || 2 || 10 ||
MARU, FIRST MEHL: I do not believe that anyone is foolish; I do not believe that
anyone is clever. Imbued forever with the Love of my Lord and Master, I chant His
Name, night and day. || 1 || O Baba, I am so foolish, but I am a sacrifice to the
Name. You are the Creator, You are wise and all-seeing. Through Your Name, we are
carried across. || 1 || Pause || The same person is foolish and wise; the same light
within has two names. The most foolish of the foolish are those who do not believe in
the Name. || 2 || Through the Guru‟s Gate, the Gurdwara, the Name is obtained.
Without the True Guru, it is not received. Through the Pleasure of the True Guru‟s Will,
the Name comes to dwell in the mind, and then, night and day, one remains lovingly
absorbed in the Lord. || 3 || In power, pleasures, beauty, wealth and youth, one
gambles his life away. Bound by the Hukam of God‟s Command, the dice are thrown; he
is just a piece in the game of chess. || 4 || The world is clever and wise, but it is
deluded by doubt, and forgets the Name; the Pandit, the religious scholar, studies the
scriptures, but he is still a fool. 

Forgetting the Name, he dwells upon the Vedas; he writes, but he is confused by his
poisonous corruption. || 5 || He is like the crop planted in the salty soil, or the tree
growing on the river bank, or the white clothes sprinkled with dirt. This world is the
house of desire; whoever enters it, is burnt down by egotistical pride. || 6 || Where
are all the kings and their subjects? Those who are immersed in duality are destroyed.
Says Nanak, these are the steps of the ladder, of the Teachings of the True Guru; only
the Unseen Lord shall remain. || 7 || 3 || 11 ||
MARU, THIRD MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

One whose mind is filled with the Lord‟s Love, is intuitively exalted by the True Word of
the Shabad. He alone knows the pain of this love; what does anyone else know about
its cure? || 1 || He Himself unites in His Union. He Himself inspires us with His Love.
He alone appreciates the value of Your Love, upon whom You shower Your Grace, O
Lord. || 1 || Pause || One whose spiritual vision is awakened — his doubt is driven
out. By Guru‟s Grace, he obtains the supreme status. He alone is a Yogi, who
understands this way, and contemplates the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 2 || By
good destiny, the soul-bride is united with her Husband Lord. Following the Guru‟s
Teachings, she eradicates her evil-mindedness from within. With love, she continually
enjoys pleasure with Him; she becomes the beloved of her Husband Lord. || 3 ||
Other than the True Guru, there is no physician. He Himself is the Immaculate Lord.
Meeting with the True Guru, evil is conquered, and spiritual wisdom is contemplated. ||
4 || One who is committed to this most sublime Shabad becomes Gurmukh, and is rid
of thirst and hunger. By one‟s own efforts, nothing can be accomplished; the Lord, in
His Mercy, bestows power. || 5 || The True Guru has revealed the essence of the
Shaastras and the Vedas. In His Mercy, He has come into the home of my self. In the
midst of Maya, the Immaculate Lord is known, by those upon whom You bestow Your
Grace. || 6 || One who becomes Gurmukh, obtains the essence of reality; he
eradictes his self-conceit from within. Without the True Guru, all are entangled in
worldly affairs; consider this in your mind, and see. || 7 || Some are deluded by
doubt; they strut around egotistically. Some, as Gurmukh, subdue their egotism.
Attuned to the True Word of the Shabad, they remain detached from the world. The
other ignorant fools wander, confused and deluded by doubt. || 8 || Those who have
not become Gurmukh, and who have not found the Naam, the Name of the Lord —
those self-willed manmukhs waste their lives uselessly. In the world hereafter, nothing
except the Name will be of any assistance; this is understood by contemplating the
Guru. || 9 || The Ambrosial Naam is the Giver of peace forever. Throughout the four
ages, it is known through the Perfect Guru. He alone receives it, unto whom You
bestow it; this is the essence of reality which Nanak has realized. || 10 || 1 || 

MARU, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

Wandering and roaming through 8.4 million incarnations, you have now been given this
human life, so difficult to obtain. || 1 || You fool! You are attached and clinging to
such trivial pleasures! The Ambrosial Nectar abides with you, but you are engrossed in
sin and corruption. || 1 || Pause || You have come to trade in gems and jewels, but
you have loaded only barren soil. || 2 || That home within which you live — you have
not kept that home in your thoughts. || 3 || He is immovable, indestructible, the
Giver of peace to the soul; and yet you do not sing His Praises, even for an instant. ||
4 || You have forgotten that place where you must go; you have not attached your
mind to the Lord, even for an instant. || 5 || Gazing upon your children, spouse,
household and paraphernalia, you are entangled in them. || 6 || As God links the
mortals, so are they linked, and so are the deeds they do. || 7 || When He becomes
Merciful, then the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is found; servant Nanak
meditates on God. || 8 || 1 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Granting His Grace, He has
protected me; I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. My tongue
lovingly chants the Lord‟s Name; this love is so sweet and intense! || 1 || He is the
place of rest for my mind, my friend, companion, associate and relative; He is the
Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. || 1 || Pause || He created the world-ocean; I
seek the Sanctuary of that God. By Guru‟s Grace, I worship and adore God; the
Messenger of Death can‟t say anything to me. || 2 || Emancipation and liberation are
at His Door; He is the treasure in the hearts of the Saints. The all-knowing Lord and
Master shows us the true way of life; He is our Savior and Protector forever. || 3 ||
Pain, suffering and troubles are eradicated, when the Lord abides in the mind. Death,
hell and the most horrible dwelling of sin and corruption cannot even touch such a
person. || 4 || Wealth, miraculous spiritual powers and the nine treasures come from
the Lord, as do the streams of Ambrosial Nectar. In the beginning, in the middle, and in
the end, He is perfect, lofty, unapproachable and unfathomable. || 5 || The Siddhas,
seekers, angelic beings, silent sages, and the Vedas speak of Him. Meditating in
remembrance on the Lord and Master, celestial peace is enjoyed; He has no end or
limitation. || 6 || Countless sins are erased in an instant, meditating on the
Benevolent Lord within the heart. Such a person becomes the purest of the pure, and is
blessed with the merits of millions of donations to charity and cleansing baths. || 7 ||
God is power, intellect, understanding, the breath of life, wealth, and everything for the
Saints. May I never forget Him from my mind, even for an instant — this is Nanak‟s
prayer. || 8 || 2 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: The sharp tool cuts down the tree, but it
does not feel anger in its mind. It serves the purpose of the cutter, and does not blame
him at all. || 1 || O my mind, continually, continuously, meditate on the Lord. The
Lord of the Universe is merciful, divine and compassionate. 

Listen — this is the way of the Saints. || 1 || Pause || He plants his feet in the boat,
and then sits down in it; the fatigue of his body is relieved. The great ocean does not
even affect him; in an instant, he arrives on the other shore. || 2 || Sandalwood,
aloe, and camphor-paste — the earth does not love them. But it doesn‟t mind, if
someone digs it up bit by bit, and applies manure and urine to it. || 3 || High and
low, bad and good — the comforting canopy of the sky stretches evenly over all. It
knows nothing of friend and enemy; all beings are alike to it. || 4 || Blazing with its
dazzling light, the sun rises, and dispels the darkness. Touching both the pure and the
impure, it harbors no hatred to any. || 5 || The cool and fragrant wind gently blows
upon all places alike. Wherever anything is, it touches it there, and does not hesitate a
bit. || 6 || Good or bad, whoever comes close to the fire — his cold is taken away. It
knows nothing of its own or others‟; it is constant in the same quality. || 7 ||
Whoever seeks the Sancuary of the feet of the Sublime Lord — his mind is attuned to
the Love of the Beloved. Constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
World, O Nanak, God becomes merciful to us. || 8 || 3 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

Moonlight, moonlight — in the courtyard of the mind, let the moonlight of God shine
down. || 1 || Meditation, meditation — sublime is meditation on the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. || 2 || Renunciation, renunciation — noble is the renunciation of
sexual desire, anger and greed. || 3 || Begging, begging — it is noble to beg for the
Lord‟s Praise from the Guru. || 4 || Vigils, vigils — sublime is the vigil spent singing
the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. || 5 || Attachment, attachment — sublime is the
attachment of the mind to the Guru‟s Feet. || 6 || He alone is blessed with this way of
life, upon whose forehead such destiny is recorded. || 7 || Says Nanak, everything is
sublime and noble, for one who enters the Sanctuary of God. || 8 || 1 || 4 || MARU,
FIFTH MEHL: Please come, O please come into the home of my heart, that I may hear
with my ears the Lord‟s Praises. || 1 || Pause || With your coming, my soul and
body are rejuvenated, and I sing with you the Lord‟s Praises. || 1 || By the Grace of
the Saint, the Lord dwells within the heart, and the love of duality is eradicated. || 2 ||
By the kindness of the devotee, the intellect is enlightened, and pain and evilmindedness are eradicated. || 3 || Beholding the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, one
is sanctified, and is no longer consigned to the womb of reincarnation. || 4 || The
nine treasures, wealth and miraculous spiritual powers are obtained, by one who is
pleasing to Your mind. || 5 || Without the Saint, I have no place of rest at all; I
cannot think of any other place to go. || 6 || I am unworthy; no one gives me
sanctuary. But in the Society of the Saints, I merge in God. || 7 || Says Nanak, the
Guru has revealed this miracle; within my mind, I enjoy the Lord, Har, Har. || 8 || 2 ||
5 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1019 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Fruitful is the life, the life of one who hears about the Lord, and
chants and meditates on Him; he lives forever. || 1 || Pause || The real drink is that
which satisfies the mind; this drink is the sublime essence of the Ambrosial Naam. || 1
|| The real food is that which will never leave you hungry again; it will leave you
contented and satisfied forever. || 2 || The real clothes are those which protect your
honor before the Transcendent Lord, and do not leave you naked ever again. || 3 ||
The real enjoyment within the mind is to be absorbed in the sublime essence of the
Lord, in the Society of the Saints. || 4 || Sew devotional worship to the Lord into the
mind, without any needle or thread. || 5 || Imbued and intoxicated with the sublime
essence of the Lord, this experience will never wear off again. || 6 || One is blessed
with all treasures, when God, in His Mercy, gives them. || 7 || O Nanak, service to the
Saints beings peace; I drink in the wash water of the feet of the Saints. || 8 || 3 || 6 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL, EIGHTH HOUSE, ANJULEES ~ WITH HANDS CUPPED
IN PRAYER:

The household which is filled with abundance — that household suffers anxiety. One
whose household has little, wanders around searching for more. He alone is happy and
at peace, who is liberated from both conditions. || 1 || Householders and kings fall
into hell, along with renunciates and angry men, and all those who study and recite the
Vedas in so many ways. Perfect is the work of that humble servant, who remains
unattached while in the body. || 2 || The mortal sleeps, even while he is awake; he is
being plundered by doubt. Without the Guru, liberation is not obtained, friend. In the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the bonds of egotism are released, and one
comes to behold the One and only Lord. || 3 || Doing deeds, one is placed in
bondage; but if he does not act, he is slandered. Intoxicated with emotional
attachment, the mind is afflicted with anxiety. One who looks alike upon pleasure and
pain, by Guru‟s Grace, sees the Lord in each and every heart. || 4 || Within the world,
one is afflicted by skepticism; he does not know the imperceptible Unspoken Speech of
the Lord. He alone understands, whom the Lord inspires to understand. The Lord
cherishes him as His child. || 5 || He may try to abandon Maya, but he is not
released. If he collects things, then his mind is afraid of losing them. I wave the flybrush over that holy person, whose honor is protected in the midst of Maya. || 6 ||
He alone is a warrior hero, who remains dead to the world. One who runs away will
wander in reincarnation. Whatever happens, accept that as good. Realize the Hukam of
His Command, and your evil-mindedness will be burnt away. || 7 || Whatever He links
us to, to that we are linked. He acts, and does, and watches over His Creation. You are
the Giver of peace, the Perfect Lord of Nanak; as You grant Your blessings, I dwell
upon Your Name. || 8 || 1 || 7 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Beneath the tree, all beings
have gathered. Some are hot-headed, and some speak very sweetly. Sunset has come,
and they rise up and depart; their days have run their course and expired. || 1 ||
Those who committed sins are sure to be ruined. Azraa-eel, the Angel of Death, seizes
and tortures them. 

They are consigned to hell by the Creator Lord, and the Accountant calls them to give
their account. || 2 || No brothers or sisters can go with them. Leaving behind their
property, youth and wealth, they march off. They do not know the kind and
compassionate Lord; they shall be crushed like sesame seeds in the oil-press. || 3 ||
You happily, cheerfully steal the possessions of others, but the Lord God is with you,
watching and listening. Through worldly greed, you have fallen into the pit; you know
nothing of the future. || 4 || You shall be born and born again, and die and die again,
only to be reincarnated again. You shall suffer terrible punishment, on your way to the
land beyond. The mortal does not know the One who created him; he is blind, and so
he shall suffer. || 5 || Forgetting the Creator Lord, he is ruined. The drama of the
world is bad; it brings sadness and then happiness. One who does not meet the Saint
does not have faith or contentment; he wanders just as he pleases. || 6 || The Lord
Himself stages all this drama. Some, he lifts up, and some he throws into the waves. As
He makes them dance, so do they dance. Everyone lives their lives according to their
past actions. || 7 || When the Lord and Master grants His Grace, then we meditate on
Him. In the Society of the Saints, one is not consigned to hell. Please bless Nanak with
the gift of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord; he continually sings the songs of
Your Glories. || 8 || 2 || 8 || 12 || 20 ||
MARU, SOLAHAS, FIRST MEHL:

The True Lord is True; there is no other at all. He who created, shall in the end destroy.
As it pleases You, so You keep me, and so I remain; what excuse could I offer to You?
|| 1 || You Yourself create, and You Yourself destroy. You yourself link each and every
person to their tasks. You contemplate Yourself, You Yourself make us worthy; You
Yourself place us on the Path. || 2 || You Yourself are all-wise, You Yourself are allknowing. You Yourself created the Universe, and You are pleased. You Yourself are the
air, water and fire; You Yourself unite in Union. || 3 || You Yourself are the moon, the
sun, the most perfect of the perfect. You Yourself are spiritual wisdom, meditation, and
the Guru, the Warrior Hero. The Messenger of Death, and his noose of death, cannot
touch one, who is lovingly focused on You, O True Lord. || 4 || You Yourself are the
male, and You Yourself are the female. You Yourself are the chess-board, and You
Yourself are the chessman. You Yourself staged the drama in the arena of the world,
and You Yourself evaluate the players. || 5 || You Yourself are the bumble bee, the
flower, the fruit and the tree. You Yourself are the water, the desert, the ocean and the
pool. You Yourself are the great fish, the tortoise, the Cause of causes; Your form
cannot be known. || 6 || You Yourself are the day, and You Yourself are the night.
You Yourself are pleased by the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. From the very beginning, and
throughout the ages, the unstruck sound current resounds, night and day; in each and
every heart, the Word of the Shabad, echoes Your Will. || 7 || You Yourself are the
jewel, incomparably beautiful and priceless. You Yourself are the Assessor, the Perfect
Weigher. 

You Yourself test and forgive. You Yourself give and take, O Siblings of Destiny. || 8 ||
He Himself is the bow, and He Himself is the archer. He Himself is all-wise, beautiful
and all-knowing. He is the speaker, the orator and the listener. He Himself made what
is made. || 9 || Air is the Guru, and water is known to be the father. The womb of the
great mother earth gives birth to all. Night and day are the two nurses, male and
female; the world plays in this play. || 10 || You Yourself are the fish, and You
Yourself are the net. You Yourself are the cows, and You yourself are their keeper. Your
Light fills all the beings of the world; they walk according to Your Command, O God. ||
11 || You Yourself are the Yogi, and You Yourself are the enjoyer. You Yourself are
the reveller; You form the supreme Union. You Yourself are speechless, formless and
fearless, absorbed in the primal ecstasy of deep meditation. || 12 || The sources of
creation and speech are contained within You, Lord. All that is seen, is coming and
going. They are the true bankers and traders, whom the True Guru has inspired to
understand. || 13 || The Word of the Shabad is understood through the Perfect True
Guru. The True Lord is overflowing with all powers. You are beyond our grasp, and
forever independent. You do not have even an iota of greed. || 14 || Birth and death
are meaningless, for those who enjoy the sublime celestial essence of the Shabad
within their minds. He Himself is the Giver of liberation, satisfaction and blessings, to
those devotees who love Him in their minds. || 15 || He Himself is immaculate; by
contact with the Guru, spiritual wisdom is obtained. Whatever is seen, shall merge into
You. Nanak, the lowly, begs for charity at Your Door; please, bless him with the glorious
greatness of Your Name. || 16 || 1 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: He Himself is the earth,
the mythical bull which supports it and the Akaashic ethers. The True Lord Himself
reveals His Glorious Virtues. He Himself is celibate, chaste and contented; He Himself is
the Doer of deeds. || 1 || He who created the creation, beholds what He has created.
No one can erase the Inscription of the True Lord. He Himself is the Doer, the Cause of
causes; He Himself is the One who bestows glorious greatness. || 2 || The five
thieves cause the fickle consciousness to waver. It looks into the homes of others, but
does not search its own home. The body-village crumbles into dust; without the Word
of the Shabad, one‟s honor is lost. || 3 || One who realizes the Lord through the
Guru, comprehends the three worlds. He subdues his desires, and struggles with his
mind. Those who serve You, become just like You; O Fearless Lord, You are their best
friend from infancy. || 4 || You Yourself are the heavenly realms, this world and the
nether regions of the underworld. You Yourself are the embodiment of light, forever
young. With matted hair, and a horrible, dreadful form, still, You have no form or
feature. || 5 || The Vedas and the Bible do not know the mystery of God. He has no
mother, father, child or brother. He created all the mountains, and levels them again;
the Unseen Lord cannot be seen. || 6 || I have grown weary of making so many
friends. No one can rid me of my sins and mistakes. God is the Supreme Lord and
Master of all the angels and mortal beings; blessed with His Love, their fear is dispelled.
|| 7 || He puts back on the Path those who have wandered and strayed. You Yourself
make them stray, and You teach them again. I cannot see anything except the Name. 

Through the Name comes salvation and merit. || 8 || The Ganges, the Jamunaa
where Krishna played, Kaydar Naat‟h, Benares, Kanchivaram, Puri, Dwaarkaa, Ganga
Saagar where the Ganges empties into the ocean, Trivaynee where the three rivers
come together, and the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, are all merged in the
Lord‟s Being. || 9 || He Himself is the Siddha, the seeker, in meditative
contemplation. He Himself is the King and the Council. God Himself, the wise Judge, sits
on the throne; He takes away doubt, duality and fear. || 10 || He Himself is the Qazi;
He Himself is the Mullah. He Himself is infallible; He never makes mistakes. He Himself
is the Giver of Grace, compassion and honor; He is no one‟s enemy. || 11 || Whoever
He forgives, He blesses with glorious greatness. He is the Giver of all; He does not have
even an iota of greed. The Immaculate Lord is all pervading, permeating everywhere,
both hidden and manifest. || 12 || How can I praise the inaccessible, infinite Lord?
The True Creator Lord is the Enemy of ego. He unites those whom He blesses with His
Grace; uniting them in His Union, they are united. || 13 || Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva
stand at His Door; they serve the unseen, infinite Lord. Millions of others can be seen
crying at His door; I cannot even estimate their numbers. || 14 || True is the Kirtan of
His Praise, and True is the Word of His Bani. I can see no other in the Vedas and the
Puraanas. Truth is my capital; I sing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. I have no
other support at all. || 15 || In each and every age, the True Lord is, and shall always
be. Who has not died? Who shall not die? Nanak the lowly offers this prayer; see Him
within your own self, and lovingly focus on the Lord. || 16 || 2 || MARU, FIRST
MEHL: In duality and evil-mindedness, the soul-bride is blind and deaf. She wears the
dress of sexual desire and anger. Her Husband Lord is within the home of her own
heart, but she does not know Him; without her Husband Lord, she cannot go to sleep.
|| 1 || The great fire of desire blazes within her. The self-willed manmukh looks
around in the four directions. Without serving the True Guru, how can she find peace?
Glorious greatness rests in the hands of the True Lord. || 2 || Eradicating sexual
desire, anger and egotism, she destroys the five thieves through the Word of the
Shabad. Taking up the sword of spiritual wisdom, she struggles with her mind, and
hope and desire are smoothed over in her mind. || 3 || From the union of the
mother‟s egg and the father‟s sperm, the form of infinite beauty has been created. The
blessings of light all come from You; You are the Creator Lord, pervading everywhere.
|| 4 || You have created birth and death. Why should anyone fear, if they come to
understand through the Guru? When You, O Merciful Lord, look with Your kindness,
then pain and suffering leave the body. || 5 || One who sits in the home of his own
self, eats his own fears. He quiets and holds his wandering mind still. His heart-lotus
blossoms forth in the overflowing green pool, and the Lord of his soul becomes his
companion and helper. || 6 || With their death already ordained, mortals come into
this world. How can they remain here? They have to go to the world beyond. True is
the Lord‟s Command; the true ones dwell in the eternal city. The True Lord blesses
them with glorious greatness. || 7 || He Himself created the whole world. 

The One who made it, assigns the tasks to it. I cannot see any other above the True
Lord. The True Lord does the appraisal. || 8 || In this green pasture, the mortal stays
only a few days. He plays and frolics in utter darkness. The jugglers have staged their
show, and left, like people mumbling in a dream. || 9 || They alone are blessed with
glorious greatness at the Lord‟s throne, who enshrine the fearless Lord in their minds,
and lovingly center themselves on Him. In the galaxies and solar systems, nether
regions, celestial realms and the three worlds, the Lord is in the primal void of deep
absorption. || 10 || True is the village, and true is the throne, of those Gurmukhs who
meet with the True Lord, and find peace. In Truth, seated upon the true throne, they
are blessed with glorious greatness; their egotism is eradicated, along with the
calculation of their account. || 11 || Calculating its account, the soul becomes
anxious. How can one find peace, through duality and the three gunas — the three
qualities? The One Lord is immaculate and formless, the Great Giver; through the
Perfect Guru, honor is obtained. || 12 || In each and every age, very rare are those
who, as Gurmukh, realize the Lord. Their minds are imbued with the True, all-pervading
Lord. Seeking His Shelter, they find peace, and their minds and bodies are not stained
with filth. || 13 || Their tongues are imbued with the True Lord, the source of nectar;
abiding with the Lord God, they have no fear or doubt. Hearing the Word of the Guru‟s
Bani, their ears are satisfied, and their light merges into the Light. || 14 || Carefully,
carefully, I place my feet upon the ground. Wherever I go, I behold Your Sanctuary.
Whether You grant me pain or pleasure, You are pleasing to my mind. I am in harmony
with You. || 15 || No one is anyone‟s companion or helper at the very last moment;
as Gurmukh, I realize You and praise You. O Nanak, imbued with the Naam, I am
detached; in the home of my own self deep within, I am absorbed in the primal void of
deep meditation. || 16 || 3 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: From the very beginning of time,
and throughout the ages, You are infinite and incomparable. You are my primal,
immaculate Lord and Master. I contemplate the Way of Yoga, the Way of Union with
the True Lord. I am truly absorbed in the primal void of deep meditation. || 1 || For
so many ages, there was only pitch darkness; the Creator Lord was absorbed in the
primal void. There was the True Name, the glorious greatness of the Truth, and the
glory of His true throne. || 2 || In the Golden Age of Truth, Truth and contentment
filled the bodies. Truth was pervasive, Truth, deep, profound and unfathomable. The
True Lord appraises the mortals on the Touchstone of Truth, and issues His True
Command. || 3 || The Perfect True Guru is true and contented. He alone is a spiritual
hero, who believes in the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. He alone obtains a true seat in
the True Court of the Lord, who surrenders to the Command of the Commander. || 4 ||
In the Golden Age of Truth, everyone spoke the Truth. Truth was pervasive — the Lord
was Truth. With Truth in their minds and mouths, mortals were rid of doubt and fear.
Truth was the friend of the Gurmukhs. || 5 || In the Silver Age of Traytaa Yoga, one
power of Dharma was lost. Three feet remained; through duality, one was cut off.
Those who were Gurmukh spoke the Truth, while the self-willed manmukhs wasted
away in vain. || 6 || The manmukh never succeeds in the Court of the Lord. Without
the Word of the Shabad, how can one be pleased within? In bondage they come, and in
bondage they go; they understand and comprehend nothing. || 7 || In the Brass Age
of Dwaapur Yuga, compassion was cut in half. 

Only a few, as Gurmukh, remembered the Lord. Dharmic faith, which upholds and
supports the earth, had only two feet; Truth was revealed to the Gurmukhs. || 8 ||
The kings acted righteously only out of self-interest. Tied to hopes of reward, they gave
to charities. Without the Lord‟s Name, liberation did not come, although they grew
weary of performing rituals. || 9 || Practicing religious rituals, they sought liberation,
but the treasure of liberation comes only by praising the Shabad. Without the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, liberation is not obtained; practicing hypocrisy, they wander around
confused. || 10 || Love and attachment to Maya cannot be abandoned. They alone
find release, who practice deeds of Truth. Day and night, the devotees remain imbued
with contemplative meditation; they become just like their Lord and Master. || 11 ||
Some chant and practice intensive meditation, and take cleansing baths at sacred
shrines of pilgrimage. They walk as You will them to walk. By stubborn rituals of selfsuppression, the Lord is not pleased. No one has ever obtained honor, without the Lord,
without the Guru. || 12 || In the Iron Age, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, only one power
remains. Without the Perfect Guru, no one has even described it. The self-willed
manmukhs have staged the show of falsehood. Without the True Guru, doubt does not
depart. || 13 || The True Guru is the Creator Lord, independent and carefree. He
does not fear death, and He is not dependent on mortal men. Whoever serves Him
becomes immortal and imperishable, and will not be tortured by death. || 14 || The
Creator Lord has enshrined Himself within the Guru. The Gurmukh saves countless
millions. The Life of the World is the Great Giver of all beings. The Fearless Lord has no
filth at all. || 15 || Everyone begs from the Guru, God‟s Treasurer. He Himself is the
immaculate, unknowable, infinite Lord. Nanak speaks the Truth; he begs from God.
Please bless me with the Truth, by Your Will. || 16 || 4 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: The
True Lord unites with those who are united with the Word of the Shabad. When it
pleases Him, we intuitively merge with Him. The Light of the Transcendent Lord
pervades the three worlds; there is no other at all, O Siblings of Destiny. || 1 || I am
His servant; I serve Him. He is unknowable and mysterious; He is pleased by the
Shabad. The Creator is the Benefactor of His devotees. He forgives them — such is His
greatness. || 2 || The True Lord gives and gives; His blessings never run short. The
false ones receive, and then deny having received. They do not understand their
origins, they are not pleased with the Truth, and so they wander in duality and doubt.
|| 3 || The Gurmukhs remain awake and aware, day and night. Following the Guru‟s
Teachings, they know the Love of the True Lord. The self-willed manmukhs remain
asleep, and are plundered. The Gurmukhs remain safe and sound, O Siblings of
Destiny. || 4 || The false come, and the false go; imbued with falsehood, they
practice only falsehood. Those who are imbued with the Shabad are robed in honor in
the Court of the Lord; the Gurmukhs focus their consciousness on Him. || 5 || The
false are cheated, and robbed by the robbers. The garden is laid waste, like the rough
wilderness. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, nothing tastes sweet; forgetting
the Lord, they suffer in sorrow. || 6 || Receiving the food of Truth, one is satisfied.
True is the glorious greatness of the jewel of the Name. One who understands his own
self, realizes the Lord. 

His light merges into the Light. || 7 || Wandering from the Name, he endures
beatings. Even great cleverness does not dispel doubt. The unconscious fool does not
remain conscious of the Lord; he putrifies and rots away to death, carrying his heavy
load of sin. || 8 || No one is free of conflict and strife. Show me anyone who is, and I
will praise him. Dedicating mind and body to God, one meets the Lord, the Life of the
World, and becomes just like Him. || 9 || No one knows the state and extent of God.
Whoever calls himself great, will be eaten by his greatness. There is no lack of gifts of
our True Lord and Master. He created all. || 10 || Great is the glorious greatness of
the independent Lord. He Himself created, and gives sustanance to all. The Merciful
Lord is not far away; the Great Giver spontaneously unites with Himself, by His Will. ||
11 || Some are sad, and some are afflicted with disease. Whatever God does, He does
by Himself. Through loving devotion, and the Perfect Teachings of the Guru, the
unstruck sound current of the Shabad is realized. || 12 || Some wander and roam
around, hungry and naked. Some act in stubbornness and die, but do not know the
value of God. They do not know the difference between good and bad; this is
understood only through the practice of the Word of the Shabad. || 13 || Some bathe
at sacred shrines and refuse to eat. Some torment their bodies in burning fire. Without
the Lord‟s Name, liberation is not obtained; how can anyone cross over? || 14 ||
Abandoning the Guru‟s Teachings, some wander in the wilderness. The self-willed
manmukhs are destitute; they do not meditate on the Lord. They are ruined, destroyed
and drowned from practicing falsehood; death is the enemy of the false. || 15 || By
the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, they come, and by the Hukam of His Command,
they go. One who realizes His Hukam, merges in the True Lord. O Nanak, he merges in
the True Lord, and his mind is pleased with the Lord. The Gurmukhs do His work. || 16
|| 5 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: He Himself is the Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny.
He evaluates those whom He Himself has created. He Himself is the True Guru, and He
Himself is the servant; He Himself created the Universe. || 1 || He is near at hand,
not far away. The Gurmukhs understand Him; perfect are those humble beings.
Associating with them night and day is profitable. This is the glorious greatness of
associating with the Guru. || 2 || Throughout the ages, Your Saints are holy and
sublime, O God. They sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, savoring it with their
tongues. They chant His Praises, and their pain and poverty are taken away; they are
not afraid of anyone else. || 3 || They remain awake and aware, and do not appear to
sleep. They serve up Truth, and so save their companions and relatives. They are not
stained with the filth of sinful residues; they are immaculate and pure, and remain
absorbed in loving devotional worship. || 4 || O humble servants of the Lord,
understand the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. This youth, breath and body shall pass away.
O mortal, you shall die today or tomorrow; chant, and meditate on the Lord within your
heart. || 5 || O mortal, abandon falsehood and your worthless ways. Death viciously
kills the false beings. The faithless cynic is ruined through falsehood and his egotistical
mind.

On the path of duality, he rots away and decomposes. || 6 || Abandon slander and
envy of others. Reading and studying, they burn, and do not find tranquility. Joining the
Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The Lord,
the Supreme Soul, shall be your helper and companion. || 7 || Abandon sexual
desire, anger and wickedness. Abandon your involvement in egotistical affairs and
conflicts. If you seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru, then you shall be saved. In this
way you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, O Siblings of Destiny. || 8 || In
the hereafter, you shall have to cross over the fiery river of poisonous flames. No one
else will be there; your soul shall be all alone. The ocean of fire spits out waves of
searing flames; the self-willed manmukhs fall into it, and are roasted there. || 9 ||
Liberation comes from the Guru; He grants this blessing by the Pleasure of His Will. He
alone knows the way, who obtains it. So ask one who has obtained it, O Siblings of
Destiny. Serve the True Guru, and find peace. || 10 || Without the Guru, he dies
entangled in sin and corruption. The Messenger of Death smashes his head and
humiliates him. The slanderous person is not freed of his bonds; he is drowned,
slandering others. || 11 || So speak the Truth, and realize the Lord deep within. He is
not far away; look, and see Him. No obstacles shall block your way; become Gurmukh,
and cross over to the other side. This is the way to cross over the terrifying worldocean. || 12 || The Naam, the Name of the Lord, abides deep within the body. The
Creator Lord is eternal and imperishable. The soul does not die, and it cannot be killed;
God creates and watches over all. Through the Word of the Shabad, His Will is
manifest. || 13 || He is immaculate, and has no darkness. The True Lord Himself sits
upon His throne. The faithless cynics are bound and gagged, and forced to wander in
reincarnation. They die, and are reborn, and continue coming and going. || 14 || The
Guru‟s servants are the Beloveds of the True Guru. Contemplating the Shabad, they sit
upon His throne. They realize the essence of reality, and know the state of their inner
being. This is the true glorious greatness of those who join the Sat Sangat. || 15 ||
He Himself saves His humble servant, and saves his ancestors as well. His companions
are liberated; He carries them across. Nanak is the servant and slave of that Gurmukh
who lovingly focuses his consciousness on the Lord. || 16 || 6 || MARU, FIRST
MEHL: For many ages, only darkness prevailed; the infinite, endless Lord was absorbed
in the primal void. He sat alone and unaffected in absolute darkness; the world of
conflict did not exist. || 1 || Thirty-six ages passed like this. He causes all to happen
by the Pleasure of His Will. No rival of His can be seen. He Himself is infinite and
endless. || 2 || God is hidden throughout the four ages — understand this well. He
pervades each and every heart, and is contained within the belly. The One and Only
Lord prevails throughout the ages. How rare are those who contemplate the Guru, and
understand this. || 3 || From the union of the sperm and the egg, the body was
formed. From the union of air, water and fire, the soul is made. He Himself plays
joyfully in the mansion of the body; all the rest is just attachment to Maya‟s expanse. ||
4 || Within the mother‟s womb, upside-down, the mortal meditated on God. The
Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows everything. 

With each and every breath, he contemplated the True Name, deep within himself,
within the womb. || 5 || He came into the world to obtain the four great blessings. He
came to dwell in the home of the Shiva and Shakti, energy and matter. But he forgot
the One Lord, and he has lost the game. The blind person forgets the Naam, the Name
of the Lord. || 6 || The child dies in his childish games. They cry and mourn, saying
that he was such a playful child. The Lord who owns him has taken him back. Those
who weep and mourn are mistaken. || 7 || What can they do, if he dies in his youth?
They cry out, “His is mine, he is mine!” They cry for the sake of Maya, and are ruined;
their lives in this world are cursed. || 8 || Their black hair eventually turns grey.
Without the Name, they lose their wealth, and then leave. They are evil-minded and
blind — they are totally ruined; they are plundered, and cry out in pain. || 9 || One
who understands himself, does not cry. When he meets the True Guru, then he
understands. Without the Guru, the heavy, hard doors are not opened. Obtaining the
Word of the Shabad, one is emancipated. || 10 || The body grows old, and is beaten
out of shape. But he does not meditate on the Lord, His only friend, even at the end.
Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he departs with his face blackened. The
false are humiliated in the Court of the Lord. || 11 || Forgetting the Naam, the false
ones depart. Coming and going, dust falls on their heads. The soul-bride finds no home
in her in-laws‟ home, the world hereafter; she suffers in agony in this world of her
parents‟ home. || 12 || She eats, dresses and plays joyfully, but without loving
devotional worship of the Lord, she dies uselessly. One who does not distinguish
between good and evil, is beaten by the Messenger of Death; how can anyone escape
this? || 13 || One who realizes what he has to possess, and what he has to abandon,
associating with the Guru, comes to know the Word of the Shabad, within the home of
his own self. Do not call anyone else bad; follow this way of life. Those who are true are
judged to be genuine by the True Lord. || 14 || Without Truth, no one succeeds in
the Court of the Lord. Through the True Shabad, one is robed in honor. He forgives
those with whom He is pleased; they silence their egotism and pride. || 15 || One
who realizes the Hukam of God‟s Command, by the Grace of the Guru, comes to know
the lifestyle of the ages. O Nanak, chant the Naam, and cross over to the other side.
The True Lord will carry you across. || 16 || 1 || 7 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: I have no
other friend like the Lord. He gave me body and mind, and infused consciousness into
my being. He cherishes and cares for all beings; He is deep within, the wise, allknowing Lord. || 1 || The Guru is the sacred pool, and I am His beloved swan. In the
ocean, there are so many jewels and rubies. The Lord‟s Praises are pearls, gems and
diamonds. Singing His Praises, my mind and body are drenched with His Love. || 2 ||
The Lord is inaccessible, inscrutable, unfathomable and unattached. The Lord‟s limits
cannot be found; the Guru is the Lord of the World. Through the Teachings of the True
Guru, the Lord carries us across to the other side. He unites in His Union those who are
colored by His Love. || 3 || Without the True Guru, how can anyone be liberated? He
has been the Friend of the Lord, from the very beginning of time, and all throughout
the ages. 

By His Grace, He grants liberation in His Court; He forgives them for their sins. || 4 ||
The True Guru, the Giver, grants liberation; all diseases are eradicated, and one is
blessed with the Ambrosial Nectar. Death, the tax collector, does not impose any tax on
one whose inner fire has been put out, whose heart is cool and tranquil. || 5 || The
body has developed a great love for the soul-swan. He is a Yogi, and she is a beautiful
woman. Day and night, he enjoys her with delight, and then he arises and departs
without consulting her. || 6 || Creating the Universe, God remains diffused
throughout it. In the wind, water and fire, He vibrates and resounds. The mind wavers,
keeping company with evil passions; one obtains the rewards of his own actions. || 7 ||
Forgetting the Naam, one suffers the misery of his evil ways. When the order to depart
is issued, how can he remain here? He falls into the pit of hell, and suffers like a fish
out of water. || 8 || The faithless cynic has to endure 8.4 million hellish incarnations.
As he acts, so does he suffer. Without the True Guru, there is no liberation. Bound and
gagged by his own actions, he is helpless. || 9 || This path is very narrow, like the
sharp edge of a sword. When his account is read, he shall be crushed like the sesame
seed in the mill. Mother, father, spouse and child — none is anyone‟s friend in the end.
Without the Lord‟s Love, no one is liberated. || 10 || You may have many friends and
companions in the world, but without the Guru, the Transcendent Lord Incarnate, there
is no one at all. Service to the Guru is the way to liberation. Night and day, sing the
Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. || 11 || Abandon falsehood, and pursue the Truth, and
you shall obtain the fruits of your desires. Very few are those who trade in the
merchandise of Truth. Those who deal in it, obtain the true profit. || 12 || Depart
with the merchandise of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and you shall intuitively obtain
the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, in the Mansion of His Presence. The Gurmukhs
search for Him and find Him; they are the perfect humble beings. In this way, they see
Him, who looks upon all alike. || 13 || God is endless; following the Guru‟s Teachings,
some find Him. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they instruct their minds.
Accept as True, Perfectly True, the Word of the True Guru‟s Bani. In this way, you shall
merge in the Lord, the Supreme Soul. || 14 || Naarad and Saraswati are Your
servants. Your servants are the greatest of the great, throughout the three worlds. Your
creative power permeates all; You are the Great Giver of all. You created the whole
creation. || 15 || Some serve at Your Door, and their sufferings are dispelled. They
are robed with honor in the Court of the Lord, and emancipated by the True Guru. The
True Guru breaks the bonds of egotism, and restrains the fickle consciousness. || 16 ||
Meet the True Guru, and search for the way, by which you may find God, and not have
to answer for your account. Subdue your egotism, and serve the Guru; O servant
Nanak, you shall be drenched with the Lord‟s Love. || 17 || 2 || 8 || MARU, FIRST
MEHL: My Lord is the Destroyer of demons. My Beloved Lord is pervading each and
every heart. The unseen Lord is always with us, but He is not seen at all. The Gurmukh
contemplates the record. || 1 || 

The Holy Gurmukh seeks Your Sanctuary. God grants His Grace, and carries him across
to the other side. The ocean is very deep, filled with fiery water; the Guru, the True
Guru, carries us across to the other side. || 2 || The blind, self-willed manmukh does
not understand. He comes and goes in reincarnation, dying, and dying again. The
primal inscription of destiny cannot be erased. The spiritually blind suffer terribly at
Death‟s door. || 3 || Some come and go, and do not find a home in their own heart.
Bound by their past actions, they commit sins. The blind ones have no understanding,
no wisdom; they are trapped and ruined by greed and egotism. || 4 || Without her
Husband Lord, what good are the soul-bride‟s decorations? She has forgotten her Lord
and Master, and is infatuated with another‟s husband. Just as no one knows who is the
father of the prostitute‟s son, such are the worthless, useless deeds that are done. || 5
|| The ghost, in the body-cage, suffers all sorts of afflictions. Those who are blind to
spiritual wisdom, putrefy in hell. The Righteous Judge of Dharma collects the balance
due on the account, of those who forget the Name of the Lord. || 6 || The scorching
sun blazes with flames of poison. The self-willed manmukh is dishonored, a beast, a
demon. Trapped by hope and desire, he practices falsehood, and is afflicted by the
terrible disease of corruption. || 7 || He carries the heavy load of sins on his forehead
and head. How can he cross the terrifying world-ocean? From the very beginning of
time, and throughout the ages, the True Guru has been the boat; through the Lord‟s
Name, He carries us across. || 8 || The love of one‟s children and spouse is so sweet
in this world. The expansive expanse of the Universe is attachment to Maya. The True
Guru snaps the noose of Death, for that Gurmukh who contemplates the essence of
reality. || 9 || Cheated by falsehood, the self-willed manmukh walks along many
paths; he may be highly educated, but he burns in the fire. The Guru is the Great Giver
of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. Chanting the Naam, sublime peace is
obtained. || 10 || The True Guru, in His Mercy, implants Truth within. All suffering is
eradicated, and one is placed on the Path. Not even a thorn ever pierces the foot of one
who has the True Guru as his Protector. || 11 || Dust mixes with dust, when the body
wastes away. The self-willed manmukh is like a stone slab, which is impervious to
water. He cries out and weeps and wails; he is reincarnated into heaven and then hell.
|| 12 || They live with the poisonous snake of Maya. This duality has ruined so many
homes. Without the True Guru, love does not well up. Imbued with devotional worship,
the soul is satisfied. || 13 || The faithless cynics chase after Maya. Forgetting the
Naam, how can they find peace? In the three qualities, they are destroyed; they cannot
cross over to the other side. || 14 || The false are called pigs and dogs. They bark
themselves to death; they bark and bark and howl in fear. False in mind and body, they
practice falsehood; through their evil-mindedness, they lose out in the Court of the
Lord. || 15 || Meeting the True Guru, the mind is stabilized. One who seeks His
Sanctuary is blessed with the Lord‟s Name. They are given the priceless wealth of the
Lord‟s Name; singing His Praises, they are His beloveds in His court. || 16 || 

In the Sanctuary of the Holy, chant the Lord‟s Name. Through the True Guru‟s
Teachings, one comes to know His state and extent. Nanak: chant the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; the Lord, the Uniter, shall unite you with Himself. || 17 || 3
|| 9 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: Remain in your own home, O my foolish and ignorant
mind. Meditate on the Lord — concentrate deep within your being and meditate on Him.
Renounce your greed, and merge with the infinite Lord. In this way, you shall find the
door of liberation. || 1 || If you forget Him, the Messenger of Death will catch sight of
you. All peace will be gone, and you will suffer in pain in the world hereafter. Chant the
Name of the Lord as Gurmukh, O my soul; this is the supreme essence of
contemplation. || 2 || Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the sweetest essence.
As Gurmukh, see the essence of the Lord deep within. Day and night, remain imbued
with the Lord‟s Love. This is the essence of all chanting, deep meditation and selfdiscipline. || 3 || Speak the Guru‟s Word, and the Name of the Lord. In the Society of
the Saints, search for this essence. Follow the Guru‟s Teachings — seek and find the
home of your own self, and you shall never be consigned to the womb of reincarnation
again. || 4 || Bathe at the sacred shrine of Truth, and sing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord. Reflect upon the essence of reality, and lovingly focus your consciousness on the
Lord. At the very last moment, the Messenger of Death will not be able to touch you, if
you chant the Name of the Beloved Lord. || 5 || The True Guru, the Primal Being, the
Great Giver, is all-knowing. Whoever has Truth within himself, merges in the Word of
the Shabad. One whom the True Guru unites in Union, is rid of the overpowering fear of
death. || 6 || The body is formed from the union of the five elements. Know that the
Lord‟s jewel is within it. The soul is the Lord, and the Lord is the soul; contemplating
the Shabad, the Lord is found. || 7 || Abide in truth and contentment, O humble
Siblings of Destiny. Hold tight to compassion and the Sanctuary of the True Guru. Know
your soul, and know the Supreme Soul; associating with the Guru, you shall be
emancipated. || 8 || The faithless cynics are stuck in falsehood and deceit. Day and
night, they slander many others. Without meditative remembrance, they come and then
go, and are cast into the hellish womb of reincarnation. || 9 || The faithless cynic is
not rid of his fear of death. The Messenger of Death‟s club is never taken away. He has
to answer to the Righteous Judge of Dharma for the account of his actions; the
egotistical being carries the unbearable load. || 10 || Tell me: without the Guru, what
faithless cynic has been saved? Acting egotistically, he falls into the terrifying worldocean. Without the Guru, no one is saved; meditating on the Lord, they are carried
across to the other side. || 11 || No one can erase the Guru‟s blessings. The Lord
carries across those whom He forgives. The pains of birth and death do not even
approach those whose minds are filled with God, the infinite and endless. || 12 ||
Those who forget the Guru come and go in reincarnation. They are born, only to die
again, and continue committing sins. The unconscious, foolish, faithless cynic does not
remember the Lord; but when he is stricken with pain, then he cries out for the Lord.
|| 13 || Pleasure and pain are the consequences of the actions of past lives. The
Giver, who blesses us with these — He alone knows. So who can you blame, O mortal
being? 

The hardships you suffer are from your own actions. || 14 || Practicing egotism and
possessiveness, you have come into the world. Hope and desire bind you and lead you
on. Indulging in egotism and self-conceit, what will you be able to carry with you,
except the load of ashes from poison and corruption? || 15 || Worship the Lord in
devotion, O humble Siblings of Destiny. Speak the Unspoken Speech, and the mind will
merge back into the Mind. Restrain your restless mind within its own home, and the
Lord, the Destroyer, shall destroy your pain. || 16 || I seek the support of the Perfect
Guru, the Lord. The Gurmukh loves the Lord; the Gurmukh realizes the Lord. O Nanak,
through the Lord‟s Name, the intellect is exalted; granting His forgiveness, the Lord
carries him across to the other side. || 17 || 4 || 10 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: O Divine
Guru, I have entered Your Sanctuary. You are the Almighty Lord, the Merciful Lord. No
one knows Your wondrous plays; You are the perfect Architect of Destiny. || 1 ||
From the very beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You cherish and sustain
Your beings. You are in each and every heart, O Merciful Lord of incomparable beauty.
As You will, You cause all to walk; everyone acts according to Your Command. || 2 ||
Deep within the nucleus of all, is the Light of the Life of the World. The Lord enjoys the
hearts of all, and drinks in their essence. He Himself gives, and He himself takes; He is
the generous father of the beings of the three worlds. || 3 || Creating the world, He
has set His play into motion. He placed the soul in the body of air, water and fire. The
body-village has nine gates; the Tenth Gate remains hidden. || 4 || There are four
horrible rivers of fire. How rare is that Gurmukh who understands this, and through the
Word of the Shabad, remains unattached. The faithless cynics are drowned and burnt
through their evil-mindedness. The Guru saves those who are imbued with the Love of
the Lord. || 5 || Water, fire, air, earth and ether — in that house of the five elements,
they dwell. Those who remain imbued with the Word of the True Guru‟s Shabad,
renounce Maya, egotism and doubt. || 6 || This mind is drenched with the Shabad,
and satisfied. Without the Name, what support can anyone have? The temple of the
body is being plundered by the thieves within, but this faithless cynic does not even
recognize these demons. || 7 || They are argumentative demons, terrifying goblins.
These demons stir up conflict and strife. Without awareness of the Shabad, one comes
and goes in reincarnation; he loses his honor in this coming and going. || 8 || The
body of the false person is just a pile of barren dirt. Without the Name, what honor can
you have? Bound and gagged throughout the four ages, there is no liberation; the
Messenger of Death keeps such a person under his gaze. || 9 || At Death‟s door, he is
tied up and punished; such a sinner does not obtain salvation. He cries out in pain, like
the fish pierced by the hook. || 10 || The faithless cynic is caught in the noose all
alone. The miserable spiritually blind person is caught in the power of Death. Without
the Lord‟s Name, liberation is not known. He shall waste away, today or tomorrow. ||
11 || Other than the True Guru, no one is your friend. Here and hereafter, God is the
Savior. He grants His Grace, and bestows the Lord‟s Name. 

He merges with Him, like water with water. || 12 || The Guru instructs His wandering
Sikhs; if they go astray, He sets them on the right path. So serve the Guru, forever, day
and night; He is the Destroyer of pain — He is with you as your companion. || 13 || O
mortal being, what devotional worship have you performed to the Guru? Even Brahma,
Indra and Shiva do not know it. Tell me, how can the unknowable True Guru be known?
He alone attains this realization, whom the Lord forgives. || 14 || One who has love
within, obtains the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. One who enshrines love for the Word
of the Guru‟s Bani, meets with Him. Day and night, the Gurmukh sees the immaculate
Divine Light everywhere; this lamp illuminates his heart. || 15 || The food of spiritual
wisdom is the supremely sweet essence. Whoever tastes it, sees the Blessed Vision of
the Lord‟s Darshan. Beholding His Darshan, the unattached one meets the Lord;
subduing the mind‟s desires, he merges into the Lord. || 16 || Those who serve the
True Guru are supreme and famous. Deep within each and every heart, they recognize
God. Please bless Nanak with the Lord‟s Praises, and the Sangat, the Congregation of
the Lord‟s humble servants; through the True Guru, they know their Lord God. || 17 ||
5 || 11 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: The True Lord is the Creator of the Universe. He
established and contemplates the worldly sphere. He Himself created the creation, and
beholds it; He is True and independent. || 1 || He created the beings of different
kinds. The two travellers have set out in two directions. Without the Perfect Guru, no
one is liberated. Chanting the True Name, one profits. || 2 || The self-willed
manmukhs read and study, but they do not know the way. They do not understand the
Naam, the Name of the Lord; they wander, deluded by doubt. They take bribes, and
give false testimony; the noose of evil-mindedness is around their necks. || 3 || They
read the Simritees, the Shaastras and the Puraanas; they argue and debate, but do not
know the essence of reality. Without the Perfect Guru, the essence of reality is not
obtained. The true and pure beings walk the Path of Truth. || 4 || All praise God and
listen, and listen and speak. He Himself is wise, and He Himself judges the Truth. Those
whom God blesses with His Glance of Grace become Gurmukh, and praise the Word of
the Shabad. || 5 || Many listen and listen, and speak the Guru‟s Bani. Listening and
speaking, no one knows His limits. He alone is wise, unto whom the unseen Lord
reveals Himself; he speaks the Unspoken Speech. || 6 || At birth, the congratulations
pour in; the ignorant sing songs of joy. Whoever is born, is sure to die, according to the
destiny of past deeds inscribed upon his head by the Sovereign Lord King. || 7 ||
Union and separation were created by my God. Creating the Universe, He gave it pain
and pleasure. The Gurmukhs remain unaffected by pain and pleasure; they wear the
armor of humility. || 8 || The noble people are traders in Truth. They purchase the
true merchandise, contemplating the Guru. One who has the wealth of the true
commodity in his lap, is blessed with the rapture of the True Shabad. || 9 || The false
dealings lead only to loss. The trades of the Gurmukh are pleasing to God. His stock is
safe, and his capital is safe and sound. 

The noose of Death is cut away from around his neck. || 10 || Everyone speaks as
they please. The self-willed manmukh, in duality, does not know how to speak. The
blind person has a blind and deaf intellect; coming and going in reincarnation, he
suffers in pain. || 11 || In pain he is born, and in pain he dies. His pain is not
relieved, without seeking the Sanctuary of the Guru. In pain he is created, and in pain
he perishes. What has he brought with himself? And what will he take away? || 12 ||
True are the actions of those who are under the Guru‟s influence. They do not come
and go in reincarnation, and they are not subject to the laws of Death. Whoever
abandons the branches, and clings to the true root, enjoys true ecstasy within his mind.
|| 13 || Death cannot strike down the people of the Lord. They do not see pain on the
most difficult path. Deep within the nucleus of their hearts, they worship and adore the
Lord‟s Name; there is nothing else at all for them. || 14 || There is no end to the
Lord‟s sermon and Praise. As it pleases You, I remain under Your Will. I am embellished
with robes of honor in the Court of the Lord, by the Order of the True King. || 15 ||
How can I chant Your uncounted glories? Even the greatest of the great do not know
Your limits. Please bless Nanak with the Truth, and preserve his honor; You are the
supreme emperor above the heads of kings. || 16 || 6 || 12 ||
