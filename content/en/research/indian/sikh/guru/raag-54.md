RAAG KALYAAN, FOURTH MEHL:

The Lord, the Beauteous Lord — no one has found His limits. I am a child — You
cherish and sustain me. You are the Great Primal Being, my Mother and Father. || 1 ||
Pause || The Names of the Lord are Countless and Unfathomable. My Sovereign Lord
is Unfathomable and Incomprehensible. The virtuous and the spiritual teachers have
given it great thought, but they have not found even an iota of His Value. || 1 || They
sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Lord of the Universe forever. They sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, but they do not find His limits. You are
Immeasurable, Unweighable, and Infinite, O Lord and Master; no matter how much one
may meditate on You, Your Depth cannot be fathomed. || 2 || Lord, Your humble
servants praise You, singing Your Glorious Praises, O Sovereign Lord. You are the ocean
of water, and I am Your fish. No one has ever found Your limits. Please be Kind to Your
humble servant, Lord; please bless me with the meditation of Your Name. I am a blind
fool; Your Name is my only Support. Servant Nanak, as Gurmukh, has found it. || 4 ||
1 || KALYAAN, FOURTH MEHL: The humble servant of the Lord sings the Lord‟s
Praise, and blossoms forth. My intellect is embellished with devotion to the Lord, Har,
Har, through the Guru‟s Teachings. This is the destiny which God has recorded on my
forehead. || 1 || Pause || I meditate in remembrance on the Guru‟s Feet, day and
night. The Lord, Har, Har, Har, comes to dwell in my mind. The Praise of the Lord, Har,
Har, Har, is Excellent and Sublime in this world. His Praise is the sandalwood paste
which I rub. || 1 || The humble servant of the Lord is lovingly attuned to the Lord,
Har, Har, Har; all the faithless cynics pursue him. The slanderous person acts in
accordance with the record of his past deeds; his foot trips over the snake, and he is
stung by its bite. || 2 || O my Lord and Master, You are the Saving Grace, the
Protector of Your humble servants. You protect them, age after age. What does it
matter, if a demon speaks evil? By doing so, he only gets frustrated. || 3 || All the
beings and creatures created by God are caught in the mouth of Death. The humble
servants of the Lord are protected by the Lord God, Har, Har, Har; servant Nanak seeks
His Sanctuary. || 4 || 2 || KALYAAN, FOURTH MEHL: 

O my mind, chant and meditate on the Master of the Universe. Through the Guru‟s
Teachings, meditate on the Lord‟s Name, and be rid of all the painful residues of your
sinful mistakes. || 1 || Pause || I have only one tongue — I cannot sing His Praises.
Please bless me with many, many tongues. Again and again, each and every instant,
with all of them, I would sing His Glorious Praises; but even then, I would not be able
to sing all of Your Praises, God. || 1 || I am so deeply in love with God, my Lord and
Master; I long to see God‟s Vision. You are the Great Giver of all beings and creatures;
only You know our inner pain. || 2 || If only someone would show me the Way, the
Path of God. Tell me — what could I give him? I would surrender, offer and dedicate all
my body and mind to him; if only someone would unite me in God‟s Union! || 3 ||
The Glorious Praises of the Lord are so many and numerous; I can describe only a tiny
bit of them. My intellect is under Your control, God; You are the All-powerful Lord God
of servant Nanak. || 4 || 3 || KALYAAN, FOURTH MEHL: O my mind, chant the
Glorious Praises of the Lord, which are said to be inexpressible. Rightousness and
Dharmic faith, success and prosperity, pleasure, the fulfillment of desires and liberation
— all follow the humble servant of the Lord like a shadow. || 1 || Pause || That
humble servant of the Lord who has such good fortune written on his forehead
meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. In that Court, where God calls for the
accounts, there, you shall be saved only by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. || 1 || I am stained with the filth of the mistakes of countless lifetimes, the pain
and pollution of egotism. Showering His Mercy, the Guru bathed me in the Water of the
Lord, and all the residues of my sins and mistakes were taken away. || 2 || God, our
Lord and Master, is deep within the hearts of His humble servants. They vibrate the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. And when that very last moment comes, then
the Naam is our Best Friend and Protector. || 3 || Your humble servants sing Your
Praises, O Lord, Har, Har; they chant and meditate on the Lord God, the Master of the
Universe. O God, my Saving Grace, Lord and Master of servant Nanak, please save me,
the sinking stone. || 4 || 4 || KALYAAN, FOURTH MEHL: Only the Lord God knows
my innermost thoughts. If someone slanders the humble servant of the Lord, God does
not believe even a tiny bit of what he says. || 1 || Pause || So give up everything
else, and serve the Imperishable; The Lord God, our Lord and Master, is the Highest of
all. When you serve the Lord, Death cannot even see you. It comes and falls at the feet
of those who know the Lord. || 1 || Those whom my Lord and Master protects — a
balanced wisdom comes to their ears. No one can equal them; their devotional worship
is accepted by my God. || 2 || So behold the Wondrous and Amazing Play of the Lord.
In an instant, He distinguishes the genuine from the counterfeit. And that is why His
humble servant is in bliss. Those of pure heart meet together, while the evil ones regret
and repent. || 3 || Lord, You are the Great Giver, our All-powerful Lord and Master; O
Lord, I beg for only one gift from You. 

Lord, please bless servant Nanak with Your Grace, that Your Feet may abide forever
within my heart. || 4 || 5 || KALYAAN, FOURTH MEHL: O God, Treasure of Mercy,
please bless me, that I may sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. I always place my
hopes in You; O God, when will you take me in Your Embrace? || 1 || Pause || I am
a foolish and ignorant child; Father, please teach me! Your child makes mistakes again
and again, but still, You are pleased with him, O Father of the Universe. || 1 ||
Whatever You give me, O my Lord and Master — that is what I receive. There is no
other place where I can go. || 2 || Those devotees who are pleasing to the Lord —
the Lord is pleasing to them. Their light merges into the Light; the lights are merged
and blended together. || 3 || The Lord Himself has shown mercy; He lovingly attunes
me to Himself. Servant Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Door of the Lord, who
protects his honor. || 4 || 6 ||
