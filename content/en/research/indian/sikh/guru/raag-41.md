NAT, FIFTH MEHL: Whoever has You for support, has the fear of death removed; peace is found, and the disease of egotism is taken away. || 1 || Pause || The fire within is quenched, and one is satisfied through the Ambrosial Word of the Guru‟s Bani, as the
baby is satisfied by milk. The Saints are my mother, father and friends. 

The Saints are my help and support, and my brothers. || 1 || The doors of doubt are
thrown open, and I have met the Lord of the World; God‟s diamond has pierced the
diamond of my mind. Nanak blossoms forth in ecstasy, singing the Lord‟s Praises; my
Lord and Master is the ocean of virtue. || 2 || 2 || 3 || NAT, FIFTH MEHL: He
Himself saves His humble servant. Twenty-four hours a day, He dwells with His humble
servant; He never forgets him from His Mind. || 1 || Pause || The Lord does not
look at his color or form; He does not consider the ancestry of His slave. Granting His
Grace, the Lord blesses him with His Name, and embellishes him with intuitive ease. ||
1 || The ocean of fire is treacherous and difficult, but he is carried across. 

Seeing,
seeing Him, Nanak blossoms forth, over and over again, a sacrifice to Him. || 2 || 3 ||
4 || NAT, FIFTH MEHL: One who chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within his
mind — millions of sins are erased in an instant, and pain is relieved. || 1 || Pause ||
Seeking and searching, I have become detached; I have found the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy. Renouncing everything, I am lovingly focused on the One Lord. I
grab hold of the feet of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Whoever chants His Name is
liberated; whoever listens to it is saved, as is anyone who seeks His Sanctuary.
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on God the Lord and Master, says Nanak, I am
in ecstasy! || 2 || 4 || 5 || NAT, FIFTH MEHL: I am in love with Your Lotus Feet. O
Lord, ocean of peace, please bless me with the supreme status. || 1 || Pause || He
has inspired His humble servant to grasp the hem of His robe; his mind is pierced
through with the intoxication of divine love. Singing His Praises, love wells up within the
devotee, and the trap of Maya is broken. || 1 || The Lord, the ocean of mercy, is allpervading, permeating everywhere; I do not see any other at all. He has united slave Nanak with Himself; His Love never diminishes. || 2 || 5 || 6 || NAT, FIFTH MEHL: O
my mind, chant, and meditate on the Lord. I shall never forget Him from my mind;
twenty-four hours a day, I sing His Glorious Praises. || 1 || Pause || I take my daily
cleansing bath in the dust of the feet of the Holy, and I am rid of all my sinful residues
and mistakes. The Lord, the ocean of mercy, is all-pervading, permeating everywhere;
He is seen to be contained in each and every heart. || 1 || Hundreds of thousands
and millions of meditations, austerities and worships are not equal to remembering the
Lord in meditation. With his palms pressed together, Nanak begs for this blessing, that
he may become the slave of the slaves of Your slaves. || 2 || 6 || 7 || NAT, FIFTH
MEHL: The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is everything for me. Granting
His Grace, He has led me to join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; the True
Guru has granted this gift. || 1 || Pause || Sing the Kirtan, the Praises of the Lord,
the Giver of peace, the Destroyer of pain; He shall bless you with perfect spiritual
wisdom. Sexual desire, anger and greed shall be shattered and destroyed, and your
foolish ego will be dispelled. || 1 || What Glorious Virtues of Yours should I chant? O
God, You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. I seek the Sanctuary of Your
Lotus Feet, O Lord, ocean of peace; Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. || 2 || 7 || 8 || 

NAT, FIFTH MEHL: I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the Guru, the Lord of the World. || 1
|| Pause || I am unworthy; You are the Perfect Giver. You are the Merciful Master of
the meek. || 1 || While standing up and sitting down, while sleeping and awake, You
are my soul, my breath of life, my wealth and property. || 2 || Within my mind there
is such a great thirst for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. Nanak is enraptured with
Your Glance of Grace. || 3 || 8 || 9 ||
NAT PARTAAL, FIFTH MEHL:

Is there any friend or companion of mine, who will constantly share the Lord‟s Name
with me? Will he rid me of my pains and evil tendencies? I would surrender my mind,
body, consciousness and everything. || 1 || Pause || How rare is that one whom the
Lord makes His own, and whose mind is sewn into the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. Granting His
Grace, the Lord blesses him with His Praise. || 1 || Vibrating, meditating on the Lord,
he is victorious in this precious human life, and millions of sinners are sanctified. Slave
Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. || 2 || 1 || 10 || 19 ||
NAT ASHTAPADEES, FOURTH MEHL:

O Lord, Your Name is the support of my mind and body. I cannot survive for a moment,
even for an instant, without serving You. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I dwell upon
the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || Within my mind, I meditate on the
Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har, Har. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is so dear to me. When
God, my Lord and Master, became merciful to me the meek one, I was exalted by the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 1 || Almighty Lord, Slayer of demons, Life of the
World, my Lord and Master, inaccessible and infinite: I offer this one prayer to the
Guru, to bless me, that I may wash the feet of the Holy. || 2 || The thousands of
eyes are the eyes of God; the One God, the Primal Being, remains unattached. The One
God, our Lord and Master, has thousands of forms; God alone, through the Guru‟s
Teachings, saves us. || 3 || Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I have been blessed with
the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I have enshrined within my heart the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. The sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, is so very sweet; like the mute, I
taste its sweetness, but I cannot describe it at all. || 4 || The tongue savors the
bland, insipid taste of the love of duality, greed and corruption. The Gurmukh tastes the
flavor of the Lord‟s Name, and all other tastes and flavors are forgotten. || 5 ||
Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I have obtained the wealth of the Lord‟s Name; hearing
it, and chanting it, sins are eradicated. The Messenger of Death and the Righteous
Judge of Dharma do not even approach the beloved servant of my Lord and Master. ||
6 || With as many breaths as I have, I chant the Naam, under Guru‟s Instructions.
Each and every breath which escapes me without the Naam — that breath is useless
and corrupt. || 7 || Please grant Your Grace; I am meek; I seek Your Sanctuary, God. 

Unite me with Your beloved, humble servants. Nanak, the slave of Your slaves, says, I
am the water-carrier of Your slaves. || 8 || 1 || NAT, FOURTH MEHL: O Lord, I am
an unworthy stone. The Merciful Lord, in His Mercy, has led me to meet the Guru;
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, this stone is carried across. || 1 || Pause ||
The True Guru has implanted within me the exceedingly sweet Naam, the Name of the
Lord; it is like the most fragrant sandalwood. Through the Name, my awareness
extends in the ten directions; the fragrance of the fragrant Lord permeates the air. || 1
|| Your unlimited sermon is the most sweet sermon; I contemplate the most Sublime
Word of the Guru. Singing, singing, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; singing His
Glorious Praises, the Guru saves me. || 2 || The Guru is wise and clear; the Guru
looks upon all alike. Meeting with Him, doubt and skepticism are removed. Meeting with
the True Guru, I have obtained the supreme status. I am a sacrifice to the True Guru.
|| 3 || Practicing hypocrisy and deception, people wander around in confusion. Greed
and hypocrisy are evils in this world. In this world and the next, they are miserable; the
Messenger of Death hovers over their heads, and strikes them down. || 4 || At the
break of day, they take care of their affairs, and the poisonous entanglements of Maya.
When night falls, they enter the land of dreams, and even in dreams, they take care of
their corruptions and pains. || 5 || Taking a barren field, they plant falsehood; they
shall harvest only falsehood. The materialistic people shall all remain hungry; the brutal
Messenger of Death stands waiting at their door. || 6 || The self-willed manmukh has
accumulated a tremendous load of debt in sin; only by contemplating the Word of the
Shabad, can this debt be paid off. As much debt and as many creditors as there are, the
Lord makes them into servants, who fall at his feet. || 7 || All the beings which the
Lord of the Universe created — He puts the rings through their noses, and leads them
all along. O Nanak, as God drives us on, so do we follow; it is all the Will of the Beloved
Lord. || 8 || 2 || NAT, FOURTH MEHL: The Lord has bathed me in the pool of
Ambrosial Nectar. The spiritual wisdom of the True Guru is the most excellent cleansing
bath; bathing in it, the filthy residues of sins are washed away. || 1 || Pause || The
virtues of the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, are so very great. Even the prostitute was
saved, by teaching the parrot to speak the Lord‟s Name. Krishna was pleased, and so
he touched the hunch-back Kubija, and she was transported to the heavens. || 1 ||
Ajaamal loved his son Naaraayan, and called out his name. His loving devotion pleased
my Lord and Master, who struck down and drove off the Messengers of Death. || 2 ||
The mortal speaks and by speaking, makes the people listen; but he does not reflect
upon what he himself says. But when he joins the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
he is confirmed in his faith, and he is saved by the Name of the Lord. || 3 || As long
as his soul and body are healthy and strong, he does not remember the Lord at all. But
when his home and mansion catch fire, then, he wants to dig the well to draw water. ||
4 || O mind, do not join with the faithless cynic, who has forgotten the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. The word of the faithless cynic stings like a scorpion; leave the faithless
cynic far, far behind. 

|| 5 || Fall in love, fall deeply in love with the Lord; clinging to the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, you will be exalted and embellished. Those who accept the Word
of the Guru as True, totally True, are very dear to my Lord and Master. || 6 ||
Because of actions committed in past lives, one comes to love the Name of the Lord,
Har, Har, Har. By Guru‟s Grace, you shall obtain the ambrosial essence; sing of this
essence, and reflect upon this essence. || 7 || O Lord, Har, Har, all forms and colors
are Yours; O my Beloved, my deep crimson ruby. Only that color which You impart,
Lord, exists; O Nanak, what can the poor wretched being do? || 8 || 3 || NAT,
FOURTH MEHL: In the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord God saves and protects us, as
He protected the elephant, when the crocodile seized it and pulled it into the water; He
lifted him up and pulled him out. || 1 || Pause || God‟s servants are sublime and
exalted; they enshrine faith for Him in their minds. Faith and devotion are pleasing to
my God‟s Mind; He saves the honor of His humble servants. || 1 || The servant of the
Lord, Har, Har, is committed to His service; He sees God pervading the entire expanse
of the universe. He sees the One and only Primal Lord God, who blesses all with His
Glance of Grace. || 2 || God, our Lord and Master, is permeating and pervading all
places; He takes care of the whole world as His slave. The Merciful Lord Himself
mercifully gives His gifts, even to worms in stones. || 3 || Within the deer is the
heavy fragrance of musk, but he is confused and deluded, and he shakes his horns
looking for it. Wandering, rambling and roaming through the forests and woods, I
exhausted myself, and then in my own home, the Perfect Guru saved me. || 4 || The
Word, the Bani is Guru, and Guru is the Bani. Within the Bani, the Ambrosial Nectar is
contained. If His humble servant believes, and acts according to the Words of the
Guru‟s Bani, then the Guru, in person, emancipates him. || 5 || All is God, and God is
the whole expanse; man eats what he has planted. When Dhrishtabudhi tormented the
humble devotee Chandrahaans, he only set his own house on fire. || 6 || God‟s
humble servant longs for Him within his heart; God watches over each breath of His
humble servant. Mercifully, mercifully, He implants devotion within his humble servant;
for his sake, God saves the whole world. || 7 || God, our Lord and Master, is Himself
by Himself; God Himself embellishes the universe. O servant Nanak, He Himself is allpervading; in His Mercy, He Himself emancipates all. || 8 || 4 || NAT, FOURTH
MEHL: Grant Your Grace, Lord, and save me, as You saved Dropadi from shame when
she was seized and brought before the court by the evil villians. || 1 || Pause ||
Bless me with Your Grace — I am just a humble beggar of Yours; I beg for a single
blessing, O my Beloved. I long constantly for the True Guru. Lead me to meet the Guru,
O Lord, that I may be exalted and embellished. || 1 || The actions of the faithless
cynic are like the churning of water; he churns, constantly churning only water. Joining
the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, the supreme status is obtained; the butter is
produced, and eaten with delight. || 2 || He may constantly and continually wash his
body; he may constantly rub, clean and polish his body. 

But if the Word of my True Guru is not pleasing to his mind, then all his preparations
and beautiful decorations are useless. || 3 || Walk playfully and carefree, O my
friends and companions; cherish the Glorious Virtues of my Lord and Master. To serve,
as Gurmukh, is pleasing to my God. Through the True Guru, the unknown is known. ||
4 || Women and men, all the men and women, all came from the One Primal Lord
God. My mind loves the dust of the feet of the humble; the Lord emancipates those
who meet with the Lord‟s humble servants. || 5 || From village to village, throughout
all the cities I wandered; and then, inspired by the Lord‟s humble servants, I found Him
deep within the nucleus of my heart. Faith and longing have welled up within me, and I
have been blended with the Lord; the Guru, the Guru, has saved me. || 6 || The
thread of my breath has been made totally sublime and pure; I contemplate the
Shabad, the Word of the True Guru. I came back to the home of my own inner self;
drinking in the ambrosial essence, I see the world, without my eyes. || 7 || I cannot
describe Your Glorious Virtues, Lord; You are the temple, and I am just a tiny worm.
Bless Nanak with Your Mercy, and unite him with the Guru; meditating on my Lord, my
mind is comforted and consoled. || 8 || 5 || NAT, FOURTH MEHL: O my mind,
vibrate, meditate on the inaccessible and infinite Lord and Master. I am such a great
sinner; I am so unworthy. And yet the Guru, in His Mercy, has saved me. || Pause ||
I have found the Holy Person, the Holy and humble servant of the Lord; I offer a prayer
to Him, my Beloved Guru. Please, bless me with the wealth, the capital of the Lord‟s
Name, and take away all my hunger and thirst. || 1 || The moth, the deer, the
bumble bee, the elephant and the fish are ruined, each by the one passion that controls
them. The five powerful demons are in the body; the Guru, the True Guru turns out
these sins. || 2 || I searched and searched through the Shaastras and the Vedas;
Naarad the silent sage proclaimed these words as well. Chanting the Lord‟s Name,
salvation is attained; the Guru saves those in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. ||
3 || In love with the Beloved Lord God, one looks at Him as the lotus looks at the sun.
The peacock dances on the mountain, when the clouds hang low and heavy. || 4 ||
The faithless cyinc may be totally drenched with ambrosial nectar, but even so, all his
branches and flowers are filled with venom. The more one bows down in humility
before the faithless cyinc, the more he provokes, and stabs, and spits out his poison. ||
5 || Remain with the Holy man, the Saint of the Saints, who chants the Lord‟s Praises
for the benefit of all. Meeting the Saint of Saints, the mind blossoms forth, like the
lotus, exalted by obtaining the water. || 6 || The waves of greed are like mad dogs
with rabies. Their madness ruins everything. When the news reached the Court of my
Lord and Master, the Guru took up the sword of spiritual wisdom, and killed them. || 7
|| Save me, save me, save me, O my God; shower me with Your Mercy, and save me!
O Nanak, I have no other support; the Guru, the True Guru, has saved me. || 8 || 6 ||
