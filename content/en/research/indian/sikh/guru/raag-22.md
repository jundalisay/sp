RAAG BIHAAGRAA, CHAU-PADAS, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:


To associate with evil demons is to live with snakes; I tried all sorts of things. || 1 ||
Then, I chanted the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and I found intuitive peace. || 1 || Pause
|| Emotional attachment is worthless and false. I claimed for myself the possessions of
others, sucked into the whirlpool of reincarnation. || 2 || All are travellers, who have
gathered under the tree, held by their many bonds. || 3 || The Company of the Holy is
stable and permanent; there, the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises are sung. Nanak seeks
Sanctuary. || 4 || 1 ||

RAAG BIHAAGRAA, NINTH MEHL:
No one knows the state of the Lord. The Yogis, the celibates, the austere penitents, and all
sorts of clever people have failed. || 1 || Pause || In an instant, He changes the beggar
into a king, and the king into a beggar. He fills what is empty, and empties what is full.
Such are His ways. || 1 || He Himself spread out the expanse of His Maya, and He
Himself beholds it. He assumes so many forms, and plays so many games, and yet He
remains distinct and detached from it all. || 2 || Incalculable, infinite, incomprehensible
and immaculate, He has misled the whole world. So give up all your doubts; prays Nanak,
O mortal, focus your consciousness on His Feet. || 3 || 1 || 2 ||
RAAG BIHAAGRAA, CHHANT, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul; to the Gurmukh, the Name of the
Lord is priceless. My mind is pierced by the sublime essence of the Lord‟s Name. The Lord
is dear to my mind. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 538 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
My mind is washed clean by the sublime essence of the Lord‟s Name. Through the
Guru‟s Teachings, hold the mind steady, O my soul; do not let it wander anywhere. One
who chants the Bani of the Praises of the Lord God, O Nanak, obtains the fruits of his
mind‟s desires. || 1 || Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Nectar abides within the
mind, O my soul; with your mouth, chants the words of Ambrosia. The Words of the
devotees are Ambrosial Nectar, O my soul; hear them in the mind, and embrace loving
affection for the Lord. Separated for so very long, I have found the Lord God, intuitively
hugged in His Loving Embrace. Servant Nanak‟s mind is filled with bliss, O my soul,
vibrating the unstruck Sound-current of the Shabad. || 2 || If only my friends and
companions would come and unite me with my Lord God, O my soul. I dedicate my
mind to one who recites the sermon of my Lord God, O my soul. As Gurmukh, worship
the Lord in adoration forever, O my soul, and you shall obtain the fruits of your mind‟s
desires. O Nanak, hurry to the Lord‟s Sanctuary, O my soul; those who meditate on the
Lord‟s Name are very fortunate. || 3 || By His Grace, God comes to meet us, O my
soul; through the Guru‟s Teachings, His Name is revealed. Without the Lord, I am so
sad, O my soul — as sad as the lotus without water. The Perfect Guru, O my soul, has
united me with the Lord, my best Friend, the Lord God. Blessed, blessed is the Guru,
who has shown me the Lord, O my soul; servant Nanak blossoms forth in the Name of
the Lord. || 4 || 1 || RAAG BIHAAGRAA, FOURTH MEHL: The Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, is Ambrosial Nectar, O my soul; through the Guru‟s Teachings, this Nectar is
obtained. Egotism and Maya are poison, O my soul; through the Ambrosial Nectar of the
Name, this poison is eradicated. The dry mind is rejuvenated, O my soul, meditating on
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Lord has given the pre-ordained blessing of high
destiny, O my soul; servant Nanak merges in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 ||
My mind is attached to the Lord, O my soul, like the infant, sucking his mother‟s milk.
Without the Lord, I find no peace, O my soul, like the song-bird, crying without the raindrops. Go, and seek the Sanctuary of the True Guru, O my soul; He shall tell you of the
Glorious Virtues of the Lord God. Servant Nanak has merged with the Lord, O my soul;
the harmonic vibrations of the Shabad resound within the heart. || 2 || The self-willed
manmukhs are consigned to separation by their own egotism, O my soul; bound to
poison, they are burnt by egotism. Like the pigeon, which itself falls into the trap, O my
soul, all the self-willed manmukhs fall under the influence of death. Those who focus
their consciousness on emotional attachment to Maya, O my soul — those self-willed
manmukhs are foolish demons. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 539 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Lord‟s humble servants beg and implore Him, and seek His Sanctuary, O my soul;
Guru Nanak becomes their Divine Protector. || 3 || The Lord‟s humble servants are
saved, through the Love of the Lord, O my soul; by their primal good destiny, they find
the Lord. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is the boat, O my soul, and the Guru is the
Boatman. Through the Word of the Shabad, He ferries us across. The Primal Lord God,
Har, Har, is very kind, O my soul; through the Guru, the True Guru, He seems so sweet.
Grant Your Grace, and hear my prayer, O Lord, Har, Har; servant Nanak meditates on
the Naam. || 4 || 2 || BIHAAGRAA, FOURTH MEHL: In this world, the best
occupation is to sing the Praises of the Naam, O my soul. Singing the Praises of the
Lord, the Lord is enshrined in the mind. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is immaculate
and pure, O my soul. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, one is saved. All sins,
errors and sorrows are cut away, O my soul; the Gurmukh washes off this filth with the
Naam, the Name of the Lord. By great good fortune, servant Nanak meditates on the
Lord; even fools and idiots like me have been saved. || 1 || Those who meditate on
the Name of the Lord, O my soul, overpower the five passions. The nine treasures of
the Naam are within, O my soul; the Guru, the True Guru, has revealed the Unseen.
The Guru has fulfilled my hopes and desires, O my soul; meeting the Lord, all hunger is
satisfied. O servant Nanak, he alone sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, O my soul,
upon whose forehead the Lord God has inscribed such pre-ordained destiny. || 2 || I
am a deceitful sinner, O my soul; I cheat others, and rob and plunder their wealth. But
by great good fortune, I have found the Guru, O my soul; through the Perfect Guru, I
have found the way to salvation. The Guru has poured the Ambrosial Nectar of the
Lord‟s Name into my mouth, O my soul, and now, my dead soul has come back to life.
O servant Nanak, those who meet the True Guru, O my soul, have all of their pains
taken away. || 3 || The Name of the Lord is the most sublime, O my soul; chanting it,
one‟s sins are washed away. The Guru, the Lord, has purified even the sinners, O my
soul; now, they are famous and respected in the four directions, throughout the four
ages. The filth of egotism is totally wiped away, O my soul, by bathing in the Ambrosial
Pool of the Lord‟s Name. Even criminals and sinners are saved, O my soul, if they are
attuned to the Lord‟s Name, even for an instant, O servant Nanak. || 4 || 3 ||
BIHAAGRAA, FOURTH MEHL: I am a sacrifice, O my soul, to those who take the
Support of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Guru, the True Guru, implanted the
Name within me, O my soul; He has carried me across the terrifying world-ocean of
poison. Those who have single-mindedly meditated on the Lord, O my soul — I
proclaim the victory of those saintly beings. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 540 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Nanak has found peace, meditating on the Lord, O my soul; the Lord is the Destroyer of
all pain. || 1 || Blessed, blessed is that tongue, O my soul, which sings the Glorious
Praises of the Lord God. Sublime and splendid are those ears, O my soul, which listen to
the Kirtan of the Your Praises, O Lord. Sublime, pure and sacred is that head, O my
soul, which falls at the Guru‟s feet. Nanak is a sacrifice to the Guru, O my soul, who has
placed the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in my consciousness. || 2 || Blessed and
approved are those eyes, O my soul, which gaze upon the Holy True Guru. Sacred and
pure are those hands, O my soul, which write the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. I
worship continually the feet of that humble being, O my soul, who walks on the Path of
Dharma, the path of righteousness. Nanak is a sacrifice to those, O my soul, who hear
of the Lord, and believe in the Lord‟s Name. || 3 || The earth, the nether regions of
the underworld, and the Akaashic ethers, O my soul, all meditate on the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. Wind, water and fire, O my soul, continually sing the Praises of the Lord,
Har, Har, Har. The woods, the meadows and the whole creation, O my soul, meditate
with their mouths on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. O Nanak, one who, as Gurmukh,
focuses his consciousness on the Lord‟s devotional worship, O my soul, is robed in
honor in the Court of the Lord. || 4 || 4 || BIHAAGRAA, FOURTH MEHL: Those who
do not remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul — those self-willed
manmukhs are foolish and ignorant. Those who attach their consciousness to emotional
attachment and Maya, O my soul, depart regretfully in the end. They find no place of
rest in the Court of the Lord, O my soul; those self-willed manmukhs are lured by sin. O
servant Nanak, those who meet the Guru are saved, O my soul; chanting the Name of
the Lord, they are absorbed in the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Go, everyone, and meet
the True Guru, O my soul; He implants the Name of the Lord, Har, har, within. Do not
hesitate for an instant — meditate on the Lord, O my soul; who knows whether or not
you shall draw another breath? That time, that moment, that instant, that second is so
fruitful, O my soul, when the Lord comes into my consciousness. Servant Nanak has
meditated on the Naam, O my soul, and now, the Messenger of Death does not even
approach him. || 2 || The Lord continually watches and hears everything, O my soul;
only those who commit sins are afraid. Those whose hearts are pure within, O my soul,
cast off all their fears. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 541 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Those who have faith in the Name of the Fearless Lord, O my soul — all their enemies
and attackers speak against them in vain. Nanak serves the Perfect Guru, O my soul,
who causes all to fall at His feet. || 3 || So serve such a Lord continuously, O my soul,
who is the Great Lord and Master of all. Those who single-mindedly worship Him in
adoration, O my soul, are not subservient to anyone. Serving the Guru, I have obtained
the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, O my soul; all the slanderers and trouble-makers
bark in vain. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, O my soul; such is the preordained destiny which the Lord has written on his forehead. || 4 || 5 || BIHAAGRAA,
FOURTH MEHL: All beings are Yours — You permeate them all, O my Lord God; You
know what they do in their hearts. The Lord is with them, inwardly and outwardly, O
my soul; He sees everything, but they deny the Lord in their minds. The Lord is far
away from the self-willed manmukhs, O my soul; all their efforts are in vain. Servant
Nanak, as Gurmukh, meditates, O my soul, and comes to behold the Lord ever-present.
|| 1 || They are devotees, and they are selfless servants, O my soul, who are pleasing
to the Mind of my God. They are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord, O my soul;
night and day, they remain absorbed in the True One. In their company, one‟s filth is
washed away, O my soul; attuned to the Lord‟s Love, one comes to bear the Mark of
His Grace. Nanak prays to God, O my soul; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, he is satisfied. || 2 || O tongue, chant and meditate on the Lord of the
Universe; O my soul, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, your thirst shall be
quenched. One unto whom my Supreme Lord God shows Mercy, O my soul, enshrines
the Name in his mind. One who meets the Perfect True Guru, O my soul, obtains the
treasure of the Lord‟s wealth. By great good fortune, one joins the Sangat, the Holy
Congregation, O my soul. O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 3 || In all
places and interspaces, O my soul, the Supreme Lord God, the Great Giver, is
pervading. His limits cannot be found, O my soul; He is the Perfect Architect of Destiny.
He cherishes all beings, O my soul, as the mother and father cherish their child. By
thousands of clever tricks, He cannot be obtained, O my soul; servant Nanak, as
Gurmukh, has come to know the Lord. || 4 || 6 || First Set of Six ||
BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT, FIRST HOUSE:

I have seen a miracle of the Lord, O my dear beloveds — whatever He does is righteous
and just. The Lord has fashioned this beautiful arena, O my dear beloveds, where all
come and go. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 542 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The One who fashioned the world causes them to come and go. Some meet the True
Guru — the Lord invites them into the Mansion of His Presence; others wander around,
deluded by doubt. You alone know Your limits; You are contained in all. Nanak speaks
the Truth — listen, Saints: the Lord dispenses even-handed justice. || 1 || Come and
join with me, O my beautiful dear beloveds; let‟s worship the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har. Let‟s serve the Perfect True Guru, O my dear beloveds, and clear away the Path of
Death. Having cleared the treacherous path, as Gurmukhs we shall obtain honor in the
Court of the Lord. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, lovingly focus their
attention on the Lord, night and day. Egotism, possessiveness and emotional
attachment are eradicated when one joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
Says servant Nanak, one who contemplates the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is
liberated. || 2 || Let‟s join hands, O Saints; let‟s come together, O my dear beloveds,
and worship the Imperishable, Almighty Lord God. I sought Him through uncounted
forms of adoration, O my dear beloveds; now, I dedicate all my mind and body to the
Lord. Mind, body and wealth all belong to God; so what can anyone offer Him in
worship? He alone merges in the lap of God, unto whom the Merciful Lord and Master
becomes kind. One who has such pre-ordained destiny written on his forehead, comes
to bear love for the Guru. Says servant Nanak, join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, and worship the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || I wandered around,
searching in the ten directions, O my dear beloveds, but I came to find the Lord in the
home of my own being. The Dear Lord has fashioned the body as the temple of the
Lord, O my dear beloveds; the Lord continues to dwell there. The Lord and Master
Himself is pervading everywhere; He is revealed to the Gurmukh. Darkness is dispelled,
and pain is removed, when the sublime essence of the Lord‟s Ambrosial Nectar trickles
down. Wherever I look, the Lord and Master is there. The Supreme Lord God is
everywhere. Says servant Nanak, meeting the True Guru, I have found the Lord within
the home of my own being. || 4 || 1 || RAAG BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL: He is so
dear to me; He fascinates my mind; the Lord is the ornament of my heart, the support
of the breath of life. The Glory of the Beloved, the Merciful Lord of the Universe, is
beautiful; He is infinite and unlimited. O Compassionate Lord of the World, Beloved Lord
of the Universe, please join with Your humble soul-bride. My eyes long for the Blessed
Vision of Your Darshan; the night passes, but I cannot sleep. I have applied the healing
ointment of spiritual wisdom to my eyes; the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is my food.
These are all my decorations. Prays Nanak, meditate on the Saint, that he may unite us
with our Husband Lord. || 1 || I endure thousands of reprimands, but still, my Lord
has not met with me. I try to meet with my Lord, but nothing works. My consciousness
is unsteady, and my wealth is unstable; without my Beloved, I cannot be consoled. 


Food, drink and decorations are useless; without my Husband Lord, how can I live? I
yearn for Him, and desire Him night and day. I cannot live without Him, even for an
instant. Prays Nanak: O Saint, I am Your slave; by Your Grace, I meet my Husband
Lord. || 2 || I share a bed with my Beloved, but I do not behold the Blessed Vision of
His Darshan. I have countless demerits — how can my Husband Lord call me to the
Mansion of His Presence? The worthless, dishonored and discarded soul-bride prays:
“Meet with me, God, O treasure of mercy.” The wall of doubt has been shattered, and
now I sleep in peace, beholding God, the Lord of the nine treasures, even for an
instant. If only I could come into the Mansion of my Beloved Lord‟s Presence. Joining
with Him, I sing the songs of joy. Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints;
please, reveal to me the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. || 3 || By the Grace of the
Saints, I have found the Lord, Har, Har. My desires are fulfilled, and my mind is at
peace; the fire within has been quenched. Fruitful is that day and beauteous is that
night, and countless are the joys, celebrations and pleasures. The Lord of the Universe,
the Beloved Lord of the World, has been revealed. With what tongue can I speak of His
Glory? Doubt, greed, emotional attachment and corruption are subdued; joining with
my companions, I sing the songs of joy. Prays Nanak, I meditate on the Saint, who has
led me to union with the Lord, Har, Har. || 4 || 2 || BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL:
Grant Your Grace, O Guru, O Perfect Supreme Lord God, that I might chant the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, night and day. I speak the Ambrosial Words of the Guru‟s Bani,
praising the Lord. Your Will seems so sweet to me, Lord. Show kindness and
compassion, O Lord of the Word, Lord of the Universe; without You, I have no other at
all. Almighty, sublime, infinite and perfect Lord — my soul, body, wealth and mind are
Yours. I am foolish, stupid, masterless, fickle, powerless, lowly and ignorant. Prays
Nanak, I seek Your Sanctuary — please save me from coming and going in
reincarnation. || 1 || In the Sanctuary of the Holy, I have found the Dear Lord; I
constantly sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Applying the dust of the devotees to
the mind and body, O Dear Lord, all sinners are sanctified. The sinners are sanctified in
the company of those who have met the Primal Lord of Destiny. Attuned to the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, they are given the gift of the life of the soul; their gifts increase
day by day. Wealth, the supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhas, and the nine
treasures come to those who meditate on the Lord, and conquer their own soul. Prays
Nanak, it is only by great good fortune that the Holy, the Lord‟s companions are found,
O friends. || 2 || Those who deal in Truth, O Dear Lord, are the perfect bankers. They
possess the great treasure, O Dear Lord, and they earn the profit of the Lord‟s Praise.
Sexual desire, anger and greed do not cling to those who are attuned to God. They
know the One, and they believe in the One; they are intoxicated with the Lord‟s Love.
They fall at the Feet of the Saints, and seek their Sanctuary; their minds are filled with
joy. Prays Nanak, those who have the Naam in their laps are the true bankers. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 544 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, meditate in remembrance on that Dear Lord, who supports all by His Power.
The Gurmukhs do not forget the Dear Lord, the Primal Creator Lord, from their minds.
Pain, disease and fear do not cling to those who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. By the
Grace of the Saints, they cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and obtain their preordained destiny. They are congratulated and applauded, and their minds are at peace;
they meet the Infinite Lord God. Prays Nanak, meditating in remembrance on the Lord,
Har, Har, my desires are fulfilled. || 4 || 3 ||
BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

O peaceful night, grow longer — I have enshrined love for my Beloved. O painful sleep,
grow shorter, so that I may constantly touch His Feet. I long for the dust of His Feet,
and always beg for His Name; for His Love, I have renounced the world. I am imbued
with the Love of my Beloved, intuitively intoxicated with it; I have forsaken my terrible
evil-mindedness. He has taken me by the arm; I am drenched in His Love. I have met
my Beloved on the Path of Truth. Prays Nanak, please shower me with Your Mercy, that
I may remain attached to Your Feet. || 1 || O my friends and companions, let us
remain attached to the Feet of God. My mind is filled with a great love for my Beloved; I
beg for the Lord‟s devotional worship. The Lord‟s devotional worship is obtained by
meditating on God. Let us go and meet the humble servants of the Lord. Renounce
pride, emotional attachment and corruption, and dedicate this body, wealth and mind to
Him. The Lord God is great, perfect, glorious, absolutely perfect; meeting the Lord, Har,
Har, the wall of doubt is torn down. Prays Nanak, hear these teachings, O friends —
chant the Lord‟s Name constantly, continually, over and over again. || 2 || The Lord‟s
bride is a happy wife; she enjoys all pleasures. She does not sit around like a widow,
because the Lord God lives forever. She does not suffer pain — she meditates on God.
She is blessed, and very fortunate. She sleeps in peaceful ease, her sins are eradicated,
and she wakes to the joy and love of the Naam. She remains absorbed in her Beloved
— the Lord‟s Name is her ornament. The Words of her Beloved are sweet and pleasing
to her. Prays Nanak, I have obtained my mind‟s desires; I have met my eternal
Husband Lord. || 3 || The songs of bliss resound, and millions of pleasures are found
in that house; the mind and body are permeated by God, the Lord of supreme bliss. My
Husband Lord is infinite and merciful; He is the Supreme Lord, the Lord of the Universe,
the Saving Grace of sinners. God, the Giver of mercy, the Lord, the Destroyer of pride,
carries us across the terrifying world-ocean of poison. The Lord lovingly embraces
whoever comes to His Sanctuary — this is the way of the Lord and Master. Prays
Nanak, I have met my Husband Lord, who plays with me forever. || 4 || 1 || 4 ||
BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord‟s Feet are the Pools of Ambrosial Nectar; dwell
there, O my mind. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 545 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Take your cleansing bath in the Ambrosial Pool of the Lord, and all your sins shall be
wiped away, O my mind. Take your cleansing in the Lord of the Universe forever, O
friends, and the pain of darkness shall be dispelled. Birth and death shall not hold you,
and the noose of Death shall be cut away. So join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, and be imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord; there, your hopes shall
be fulfilled. Prays Nanak, shower Your Mercy upon me, Lord, that I might dwell at Your
Lotus Feet. || 1 || There is bliss and ecstasy there always, and the unstruck celestial
melody resounds there. Meeting together, the humble Saints sing God‟s Praises, and
celebrate His Victory. Meeting together, the Saints sing the Praises of the Lord and
Master; they are pleasing to the Lord, and drenched with the sublime essence of His
love and affection. They earn the profit of the Lord, eradicate self-conceit, and meet
Him, from whom they were separated for so long. Taking them by the arm, He makes
them His own; God, the One, Inaccessible and Infinite, bestows His kindness. Prays
Nanak, forever immaculate are those who vibrate and resonate with the True Word of
the Shabad. || 2 || Listen, O most fortunate ones, to the Ambrosial Bani, the Word of
the Lord. Only one who has such pre-ordained karma, has it enter into the heart. The
Unspoken Speech is known only by those unto whom God grants His Grace. They
become immortal, and shall not die again; their troubles, disputes and pains are
dispelled. They find the Sanctuary of the Lord; they do not forsake Him, and do not
leave. God‟s Love is pleasing to their minds and bodies. Prays Nanak, sing forever the
Sacred Ambrosial Bani of the Word. || 3 || My mind and body are intoxicated — I
cannot describe it. From Him I originated, and into Him I shall merge once again. I am
absorbed into God‟s Light, through and through, like water merging into water. The One
permeates the water, the land and the sky — I do not see any other. He is totally
permeating the forests, the fields and the three worlds. I cannot express His worth.
Prays Nanak, He Himself knows — the One who created this creation. || 4 || 2 || 5 ||
BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL: The Saints go around, searching for God, the support of
their breath of life. They lose the strength of their bodies, if they do not merge with
their Beloved Lord. O God, my Beloved, merge with me — bless me with Your kindness;
be kind, and attach me to the hem of Your robe. Bless me with Your Name, that I may
chant it, O Lord and Master; beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live. He is
almighty, perfect, eternal and unchanging, exalted, unapproachable and infinite. Prays
Nanak, grant Your Grace, O Beloved of my breath of life, that I may merge with You. ||
1 || I have practiced chanting, intensive meditation and fasting to see Your Feet, Lord.
But still, the burning fire is not quenched, without the Sanctuary of the Lord and
Master. O God, I seek Your Sanctuary — please, cut away my bonds and carry me
across the world-ocean. I am helpless, forlorn and worthless — I know nothing at all;
please do not count up my merits and demerits. The Lord is Merciful to the meek, the
Sustainer of the world, Beloved, Almighty Cause of causes. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 546 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Nanak, the song-bird, begs for the rain-drop of the Lord‟s Name; meditating on the Feet
of the Lord, Har, Har, he lives. || 2 || Drink in the Ambrosial Nectar from the sacred
pool, the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. In the Society of the Saints, one meets the Lord;
meditating on Him, one‟s affairs are resolved. God accomplishes everything; He is the
Destroyer of pain. Never forget Him from your mind, even for an instant. He is blissful,
night and day; He is forever True. All Glories are contained in the Lord in the Universe.
Incalculable, lofty and infinite is the Lord and Master. His dwelling is unapproachable.
Prays Nanak, my desires are fulfilled; I have met the Lord, the Greatest Lover. || 3 ||
The fruits of many millions of charitable feasts come to those who listen to and sing the
Lord‟s Praise. Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, all one‟s generations are carried
across. Chanting the Name of the Lord, the mortal being is beautified; what Praises of
His can I chant? I shall never forget the Lord; He is as dear as my breath of life. My
mind constantly yearns for the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Auspicious is that day,
when God, the lofty, inaccessible and infinite, hugs me close in His embrace. Prays
Nanak, everything is fruitful — I have met my supremely beloved Lord God. || 4 || 3 ||
6 || BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT: Why are you imbued with the love of
another? That path is very dangerous. You are committing sins — no one is your friend.
No one shall be your friend; you shall regret and repent forever. You have not chanted
with your tongue the Praises of the Lord of the World; when will these days come
again? The leaf, once separated from the branch, shall not join with it again; all alone, it
falls on its way to death. Prays Nanak, without the Lord‟s Name, the soul wanders in
suffering forever. || 1 || You are practicing deception secretly, but the Lord, the
Knower, knows all. When the Righteous Judge of Dharma reads your account, you shall
be squeezed like a sesame seed in the oil-press. For the actions you committed, you
shall suffer in pain, O mortal being; you shall be consigned to countless reincarnations.
Emotionally attached to Maya, the great enticer, you shall lose this jewel of human life.
Except for the Name of the One Lord, you are clever in everything else. Prays Nanak,
those who have such pre-ordained destiny are attracted to doubt and emotional
attachment. || 2 || No one advocates for the ungrateful person, who is separated
from the Lord. The hard-hearted Messengers of Death come and seize him. They seize
him, and lead him away, to pay for his evil deeds; he was imbued with Maya, the great
enticer. He was not Gurmukh — he did not chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the
Universe; and now, the hot irons are put to his chest. He is ruined by sexual desire,
anger and egotism; deprived of spiritual wisdom, he comes to regret. Prays Nanak, by
his cursed destiny he has gone astray; with his tongue, he does not chant the Name of
the Lord. || 3 || Without You, God, no one is our savior and protector. It is Your
Nature, Lord, to save the sinners. O Savior of sinners, I have entered Your Sanctuary, O
Lord and Master, Compassionate Ocean of Mercy. Please, save me from the deep, dark
pit, O Creator, Cherisher of all hearts. I seek Your Sanctuary; please, cut away these
heavy bonds, and give me the Support of the One Name. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 547 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Prays Nanak, please give me Your Hand and save me, O Lord of the Universe, Merciful
to the meek. || 4 || That day is judged to be fruitful, when I met with the Lord God.
Total happiness was revealed, and pain was taken far away. Intuitive peace and poise,
joy and eternal happiness come from constantly singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord
of the World. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I lovingly worship the
Lord; I shall not wander again in reincarnation. He has hugged me close in His Loving
Embrace, with intuitive ease, and the seed of my primal destiny has sprouted. Prays
Nanak, He Himself has met me; He shall never leave me again. || 5 || 4 || 7 ||
BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT: Listen to my prayer, O my Lord and Master. I
am filled with millions of sins, but still, I am Your slave. O Destroyer of pain, Bestower
of mercy, Fascinating Lord, Destroyer of sorrow and strife: I have come to Your
Sanctuary; please preserve my honor. You are in all, O Immaculate Lord. God hears
and beholds all; He is with us, the nearest of the near. O Lord and Master, hear Nanak‟s
prayer; please save the servants of Your household. || 1 || You are eternal and allpowerful; I am a mere beggar, Lord. I am intoxicated with emotional attachment to
Maya — save me, Lord! Bound down by greed, emotional attachment and corruption, I
have made all sorts of bad mistakes. The creator is detached, and free of
entanglement; one obtains the fruits of his own actions. Be kind to me, O Purifier of
sinners; I am so tired of wandering through reincarnation. Prays Nanak, I am the slave
of the Lord; God is the Support of my soul, and my breath of life. || 2 || You are
great and all-powerful; my understanding is shallow, O Lord. You cherish even those
who are ungrateful; Your Glance of Grace is perfect, Lord. Your wisdom is
unfathomable, O Infinite Creator. I am lowly — I know nothing at all. Rejecting the
jewel, I have saved the shell; I am a lowly, ignorant beast. I have gathered that fickle
wealth which will forsake me; I committed sins, over and over again. Nanak seeks Your
Sanctuary, Almighty Lord and Master; please, preserve my honor. || 3 || I was
separated from Him, and now, He has united me with Himself. In the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. Singing the Praises of the
Lord of the Universe, forever sublime, the blissful Lord is revealed to me. My bed is
adorned with God; my God has made me His own. Abandoning anxiety, I have become
carefree, and I shall not suffer in pain any more. Nanak lives by gazing upon the
Blessed Vision of His Darshan, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe,
the Ocean of excellence. || 4 || 5 || 8 || BIHAAGRAA, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT: O
you of righteous faith, chant the Lord‟s Name; why do you remain silent? with your
eyes, you have seen the treacherous ways of Maya. Nothing shall go along with you,
except the Name of the Lord of the Universe. Land and clothes, gold and silver — all of
these things are useless. Children, spouse and worldly honors, elephants, horses and
other corrupting influences shall not go with you. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 548 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Prays Nanak, without the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the whole world is
false. || 1 || O king, why are you asleep? Why don‟t you wake up to reality? It is
useless to cry and whine about Maya, but so many weep and wail. So many weep and
wail for Maya, the great enticer, but without the Name of the Lord, there is no peace.
Thousands of clever tricks and efforts will not succeed. They go wherever the Lord wills
them to go. In the beginning, in the end, and in the middle, He is all-pervading
everywhere; He is in each and every heart. Prays Nanak, those who join the Saadh
Sangat go to the house of the Lord with honor. || 2 || O king of the people, you know
your palaces and wise servants? You shall certainly have to separate from them; your
attachment to them will cause you to regret. Beholding the phantom city, you have
gone astray; how can you find stability now? Absorbed in things other than the Name of
the Lord, this human life is wasted in vain. Indulging in egotistical actions, your thirst is
not quenched. Your desires are not fulfilled, and you do not attain spiritual wisdom.
Prays Nanak, without the Name of the Lord, many have departed with regret. || 3 ||
Showering His blessings, the Lord has made me His own. Grasping my arm, He has
pulled me out of the mud, and blessed me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. Worshipping the Lord in the Saadh Sangat, all my sins and sufferings are burnt
away. This is the greatest religion, and the best act of charity; this alone shall go along
with you. My tongue chants in adoration the Name of the One Lord and Master; my
mind and body are drenched in the Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, whoever the Lord unites
with Himself, is filled with all virtues. || 4 || 6 || 9 ||

VAAR OF BIHAAGRAA, FOURTH MEHL:

SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: By serving the Guru, peace is obtained; do not search for
peace anywhere else. The mind is pierced by the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; it dwells
with the Lord forever. O Nanak, they alone obtain the Naam, whom the Lord beholds
with His Glance of Grace. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The treasure of God‟s Praise is such a
blessed gift; it is used and spent by those to whom the Lord gives it. Without the True
Guru, it does not come to hand; all have grown weary of performing religious rituals. O
Nanak, the self-willed manmukhs of the world lack this wealth; when they are hungry in
the next world, what will they have to eat there? || 2 || PAUREE: All are Yours —
You belong to all. You created all. You are pervading within all — all meditate on You.
You accept the devotional worship of those who are pleasing to Your Mind. Whatever
pleases the Lord God happens; all act as You cause them to act. Praise the Lord, the
greatest of all; He preserves the honor of the humble Saints. || 1 || SHALOK, THIRD
MEHL: O Nanak, the spiritually wise have conquered the world, but the world has
conquered everyone. Through the Name, their affairs are brought to perfection;
whatever will be, will be. Under Guru‟s Instruction, their minds are held steady; no one
can make them waver. 

The Lord makes His devotees His own, and resolves their affairs. The self-willed
manmukhs have been led astray from the very beginning; within them lurks greed,
avarice and egotism. Their nights and days pass in argument and conflict; they do not
contemplate the Word of the Shabad. The Creator has taken away their common sense
and understanding, and all their speech is corrupt. No matter what they are given, they
are not satisfied; within them is desire, and the great darkness of ignorance. O Nanak,
it is right to break with the self-willed manmukhs; to them, emotional attachment to
Maya is sweet. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: What can fear and skepticism do to those, who
have given their heads to the Creator, and to the True Guru? The Protector Himself has
protected their honor from the beginning of time. Meeting their Beloved, they find
peace; they contemplate the True Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, I serve the Giver of
peace; He Himself is the Assessor. || 2 || PAUREE: All beings and creatures are
Yours; You are the wealth of all. One unto whom You give, obtains everything; there is
no one else to rival You. You alone are the Great Giver of all; I offer my prayer to You,
Lord. One with whom You are pleased, is accepted by You; how blessed is such a
person! Your wondrous play is pervading everywhere. Pain and pleasure are with You.
|| 2 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The Gurmukhs are pleasing to the True Lord; they are
judged to be true in the True Court. The minds of such friends are filled with bliss, as
they contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. They enshrine the Shabad deep
within; their pain is dispelled, and the Creator blesses them with the Divine Light. O
Nanak, the Savior Lord shall save them, and shower them with His Mercy. || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: Serve the Guru, and wait upon Him; as you work, maintain the Fear of
God. As you serve Him, you will become like Him, if you walk in harmony with His Will.
O Nanak, He Himself is everything; there is no other place to go. || 2 || PAUREE:
You alone know Your greatness — there is no one else as great as You. If there were
some other rival as great as You, then I would speak of him. You alone are as great as
You are. One who serves You finds peace; who else can compare to You? You are allpowerful to destroy and create, O Great Giver; all stand begging before You, with their
palms pressed together. I see none as great as You, O Great Giver; You give in charity
to the beings of all the continents, worlds, solar systems, nether regions and universes.
|| 3 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O mind, you have no faith, and you have not
embraced love for the Celestial Lord. You do not enjoy the sublime taste of the Shabad
— what Praises of the Lord will you stubborn-mindedly sing? O Nanak, one‟s coming
into the world is approved, if, as Gurmukh, he merges into the True Lord. || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: The fool does not understand his own self; he annoys others with his
speech. His underlying nature does not leave him; separated from the Lord, he is
beaten. He has not changed and reformed himself in Fear of the True Guru, so that he
might merge in the lap of God. 

Night and day, his doubts never stop; without the Word of the Shabad, he suffers in
pain. Sexual desire, anger and greed are very powerful within; he passes his life
constantly entangled in worldly affairs. His feet, hands, eyes and ears are exhausted;
his days are numbered, and death is approaching. The True Name does not seem sweet
to him — the Name by which the nine treasures are obtained. But if he remains dead
while yet alive, then by so dying, he truly lives; thus, he attains liberation. But if he is
not blessed with such pre-destined karma, then without this karma, what can he
obtain? Meditate on the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, you fool; through the Shabad, you
shall obtain salvation and wisdom. O Nanak, he alone finds the True Guru, who
eradicates self-conceit from within. || 2 || PAUREE: One whose consciousness is
filled with my Lord and Master — why should he feel anxious about anything? The Lord
is the Giver of peace, the Lord of all things; why would we turn our faces away from His
meditation, for a moment, even for an instant? One who meditates on the Lord obtains
all pleasures and comforts; let‟s go, each and every day, to sit in the Society of the
Saints. All the pain, hunger and disease of the Lord‟s servant are eradicated; the bonds
of all the humble beings are torn away. By the Lord‟s Grace, one becomes the Lord‟s
devotee; beholding the face of the Lord‟s humble devotee, the whole world is saved
and carried across. || 4 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Let that tongue, which has not
tasted the Taste of the Lord, be burnt. O Nanak, one whose mind is filled with the Lord,
Har, Har — his tongue savors the Word of the Shabad. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Let that
tongue, which has forgotten the Name of the Lord, be burnt. O Nanak, the tongue of
the Gurmukh chants the Lord‟s Name, and loves the Name of the Lord. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The Lord Himself is the Master, the servant and the devotee; the Lord
Himself is the Cause of causes. The Lord Himself beholds, and He Himself rejoices. As
He pleases, He enjoins us. The Lord places some on the Path, and the Lord Himself
leads others into the wilderness. The Lord is the True Master; True is His justice. He
arranges and watches all His plays. By Guru‟s Grace, servant Nanak speaks and sings
the Glorious Praises of the True Lord. || 5 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: How rare is the
dervish, the Saintly renunciate, who understands renunciation. Cursed is the life, and
cursed are the clothes, of one who wanders around, begging from door to door. But if
he gives up hope and anxiety and becomes Gurmukh, and takes the Name as his
charity, then Nanak washes his feet; I am a sacrifice to him. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O
Nanak, the tree has one fruit, but two birds are perched upon it. They are not seen
coming or going; these birds have no wings. The soul enjoys all sorts of pleasures;
through the Word of the Shabad, it remains in Nirvaanaa. Imbued with the subtle
essence of the fruit of the Lord‟s Name, O Nanak, it bears the True Insignia of God‟s
Grace. || 2 || PAUREE: He Himself is the field, and He Himself is the farmer. He
Himself grows and grinds the grain. He Himself cooks it, He Himself puts the food in the
dishes, and He Himself sits down to eat. 

He Himself is the water, He Himself gives the tooth-pick, and He Himself offers the
mouthwash. He Himself calls and seats the congregation, and He Himself bids them
goodbye. One whom the Lord Himself blesses with His Mercy — the Lord inspires him
to obey the Hukam of His Command. || 6 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Religious rituals
are all just entanglements; bad and good are bound up with them. Possessiveness and
emotional attachment are more bonds; children and spouse are entanglements as well.
Wherever I look, I see the noose of attachment to Maya. O Nanak, without the True
Name, the world is engrossed in blind dealings. || 1 || FOURTH MEHL: The blind
receive the Divine Light, when they merge with the Will of the True Guru. They break
their bonds and dwell in Truth, and the darkness of ignorance is dispelled. They see
that everything belongs to the One who created and fashioned the body. Nanak seeks
the Sanctuary of the Creator; the Creator preserves his honor. || 2 || PAUREE: When
the Creator, sitting all by Himself, created the Universe, he did not consult with any of
His servants. So what can anyone take, and what can anyone give, since He did not
create any other like Himself? Then, after forming the Universe, the Creator blessed all
with His blessings. He Himself instructs us in His service; as Gurmukh, we drink in His
Ambrosial Nectar. He Himself is formless, and He Himself is formed; whatever He
Himself does, comes to pass. || 7 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The Gurmukhs serve
God forever; night and day, they are intuitively absorbed in the Love of the True One.
They are in bliss forever, singing the Glorious Praises of the True Lord; in this world and
in the next, they keep Him clasped to their hearts. Their Beloved dwells deep within;
the Creator pre-ordained this karma. O Nanak, He blends them into Himself; He Himself
showers His Mercy upon them. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: By merely talking and speaking,
He is not found. Night and day, sing His Glorious Praises forever. Without His Grace, no
one finds Him; many have died barking and bewailing. When the mind and body are
drenched with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the Lord Himself comes to dwell in the
mind. O Nanak, by His Grace, He is found; He unites us in His Union. || 2 || PAUREE:
He Himself is the Vedas, the Puraanas and all the Shaastras; He Himself recites them,
and He Himself is pleased. He Himself sits down to worship, and He Himself creates the
world. He Himself is the householder, and He Himself is the renunciate; He Himself
speaks the Unspoken. He Himself is all goodness, and He Himself causes us to act; He
Himself remains detached. He Himself grants pleasure and pain; the Creator Himself
bestows His blessings. || 8 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O Shaykh, renounce your
violent nature; live in the Fear of God and give up your madness. Through the Fear of
the Guru, many have been saved; in this fear, you shall find the Fearless One. Pierce
your stubborn mind with the Word of the Shabad; let peace and tranquility come to
abide in your mind. If good deeds are done in this state of peace, they are approved by
the Lord and Master. O Nanak, no one has ever found God through sex and anger —
go, and ask any spiritual teacher. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: 

The self-willed manmukhs are emotionally attached to Maya — they have no love for
the Naam. They practice falsehood, gather falsehood, and make falsehood their
sustenance. They collect the poisonous wealth of Maya, and then die; in the end, it is
all reduced to ashes. They practice religious rituals, purity and austere self-discipline,
but within, there is only greed and corruption. O Nanak, whatever the self-willed
manmukhs do is not acceptable; in the Court of the Lord, they are dishonored. || 2 ||
PAUREE: He Himself created the four sources of creation, and He Himself fashioned
speech; He Himself created the worlds and solar systems. He Himself is the ocean, and
He Himself is the sea; He Himself puts the pearls in it. By His Grace, He enables some
to find them — those whom He makes Gurmukh. He Himself is the terrifying worldocean, and He Himself is the boat; He Himself is the boatman, and He Himself ferries
us across. The Creator Himself acts, and causes us to act; no one else can equal You,
Lord. || 9 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Service to the True Guru is fruitful, if one does
so with a sincere mind. The treasure of the Naam is obtained, and the mind comes to
be free of anxiety. The pains of birth and death are eradicated, and the mind is rid of
egotism and possessiveness. One achieves the ultimate state, and remains absorbed in
the True One. O Nanak, the True Guru comes and meets those who have such preordained destiny. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The True Guru is attuned to the Naam; He is
the boat in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. One who becomes Gurmukh crosses over; the
True Lord abides within him. He remembers the Naam, he gathers in the Naam, and he
obtains honor through the Naam. Nanak has found the True Guru; by His Grace, the
Name is obtained. || 2 || PAUREE: He Himself is the Philosopher‟s Stone, He Himself
is the metal, and He Himself is transformed into gold. He Himself is the Lord and
Master, He Himself is the servant, and He Himself is the Destroyer of sins. He Himself
enjoys every heart; the Lord Master Himself is the basis of all illusion. He Himself is the
discerning one, and He Himself is the Knower of all; He Himself breaks the bonds of the
Gurmukhs. Servant Nanak is not satisfied by merely praising You, O Creator Lord; You
are the Great Giver of peace. || 10 || SHALOK, FOURTH MEHL: Without serving the
True Guru, the deeds which are done are only chains binding the soul. Without serving
the True Guru, they find no place of rest. They die, only to be born again — they
continue coming and going. Without serving the True Guru, their speech is insipid. They
do not enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord, in the mind. O Nanak, without serving
the True Guru, they are bound and gagged, and beaten in the City of Death; they
depart with blackened faces. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Some wait upon and serve the
True Guru; they embrace love for the Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, they reform their lives,
and save their generations as well. || 2 || PAUREE: He Himself is the school, He
Himself is the teacher, and He Himself brings the students to be taught. He Himself is
the father, He Himself is the mother, and He Himself makes the children wise. In one
place, He teaches them to read and understand everything, while in another place, He
Himself makes them ignorant. 

Some, You summon to the Mansion of Your Presence within, when they become
pleasing to Your Mind, O True Lord. That Gurmukh, whom You have blessed with
greatness — that humble being is known and respected in Your True Court. || 11 ||
SHALOK, MARDAANAA: The Dark Age of Kali Yuga is the vessel, filled with the wine of
sex; the mind is the drinker. Anger is the cup, filled with emotional attachment; egotism
is the bartender. Drinking too much in the company of falsehood and greed, one is
ruined. So let good deeds be your distillery, and let Truth be the molasses you ferment;
make the most excellent wine of Truth. Make virtue your bread, good conduct the ghee,
and modesty the dish of meat. As Gurmukh, these are obtained, O Nanak; consuming
them, evil and corruption depart. || 1 || MARDAANAA: The body is the bottle, selfconceit is the wine, and desire is the company of drinking buddies. The glass of the
mind‟s longing is filled to overflowing with falsehood; the Messenger of Death is the
bartender. Drinking in this wine, O Nanak, one takes on countless vices and corruption.
So make spiritual wisdom your molasses, and the Praise of God your bread; let the Fear
of God be the dish of meat. O Nanak, this is the true food; let the True Name be your
only Support. || 2 || If the human body is the pitcher, and self-realization is the wine,
then the Ambrosial Nectar streams down. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True
Congregation, the glass of the Lord‟s Love is filled with this Ambrosial Nectar; drinking it
in, one‟s evil and corruption are eradicated. || 3 || PAUREE: He Himself is the angelic
being, the heavenly herald, and the celestial singer. He Himself is the one who explains
the six schools of philosophy. He Himself is Shiva, Shankara and Mahaysh; He Himself
is the Gurmukh, who speaks the Unspoken Speech. He Himself is the Yogi, He Himself
is the Enjoyer of pleasures, and He Himself is the Sannyaasee, wandering through the
wilderness. He discusses with Himself, and He teaches Himself; He Himself is discrete,
graceful and wise. Staging His own play, He Himself watches it; He Himself is the
Knower of all beings. || 12 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: That prayer is accepted, which
brings the Lord God to my consciousness. Love for the Lord wells up within me, and my
attachment to Maya is burnt away. By Guru‟s Grace, duality is conquered, and the mind
becomes stable; I have made contemplative meditation my prayer. O Nanak, the selfwilled manmukh may recite his prayers, but his mind is not focused on it; through birth
and death, he is ruined. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: I wandered over the whole world,
crying out, “Love, O love!”, but my thirst was not quenched. O Nanak, meeting the True
Guru, my desires are satisfied; I found my Husband Lord, when I returned to the home
of my own inner being. || 2 || PAUREE: He Himself is the supreme essence; He
Himself is the essence of all. He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the
servant. He Himself created the people of the eighteen castes; God Himself acquired
His domain. He Himself kills, and He Himself redeems; He Himself, in His Kindness,
forgives us. He is infallible — He never makes mistakes; the True Lord‟s justice is totally
True. Those whom the Lord Himself instructs as Gurmukh — duality and doubt depart
from within them. || 13 || SHALOK, FIFTH MEHL: That body, which does not
meditate in remembrance on the Lord‟s Name in the Saadh Sangat, shall be reduced to
dust. 

Cursed and insipid is that body, O Nanak, which does not know the One who created it.
|| 1 || FIFTH MEHL: Let His Lotus Feet abide within your heart, and with your tongue,
chant the Name of the Lord of the World. O Nanak, meditate in remembrance on God,
and nurture this body of yours. || 2 || PAUREE: The Creator Himself is the sixty-eight
sacred places of pilgrimage; He Himself takes the cleansing bath there. He Himself
practices austere self-discipline; the Lord and Master Himself inspires us to chant His
Name. He Himself becomes merciful; the Destroyer of fear Himself gives in charity to
all. One whom He has enlightened and made Gurmukh, obtains honor forever in His
Court. One whose honor is preserved by his Lord and Master, comes to know the True
Lord. || 14 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O Nanak, without meeting the True Guru, the
world is blind; in blindness, it does its deeds. It does not focus its consciousness on the
Word of the Shabad, which would bring peace to abide in the mind. Always afflicted
with the dark passions of low energy, it wanders around, passing its days and nights
burning. Whatever pleases Him, comes to pass; no one has any say in this. || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: The True Guru has commanded us to do this: through the Guru‟s Gate,
meditate on your Lord and Master. The Lord and Master is ever-present. He rips away
the veil of doubt, and installs His Light deep within. The Name of the Lord is Ambrosial
Nectar — take this healing medicine! Enshrine the Will of the True Guru in your
consciousness, and make the Love of the True One your self-discipline. O Nanak, you
shall be kept in peace here, and hereafter you shall celebrate with the Lord. || 2 ||
PAUREE: He Himself is the vast variety of Nature, and He Himself makes it bear fruit.
He Himself is the Gardener, He Himself irrigates all the plants, and He Himself puts
them in His mouth. He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer; He
Himself gives, and inspires others to give. He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He
Himself is the Protector; He Himself is pervading everywhere. Servant Nanak speaks of
the greatness of the Lord, the Creator, who has no greed at all. || 15 || SHALOK,
THIRD MEHL: One person brings a full bottle, and another comes to fill his cup.
Drinking it, his intelligence departs, and madness enters his mind. He cannot distinguish
between his own and others‟ — he is struck down by his Lord and Master. Drinking it,
he forgets his Lord and Master, and he is punished in the Court of the Lord. Don‟t drink
the false wine at all, if it is in your power. O Nanak, by His Grace, one obtains the true
wine, when the True Guru comes and meets him. He shall dwell forever in the Love of
the Lord and Master, and obtain a seat in the Mansion of His Presence. || 1 || THIRD
MEHL: One remains dead while yet alive in this world, when he realizes the Lord. When
he is put to sleep, he remains asleep; when He is awakened, he regains consciousness.
O Nanak, when the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, He causes him to meet the True
Guru. By Guru‟s Grace, remain dead while yet alive, and you shall not have to die again.
|| 2 || PAUREE: By His doing, everything happens; what does He care for anyone
else? 

O Dear Lord, everyone eats whatever You give — all are subservient to You. One who
praises You obtains everything, as You grant Your Grace, O Immaculate Lord. He alone
is a true banker and trader, who loads the merchandise of the wealth of Your Name, O
Lord. O Saints, let everyone praise the Lord, who has destroyed the pile of the love of
duality. || 16 || SHALOK: Kabeer, the world is dying — dying to death, but no one
knows how to truly die. Whoever dies — let him die such a death, that he shall never
have to die again. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: What do I know? How will I die? What sort of
death will it be? If I don‟t forget the Lord and Master from my mind, then death will be
easy. The world is terrified of death; everyone longs to live. By Guru‟s Grace, one who
dies while yet alive, understands the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command. O Nanak, one who
dies such a death, lives forever. || 2 || PAUREE: When the Lord Master Himself
becomes merciful, the Lord Himself causes His Name to be chanted. He Himself leads
us to meet the True Guru, and blesses us with peace. His servant is pleasing to the
Lord. He Himself preserves the honor of His servants; He makes others fall at the feet
of His devotees. The Righteous Judge of Dharma is the creation of the Lord; he does
not even approach the humble servant of the Lord. One who is dear to the Lord, is dear
to all; a great many others come and go in vain. || 17 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL:
The whole world wanders around chanting, “Raam, Raam, Lord, Lord”, but the Lord
cannot be found like this. He is inaccessible, unfathomable and utterly great; He is
unweighable, and cannot be weighed. No one can evaluate Him; He cannot be
purchased at any price. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, His mystery is known;
in this way, He comes to dwell in the mind. O Nanak, He Himself is infinite; by Guru‟s
Grace, He is known to be permeating everywhere. He Himself comes to blend, and
having blended, remains blended. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O mind, this is the wealth of
the Naam; it brings peace, forever and ever. It never brings any loss at all; through it,
one earns profits forever. Eating and spending it, it never decreases; He continues to
give, forever and ever. One who has no skepticism at all, never suffers humiliation. O
Nanak, the Gurmukh obtains it, when the Lord bestows His Glance of Grace. || 2 ||
PAUREE: He Himself is deep within all hearts, and He Himself is outside as well. He
Himself is prevailing unmanifest, and He Himself is manifest as well. For thirty-six ages,
He created the darkness, abiding in the void. There were no Vedas, Puraanas or
Shaastras there; only the Lord Himself existed. He Himself sat in the absolute trance,
withdrawn from everything. Only He Himself knows His state; He Himself is the
unfathomable ocean. || 18 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: In egotism, the world is dead;
it dies and dies, again and again. 

As long as there is breath in the body, he does not remember God; what will he do
when he goes beyond? One who remembers the Lord is spiritually wise; the ignorant
act blindly. O Nanak, whatever one does in this world determines what he shall receive
in the world beyond. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: It is the pre-ordained Command of the
Lord and Master, that one cannot be conscious of Him without the True Guru. Meeting
the True Guru, one realizes that the Lord is permeating and pervading deep within; he
remains forever absorbed in the Lord‟s Love. With each and every breath, he constantly
remembers the Lord in meditation; not a single breath passes in vain. The fear of birth
and death departs, and one obtains the honored state of eternal life. O Nanak, this rank
is bestowed upon those whom He showers with His Mercy. || 2 || PAUREE: He
Himself is all-wise and all-knowing; He Himself is supreme. He Himself reveals His form,
and He Himself enjoins us to His meditation. He Himself poses as a silent sage, and He
Himself speaks spiritual wisdom. He does not seem bitter to anyone; He is pleasing to
all. His Praises cannot be described; I am forever and ever a sacrifice to Him. || 19 ||
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Nanak, the Jinn, the demons,
have taken birth. The son is a demon, the daughter is a demon, and the wife is the
chief of the demons. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: The Hindus have forgotten the Primal Lord;
they are going the wrong way. As Naarad instructed them, they worship idols. They are
blind and mute, the blindest of the blind. The ignorant fools pick up stones and worship
them. But when those stones themselves sink, how will they carry you across? || 2 ||
PAUREE: Everything is in Your power; You are the True King. The devotees are attuned
to the Love of the One Lord; they have perfect faith in Him. The Name of the Lord is
the food of ambrosial nectar; His humble servants eat their fill. All treasures are
obtained — meditative remembrance is the true profit. The Saints are very dear to the
Supreme Lord God; O Nanak, the Lord is unapproachable and unfathomable. || 20 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Everything comes by His Command, and everything goes by
His Command. If some fool believes that he does so himself, he is blind, and acts in
blindness. O Nanak, one who becomes Gurmukh understands the Hukam of the Lord‟s
Command; the Lord grants His Grace. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: He alone is a Yogi, and
he alone finds the Way, who as Gurmukh, has found the Naam. In the body-village of
that Yogi is everything; Yoga is not obtained by outward show and religious robes. O
Nanak, such a Yogi is very rare; the Lord is revealed in the heart. || 2 || PAUREE: He
Himself created the creatures, and He Himself supports them. He Himself is seen to be
subtle, and He Himself is obvious. He Himself remains a solitary hermit, and He Himself
has a huge family. Nanak begs for the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints of the
Lord. I cannot see any other Giver; You alone are the Giver, Lord. || 21 || 1 || SUDH
