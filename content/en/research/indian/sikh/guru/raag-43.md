RAAG MARU, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

SHALOK: Nanak seeks Your protection, and beholds You ever-present, here and now. || 1 || SHABAD: Those who
receive the call in the last hours of the night, chant the Name of their Lord and Master.
Tents, canopies, pavilions and carriages are prepared and made ready for them. You
send out the call, Lord, to those who meditate on Your Name. || 1 || Father, I am
unfortunate, a fraud. 

I have not found Your Name; my mind is blind and deluded by
doubt. || 1 || Pause || I have enjoyed the tastes, and now my pains have come to
fruition; such is my pre-ordained destiny, O my mother. Now my joys are few, and my
pains are many. In utter agony, I pass my life. || 2 || What separation could be worse
than separation from the Lord? For those who are united with Him, what other union
can there be? Praise the Lord and Master, who, having created this play, beholds it. ||
3 || By good destiny, this union comes about; this body enjoys its pleasures. Those
who have lost their destiny, suffer separation from this union. O Nanak, they may still
be united once again! || 4 || 1 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: The union of the mother and
father brings the body into being. The Creator inscribes upon it the inscription of its
destiny. According to this inscription, gifts, light and glorious greatness are received.
Joining with Maya, the spiritual consciousness is lost. || 1 || O foolish mind, why are
you so proud? You shall have to arise and depart when it pleases your Lord and Master.
|| 1 || Pause || Abandon the tastes of the world, and find intuitive peace. All must
abandon their worldly homes; no one remains here forever. Eat some, and save the
rest, if you are destined to return to the world again. || 2 || He adorns his body and
ress in silk robes. He issues all sorts of commands. Preparing his comfortable bed, he
sleeps. When he falls into the hands of the Messenger of Death, what good does it do
to cry out? || 3 || 

Household affairs are whirlpools of entanglements, O Siblings of Destiny. Sin is a stone
which does not float. So let the Fear of God be the boat to carry your soul across. Says
Nanak, rare are those who are blessed with this Boat. || 4 || 2 || MARU, FIRST
MEHL, FIRST HOUSE: Actions are the paper, and the mind is the ink; good and bad
are both recorded upon it. As their past actions drive them, so are mortals driven. There
is no end to Your Glorious Virtues, Lord. || 1 || Why do you not keep Him in your
consciousness, you mad man? Forgetting the Lord, your own virtues shall rot away. ||
1 || Pause || Th enight is a net, and the day is a net; there are as many traps as
there are moments. With relish and delight, you continually bite at the bait; you are
trapped, you fool — how will you ever escape? || 2 || The body is a furnace, and the
mind is the iron within it; the five fires are heating it. Sin is the charcoal placed upon it,
which burns the mind; the tongs are anxiety and worry. || 3 || What was turned to
slag is again transformed into gold, if one meets with the Guru. He blesses the mortal
with the Ambrosial Name of the One Lord, and then, O Nanak, the body is held steady.
|| 4 || 3 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: In the pure, immaculate waters, both the lotus and
the slimy scum are found. The lotus flower is with the scum and the water, but it
remains untouched by any pollution. || 1 || You frog, you will never understand. You
eat the dirt, while you dwell in the immaculate waters. You know nothing of the
ambrosial nectar there. || 1 || Pause || You dwell continually in the water; the
bumble bee does not dwell there, but it is intoxicated with its fragrance from afar.
Intuitively sensing the moon in the distance, the lotus bows its head. || 2 || The
realms of nectar are irrigated with milk and honey; you think you are clever to live in
the water. You can never escape your own inner tendencies, like the love of the flea for
blood. || 3 || The fool may live with the Pandit, the religious scholar, and listen to the
Vedas and the Shaastras. You can never escape your own inner tendencies, like the
crooked tail of the dog. || 4 || Some are hypocrites; they do not merge with the
Naam, the Name of the Lord. Some are absorbed in the Feet of the Lord, Har, Har. The
mortals obtain what they are predestined to receive; O Nanak, with your tongue, chant
the Naam. || 5 || 4 || MARU, FIRST MEHL, SHALOK: Countless sinners are
sanctified, attaching their minds to the Feet of the Lord. The merits of the sixty-eight
places of pilgrimage are found in God‟s Name, O Nanak, when such destiny is inscribed
upon one‟s forehead. || 1 || SHABAD: O friends and companions, so puffed up with
pride, listen to this one joyous story of your Husband Lord. || 1 || Who can I tell
about my pain, O my mother? Without the Lord, my soul cannot survive; how can I
comfort it, O my mother? || 1 || Pause || I am a dejected, discarded bride, totally
miserable. I have lost my youth; I regret and repent. || 2 || You are my wise Lord
and Master, above my head. I serve You as Your humble slave. Nanak humbly prays,
this is my only concern: without the Blessed Vision of my Beloved, how can I enjoy
Him? || 4 || 5 || 

MARU, FIRST MEHL: I am Your slave, Your bonded servant, and so I am called
fortunate. I sold myself at Your store in exchange for the Guru‟s Word; whatever You
link me to, to that I am linked. || 1 || What cleverness can Your servant try with You?
O my Lord and Master, I cannot carry out the Hukam of Your Command. || 1 || Pause
|| My mother is Your slave, and my father is Your slave; I am the child of Your slaves.
My slave mother dances, and my slave father sings; I practice devotional worship to
You, O my Sovereign Lord. || 2 || If You wish to drink, then I shall get water for You;
if You wish to eat, I shall grind the corn for You. I wave the fan over You, and wash
Your feet, and continue to chant Your Name. || 3 || I have been untrue to myself, but
Nanak is Your slave; please forgive him, by Your glorious greatness. Since the very
beginning of time, and throughout the ages, You have been the merciful and generous
Lord. Without You, liberation cannot be attained. || 4 || 6 || MARU, FIRST MEHL:
Some call him a ghost; some say that he is a demon. Some call him a mere mortal; O,
poor Nanak! || 1 || Crazy Nanak has gone insane, after his Lord, the King. I know of
none other than the Lord. || 1 || Pause || He alone is known to be insane, when he
goes insane with the Fear of God. He recognizes none other than the One Lord and
Master. || 2 || He alone is known to be insane, if he works for the One Lord.
Recognizing the Hukam, the Command of his Lord and Master, what other cleverness is
there? || 3 || He alone is known to be insane, when he falls in love with his Lord and
Master. He sees himself as bad, and all the rest of the world as good. || 4 || 7 ||
MARU, FIRST MEHL: This wealth is all-pervading, permeating all. The self-willed
manmukh wanders around, thinking that it is far away. || 1 || That commodity, the
wealth of the Naam, is within my heart. Whoever You bless with it, is emancipated. ||
1 || Pause || This wealth does not burn; it cannot be stolen by a thief. This wealth
does not drown, and its owner is never punished. || 2 || Gaze upon the glorious
greatness of this wealth, and your nights and days will pass, imbued with celestial
peace. || 3 || Listen to this incomparably beautiful story, O my brothers, O Siblings of
Destiny. Tell me, without this wealth, who has ever obtained the supreme status? || 4
|| Nanak humbly prays, I proclaim the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. If one meets the
True Guru, then this wealth is obtained. || 5 || 8 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: Heat up the
sun energy of the right nostril, and cool down the moon energy of the left nostril;
practicing this breath-control, bring them into perfect balance. In this way, the fickle
fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall
will not crumble. || 1 || You fool, why are you deluded by doubt? You do not
remember the detached Lord of supreme bliss. || 1 || Pause || Seize and burn the
unbearable; seize and kill the imperishable; leave behind your doubts, and then, you
shall drink in the Nectar. In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the
swan-soul shall not fly away, and the body-wall shall not crumble. || 2 || Nanak
humbly prays, if the Lord‟s humble servant dwells upon Him, in his mind of minds, with
his every breath, then he drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. 

In this way, the fickle fish of the mind will be held steady; the swan-soul shall not fly
away, and the body-wall shall not crumble. || 3 || 9 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: Maya is
not conquered, and the mind is not subdued; the waves of desire in the world-ocean
are intoxicating wine. The boat crosses over the water, carrying the true merchandise.
The jewel within the mind subdues the mind; attached to the Truth, it is not broken.
The king is seated upon the throne, imbued with the Fear of God and the five qualities.
|| 1 || O Baba, do not see your True Lord and Master as being far away. He is the
Light of all, the Life of the world; The True Lord writes His Inscription on each and
every head. || 1 || Pause || Brahma and Vishnu, the Rishis and the silent sages,
Shiva and Indra, penitents and beggars — whoever obeys the Hukam of the Lord‟s
Command, looks beautiful in the Court of the True Lord, while the stubborn rebels die.
The wandering beggars, warriors, celibates and Sannyaasee hermits — through the
Perfect Guru, consider this: without selfless service, no one ever receives the fruits of
their rewards. Serving the Lord is the most excellent action. || 2 || You are the wealth
of the poor, the Guru of the guru-less, the honor of the dishonored. I am blind; I have
grasped hold of the jewel, the Guru. You are the strength of the weak. He is not known
through burnt offerings and ritual chanting; the True Lord is known through the Guru‟s
Teachings. Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, no one finds shelter in the Court
of the Lord; the false come and go in reincarnation. || 3 || So praise the True Name,
and through the True Name, you will find satisfaction. When the mind is cleaned with
the jewel of spiritual wisdom, it does not become dirty again. As long as the Lord and
Master dwells in the mind, no obstacles are encountered. O Nanak, giving one‟s head,
one is emancipated, and the mind and body become true. || 4 || 10 || MARU, FIRST
MEHL: The Yogi who is joined to the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is pure; he is not
stained by even a particle of dirt. The True Lord, his Beloved, is always with him; the
rounds of birth and death are ended for him. || 1 || O Lord of the Universe, what is
Your Name, and what is it like? If You summon me into the Mansion of Your Presence, I
will ask You, how I can become one with You. || 1 || Pause || He alone is a
Brahmin, who takes his cleansing bath in the spiritual wisdom of God, and whose leafofferings in worship are the Glorious Praises of the Lord. The One Name, the One Lord,
and His One Light pervade the three worlds. || 2 || My tongue is the balance of the
scale, and this heart of mine is the pan of the scale; I weigh the immeasurable Naam.
There is one store, and one banker above all; the merchants deal in the one
commodity. || 3 || The True Guru saves us at both ends; he alone understands, who
is lovingly focused on the One Lord; his inner being remains free of doubt. The Word of
the Shabad abides within, and doubt is ended, for those who constantly serve, day and
night. || 4 || Above is the sky of the mind, and beyond this sky is the Lord, the
Protector of the World; the Inaccessible Lord God; the Guru abides there as well.
According to the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings, what is outside is the same as what is
inside the home of the self. Nanak has become a detached renunciate. || 5 || 11 || 

RAAG MARU, FIRST MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE:

Day and night, he remains awake and aware; he never sleeps or dreams. He alone
knows this, who feels the pain of separation from God. My body is pierced through with
the arrow of love. How can any physician know the cure? || 1 || Rare is that one, who
as Gurmukh, understands, and whom the True Lord links to His Praise. He alone
appreciates the value of the Ambsosial Nectar, who deals in this Ambrosia. || 1 ||
Pause || The soul-bride is in love with her Husband Lord; the focuses her
consciousness on the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The soul-bride is joyously
embellished with intuitive ease; her hunger and thirst are taken away. || 2 || Tear
down skepticism and dispel your doubt; with your intuition, draw the bow of the Praise
of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, conquer and subdue your mind;
take the support of Yoga — Union with the beautiful Lord. || 3 || Burnt by egotism,
one forgets the Lord from his mind. In the City of Death, he is attacked with massive
swords. Then, even if he asks for it, he will not receive the Lord‟s Name; O soul, you
shall suffer terrible punishment. || 4 || You are distracted by thoughts of Maya and
worldly attachment. In the City of Death, you will be caught by the noose of the
Messenger of Death. You cannot break free from the bondage of loving attachment,
and so the Messenger of Death will torture you. || 5 || I have done nothing; I am
doing nothing now. The True Guru has blessed me with the Ambrosial Nectar of the
Naam. What other efforts can anyone make, when You bestow Your blessing? Nanak
seeks Your Sanctuary. || 6 || 1 || 12 ||
MARU, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

Wherever You seat me, there I sit, O my Lord and Master; wherever You send me,
there I go. In the entire village, there is only One King; all places are sacred. || 1 || O
Baba, while I dwell in this body, let me sing Your True Praises, that I may intuitively
merge with You. || 1 || Pause || He thinks that good and bad deeds come from
himself; this is the source of all evil. Whatever happens in this world is only by the
Order of our Lord and Master. || 2 || Sexual desires are so strong and compelling;
where has this sexual desire come from? The Creator Himself stages all the plays; how
rare are those who realize this. || 3 || By Guru‟s Grace, one is lovingly focused on the
One Lord, and then, duality is ended. Whatever is in harmony with His Will, he accepts
as True; the noose of Death is loosened from around his neck. || 4 || Prays Nanak,
who can call him to account, when the egotistical pride of his mind has been silenced?
Even the Righteous Judge of Dharma is intimidated and afraid of him; he has entered
the Sanctuary of the True Lord. || 5 || 1 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: Coming and going
in reincarnation no longer exist, when one dwells in the home of the self within. 

He bestowed the Blessing of His treasure of truth; only He Himself knows. || 1 || O
my mind, remember the Dear Lord, and abandon the corruption of your mind. Meditate
on the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; focus lovingly on the Truth. || 1 || Pause || One
who forgets the Name in this world, shall not find any place of rest anywhere else. He
shall wander in all sorts of reincarnations, and rot away in manure. || 2 || By great
good fortune, I have found the Guru, according to my pre-ordained destiny, O my
mother. Night and day, I practice true devotional worship; I am united with the True
Lord. || 3 || He Himself fashioned the entire universe; He Himself bestows His Glance
of Grace. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is glorious and great; as He
pleases, He bestows His Blessings. || 4 || 2 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: Please forgive
my past mistakes, O my Dear Lord; now, please place me on the Path. I remain
attached to the Lord‟s Feet, and eradicate self-conceit from within. || 1 || O my mind,
as Gurmukh, meditate on the Name of the Lord. Remain attached forever to the Lord‟s
Feet, single-mindedly, with love for the One Lord. || 1 || Pause || I have no social
status or honor; I have no place or home. Pierced through by the Word of the Shabad,
my doubts have been cut away. The Guru has inspired me to understand the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. || 2 || This mind wanders around, driven by greed, totally attached
to greed. He is engrossed in false pursuits; he shall endure beatings in the City of
Death. || 3 || O Nanak, God Himself Himself is all-in-all. There is no other at all. He
bestows the treasure of devotional worship, and the Gurmukhs abide in peace. || 4 || 3
|| MARU, THIRD MEHL: Seek and find those who are imbued with Truth; they are so
rare in this world. Meeting with them, one‟s face becomes radiant and bright, chanting
the Name of the Lord. || 1 || O Baba, contemplate and cherish the True Lord and
Master within your heart. Seek out and see, and ask your True Guru, and obtain the
true commodity. || 1 || Pause || All serve the One True Lord; through pre-ordained
destiny, they meet Him. The Gurmukhs merge with Him, and will not be separated from
Him again; they attain the True Lord. || 2 || Some do not appreciate the value of
devotional worship; the self-willed manmukhs are deluded by doubt. They are fillled
with self-conceit; they cannot accomplish anything. || 3 || Stand and offer your
prayer, to the One who cannot be moved by force. O Nanak, the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, abides within the mind of the Gurmukh; hearing his prayer, the Lord applauds
him. || 4 || 4 || MARU, THIRD MEHL: He transforms the burning desert into a cool
oasis; he transmutes rusted iron into gold. So praise the True Lord; there is none other
as great as He is. || 1 || O my mind, night and day, meditate on the Lord‟s Name.
Contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings, and sing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, night and day. || 1 || Pause || As Gurmukh, one comes to know the One Lord,
when the True Guru instructs him. Praise the True Guru, who imparts this
understanding. || 2 || Those who forsake the True Guru, and attach themselves to
duality — what will they do when they go to the world hereafter? Bound and gagged in
the City of Death, they will be beaten. 

They will be punished severely. || 3 || My God is independent and self-sufficient; he
does not have even an iota of greed. O Nanak, run to His Sanctuary; granting His
forgiveness, He merges us into Himself. || 4 || 5 ||

MARU, FOURTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

Suk-deva and Janak meditated on the Naam; following the Guru‟s Teachings, they
sought the Sanctuary of the Lord, Har, Har. God met Sudama and removed his poverty;
through loving devotional worship, he crossed over. God is the Lover of His devotees;
the Lord‟s Name is fufilling; God showers His Mercy on the Gurmukhs. || 1 || O my
mind, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you will be saved. Dhroo, Prahlaad
and Bidar the slave-girl‟s son, became Gurmukh, and through the Naam, crossed over.
|| 1 || Pause || In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Naam is the supreme wealth; it
saves the humble devotees. All the faults of Naam Dayv, Jai Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan
and Ravi Daas the leather-worker were covered. Those who become Gurmukh, and
remain attached to the Naam, are saved; all their sinful residues are washed off. || 2 ||
Whoever chants the Naam, all his sins and mistakes are taken away. Ajaamal, who had
sex with prostitites, was saved, by chanting the Name of the Lord. Chanting the Naam,
Ugar Sain obtained salvation; his bonds were broken, and he was liberated. || 3 ||
God Himself takes pity on His humble servants, and makes them His own. My Lord of
the Universe saves the honor of His servants; those who seek His Sanctuary are saved.
The Lord has showered servant Nanak with His Mercy; he has enshrined the Lord‟s
Name within his heart. || 4 || 1 || MARU, FOURTH MEHL: The Siddhas in Samaadhi
meditate on Him; they are lovingly focused on Him. The seekers and the silent sages
meditate on Him as well. The celibates, the true and contented beings meditate on Him;
Indra and the other gods chant His Name with their mouths. Those who seek His
Sanctuary meditate on Him; they become Gurmukh and swim across. || 1 || O my
mind, chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and cross over. Dhanna the farmer, and
Balmik the highway robber, became Gurmukh, and crossed over. || 1 || Pause ||
Angels, men, heavenly heralds and celestial singers meditate on Him; even the humble
Rishis sing of the Lord. Shiva, Brahma and the goddess Lakhshmi, meditate, and chant
with their mouths the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Those whose minds are drenched
with the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, as Gurmukh, cross over. || 2 || Millions and
millions, thirty-three million gods meditate on Him; there is no end to those who
meditate on the Lord. The Vedas, the Puraanas and the Simritees meditate on the Lord;
the Pandits, the religious scholars, sing the Lord‟s Praises as well. Those whose minds
are filled with the Naam, the source of nectar — as Gurmukh, they cross over. || 3 ||
Those who chant the Naam in endless waves — I cannot even count their number. The
Lord of the Universe bestows His Mercy, and those who are pleasing to the Mind of the
Lord God, find their place. The Guru, granting His Grace, implants the Lord‟s Name
within; servant Nanak chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 4 || 2 || 

MARU, FOURTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

Take the treasure of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and
the Lord shall bless you with honor. Here and hereafter, the Lord goes with you; in the
end, He shall deliver you. Where the path is difficult and the street is narrow, there the
Lord shall liberate you. || 1 || O my True Guru, implant within me the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. The Lord is my mother, father, child and relative; I have none other
than the Lord, O my mother. || 1 || Pause || I feel the pains of love and yearning
for the Lord, and the Name of the Lord. If only someone would come and unite me with
Him, O my mother. I bow in humble devotion to one who inspires me to meet with my
Beloved. The almighty and merciful True Guru unites me with the Lord God
instantaneously. || 2 || Those who do not remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
are most unfortunate, and are slaughtered. They wander in reincarnation, again and
again; they die, and are re-born, and continue coming and going. Bound and gagged at
Death‟s Door, they are cruelly beaten, and punished in the Court of the Lord. || 3 || O
God, I seek Your Sanctuary; O my Sovereign Lord King, please unite me with Yourself.
O Lord, Life of the World, please shower me with Your Mercy; grant me the Sanctuary
of the Guru, the True Guru. The Dear Lord, becoming merciful, has blended servant
Nanak with Himself. || 4 || 1 || 3 || MARU, FOURTH MEHL: I inquire about the
commodity of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Is there anyone who can show me the
wealth, the capital of the Lord? I cut myself into pieces, and make myself a sacrifice to
that one who leads me to meet my Lord God. I am filled with the Love of my Beloved;
how can I meet my Friend, and merge with Him? || 1 || O my beloved friend, my
mind, I take the wealth, the capital of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Perfect Guru
has implanted the Naam within me; the Lord is my support — I celebrate the Lord. || 1
|| Pause || O my Guru, please unite me with the Lord, Har, Har; show me the
wealth, the capital of the Lord. Without the Guru, love does not well up; see this, and
know it in your mind. The Lord has installed Himself within the Guru; so praise the
Guru, who unites us with the Lord. || 2 || The ocean, the treasure of devotional
worship of the Lord, rests with the Perfect True Guru. When it pleases the True Guru,
He opens the treasure, and and the Gurmukhs are illuminated by the Lord‟s Light. The
unfortunate self-willed manmukhs die of thirst, on the very bank of the river. || 3 ||
The Guru is the Great Giver; I beg for this gift from the Guru, that He may unite me
with God, from whom I was separated for so long! This is the great hope of my mind
and body. If it pleases You, O my Guru, please listen to my prayer; this is servant
Nanak‟s prayer. || 4 || 2 || 4 || MARU, FOURTH MEHL: O Lord God, please preach
Your sermon to me. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Lord is merged into my heart.
Meditate on the sermon of the Lord, Har, Har, O very fortunate ones; the Lord shall
bless you with the most sublime status of Nirvaanaa. 


The minds of the Gurmukhs are filled with faith; through the Perfect Guru, they merge
in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || O my mind, the sermon of the Lord, Har,
Har, is pleasing to my mind. Continually and forever, speak the sermon of the Lord,
Har, Har; as Gurmukh, speak the Unspoken Speech. || 1 || Pause || I have searched
through and through my mind and body; how can I attain this Unspoken Speech?
Meeting with the humble Saints, I have found it; listening to the Unspoken Speech, my
mind is pleased. The Lord‟s Name is the Support of my mind and body; I am united
with the all-knowing Primal Lord God. || 2 || The Guru, the Primal Being, has united
me with the Primal Lord God. My consciousness has merged into the supreme
consciousness. By great good fortune, I serve the Guru, and I have found my Lord, allwise and all-knowing. The self-willed manmukhs are very unfortunate; they pass their
life-night in misery and pain. || 3 || I am just a meek beggar at Your Door, God;
please, place the Ambrosial Word of Your Bani in my mouth. The True Guru is my
friend; He unites me with my all-wise, all-knowing Lord God. Servant Nanak has
entered Your Sanctuary; grant Your Grace, and merge me into Your Name. || 4 || 3 ||
5 || MARU, FOURTH MEHL: Detached from the world, I am in love with the Lord; by
great good fortune, I have enshrined the Lord within my mind. Joining the Sangat, the
Holy Congregation, faith has welled up within me; through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, I taste the sublime essence of the Lord. My mind and body have totally
blossomed forth; through the Word of the Guru‟s Bani, I chant the Glorious Praises of
the Lord. || 1 || O my beloved mind, my friend, taste the sublime essence of the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Through the Perfect Guru, I have found the Lord, who
saves my honor, here and hereafter. || 1 || Pause || Meditate on the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har; as Gurmukh, taste the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. Plant the seed of the
Lord in the body-farm. The Lord God is enshrined within the Sangat, the Holy
Congregation. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Ambrosial Nectar. Through the
Perfect Guru, taste the sublime essence of the Lord. || 2 || The self-willed manmukhs
are filled with hunger and thirst; their minds run around in the ten directions, hoping for
great wealth. Without the Name of the Lord, their life is cursed; the manmukhs are
stuck in manure. They come and go, and are consigned to wander through uncounted
incarnations, eating stinking rot. || 3 || Begging, imploring, I seek Your Sanctuary;
Lord, shower me with Your Mercy, and save me, God. Lead me to join the Society of
the Saints, and bless me with the honor and glory of the Lord‟s Name. I have obtained
the wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; servant Nanak chants the Lord‟s Name,
through the Guru‟s Teachings. || 4 || 4 || 6 ||
MARU, FOURTH MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE:

Devotional worship to the Lord, Har, Har, is an overflowing treasure. The Gurmukh is
emancipated by the Lord. One who is blessed by the Mercy of my Lord and Master sings
the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || O Lord, Har, Har, take pity on me, that within
my heart, I may dwell upon You, Lord, forever and ever. 

Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my soul; chanting the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, you shall be emancipated. || 1 || Pause || The Ambrosial Name of the Lord is
the ocean of peace. The beggar begs for it; O Lord, please bless him, in Your kindness.
True, True is the Lord; the Lord is forever True; the True Lord is pleasing to my mind.
|| 2 || The nine holes pour out filth. Chanting the Lord‟s Name, they are all purified
and sanctified. When my Lord and Master is totally pleased, He leads the mortal to
meditate in remembrance on the Lord, and then his filth is taken away. || 3 ||
Attachment to Maya is terribly treacherous. How can one cross over the difficult worldocean? The True Lord bestows the boat of the True Guru; meditating on the Lord, Har,
Har, one is carried across. || 4 || You are everywhere; all are Yours. Whatever You
do, God, that alone comes to pass. Poor servant Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the
Lord; as it pleases the Lord, He bestows His approval. || 5 || 1 || 7 || MARU,
FOURTH MEHL: Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind. The Lord shall
eradicate all your sinful residues. Treasure the Lord‟s wealth, and gather in the Lord‟s
wealth; when you depart in the end, the Lord shall go along with you as your only
friend and companion. || 1 || He alone meditates on the Lord, unto whom He grants
His Grace. He continually chants the Lord‟s Chant; meditating on the Lord, one finds
peace. By Guru‟s Grace, the sublime essence of the Lord is obtained. Meditating on the
Lord, Har, Har, one is carried across. || 1 || Pause || The fearless, formless Lord —
the Name is Truth. To chant it is the most sublime and exalted activity in this world.
Doing so, the Messenger of Death, the evil enemy, is killed. Death does not even
approach the Lord‟s servant. || 2 || One whose mind is satisfied with the Lord — that
servant is known throughout the four ages, in all four directions. If some sinner speaks
evil of him, the Messenger of Death chews him up. || 3 || The One Pure Creator Lord
is in all. He stages all His wondrous plays, and watches them. Who can kill that person,
whom the Lord has saved? The Creator Lord Himself delivers him. || 4 || I chant the
Name of the Creator Lord, night and day. He saves all His servants and devotees.
Consult the eighteen Puraanas and the four Vedas; O servant Nanak, only the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, will deliver you. || 5 || 2 || 8 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

The earth, the Akaashic ethers and the stars abide in the Fear of God. The almighty
Order of the Lord is over the heads of all. Wind, water and fire abide in the Fear of God;
poor Indra abides in the Fear of God as well. || 1 || I have heard one thing, that the
One Lord alone is fearless. He alone is at peace, and he alone is embellished forever,
who meets with the Guru, and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
The embodied and the divine beings abide in the Fear of God. The Siddhas and seekers
die in the Fear of God. The 8.4 millions species of beings die, and die again, and are
born over and over again. 

They are consigned to reincarnation. || 2 || Those who embody the energies of
sattva—white light, raajas—red passion, and taamas—black darkness, abide in the Fear
of God, along with the many created forms. This miserable deceiver Maya abides in the
Fear of God; the Righteous Judge of Dharma is utterly afraid of Him as well. The entire
expanse of the Universe is in the Fear of God; only the Creator Lord is without this
Fear. Says Nanak, God is the companion of His devotees; His devotees look beautiful in
the Court of the Lord. || 4 || 1 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: The five year old orphan boy
Dhroo, by meditating in remembrance on the Lord, became stationary and permanent.
For the sake of his son, Ajaamal called out, “O Lord, Naaraayan”, who struck down and
killed the Messenger of Death. || 1 || My Lord and Master has saved many, countless
beings. I am meek, with little or no understanding, and unworthy; I seek protection at
the Lord‟s Door. || 1 || Pause || Baalmeek the outcaste was saved, and the poor
hunter was saved as well. The elephant remembered the Lord in his mind for an
instant, and so was carried across. || 2 || He saved His devotee Prahlaad, and tore
Harnaakhash with his nails. Bidar, the son of a slave-girl, was purified, and all his
generations were redeemed. || 3 || What sins of mine should I speak of? I am
intoxicated with false emotional attachment. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the
Lord; please, reach out and take me into Your embrace. || 4 || 2 || MARU, FIFTH
MEHL: For the sake of riches, I wandered around in so many ways; I rushed around,
making all sorts of efforts. The deeds I did in egotism and pride, have all been done in
vain. || 1 || Other days are of no use to me; please bless me with those days, O Dear
God, on which I may sing the Lord‟s Praises. || 1 || Pause || Gazing upon children,
spouse, household and possessions, one is entangled in these. Tasting the wine of
Maya, one is intoxicated, and never sings of the Lord, Har, Har. || 2 || In this way, I
have examined lots of methods, but without the Saints, it is not found. You are the
Great Giver, the great and almighty God; I have come to beg a gift from You. || 3 ||
Abandoning all pride and self-importance, I have sought the Sanctuary of the dust of
the feet of the Lord‟s slave. Says Nanak, meeting with the Lord, I have become one
with Him; I have found supreme bliss and peace. || 4 || 3 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: In
what place is the Name established? Where does egotism dwell? What injury have you
suffered, listening to abuse from someone else‟s mouth? || 1 || Listen: who are you,
and where did you come from? You don‟t even know how long you will stay here; you
have no hint of when you shall leave. || 1 || Pause || Wind and water have patience
and tolerance; the earth has compassion and forgiveness, no doubt. The union of the
five tattvas — the five elements — has brought you into being. Which of these is evil?
|| 2 || The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, formed your form; He also burdened
you with egotism. He alone is born and dies; He alone comes and goes. || 3 ||
Nothing of the color and the form of the creation shall remain; the entire expanse is
transitory. 

Prays Nanak, when He brings His play to its close, then only the One, the One Lord
remains. || 4 || 4 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Pride, emotional attachment, greed and
corruption are gone; I have not placed anything else, other than the Lord, within my
consciousness. I have purchased the jewel of the Naam and the Glorious Praises of the
Lord; loading this merchandise, I have set out on my journey. || 1 || The love which
the Lord‟s servant feels for the Lord lasts forever. In my life, I served my Lord and
Master, and as I depart, I keep Him enshrined in my consciousness. || 1 || Pause ||
I have not turned my face away from my Lord and Master‟s Command. He fills my
household with celestial peace and bliss; if He asks me to leave, I leave at once. || 2 ||
When I am under the Lord‟s Command, I find even hunger pleasurable; I know no
difference between sorrow and joy. Whatever the Command of my Lord and Master is, I
bow my forehead and accept it. || 3 || The Lord and Master has become merciful to
His servant; He has embellished both this world and the next. Blessed is that servant,
and fruitful is his birth; O Nanak, he realizes his Lord and Master. || 4 || 5 || MARU,
FIFTH MEHL: Good karma has dawned for me — my Lord and Master has become
merciful. I sing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. My struggle is ended; I
have found peace and tranquility. All my wanderings have ceased. || 1 || Now, I have
obtained the state of eternal life. The Primal Lord, the Architect of Destiny, has come
into my conscious mind; I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints. || 1 || Pause || Sexual
desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment are eradicated; all my enemies are
eliminated. He is always ever-present, here and now, watching over me; He is never far
away. || 2 || In peace and cool tranquility, my faith has been totally fulfilled; the
Saints are my Helpers and Support. He has purified the sinners in an instant; I cannot
express His Glorious Praises. || 3 || I have become fearless; all fear has departed.
The feet of the Lord of the Universe are my only Shelter. Nanak sings the Praises of his
Lord and Master; night and day, he is lovingly focused on Him. || 4 || 6 || MARU,
FIFTH MEHL: He is all-powerful, the Master of all virtues, but you never sing of Him!
You shall have to leave all this in an instant, but again and again, you chase after it. ||
1 || Why do you not contemplate your God? You are entangled in association with
your enemies, and the enjoyment of pleasures; your soul is burning up with them! || 1
|| Pause || Hearing His Name, the Messenger of Death will release you, and yet, you
do not enter His Sanctuary! Turn out this wretched jackal, and seek the Shelter of that
God. || 2 || Praising Him, you shall cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and yet, you
have not fallen in love with Him! This meager, short-lived dream, this thing — you are
engrossed in it, over and over again. || 3 || When our Lord and Master, the ocean of
mercy, grants His Grace, one finds honor in the Society of the Saints. Says Nanak, I am
rid of the illusion of the three-phased Maya, when God becomes my help and support.
|| 4 || 7 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: The Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, knows
everything; what can anyone hide from Him? 

Your hands and feet will fall off in an instant, when you are burnt in the fire. || 1 ||
You fool, you have forgotten the Lord from your mind! You eat His salt, and then you
are untrue to Him; before your very eyes, you shall be torn apart. || 1 || Pause ||
The incurable disease has arisen in your body; it cannot be removed or overcome.
Forgetting God, one endures utter agony; this is the essence of reality which Nanak has
realized. || 2 || 8 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: I have enshrined the lotus feet of God
within my consciousness. I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, continually,
continuously. There is none other than Him at all. He alone exists, in the beginning, in
the middle, and in the end. || 1 || He Himself is the Shelter of the Saints. || 1 ||
Pause || The entire universe is under His control. He Himself, the Formless Lord, is
Himself by Himself. Nanak holds tight to that True Lord. He has found peace, and shall
never suffer pain again. || 2 || 9 ||

MARU, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

He is the Giver of peace to the breath of life, the Giver of life to the soul; how can you
forget Him, you ignorant person? You taste the weak, insipid wine, and you have gone
insane. You have uselessly wasted this precious human life. || 1 || O man, such is the
foolishness you practice. Renouncing the Lord, the Support of the earth, you wander,
deluded by doubt; you are engrossed in emotional attachment, associating with Maya,
the slave-girl. || 1 || Pause || Abandoning the Lord, the Support of the earth, you
serve her of lowly ancestry, and you pass you life acting egotistically. You do useless
deeds, you ignorant person; this is why you are called a blind, self-willed manmukh. ||
2 || That which is true, you believe to be untrue; what is transitory, you believe to be
permanent. You grasp as your own, what belongs to others; in such delusions you are
deluded. || 3 || The Kh‟shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas all cross over,
through the Name of the One Lord. Guru Nanak speaks the Teachings; whoever listens
to them is carried across. || 4 || 1 || 10 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: You may act in
secrecy, but God is still with you; you can only deceive other people. Forgetting your
Dear Lord, you enjoy corrupt pleasures, and so you shall have to embrace red-hot
pillars. || 1 || O man, why do you go out to the households of others? You filthy,
heartless, lustful donkey! Haven‟t you heard of the Righteous Judge of Dharma? || 1 ||
Pause || The stone of corruption is tied around your neck, and the load of slander is
on your head. You must cross over the vast open ocean, but you cannot cross over to
the other side. || 2 || You are engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional
attachment; you have turned your eyes away from the Truth. You cannot even raise
your head above the water of the vast, impassable sea of Maya. || 3 || The sun is
liberated, and the moon is liberated; the God-realized being is pure and untouched. His
inner nature is like that of fire, untouched and forever immaculate. || 4 || When good
karma dawns, the wall of doubt is torn down. 

He lovingly accepts the Guru‟s Will. One who is blessed with the medicine of the
GurMantra, the Name of the Lord, O servant Nanak, does not suffer the agonies of
reincarnation. || 5 || 2 || O man, in this way, you shall cross over to the other side.
Meditate on your Dear Lord, and be dead to the world; renounce your love of duality.
|| Second Pause || 2 || 11 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: I have quit searching outside;
the Guru has shown me that God is within the home of my own heart. I have seen God,
fearless, of wondrous beauty; my mind shall never leave Him to go anywhere else. || 1
|| I have found the jewel; I have found the Perfect Lord. The invaluable value cannot
be obtained; in His Mercy, the Guru bestows it. || 1 || Pause || The Supreme Lord
God is imperceptible and unfathomable; meeting the Holy Saint, I speak the Unspoken
Speech. The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates and resounds in the Tenth
Gate; the Ambrosial Naam trickles down there. || 2 || I lack nothing; the thirsty
desires of my mind are satisfied. The inexhaustible treasure has entered into my being.
I serve the feet, the feet, the feet of the Guru, and manage the unmanageable. I have
found the juice, the sublime essence. || 3 || Intuitively I come, and intuively I go; my
mind intuitively plays. Says Nanak, when the Guru drives out doubt, then the soul-bride
enters the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. || 4 || 3 || 12 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL:
You feel no love for the One who created and embellished you. The seed, planted out
season, does not germinate; it does not produce flower or fruit. || 1 || O mind, this is
the time to plant the seed of the Name. Focus your mind, and cultivate this crop; at the
proper time, make this your purpose. || 1 || Pause || Eradicate the stubbornness
and doubt of your mind, and go to the Sanctuary of the True Guru. He alone does such
deeds, who has such pre-ordained karma. || 2 || He falls in love with the Lord of the
Universe, and his efforts are approved. My crop has germinated, and it shall never be
used up. || 3 || I have obtained the priceless wealth, which shall never leave me or
go anywhere else. Says Nanak, I have found peace; I am satisfied and fulfilled. || 4 ||
4 || 13 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: The egg of doubt has burst; my mind has been
enlightened. The Guru has shattered the shackles on my feet, and has set me free. || 1
|| My coming and going in reincarnation is ended. The boiling cauldron has cooled
down; the Guru has blessed me with the cooling, soothing Naam, the Name of the Lord.
|| 1 || Pause || Since I joined the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, those
who were eyeing me have left. The one who tied me up, has released me; what can the
Watchman of Death do to me now? || 2 || The load of my karma has been removed,
and I am now free of karma. I have crossed the world-ocean, and reached the other
shore; the Guru has blessed me with this Dharma. || 3 || True is my place, and True
is my seat; I have made Truth my life‟s purpose. True is my capital, and True is the
merchandise, which Nanak has placed into the home of the heart. || 4 || 5 || 14 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL: 

The Pandit, the religious scholar, proclaims the Vedas, but he is slow to act on them.
Another person on silence sits alone, but his heart is tied in knots of desire. Another
becomes an Udaasi, a renunciate; he abandons his home and walks out on his family,
but his wandering impulses do not leave him. || 1 || Who can I tell about the state of
my soul? Where can I find such a person who is liberated, and who can unite me with
my God? || 1 || Pause || Someone may practice intensive meditation, and discipline
his body, but his mind still runs around in ten directions. The celibate practices celibacy,
but his heart is filled with pride. The Sannyaasi wanders around at sacred shrines of
pilgrimage, but his mindless anger is still within him. || 2 || The temple dancers tie
bells around their ankles to earn their living. Others go on fasts, take vows, perform the
six rituals and wear religious robes for show. Some sing songs and melodies and
hymns, but their minds do not sing of the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || The Lord‟s Saints are
immaculately pure; they are beyond pleasure and pain, beyond greed and attachment.
My mind obtains the dust of their feet, when the Lord God shows mercy. Says Nanak, I
met the Perfect Guru, and then the anxiety of my mind was removed. || 4 || My
Sovereign Lord is the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. The Beloved of my soul
knows everything; all trivial talk is forgotten. || 1 || Second Pause || 6 || 15 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL: One who has Your Name in his heart is the king of all the
hundreds of thousands and millions of beings. Those, whom my True Guru has not
blessed with Your Name, are poor idiots, who die and are reborn. || 1 || My True
Guru protects and preserves my honor. When You come to mind, Lord, then I obtain
perfect honor. Forgetting You, I roll in the dust. || 1 || Pause || The mind‟s
pleasures of love and beauty bring just as many blames and sins. The Name of the Lord
is the treasure of Emancipation; it is absolute peace and poise. || 2 || The pleasures
of Maya fade away in an instant, like the shade of a passing cloud. They alone are dyed
in the deep crimson of the Lord‟s Love, who meet the Guru, and sing the Praises of the
Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || My Lord and Master is lofty and exalted, grand and infinite. The
Darbaar of His Court is inaccessible. Through the Naam, glorious greatness and respect
are obtained; O Nanak, my Lord and Master is my Beloved. || 4 || 7 || 16 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE:

The One Universal Creator Lord created the creation. He made all the days and the
nights. The forests, meadows, three worlds, water, the four Vedas, the four sources of
creation, the countries, the continents and all the worlds, have all come from the One
Word of the Lord. || 1 || Hey — understand the Creator Lord. If you meet the True
Guru, then you‟ll understand. || 1 || Pause || He formed the expanse of the entire
universe from the three gunas, the three qualities. People are incarnated in heaven and
in hell. In egotism, they come and go. 

The mind cannot hold still, even for an instant. Without the Guru, there is only pitch
darkness. Meeting with the True Guru, one is emancipated. || 2 || All the deeds done
in egotism, are just chains around the neck. Harboring self-conceit and self-interest is
just like placing chains around one‟s ankles. He alone meets with the Guru, and realizes
the One Lord, who has such destiny written on his forehead. || 3 || He alone meets
the Lord, who is pleasing to His Mind. He alone is deluded, who is deluded by God. No
one, by himself, is ignorant or wise. He alone chants the Naam, whom the Lord inspires
to do so. You have no end or limitation. Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to You. ||
4 || 1 || 17 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Maya, the enticer, has enticed the world of the
three gunas, the three qualities. The false world is engrossed in greed. Crying out,
“Mine, mine!” they collect possessions, but in the end, they are all deceived. || 1 ||
The Lord is fearless, formless and merciful. He is the Cherisher of all beings and
creatures. || 1 || Pause || Some collect wealth, and bury it in the ground. Some
cannot abandon wealth, even in their dreams. The king exercises his power, and fills his
money-bags, but this fickle companion will not go along with him. || 2 || Some love
this wealth even more than their body and breath of life. Some collect it, forsaking their
fathers and mothers. Some hide it from their children, friends and siblings, but it will
not remain with them. || 3 || Some become hermits, and sit in meditative trances.
Some are Yogis, celibates, religious scholars and thinkers. Some dwell in homes,
graveyards, cremation grounds and forests; but Maya still clings to them there. || 4 ||
When the Lord and Master releases one from his bonds, the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, comes to dwell in his soul. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, His
humble servants are liberated; O Nanak, they are redeemed and enraptured by the
Lord‟s Glance of Grace. || 5 || 2 || 18 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Meditate in
remembrance on the One Immaculate Lord. No one is turned away from Him emptyhanded. He cherished and preserved you in your mother‟s womb; He blessed you with
body and soul, and embellished you. Each and every instant, meditate on that Creator
Lord. Meditating in remembrance on Him, all faults and mistakes are covered. Enshrine
the Lord‟s lotus feet deep within the nucleus of your self. Save your soul from the
waters of corruption. Your cries and shrieks shall be ended; meditating on the Lord of
the Universe, your doubts and fears shall be dispelled. Rare is that being, who finds the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Nanak is a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. || 1 ||
The Lord‟s Name is the support of my mind and body. Whoever meditates on Him is
emancipated. || 1 || Pause || He believes that the false thing is true. The ignorant
fool falls in love with it. He is intoxicated with the wine of sexual desire, anger and
greed; he loses this human life in exchance for a mere shell. He abandons his own, and
loves that of others. His mind and body are permeated with the intoxication of Maya.
His thirsty desires are not quenched, although he indulges in pleasures. His hopes are
not fulfilled, and all his words are false. He comes alone, and he goes alone. 

False is all his talk of me and you. The Lord Himself administers the poisonous potion,
to mislead and delude. O Nanak, the the karma of past actions cannot be erased. || 2
|| Beasts, birds, demons and ghosts — in these many ways, the false wander in
reincarnation. Wherever they go, they cannot remain there. They have no place of rest;
they rise up again and again and run around. Their minds and bodies are filled with
immense, expansive desires. The poor wretches are cheated by egotism. They are filled
with countless sins, and are severely punished. The extent of this cannot be estimated.
Forgetting God, they fall into hell. There are no mothers there, no siblings, no friends
and no spouses. Those humble beings, unto whom the Lord and Master becomes
Merciful, O Nanak, cross over. || 3 || Rambling and roaming, wandering around, I
came to seek the Sanctuary of God. He is the Master of the meek, the father and
mother of the world. The Merciful Lord God is the Destroyer of sorrow and suffering. He
emancipates whoever He pleases. He lifts them up and pulls him out of the deep dark
pit. Emancipation comes through loving devotional worship. The Holy Saint is the very
embodiment of the Lord‟s form. He Himself saves us from the great fire. By myself, I
cannot practice meditation, austerities, penance and self-discipline. In the beginning
and in the end, God is inaccessible and unfathomable. Please bless me with Your Name,
Lord; Your slave begs only for this. O Nanak, my Lord God is the Giver of the true state
of life. || 4 || 3 || 19 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Why do you try to deceive others, O
people of the world? The Fascinating Lord is Merciful to the meek. || 1 || This is what
I have come to know. The brave and heroic Guru, the Generous Giver, gives Sanctuary
and preserves our honor. || 1 || Pause || He submits to the Will of His devotees; He
is forever and ever the Giver of peace. || 2 || Please bless me with Your Mercy, that I
may meditate on Your Name alone. || 3 || Nanak, the meek and humble, begs for the
Naam, the Name of the Lord; it eradicates duality and doubt. || 4 || 4 || 20 || MARU,
FIFTH MEHL: My Lord and Master is utterly powerful. I am just His poor servant. || 1
|| My Enticing Beloved is very dear to my mind and my breath of life. He blesses me
with His gift. || 1 || Pause || I have seen and tested all. There is none other than
Him. || 2 || He sustains and nurtures all beings. He was, and shall always be. || 3 ||
Please bless me with Your Mercy, O Divine Lord, and link Nanak to Your service. || 4 ||
5 || 21 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: The Redeemer of sinners, who carries us across; I am
a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice to Him. If only I could meet with such a
Saint, who would inspire me to meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, Har. || 1 || No one
knows me; I am called Your slave. This is my support and sustenance. || 1 || Pause
|| You support and cherish all; I am meek and humble — this is my only prayer. You
alone know Your Way; You are the water, and I am the fish. || 2 || O Perfect and
Expansive Lord and Master, I follow You in love. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1006 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O God, You are pervading all the worlds, solar systems and galaxies. || 3 || You are
eternal and unchanging, imperishable, invisible and infinite, O divine fascinating Lord.
Please bless Nanak with the gift of the Society of the Saints, and the dust of the feet of
Your slaves. || 4 || 6 || 22 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: The Saints are fulfilled and
satisfied; they know the Guru‟s Mantra and the Teachings. They cannot even be
described; they are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. || 1 || My Beloved is a priceless jewel. His Name is unattainable and
immeasurable. || 1 || Pause || One whose mind is satisfied believing in the
imperishable Lord God, becomes Gurmukh and attains the essence of spiritual wisdom.
He sees all in his meditation. He banishes egotistical pride from his mind. || 2 ||
Permanent is the place of those who, through the Guru, realize the Mansion of the
Lord‟s Presence. Meeting the Guru, they remain awake and aware night and day; they
are committed to the Lord‟s service. || 3 || They are perfectly fulfilled and satisfied,
intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi. The Lord‟s treasure comes into their hands; O Nanak,
through the Guru, they attain it. || 4 || 7 || 23 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL, SIXTH HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

Abandon all your clever tricks; meet with the Holy, and renounce your egotistical pride.
Everything else is false; with your tongue, chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. ||
1 || O my mind, with your ears, listen to the Name of the Lord. The sins of your many
past lifetimes shall be washed away; then, what can the wretched Messenger of Death
do to you? || 1 || Pause || Pain, poverty and fear shall not afflict you, and you shall
find peace and pleasure. By Guru‟s Grace, Nanak speaks; meditation on the Lord is the
essence of spiritual wisdom. || 2 || 1 || 24 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Those who have
forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord — I have seen them reduced to dust. The
love of children and friends, and the pleasures of married life are torn apart. || 1 || O
my mind, continually, continuously chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. You shall
not burn in the ocean of fire, and your mind and body shall be blessed with peace. || 1
|| Pause || Like the shade of a tree, these things shall pass away, like the clouds
blown away by the wind. Meeting with the Holy, devotional worship to the Lord is
implanted within; O Nanak, only this shall work for you. || 2 || 2 || 25 || MARU,
FIFTH MEHL: The perfect, primal Lord is the Giver of peace; He is always with you. He
does not die, and he does not come or go in reincarnation. He does not perish, and He
is not affected by heat or cold. || 1 || O my mind, be in love with the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. Within the mind, think of the Lord, Har, Har, the treasure. This is the
purest way of life. || 1 || Pause || Whoever meditates on the merciful
compassionate Lord, the Lord of the Universe, is successful. He is always new, fresh
and young, clever and beautiful; Nanak‟s mind is pierced through with His Love. || 2 ||
3 || 26 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: While walking and sitting, sleeping and waking,
contemplate within your heart the GurMantra. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1007 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Run to the Lord‟s lotus feet, and join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Cross
over the terrifying world-ocean, and reach the other side. || 1 || O my mind, enshrine
the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your heart. Love the Lord, and commit your
mind and body to Him; forget everything else. || 1 || Pause || Soul, mind, body and
breath of life belong to God; eliminate your self-conceit. Meditate, vibrate on the Lord of
the Universe, and all your desires shall be fulfilled; O Nanak, you shall never be
defeated. || 2 || 4 || 27 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: Renounce your self-conceit, and the
fever shall depart; become the dust of the feet of the Holy. He alone receives Your
Name, Lord, whom You bless with Your Mercy. || 1 || O my mind, drink in the
Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Abandon other bland, insipid
tastes; become immortal, and live throughout the ages. || 1 || Pause || Savor the
essence of the One and only Naam; love the Naam, focus and attune yourself to the
Naam. Nanak has made the One Lord his only friend, companion and relative. || 2 || 5
|| 28 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: He nourishes and preserves mortals in the womb of the
mother, so that the fiery heat does not hurt them. That Lord and Master protects us
here. Understand this in your mind. || 1 || O my mind, take the Support of the Naam,
the Name of the Lord. Understand the One who created you; the One God is the Cause
of causes. || 1 || Pause || Remember the One Lord in your mind, renounce your
clever tricks, and give up all your religious robes. Meditating in remembrance forever on
the Lord, Har, Har, O Nanak, countless beings have been saved. || 2 || 6 || 29 ||
MARU, FIFTH MEHL: His Name is the Purifier of sinners; He is the Master of the
masterless. In the vast and terrifying world-ocean, he is the raft for those who have
such destiny inscribed on their foreheads. || 1 || Without the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, huge numbers of companions have drowned. Even if someone does not
remember the Lord, the Cause of causes, still, the Lord reaches out with His hand, and
saves him. || 1 || Pause || In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, chant the
Glorious Praises of the Lord, and take the Path of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord.
Shower me with Your Mercy, O Lord; listening to Your sermon, Nanak lives. || 2 || 7 ||
30 ||
MARU, ANJULEE ~ WITH HANDS CUPPED IN PRAYER, FIFTH MEHL,
SEVENTH HOUSE:

Union and separation are ordained by the Primal Lord God. The puppet is made from
the five elements. By the Command of the Dear Lord King, the soul came and entered
into the body. || 1 || In that place, where the fire rages like an oven, in that darkness
where the body lies face down — there, one remembers his Lord and Master with each
and every breath, and then he is rescued. || 2 || Then, one comes out from within
the womb, and forgetting his Lord and Master, he attaches his consciousness to the
world. He comes and goes, and wanders in reincarnation; he cannot remain anywhere.
|| 3 || The Merciful Lord Himself emancipates. He created and established all beings
and creatures. Those who depart after having been victorious in this priceless human
life —
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1008 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, their coming into the world is approved. || 4 || 1 || 31 || The One Lord
alone is our help and support; neither physician nor friend, nor sister nor brother can be
this. || 1 || His actions alone come to pass; He washes off the filth of sins. Meditate in
remembrance on that Supreme Lord. || 2 || He abides in each and every heart, and
dwells in all; His seat and place are eternal. || 3 || He does not come or go, and He is
always with us. His actions are perfect. || 4 || He is the Savior and the Protector of
His devotees. The Saints live by meditating on God, the support of the breath of life.
The Almighty Lord and Master is the Cause of causes; Nanak is a sacrifice to Him. || 5

MARU, NINTH MEHL:
The Name of the Lord is forever the Giver of peace. Meditating in remembrance on it,
Ajaamal was saved, and Ganika the prostitute was emancipated. || 1 || Pause ||
Dropadi the princess of Panchaala remembered the Lord‟s Name in the royal court. The
Lord, the embodiment of mercy, removed her suffering; thus His own glory was
increased. || 1 || That man, who sings the Praise of the Lord, the treasure of mercy,
has the help and support of the Lord. Says Nanak, I have come to rely on this. I seek
the Sanctuary of the Lord. || 2 || 1 || MARU, NINTH MEHL: What should I do now,
O mother? I have wasted my whole life in sin and corruption; I never remembered the
Lord. || 1 || Pause || When Death places the noose around my neck, then I lose all
my senses. Now, in this disaster, other than the Name of the Lord, who will be my help
and support? || 1 || That wealth, which he believes to be his own, in an instant,
belongs to another. Says Nanak, this still really bothers my mind — I never sang the
Praises of the Lord. || 2 || 2 || MARU, NINTH MEHL: O my mother, I have not
renounced the pride of my mind. I have wasted my life intoxicated with Maya; I have
not focused myself in meditation on the Lord. || 1 || Pause || When Death‟s club
falls on my head, then I will be wakened from my sleep. But what good will it do to
repent at that time? I cannot escape by running away. || 1 || When this anxiety
arises in the heart, then, one comes to love the Guru‟s feet. My life becomes fruitful, O
Nanak, only when I am absorbed in the Praises of God. || 2 || 3 ||
MARU, ASHTAPADEES, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

Reciting and listening to the Vedas and the Puraanas, countless wise men have grown
weary. So many in their various religious robes have grown weary, wandering to the
sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage. The True Lord and Master is immaculate and
pure. The mind is satisfied only by the One Lord. || 1 || You are eternal; You do not
grow old. All others pass away. One who lovingly focuses on the Naam, the source of
nectar — his pains are taken away. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1009 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || Pause || Study the Lord‟s Name, and understand the Lord‟s Name; follow the
Guru‟s Teachings, and through the Naam, you shall be saved. Perfect are the Teachings
of the Perfect Guru; contemplate the Perfect Word of the Shabad. The Lord‟s Name is
the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and the Eradicator of sinful residues. || 2
|| The blind ignorant mortal stirs the water and churns the water, wishing to obtain
butter. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, one churns the cream, and the treasure of the
Ambrosial Naam is obtained. The self-willed manmukh is a beast; he does not know the
essence of reality that is contained within himself. || 3 || Dying in egotism and selfconceit, one dies, and dies again, only to be reincarnated over and over again. 

But when he dies in the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, then he does not die, ever again.
When he follows the Guru‟s Teachings, and enshrines the Lord, the Life of the World,
within his mind, he redeems all his generations. || 4 || The Naam, the Name of the
Lord, is the true object, the true commodity. The Naam is the only true profit in this
world. Follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and contemplate it. To work in the love of duality,
brings constant loss in this world. || 5 || True is one‟s association, true is one‟s place,
and true is one‟s hearth and home, when one has the support of the Naam.
Contemplating the True Word of the Guru‟s Bani, and the True Word of the Shabad,
one becomes content. || 6 || Enjoying princely pleasures, one shall be destroyed in
pain and pleasure. Adopting a name of greatness, one strings heavy sins around his
neck. Mankind cannot give gifts; You alone are the Giver of everything. || 7 || You
are inaccessible and unfathomable; O Lord, You are imperishable and infinite. Through
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, seeking at the Lord‟s Door, one finds the treasure of
liberation. O Nanak, this union is not broken, if one deals in the merchandise of Truth.
|| 8 || 1 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: The boat is loaded with sin and corruption, and
launched into the sea. The shore cannot be seen on this side, nor on the shore beyond.
There are no oars, nor any boatmen, to cross over the terrifying world-ocean. || 1 ||
O Baba, the world is caught in the great noose. By Guru‟s Grace, they are saved,
contemplating the True Name. || 1 || Pause || The True Guru is the boat; the Word
of the Shabad will carry them across. There is neither wind nor fire, neither water nor
form there. The True Name of the True Lord is there; it carries them across the
terrifying world-ocean. || 2 || The Gurmukhs reach the shore beyond, lovingly
focusing on the True Lord. Their comings and goings are ended, and their light merges
into the Light. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, intuitive peace wells up within them, and
they remain merged in the True Lord. || 3 || The snake may be locked in a basket,
but it is still poisonous, and the anger within its mind remains. One obtains what is preordained; why does he blame others? If one, as Gurmukh, hears and believes in the
Name, the charm against poison, his mind becomes content. || 4 || The crocodile is
caught by the hook and line; caught in the trap of evil-mindedness, he regrets and
repents, again and again. He does not understand birth and death; the inscription of
one‟s past actions cannot be erased. || 5 || Injecting the poison of egotism, the world
was created; with the Shabad enshrined within, the poison is eliminated. Old age
cannot torment one who remains lovingly absorbed in the True Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1010 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He alone is called Jivan-Mikta, liberated while yet alive, from within whom egotism is
eradicated. || 6 || The world is chasing after worldly affairs; caught and bound, it
does not understand contemplative meditation. The foolish, ignorant, self-willed
manmukh has forgotten birth and death. Those whom the Guru has protected are
saved, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. || 7 || In the cage of divine love,
the parrot, speaks. It pecks at the Truth, and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar; it flies
away, only once. Meeting with the Guru, one recognizes his Lord and Master; says
Nanak, he finds the gate of liberation. || 8 || 2 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: One who dies
in the Word of the Shabad conquers death; otherwise, where can you run? Through the
Fear of God, fear runs away; His Name is Ambrosial Nectar. You alone kill and protect;
except for You, there is no place at all. || 1 || O Baba, I am filthy, shallow and totally
without understanding. Without the Naam, no one is anything; the Perfect Guru has
made my intellect perfect. || 1 || Pause || I am full of faults, and I have no virtue at
all. Without virtues, how can I go home? Through the Word of the Shabad, intuitive
peace wells up; without good destiny, the wealth is not obtained. Those whose minds
are not filled with the Naam are bound and gagged, and suffer in pain. || 2 || Those
who have forgotten the Naam — why have they even come into the world? Here and
hereafter, they do not find any peace; they have loaded their carts with ashes. Those
who are separated, do not meet with the Lord; they suffer in terrible pain at Death‟s
Door. || 3 || I do not know what will happen in the world hereafter; I am so confused
— please teach me, Lord! I am confused; I would fall at the feet of one who shows me
the Way. Without the Guru, there is no giver at all; His value cannot be described. || 4
|| If I see my friend, then I will embrace Him; I have sent Him the letter of Truth. His
soul-bride stands waiting expectantly; as Gurmukh, I see Him with my eyes. By the
Pleasure of Your Will, You abide in my mind, and bless me with Your Glance of Grace.
|| 5 || One who is wandering hungry and thirsty — what can he give, and what can
anyone ask from him? I cannot conceive of any other, who can bless my mind and body
with perfection. The One who created me takes care of me; He Himself blesses me with
glory. || 6 || In the body-village is my Lord and Master, whose body is ever-new,
Innocent and child-like, incomparably playful. He is neither a woman, nor a man, nor a
bird; the True Lord is so wise and beautiful. Whatever pleases Him, happens; You are
the lamp, and You are the incense. || 7 || He hears the songs and tastes the flavors,
but these flavors are useless and insipid, and bring only disease to the body. One who
loves the Truth and speaks the Truth, escapes from the sorrow of separation. Nanak
does not forget the Naam; whatever happens is by the Lord‟s Will. || 8 || 3 || MARU,
FIRST MEHL: Practice Truth — other greed and attachments are useless. The True
Lord has fascinated this mind, and my tongue enjoys the taste of Truth. Without the
Name, there is no juice; the others depart, loaded with poison. || 1 || I am such a
slave of Yours, O my Beloved Lord and Master. I walk in harmony with Your Command,
O my True, Sweet Beloved. || 1 || Pause || Night and day, the slave works for his
overlord. I have sold my mind for the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; my mind is comforted
and consoled by the Shabad. 

The Perfect Guru is honored and celebrated; He has taken away the pains of my mind.
|| 2 || I am the servant and slave of my Master; what glorious greatness of His can I
describe? The Perfect Master, by the Pleasure of His Will, forgives, and then one
practices Truth. I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who re-unites the separated ones. || 3 ||
The intellect of His servant and slave is noble and true; it is made so by the Guru‟s
intellect. The intuition of those who are true is beautiful; the intellect of the self-willed
manmukh is insipid. My mind and body belong to You, God; from the very beginning,
Truth has been my only support. || 4 || In Truth I sit and stand; I eat and speak the
Truth. With Truth in my consciousness, I gather the wealth of Truth, and drink in the
sublime essence of Truth. In the home of Truth, the True Lord protects me; I speak the
Words of the Guru‟s Teachings with love. || 5 || The self-willed manmukh is very lazy;
he is trapped in the wilderness. He is drawn to the bait, and continually pecking at it, he
is trapped; his link to the Lord is ruined. By Guru‟s Grace, one is liberated, absorbed in
the primal trance of Truth. || 6 || His slave remains continually pierced through with
love and affection for God. Without the True Lord, the soul of the false, corrupt person
is burnt to ashes. Abandoning all evil actions, he crosses over in the boat of Truth. || 7
|| Those who have forgotten the Naam have no home, no place of rest. The Lord‟s
slave renounces greed and attachment, and obtains the Lord‟s Name. If You forgive
him, Lord, then He is united with You; Nanak is a sacrifice. || 8 || 4 || MARU, FIRST
MEHL: The Lord‟s slave renounces his egotistical pride, through the Guru‟s Fear,
intuitively and easily. The slave realizes his Lord and Master; glorious is his greatness!
Meeting with his Lord and Master, he finds peace; His value cannot be desribed. || 1 ||
I am the slave and servant of my Lord and Master; all glory is to my Master. By Guru‟s
Grace, I am saved, in the Sanctuary of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || The slave has been
given the most excellent task, by the Primal Command of the Master. The slave realizes
the Hukam of His Command, and submits to His Will forever. The Lord King Himself
grants forgiveness; how glorious is His greatness! || 2 || He Himself is True, and
everything is True; this is revealed through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. He alone
serves You, whom You have enjoined to do so. Without serving Him, no one finds Him;
in duality and doubt, they are ruined. || 3 || How could we forget Him from our
minds? The gifts which he bestows increase day by day. Soul and body, all belong to
Him; He infused the breath into us. If he shows His Mercy, then we serve Him; serving
Him, we merge in Truth. || 4 || He alone is the Lord‟s slave, who remains dead while
yet alive, and eradicates egotism from within. His bonds are broken, the fire of his
desire is quenched, and he is liberated. The treasure of the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, is within all, but how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, obtain it. || 5 || Within
the Lord‟s slave, there is no virtue at all; the Lord‟s slave is totally unworthy. There is
no Giver as great as You, Lord; You alone are the Forgiver. Your slave obeys the Hukam
of Your Command; this is the most excellent action. || 6 || The Guru is the pool of
nectar in the world-ocean; whatever one desires, that fruit is obtained. 

The treasure of the Naam brings immortality; enshrine it in your heart and mind.
Serving the Guru, eternal peace is obtained, by those whom the Lord inspires to obey
the Hukam of His Command. || 7 || Gold and silver, and all metals, mix with dust in
the end. Without the Name, nothing goes along with you; the True Guru has imparted
this understanding. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam are immaculate and
pure; they remain merged in the Truth. || 8 || 5 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: The Order
is issued, and he cannot remain; the permit to stay has been torn up. This mind is tied
to its faults; it suffers terrible pain in its body. The Perfect Guru forgives all the mistakes
of the beggar at His Door. || 1 || How can he stay here? He must get up and depart.
Contemplate the Word of the Shabad, and understand this. He alone is united, whom
You, O Lord, unite. Such is the Primal Command of the Infinite Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
As You keep me, I remain; whatever You give me, I eat. As You lead me, I follow, with
the Ambrosial Name in my mouth. All glorious greatness rests in the hands of my Lord
and Master; my mind yearns to unite with You. || 2 || Why should anyone praise any
other created being? That Lord acts and sees. The One who created me, abides within
my mind; there is no other at all. So praise that True Lord, and you shall be blessed
with true honor. || 3 || The Pandit, the religious scholar, reads, but does not reach
the Lord; he is totally entangled in worldly affairs. He keeps the company of both virtue
and vice, tormented by hunger and the Messenger of Death. One who is protected by
the Perfect Lord, forgets separation and fear. || 4 || They alone are perfect, O
Siblings of Destiny, whose honor is certified. Perfect is the intellect of the Perfect Lord.
True is His glorious greatness. His gifts never run short, although those who receive
may grow weary of receiving. || 5 || Searching the salty sea, one finds the pearl. It
looks beautiful for a few days, but in the end, it is eaten away by dust. If one serves
the Guru, the ocean of Truth, the gifts one receives never run short. || 6 || They
alone are pure, who are pleasing to my God; all others are soiled with filth. The filthy
become pure, when they meet with the Guru, the Philosopher‟s Stone. Who can
estimate the value of the color of the true jewel? || 7 || Wearing religious robes, the
Lord is not obtained, nor is He obtained by giving donations at sacred shrines of
pilgrimage. Go and ask the readers of the Vedas; without faith, the world is cheated. O
Nanak, he alone values the jewel, who is blessed with the spiritual wisdom of the
Perfect Guru. || 8 || 6 || MARU, FIFTH MEHL: The self-willed manmukh, in a fit of
passion, abandons his home, and is ruined; then, he spies on the homes of others. He
neglects his household duties, and does not meet with the True Guru; he is caught in
the whirlpool of evil-mindedness. Wandering in foreign lands and reading scriptures, he
grows weary, and his thirsty desires only increase. His perishable body does not
remember the Word of the Shabad; like a beast, he fills his belly. || 1 || O Baba, this
is the way of life of the Sannyaasi, the renunciate. Through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, he is to enshrine love for the One Lord. Imbued with Your Name, Lord, he
remains satisfied and fulfilled. || 1 || Pause || He dyes his robes with saffron dye,
and wearing these robes, he goes out begging. Tearing his robes, he makes a patched
coat, and puts the money in his wallet. From house to house he goes begging, and tries
to teach the world; but his mind is blind, and so he loses his honor. He is deluded by
doubt, and does not remember the Word of the Shabad. 

He loses his life in the gamble. || 2 || Without the Guru, the fire within is not
quenched; and outside, the fire still burns. Without serving the Guru, there is no
devotional worship. How can anyone, by himself, know the Lord? Slandering others,
one lives in hell; within him is hazy darkness. Wandering to the eixty-eight sacred
shrines of pilgrimage, he is ruined. How can the filth of sin be washed away? || 3 ||
He sifts through the dust, and applies ashes to his body, but he is searching for the
path of Maya‟s wealth. Inwardly and outwardly, he does not know the One Lord; if
someone tells him the Truth, he grows angry. He reads the scriptures, but tells lies;
such is the intellect of one who has no guru. Without chanting the Naam, how can he
find peace? Without the Name, how can he look good? || 4 || Some shave their
heads, some keep their hair in matted tangles; some keep it in braids, while some keep
silent, filled with egotistical pride. Their minds waver and wander in ten directions,
without loving devotion and enlightenment of the soul. They abandon the Ambrosial
Nectar, and drink the deadly poison, driven mad by Maya. Past actions cannot be
erased; without understanding the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, they become beasts.
|| 5 || With bowl in hand, wearing his patched coat, great desires well up in his mind.
Abandoning his own wife, he is engrossed in sexual desire; his thoughts are on the
wives of others. He teaches and preaches, but does not contemplate the Shabad; he is
bought and sold on the street. With poison within, he pretends to be free of doubt; he
is ruined and humiliated by the Messenger of Death. || 6 || He alone is a Sannyaasi,
who serves the True Guru, and removes his self-conceit from within. He does not ask
for clothes or food; without asking, he accepts whatever he receives. He does not speak
empty words; he gathers in the wealth of tolerance, and burns away his anger with the
Naam. Blessed is such a householder, Sannyaasi and Yogi, who focuses his
consciousness on the Lord‟s feet. || 7 || Amidst hope, the Sannyaasi remains
unmoved by hope; he remains lovingly focused on the One Lord. He drinks in the
sublime essence of the Lord, and so finds peace and tranquility; in the home of his own
being, he remains absorbed in the deep trance of meditation. His mind does not waver;
as Gurmukh, he understands. He restrains it from wandering out. Following the Guru‟s
Teachings, he searches the home of his body, and obtains the wealth of the Naam. || 8
|| Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva are exalted, imbued with contemplative meditation on
the Naam. The sources of creation, speech, the heavens and the underworld, all beings
and creatures, are infused with Your Light. All comforts and liberation are found in the
Naam, and the vibrations of the Guru‟s Bani; I have enshrined the True Name within my
heart. Without the Naam, no one is saved; O Nanak, with the Truth, cross over to the
other side. || 9 || 7 || MARU, FIRST MEHL: Through the union of mother and father,
the fetus is formed. The egg and sperm join together to make the body. Upside-down
within the womb, it lovingly dwells on the Lord; God provides for it, and gives it
nourishment there. || 1 || How can he cross over the terrifying world-ocean? The
Gurmukh obtains the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord; the unbearable load of
sins is removed. || 1 || Pause || I have forgotten Your Virtues, Lord; I am insane —
what can I do now? You are the Merciful Giver, above the heads of all. Day and night,
You give gifts, and take care of all. || 2 || One is born to achieve the four great
objectives of life. 

The spirit has taken up its home in the material world. Driven by hunger, it sees the
path of Maya‟s riches; this emotional attachment takes away the treasure of liberation.
|| 3 || Weeping and wailing, he does not receive them; he searches here and there,
and grows weary. Engrossed in sexual desire, anger and egotism, he falls in love with
his false relatives. || 4 || He eats and enjoys, listens and watches, and dresses up to
show off in this house of death. Without the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, he does not
undersand himself. Without the Lord‟s Name, death cannot be avoided. || 5 || The
more attachment and egotism delude and confuse him, the more he cries out, “Mine,
mine!”, and the more he loses out. His body and wealth pass away, and he is torn by
skepticism and cynicism; in the end, he regrets and repents, when the dust falls on his
face. || 6 || He grows old, his body and youth waste away, and his throat is plugged
with mucous; water flows from his eyes. He feet fail him, and his hands shake and
tremble; the faithless cynic does not enshrine the Lord in his heart. || 7 || His intellect
fails him, his black hair turns white, and no one wants to keep him in their home.
Forgetting the Naam, these are the stigmas which stick to him; the Messenger of Death
beats him, and drags him to hell. || 8 || The record of one‟s past actions cannot be
erased; who else is to blame for one‟s birth and death? Without the Guru, life and death
are pointless; without the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, life just burns away. || 9 || The
pleasures enjoyed in happiness bring ruin; acting in corruption is useless indulgence.
Forgetting the Naam, and caught by greed, he betrays his own source; the club of the
Righteous Judge of Dharma will strike him over the head. || 10 || The Gurmukhs sing
the Glorious Praises of the Lord‟s Name; the Lord God blesses them with His Glance of
Grace. Those beings are pure, perfect unlimited and infinite; in this world, they are the
embodiment of the Guru, the Lord of the Universe. || 11 || Meditate in remembrance
on the Lord; meditate and contemplate the Guru‟s Word, and love to associate with the
humble servants of the Lord. The Lord‟s humble servants are the embodiment of the
Guru; they are supreme and respected in the Court of the Lord. Nanak seeks the dust
of the feet of those humble servants of the Lord. || 12 || 8 ||
