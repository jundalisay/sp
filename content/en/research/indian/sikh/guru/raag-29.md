RAAG TILANG, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

I offer this one prayer to You; please listen to it, O Creator Lord. You are true, great,
merciful and spotless, O Cherisher Lord. || 1 || The world is a transitory place of
mortality — know this for certain in your mind. Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, has
caught me by the hair on my head, and yet, I do not know it at all in my mind. || 1 ||
Pause || Spouse, children, parents and siblings — none of them will be there to hold your
hand. And when at last I fall, and the time of my last prayer has come, there shall be no
one to rescue me. || 2 || Night and day, I wandered around in greed, contemplating evil
schemes. I never did good deeds; this is my condition. || 3 || I am unfortunate, miserly,
negligent, shameless and without the Fear of God. Says Nanak, I am Your humble servant,
the dust of the feet of Your slaves. || 4 || 1 ||
TILANG, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

The Fear of You, O Lord God, is my marijuana; my consciousness is the pouch which holds
it. I have become an intoxicated hermit. My hands are my begging bowl; I am so hungry
for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I beg at Your Door, day after day. || 1 || I long
for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I am a beggar at Your Door — please bless me with
Your charity. || 1 || Pause || Saffron, flowers, musk oil and gold embellish the bodies of
all. The Lord‟s devotees are like sandalwood, which imparts its fragrance to everyone. || 2
|| No one says that ghee or silk are polluted. Such is the Lord‟s devotee, no matter what
his social status is. Those who bow in reverence to the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
remain absorbed in Your Love. Nanak begs for charity at their door. || 3 || 1 || 2 ||
TILANG, FIRST MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

This body fabric is conditioned by Maya, O beloved; this cloth is dyed in greed. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 722 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
My Husband Lord is not pleased by these clothes, O Beloved; how can the soul-bride go
to His bed? || 1 || I am a sacrifice, O Dear Merciful Lord; I am a sacrifice to You. I am
a sacrifice to those who take to Your Name. Unto those who take to Your Name, I am
forever a sacrifice. || 1 || Pause || If the body becomes the dyer‟s vat, O Beloved,
and the Name is placed within it as the dye, and if the Dyer who dyes this cloth is the
Lord Master — O, such a color has never been seen before! || 2 || Those whose
shawls are so dyed, O Beloved, their Husband Lord is always with them. Bless me with
the dust of those humble beings, O Dear Lord. Says Nanak, this is my prayer. || 3 ||
He Himself creates, and He Himself imbues us. He Himself bestows His Glance of
Grace. O Nanak, if the soul-bride becomes pleasing to her Husband Lord, He Himself
enjoys her. || 4 || 1 || 3 || TILANG, FIRST MEHL: O foolish and ignorant soul-bride,
why are you so proud? Within the home of your own self, why do you not enjoy the
Love of your Lord? Your Husband Lord is so very near, O foolish bride; why do you
search for Him outside? Apply the Fear of God as the maascara to adorn your eyes, and
make the Love of the Lord your ornament. Then, you shall be known as a devoted and
committed soul-bride, when you enshrine love for your Husband Lord. || 1 || What
can the silly young bride do, if she is not pleasing to her Husband Lord? She may plead
and implore so many times, but still, such a bride shall not obtain the Mansion of the
Lord‟s Presence. Without the karma of good deeds, nothing is obtained, although she
may run around frantically. She is intoxicated with greed, pride and egotism, and
engrossed in Maya. She cannot obtain her Husband Lord in these ways; the young bride
is so foolish! || 2 || Go and ask the happy, pure soul-brides, how did they obtain their
Husband Lord? Whatever the Lord does, accept that as good; do away with your own
cleverness and self-will. By His Love, true wealth is obtained; link your consciousness to
His lotus feet. As your Husband Lord directs, so you must act; surrender your body and
mind to Him, and apply this perfume to yourself. So speaks the happy soul-bride, O
sister; in this way, the Husband Lord is obtained. || 3 || Give up your selfhood, and
so obtain your Husband Lord; what other clever tricks are of any use? When the
Husband Lord looks upon the soul-bride with His Gracious Glance, that day is historic —
the bride obtains the nine treasures. She who is loved by her Husband Lord, is the true
soul-bride; O Nanak, she is the queen of all. Thus she is imbued with His Love,
intoxicated with delight; day and night, she is absorbed in His Love. She is beautiful,
glorious and brilliant; she is known as truly wise. || 4 || 2 || 4 || TILANG, FIRST
MEHL: As the Word of the Forgiving Lord comes to me, so do I express it, O Lalo.
Bringing the marriage party of sin, Babar has invaded from Kaabul, demanding our land
as his wedding gift, O Lalo. Modesty and righteousness both have vanished, and
falsehood struts around like a leader, O Lalo. The Qazis and the Brahmins have lost
their roles, and Satan now conducts the marriage rites, O Lalo. The Muslim women read
the Koran, and in their misery, they call upon God, O Lalo. The Hindu women of high
social status, and others of lowly status as well, are put into the same category, O Lalo. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 723 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The wedding songs of murder are sung, O Nanak, and blood is sprinkled instead of
saffron, O Lalo. || 1 || Nanak sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord and Master in the
city of corpses, and voices this account. The One who created, and attached the
mortals to pleasures, sits alone, and watches this. The Lord and Master is True, and
True is His justice. He issues His Commands according to His judgement. The bodyfabric will be torn apart into shreds, and then India will remember these words. Coming
in seventy-eight (1521 A.D.), they will depart in ninety-seven (1540 A.D.), and then
another disciple of man will rise up. Nanak speaks the Word of Truth; he proclaims the
Truth at this, the right time. || 2 || 3 || 5 ||
TILANG, FOURTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

Everyone comes by Command of the Lord and Master. The Hukam of His Command
extends to all. True is the Lord and Master, and True is His play. The Lord is the Master
of all. || 1 || So praise the True Lord; the Lord is the Master over all. No one is equal
to Him; am I of any account? || Pause || Air, water, earth and sky — the Lord has
made these His home and temple. He Himself is pervading everywhere, O Nanak. Tell
me: what can be counted as false? || 2 || 1 || TILANG, FOURTH MEHL: The evilminded person continually does fruitless deeds, all puffed up with pride. When he
brings home what he has acquired, by practicing deception and falsehood, he thinks
that he has conquered the world. || 1 || Such is the drama of the world, that he does
not contemplate the Lord‟s Name. In an instant, all this false play shall perish; O my
mind, meditate on the Lord. || Pause || He does not think of that time, when Death,
the Torturer, shall come and seize him. O Nanak, the Lord saves that one, within whose
heart the Lord, in His Kind Mercy, dwells. || 2 || 2 || 7 ||
TILANG, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

The Lord infused His Light into the dust, and created the world, the universe. The sky,
the earth, the trees, and the water — all are the Creation of the Lord. || 1 || O
human being, whatever you can see with your eyes, shall perish. The world eats dead
carcasses, living by neglect and greed. || Pause || Like a goblin, or a beast, they kill
and eat the forbidden carcasses of meat. So control your urges, or else you will be
seized by the Lord, and thrown into the tortures of hell. || 2 || Your benefactors,
presents, companions, courts, lands and homes — when Azraa-eel, the Messenger of
Death seizes you, what good will these be to you then? || 3 || The Pure Lord God
knows your condition. O Nanak, recite your prayer to the holy people. || 4 || 1 ||
TILANG, SECOND HOUSE, FIFTH MEHL: There is no other than You, Lord. You are
the Creator; whatever You do, that alone happens. You are the strength, and You are
the support of the mind. Forever and ever, meditate, O Nanak, on the One. || 1 ||
The Great Giver is the Supreme Lord God over all. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 724 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
You are our support, You are our sustainer. || Pause || You are, You are, and You
shall ever be, O inaccessible, unfathomable, lofty and infinite Lord. Those who serve
You, are not touched by fear or suffering. By Guru‟s Grace, O Nanak, sing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. || 2 || Whatever is seen, is Your form, O treasure of virtue, O
Lord of the Universe, O Lord of incomparable beauty. Remembering, remembering,
remembering the Lord in meditation, His humble servant becomes like Him. O Nanak,
by His Grace, we obtain Him. || 3 || I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on the
Lord. Associating with them, the whole world is saved. Says Nanak, God fulfills our
hopes and aspirations. I long for the dust of the feet of the Saints. || 4 || 2 ||
TILANG, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE: Merciful, the Lord Master is Merciful. My Lord
Master is Merciful. He gives His gifts to all beings. || Pause || Why do you waver, O
mortal being? The Creator Lord Himself shall protect you. He who created you, will also
give you nourishment. || 1 || The One who created the world, takes care of it. In
each and every heart and mind, the Lord is the True Cherisher. || 2 || His creative
potency and His value cannot be known; He is the Great and carefree Lord. O human
being, meditate on the Lord, as long as there is breath in your body. || 3 || O God,
You are all-powerful, inexpressible and imperceptible; my soul and body are Your
capital. By Your Mercy, may I find peace; this is Nanak‟s lasting prayer. || 4 || 3 ||
TILANG, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE: O Creator, through Your creative potency, I am
in love with You. You alone are my spiritual and temporal Lord; and yet, You are
detached from all Your creation. || Pause || In an instant, You establish and
disestablish. Wondrous is Your form! Who can know Your play? You are the Light in the
darkness. || 1 || You are the Master of Your creation, the Lord of all the world, O
Merciful Lord God. One who worships You day and night — why should he have to go to
hell? || 2 || Azraa-eel, the Messenger of Death, is the friend of the human being who
has Your support, Lord. His sins are all forgiven; Your humble servant gazes upon Your
Vision. || 3 || All worldly considerations are for the present only. True peace comes
only from Your Name. Meeting the Guru, Nanak understands; He sings only Your
Praises forever, O Lord. || 4 || 4 || TILANG, FIFTH MEHL: Think of the Lord in your
mind, O wise one. Enshrine love for the True Lord in your mind and body; He is the
Liberator from bondage. || 1 || Pause || The value of seeing the Vision of the Lord
Master cannot be estimated. You are the Pure Cherisher; You Yourself are the great and
immeasurable Lord and Master. || 1 || Give me Your help, O brave and generous
Lord; You are the One, You are the Only Lord. O Creator Lord, by Your creative
potency, You created the world; Nanak holds tight to Your support. || 2 || 5 ||
TILANG, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

The One who created the world watches over it; what more can we say, O Siblings of
Destiny? 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 725 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He Himself knows, and He Himself acts; He laid out the garden of the world. || 1 ||
Savor the story, the story of the Beloved Lord, which brings a lasting peace. || Pause
|| She who does not enjoy the Love of her Husband Lord, shall come to regret and
repent in the end. She wrings her hands, and bangs her head, when the night of her
life has passed away. || 2 || Nothing comes from repentance, when the game is
already finished. She shall have the opportunity to enjoy her Beloved, only when her
turn comes again. || 3 || The happy soul-bride attains her Husband Lord — she is so
much better than I am. I have none of her merits or virtues; whom should I blame? ||
4 || I shall go and ask those sisters who have enjoyed their Husband Lord. I touch
their feet, and ask them to show me the Path. || 5 || She who understands the
Hukam of His Command, O Nanak, applies the Fear of God as her sandalwood oil; she
charms her Beloved with her virtue, and so obtains Him. || 6 || She who meets her
Beloved in her heart, remains united with Him; this is truly called union. As much as she
may long for Him, she shall not meet Him through mere words. || 7 || As metal melts
into metal again, so does love melt into love. By Guru‟s Grace, this understanding is
obtained, and then, one obtains the Fearless Lord. || 8 || There may be an orchard of
betel nut trees in the garden, but the donkey does not appreciate its value. If someone
savors a fragrance, then he can truly appreciate its flower. || 9 || One who drinks in
the ambrosia, O Nanak, abandons his doubts and wanderings. Easily and intuitively, he
remains blended with the Lord, and obtains the immortal status. || 10 || 1 || TILANG,
FOURTH MEHL: The Guru, my friend, has told me the stories and the sermon of the
Lord. I am a sacrifice to my Guru; to the Guru, I am a sacrifice. || 1 || Come, join
with me, O Sikh of the Guru, come and join with me. You are my Guru‟s Beloved. ||
Pause || The Glorious Praises of the Lord are pleasing to the Lord; I have obtained
them from the Guru. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to those who surrender to, and obey
the Guru‟s Will. || 2 || I am dedicated and devoted to those who gaze upon the
Beloved True Guru. I am forever a sacrifice to those who perform service for the Guru.
|| 3 || Your Name, O Lord, Har, Har, is the Destroyer of sorrow. Serving the Guru, it is
obtained, and as Gurmukh, one is emancipated. || 4 || Those humble beings who
meditate on the Lord‟s Name, are celebrated and acclaimed. Nanak is a sacrifice to
them, forever and ever a devoted sacrifice. || 5 || O Lord, that alone is Praise to You,
which is pleasing to Your Will, O Lord God. Those Gurmukhs, who serve their Beloved
Lord, obtain Him as their reward. || 6 || Those who cherish love for the Lord, their
souls are always with God. Chanting and meditating on their Beloved, they live in, and
gather in, the Lord‟s Name. || 7 || I am a sacrifice to those Gurmukhs who serve their
Beloved Lord. They themselves are saved, along with their families, and through them,
all the world is saved. || 8 || My Beloved Guru serves the Lord. Blessed is the Guru,
Blessed is the Guru. The Guru has shown me the Lord‟s Path; the Guru has done the
greatest good deed. || 9 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 726 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Those Sikhs of the Guru, who serve the Guru, are the most blessed beings. Servant
Nanak is a sacrifice to them; He is forever and ever a sacrifice. || 10 || The Lord
Himself is pleased with the Gurmukhs, the fellowship of the companions. In the Lord‟s
Court, they are given robes of honor, and the Lord Himself hugs them close in His
embrace. || 11 || Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of those
Gurmukhs, who meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I wash their feet, and
drink in the dust of their feet, dissolved in the wash water. || 12 || Those who eat
betel nuts and betel leaf and apply lipstick, but do not contemplate the Lord, Har, Har
— the Messenger of Death will seize them and take them away. || 13 || The
Messenger of Death does not even approach those who contemplate the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har, and keep Him enshrined in their hearts. The Guru‟s Sikhs are the Guru‟s
Beloveds. || 14 || The Name of the Lord is a treasure, known only to the few
Gurmukhs. O Nanak, those who meet with the True Guru, enjoy peace and pleasure. ||
15 || The True Guru is called the Giver; in His Mercy, He grants His Grace. I am
forever a sacrifice to the Guru, who has blessed me with the Lord‟s Name. || 16 ||
Blessed, very blessed is the Guru, who brings the Lord‟s message. I gaze upon the
Guru, the Guru, the True Guru embodied, and I blossom forth in bliss. || 17 || The
Guru‟s tongue recites Words of Ambrosial Nectar; He is adorned with the Lord‟s Name.
Those Sikhs who hear and obey the Guru — all their desires depart. || 18 || Some
speak of the Lord‟s Path; tell me, how can I walk on it? O Lord, Har, Har, Your Name is
my supplies; I will take it with me and set out. || 19 || Those Gurmukhs who worship
and adore the Lord, are wealthy and very wise. I am forever a sacrifice to the True
Guru; I am absorbed in the Words of the Guru‟s Teachings. || 20 || You are the
Master, my Lord and Master; You are my Ruler and King. If it is pleasing to Your Will,
then I worship and serve You; You are the treasure of virtue. || 21 || The Lord
Himself is absolute; He is The One and Only; but He Himself is also manifested in many
forms. Whatever pleases Him, O Nanak, that alone is good. || 22 || 2 ||
TILANG, NINTH MEHL, KAAFEE:

If you are conscious, then be conscious of Him night and day, O mortal. Each and every
moment, your life is passing away, like water from a cracked pitcher. || 1 || Pause ||
Why do you not sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, you ignorant fool? You are
attached to false greed, and you do not even consider death. || 1 || Even now, no
harm has been done, if you will only sing God‟s Praises. Says Nanak, by meditating and
vibrating upon Him, you shall obtain the state of fearlessness. || 2 || 1 || TILANG,
NINTH MEHL: Wake up, O mind! Wake up! Why are you sleeping unaware? That body,
which you were born with, shall not go along with you in the end. || 1 || Pause || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 727 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Mother, father, children and relatives whom you love, will throw your body into the fire,
when your soul departs from it. || 1 || Your worldly affairs exist only as long as you
are alive; know this well. O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; everything is
like a dream. || 2 || 2 || TILANG, NINTH MEHL: Sing the Lord‟s Praises, O mind; He
is your only true companion. Your time is passing away; listen carefully to what I say.
|| 1 || Pause || You are so in love with property, chariots, wealth and power. When
the noose of death tightens around your neck, they will all belong to others. || 1 ||
Know this well, O madman — you have ruined your affairs. You did not restrain yourself
from committing sins, and you did not eradicate your ego. || 2 || So listen to the
Teachings imparted by the Guru, O Siblings of Destiny. Nanak proclaims: hold tight to
the Protection and the Sanctuary of God. || 3 || 3 ||
TILANG, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE KABEER JEE:

The Vedas and the Scriptures are only make-believe, O Siblings of Destiny; they do not
relieve the anxiety of the heart. If you will only center yourself on the Lord, even for
just a breath, then you shall see the Lord face-to-face, present before you. || 1 || O
human being, search your own heart every day, and do not wander around in
confusion. This world is just a magic-show; no one will be holding your hand. || 1 ||
Pause || Reading and studying falsehood, people are happy; in their ignorance, they
speak nonsense. The True Creator Lord is diffused into His creation; He is not just the
dark-skinned Krishna of legends. || 2 || Through the Tenth Gate, the stream of nectar
flows; take your bath in this. Serve the Lord forever; use your eyes, and see Him everpresent everywhere. || 3 || The Lord is the purest of the pure; only through doubt
could there be another. O Kabeer, mercy flows from the Merciful Lord; He alone knows
who acts. || 4 || 1 || NAAM DAYV JEE: I am blind; Your Name, O Creator Lord, is my
only anchor and support. I am poor, and I am meek. Your Name is my only support. ||
1 || Pause || O beautiful Lord, benevolent and merciful Lord, You are so wealthy and
generous. You are ever-present in every presence, within and before me. || 1 || You
are the river of life, You are the Giver of all; You are so very wealthy. You alone give,
and You alone take away; there is no other at all. || 2 || You are wise, You are the
supreme seer; how could I make You an object of thought? O Lord and Master of Naam
Dayv, You are the merciful Lord of forgiveness. || 3 || 1 || 2 || Hello, my friend, hello
my friend. Is there any good news? I am a sacrifice, a devoted sacrifice, a dedicated
and devoted sacrifice, to You. Slavery to You is so sublime; Your Name is noble and
exalted. || 1 || Pause || Where did you come from? Where have You been? And
where are You going? Tell me the truth, in the holy city of Dwaarikaa. || 1 || How
handsome is your turban! And how sweet is your speech. Why are there Moghals in the
holy city of Dwaarikaa? || 2 || You alone are the Lord of so many thousands of
worlds. You are my Lord King, like the dark-skinned Krishna. || 3 || You are the Lord
of the sun, Lord Indra and Lord Brahma, the King of men. You are the Lord and Master
of Naam Dayv, the King, the Liberator of all. || 4 || 2 || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 728 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.
TRUTH IS THE NAME.
CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED. NO FEAR. NO HATRED.
IMAGE OF THE UNDYING. BEYOND BIRTH. SELF-EXISTENT.
BY GURU‟S GRACE:
RAAG SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, CHAU-PADAS, FIRST HOUSE:
Wash the vessel, sit down and anoint it with fragrance; then, go out and get the milk.
Add the rennet of clear consciousness to the milk of good deeds, and then, free of
desire, let it curdle. || 1 || Chant the Name of the One Lord. All other actions are
fruitless. || 1 || Pause || Let your mind be the handles, and then churn it, without
sleeping. If you chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord ,with your tongue, then the curd
will be churned. In this way, the Ambrosial Nectar is obtained. || 2 || Wash your mind
in the pool of Truth, and let it be the vessel of the Lord; let this be your offering to
please Him. That humble servant who dedicates and offers his life, and who serves in
this way, remains absorbed in his Lord and Master. || 3 || The speakers speak and
speak and speak, and then they depart. There is no other to compare to You. Servant
Nanak, lacking devotion, humbly prays: may I sing the Praises of the True Lord. || 4 ||
1 ||
SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

Deep within the self, the Lord abides; do not go outside looking for Him. You have
renounced the Ambrosial Nectar — why are you eating poison? || 1 || Meditate on
such spiritual wisdom, O my mind, and become the slave of the True Lord. || 1 ||
Pause || Everyone speaks of wisdom and meditation; but bound in bondage, the
whole world is wandering around in confusion. || 2 || One who serves the Lord is His
servant. The Lord is pervading and permeating the water, the land, and the sky. || 3 ||
I am not good; no one is bad. Prays Nanak, He alone saves us! || 4 || 1 || 2 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 729 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, SIXTH HOUSE:

Bronze is bright and shiny, but when it is rubbed, its blackness appears. Washing it, its
impurity is not removed, even if it is washed a hundred times. || 1 || They alone are
my friends, who travel along with me; and in that place, where the accounts are called
for, they appear standing with me. || 1 || Pause || There are houses, mansions and
tall buildings, painted on all sides; but they are empty within, and they crumble like
useless ruins. || 2 || The herons in their white feathers dwell in the sacred shrines of
pilgrimage. They tear apart and eat the living beings, and so they are not called white.
|| 3 || My body is like the simmal tree; seeing me, other people are fooled. Its fruits
are useless — just like the qualities of my body. || 4 || The blind man is carrying such
a heavy load, and his journey through the mountains is so long. My eyes can see, but I
cannot find the Way. How can I climb up and cross over the mountain? || 5 || What
good does it do to serve, and be good, and be clever? O Nanak, contemplate the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, and you shall be released from bondage. || 6 || 1 || 3 ||
SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL: Build the raft of meditation and self-discipline, to carry you
across the river. There will be no ocean, and no rising tides to stop you; this is how
comfortable your path shall be. || 1 || Your Name alone is the color, in which the
robe of my body is dyed. This color is permanent, O my Beloved. || 1 || Pause || My
beloved friends have departed; how will they meet the Lord? If they have virtue in their
pack, the Lord will unite them with Himself. || 2 || Once united with Him, they will
not be separated again, if they are truly united. The True Lord brings their comings and
goings to an end. || 3 || One who subdues and eradicates egotism, sews the robe of
devotion. Following the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings, she receives the fruits of her
reward, the Ambrosial Words of the Lord. || 4 || Says Nanak, O soul-brides, our
Husband Lord is so dear! We are the servants, the hand-maidens of the Lord; He is our
True Lord and Master. || 5 || 2 || 4 || SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL: Those whose minds
are filled with love of the Lord, are blessed and exalted. They are blessed with peace,
and their pains are forgotten. He will undoubtedly, certainly save them. || 1 || The
Guru comes to meet those whose destiny is so pre-ordained. He blesses them with the
Teachings of the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. Those who walk in the Will of the True
Guru, never wander begging. || 2 || And one who lives in the Mansion of the Lord‟s
Presence, why should he bow down to any other? The gate-keeper at the Lord‟s Gate
shall not stop him to ask any questions. And one who is blessed with the Lord‟s Glance
of Grace — by his words, others are emancipated as well. || 3 || The Lord Himself
sends out, and recalls the mortal beings; no one else gives Him advice. He Himself
demolishes, constructs and creates; He knows everything. O Nanak, the Naam, the
Name of the Lord is the blessing, given to those who receive His Mercy, and His Grace.
|| 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 730 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
4 || 3 || 5 || SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL: That vessel alone is pure, which is pleasing to
Him. The filthiest vessel does not become pure, simply by being washed. Through the
Gurdwara, the Guru‟s Gate, one obtains understanding. By being washed through this
Gate, it becomes pure. The Lord Himself sets the standards to differentiate between the
dirty and the pure. Do not think that you will automatically find a place of rest
hereafter. According to the actions one has committed, so does the mortal become. He
Himself bestows the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. Such a mortal departs with honor and
renown; his life is embellished and redeemed, and the trumpets resound with his glory.
Why speak of poor mortals? His glory shall echo throughout the three worlds. O Nanak,
he himself shall be enraptured, and he shall save his entire ancestry. || 1 || 4 || 6 ||
SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL: The Yogi practices yoga, and the pleasure-seeker practices
eating. The austere practice austerities, bathing and rubbing themselves at sacred
shrines of pilgrimage. || 1 || Let me hear some news of You, O Beloved; if only
someone would come and sit with me, and tell me. || 1 || Pause || As one plants, so
does he harvest; whatever he earns, he eats. In the world hereafter, his account is not
called for, if he goes with the insignia of the Lord. || 2 || According to the actions the
mortal commits, so is he proclaimed. And that breath which is drawn without thinking of
the Lord, that breath goes in vain. || 3 || I would sell this body, if someone would
only purchase it. O Nanak, that body is of no use at all, if it does not enshrine the Name
of the True Lord. || 4 || 5 || 7 ||
SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, SEVENTH HOUSE:

Yoga is not the patched coat, Yoga is not the walking stick. Yoga is not smearing the
body with ashes. Yoga is not the ear-rings, and not the shaven head. Yoga is not the
blowing of the horn. Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth of the world — this
is the way to attain Yoga. || 1 || By mere words, Yoga is not attained. One who looks
upon all with a single eye, and knows them to be one and the same — he alone is
known as a Yogi. || 1 || Pause || Yoga is not wandering to the tombs of the dead;
Yoga is not sitting in trances. Yoga is not wandering through foreign lands; Yoga is not
bathing at sacred shrines of pilgrimage. Remaining unblemished in the midst of the filth
of the world — this is the way to attain Yoga. || 2 || Meeting with the True Guru,
doubt is dispelled, and the wandering mind is restrained. Nectar rains down, celestial
music resounds, and deep within, wisdom is obtained. Remaining unblemished in the
midst of the filth of the world — this is the way to attain Yoga. || 3 || O Nanak,
remain dead while yet alive — practice such a Yoga. When the horn is blown without
being blown, then you shall attain the state of fearless dignity. Remaining unblemished
in the midst of the filth of the world — this is the way to attain Yoga. || 4 || 1 || 8 ||
SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL: What scale, what weights, and what assayer shall I call for
You, Lord? From what guru should I receive instruction? By whom should I have Your
value appraised? 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 731 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || O my Dear Beloved Lord, Your limits are not known. You pervade the water,
the land, and the sky; You Yourself are All-pervading. || 1 || Pause || Mind is the
scale, consciousness the weights, and the performance of Your service is the appraiser.
Deep within my heart, I weigh my Husband Lord; in this way I focus my consciousness.
|| 2 || You Yourself are the balance, the weights and the scale; You Yourself are the
weigher. You Yourself see, and You Yourself understand; You Yourself are the trader.
|| 3 || The blind, low class wandering soul, comes for a moment, and departs in an
instant. In its company, Nanak dwells; how can the fool attain the Lord? || 4 || 2 || 9 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

My mind worships and adores the Lord‟s Name, through the Guru, and the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. All the desires of my mind and body have been fulfilled; all fear of death
has been dispelled. || 1 || O my mind, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord‟s Name.
And when the Guru is pleased and satisfied, the mind is instructed; it then joyfully
drinks in the subtle essence of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || The Sat Sangat, the True
Congregation of the True Guru, is sublime and exalted. They sing the Glorious Praises
of the Lord God. Bless me with Your Mercy, Lord, and unite me with the Sat Sangat; I
wash the feet of Your humble servants. || 2 || The Lord‟s Name is all. The Lord‟s
Name is the essence of the Guru‟s Teachings, the juice, the sweetness of it. I have
found the Ambrosial Nectar, the Divine Water of the Lord‟s Name, and all my thirst for it
is quenched. || 3 || The Guru, the True Guru, is my social status and honor; I have
sold my head to the Guru. Servant Nanak is called the chaylaa, the disciple of the Guru;
O Guru, save the honor of Your servant. || 4 || 1 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: I
chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord God, the Supreme Being, Har, Har; my poverty
and problems have all been eradicated. The fear of birth and death has been erased,
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; serving the Unmoving, Unchanging Lord, I am
absorbed in peace. || 1 || O my mind, vibrate the Name of the most Beloved, Darling
Lord. I have dedicated my mind and body, and placed them in offering before the Guru;
I have sold my head to the Guru, for a very dear price. || 1 || Pause || The kings
and the rulers of men enjoy pleasures and delights, but without the Name of the Lord,
death seizes and dispatches them all. The Righteous Judge of Dharma strikes them over
the heads with his staff, and when the fruits of their actions come into their hands, then
they regret and repent. || 2 || Save me, save me, Lord; I am Your humble servant, a
mere worm. I seek the Protection of Your Sanctuary, O Primal Lord, Cherisher and
Nourisher. Please bless me with the Blessed Vision of the Saint‟s Darshan, that I may
find peace. O God, please fulfill the desires of Your humble servant. || 3 || You are
the All-powerful, Great, Primal God, my Lord and Master. O Lord, please bless me with
the gift of humility. Servant Nanak has found the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and is at
peace; I am forever a sacrifice to the Naam. || 4 || 2 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL:
The Lord‟s Name is the Love of the Lord. The Lord‟s Love is the permanent color. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 732 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When the Guru is totally satisfied and pleased, He colors us with the Lord‟s Love; this
color shall never fade away. || 1 || O my mind, enshrine love for the Name of the
Lord. The Guru, satisfied and pleased, taught me about the Lord, and my Sovereign
Lord King met with me at once. || 1 || Pause || The self-willed manmukh is like the
ignorant bride, who comes and goes again and again in reincarnation. The Lord God
does not come into her consciousness, and her mind is stuck in the love of duality. || 2
|| I am full of filth, and I practice evil deeds; O Lord, save me, be with me, merge me
into Your Being! The Guru has bathed me in the pool of Ambrosial Nectar, and the dirty
residues of all my sins and mistakes have been washed away. || 3 || O Lord God,
Merciful to the meek and the poor, please unite me with the Sat Sangat, the True
Congregation. Joining the Sangat, servant Nanak has obtained the Lord‟s Love; my
mind and body are drenched in it. || 4 || 3 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: One who
chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, while constantly practicing deception, shall
never become pure of heart. He may perform all sorts of rituals, night and day, but he
shall not find peace, even in dreams. || 1 || O wise ones, without the Guru, there is
no devotional worship.The untreated cloth does not take up the dye, no matter how
much everyone may wish it. || 1 || Pause || The self-willed manmukh may perform
chants, meditations, austere self-discipline, fasts and devotional worship, but his
sickness does not go away. Deep within him is the sickness of excessive egotism; in the
love of duality he is ruined. || 2 || Outwardly, he wears religious robes and he is very
clever, but his mind wanders in the ten directions. Engrossed in ego, he does not
remember the Word of the Shabad; over and over again, he is reincarnated. || 3 || O
Nanak, that mortal who is blessed with the Lord‟s Glance of Grace, understands Him;
that humble servant meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. By Guru‟s Grace, he
understands the One Lord, and is absorbed into the One Lord. || 4 || 4 || 13 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I searched and searched the body-village; I found the
wealth of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || The Lord, Har, Har, has enshrined
peace within my mind. The fire of desire was extinguished in an instant, when I met the
Guru; all my hunger has been satisfied. || 1 || Pause || Singing the Glorious Praises
of the Lord, I live, O my mother. The Merciful True Guru implanted the Glorious Praises
of the Naam within me. || 2 || I search for and seek out my Beloved Lord God, Har,
Har. Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, I have obtained the subtle essence
of the Lord. || 3 || By the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon my forehead, I have
found the Lord. Guru Nanak, pleased and satisfied, has united me with the Lord, O
Siblings of Destiny. || 4 || 1 || 5 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: Showering His Mercy,
the Lord imbues the mind with His Love. The Gurmukh merges in the Name of the Lord,
Har, Har. || 1 || Imbued with the Lord‟s Love, the mortal enjoys the pleasure of His
Love. He remains always blissful, day and night, and he merges into the Shabad, the
Word of the Perfect Guru. || 1 || Pause || Everyone longs for the Lord‟s Love; the
Gurmukh is imbued with the deep red color of His Love. || 2 || The foolish, self-willed
manmukh is left pale and uncolored. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 733 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Even if he wishes it a hundred times, he does not obtain the Lord‟s Love. || 3 || But if
the Lord blesses him with His Glance of Grace, then he meets the True Guru. Nanak is
absorbed into the subtle essence of the Lord‟s Love. || 4 || 2 || 6 || SOOHEE,
FOURTH MEHL: My tongue remains satisfied with the subtle essence of the Lord. The
Gurmukh drinks it in, and merges in celestial peace. || 1 || If you taste the subtle
essence of the Lord, O humble Siblings of Destiny, then how can you be enticed by
other flavors? || 1 || Pause || Under Guru‟s Instructions, keep this subtle essence
enshrined in your heart. Those who are imbued with the subtle essence of the Lord, are
immersed in celestial bliss. || 2 || The self-willed manmukh cannot even taste the
subtle essence of the Lord. He acts out in ego, and suffers terrible punishment. || 3 ||
But if he is blessed with the Lord‟s Kind Mercy, then he obtains the subtle essence of
the Lord. O Nanak, absorbed in this subtle essence of the Lord, sing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. || 4 || 3 || 7 ||
SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL, SIXTH HOUSE:

When someone of low social class chants the Lord‟s Name, he obtains the state of
highest dignity. Go and ask Bidar, the son of a maid; Krishna himself stayed in his
house. || 1 || Listen, O humble Siblings of Destiny, to the Unspoken Speech of the
Lord; it removes all anxiety, pain and hunger. || 1 || Pause || Ravi Daas, the
leather-worker, praised the Lord, and sang the Kirtan of His Praises each and every
instant. Although he was of low social status, he was exalted and elevated, and people
of all four castes came and bowed at his feet. || 2 || Naam Dayv loved the Lord; the
people called him a fabric dyer. The Lord turned His back on the high-class
Kh‟shaatriyas and Brahmins, and showed His face to Naam Dayv. || 3 || All of the
devotees and servants of the Lord have the tilak, the ceremonial mark, applied to their
foreheads at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage. Servant Nanak shall touch
their feet night and day, if the Lord, the King, grants His Grace. || 4 || 1 || 8 ||
SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: They alone worship and adore the Lord deep within, who
are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny from the very beginning of time. What can
anyone do to undermine them? My Creator Lord is on their side. || 1 || So meditate
on the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind. Meditate on the Lord, O mind; He is the Eliminator of
all the pains of reincarnation. || 1 || Pause || In the very beginning, the Lord
blessed His devotees with the Ambrosial Nectar, the treasure of devotion. Anyone who
tries to compete with them is a fool; his face shall be blackened here and hereafter. ||
2 || They alone are devotees, and they alone are selfless servants, who love the Lord‟s
Name. By their selfless service, they find the Lord, while ashes fall on the heads of the
slanderers. || 3 || He alone knows this, who experiences it within the home of his
own self. Ask Guru Nanak, the Guru of the world, and reflect upon it. Throughout the
four generations of the Gurus, from the beginning of time and throughout the ages, no
one has ever found the Lord by back-biting and undermining. Only by serving the Lord
with love, is one emancipated. || 4 || 2 || 9 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: Wherever
the Lord is worshipped in adoration, there the Lord becomes one‟s friend and helper. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 734 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
By Guru‟s Grace, the Lord comes to dwell in the mind; He cannot be obtained in any
other way. || 1 || So gather in the wealth of the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, so that in
this world and the next, the Lord shall be your friend and companion. || 1 || Pause ||
In the company of the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, you shall earn the wealth of
the Lord; this wealth of the Lord is not obtained anywhere else, by any other means, at
all. The dealer in the Lord‟s Jewels purchases the wealth of the Lord‟s jewels; the dealer
in cheap glass jewels cannot acquire the Lord‟s wealth by empty words. || 2 || The
Lord‟s wealth is like jewels, gems and rubies. At the appointed time in the Amrit Vaylaa,
the ambrosial hours of the morning, the Lord‟s devotees lovingly center their attention
on the Lord, and the wealth of the Lord. The devotees of the Lord plant the seed of the
Lord‟s wealth in the ambrosial hours of the Amrit Vaylaa; they eat it, and spend it, but it
is never exhausted. In this world and the next, the devotees are blessed with glorious
greatness, the wealth of the Lord. || 3 || The wealth of the Fearless Lord is
permanent, forever and ever, and true. This wealth of the Lord cannot be destroyed by
fire or water; neither thieves nor the Messenger of Death can take it away. Thieves
cannot even approach the Lord‟s wealth; Death, the tax collector cannot tax it. || 4 ||
The faithless cynics commit sins and gather in their poisonous wealth, but it shall not go
along with them for even a single step. In this world, the faithless cynics become
miserable, as it slips away through their hands. In the world hereafter, the faithless
cynics find no shelter in the Court of the Lord. || 5 || The Lord Himself is the Banker
of this wealth, O Saints; when the Lord gives it, the mortal loads it and takes it away.
This wealth of the Lord is never exhausted; the Guru has given this understanding to
servant Nanak. || 6 || 3 || 10 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: That mortal, with whom
the Lord is pleased, repeats the Glorious Praises of the Lord; he alone is a devotee, and
he alone is approved. How can his glory be described? Within his heart, the Primal Lord,
the Lord God, abides. || 1 || Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe;
focus your meditation on the True Guru. || 1 || Pause || He is the True Guru —
service to the True Guru is fruitful and rewarding. By this service, the greatest treasure
is obtained. The faithless cynics in their love of duality and sensual desires, harbor foulsmelling urges. They are totally useless and ignorant. || 2 || One who has faith — his
singing is approved. He is honored in the Court of the Lord. Those who lack faith may
close their eyes, hypocritically pretending and faking devotion, but their false pretenses
shall soon wear off. || 3 || My soul and body are totally Yours, Lord; You are the
Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts, my Primal Lord God. So speaks servant Nanak,
the slave of Your slaves; as You make me speak, so do I speak. || 4 || 4 || 11 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 735 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL, SEVENTH HOUSE:

Which, which of Your Glorious Virtues should I sing and recount, Lord? You are my Lord
and Master, the treasure of excellence. I cannot express Your Glorious Praises. You are
my Lord and Master, lofty and benevolent. || 1 || The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is
my only support. If it pleases You, please save me, O my Lord and Master; without You,
I have no other at all. || 1 || Pause || You alone are my strength, and my Court, O
my Lord and Master; unto You alone I pray. There is no other place where I can offer
my prayers; I can tell my pains and pleasures only to You. || 2 || Water is locked up
in the earth, and fire is locked up in wood. The sheep and the lions are kept in one
place; O mortal, meditate on the Lord, and your doubts and fears shall be removed. ||
3 || So behold the glorious greatness of the Lord, O Saints; the Lord blesses the
dishonored with honor. As dust rises from underfoot, O Nanak, so does the Lord make
all people fall at the feet of the Holy. || 4 || 1 || 12 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: You
Yourself, O Creator, know everything; what can I possibly tell You? You know all the
bad and the good; as we act, so are we rewarded. || 1 || O my Lord and Master, You
alone know the state of my inner being. You know all the bad and the good; as it
pleases You, so You make us speak. || 1 || Pause || The Lord has infused the love
of Maya into all bodies; through this human body, there comes the opportunity to
worship the Lord with devotion. You unite some with the True Guru, and bless them
with peace; while others, the self-willed manmukhs, are engrossed in worldly affairs. ||
2 || All belong to You, and You belong to all, O my Creator Lord; You wrote the words
of destiny on the forehead of everyone. As You bestow Your Glance of Grace, so are
mortals made; without Your Gracious Glance, no one assumes any form. || 3 || You
alone know Your Glorious Greatness; everyone constantly meditates on You. That
being, with whom You are pleased, is united with You; O servant Nanak, only such a
mortal is accepted. || 4 || 2 || 13 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: Those beings, within
whose inner selves my Lord, Har, Har, dwells — all their diseases are cured. They alone
become liberated, who meditate on the Name of the Lord; they obtain the supreme
status. || 1 || O my Lord, the Lord‟s humble servants become healthy. Those who
meditate on my Lord, Har, Har, through the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings, are rid of
the disease of ego. || 1 || Pause || Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva suffer from the
disease of the three gunas — the three qualities; they do their deeds in egotism. The
poor fools do not remember the One who created them; this understanding of the Lord
is only obtained by those who become Gurmukh. || 2 || The entire world is afflicted
by the disease of egotism. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 736 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They suffer the terrible pains of birth and death. By Guru‟s Grace, a few rare ones are
saved; I am a sacrifice to those humble beings. || 3 || The One who created the
Universe, that Lord alone knows. His beauty is incomparable. O Nanak, the Lord Himself
gazes upon it, and is pleased. The Gurmukh contemplates God. || 4 || 3 || 14 ||
SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: All that happens, and all that will happen, is by His Will. If
we could do something by ourselves, we would. By ourselves, we cannot do anything at
all. As it pleases the Lord, He preserves us. || 1 || O my Dear Lord, everything is in
Your power. I have no power to do anything at all. As it pleases You, You forgive us. ||
1 || Pause || You Yourself bless us with soul, body and everything. You Yourself
cause us to act. As You issue Your Commands, so do we act, according to our preordained destiny. || 2 || You created the entire Universe out of the five elements; if
anyone can create a sixth, let him. You unite some with the True Guru, and cause them
to understand, while others, the self-willed manmukhs, do their deeds and cry out in
pain. || 3 || I cannot describe the glorious greatness of the Lord; I am foolish,
thoughtless, idiotic and lowly. Please, forgive servant Nanak, O my Lord and Master; I
am ignorant, but I have entered Your Sanctuary. || 4 || 4 || 15 || 24 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

The actor stages the play, playing the many characters in different costumes; but when
the play ends, he takes off the costumes, and then he is one, and only one. || 1 ||
How many forms and images appeared and disappeared? Where have they gone?
Where did they come from? || 1 || Pause || Countless waves rise up from the water.
Jewels and ornaments of many different forms are fashioned from gold. I have seen
seeds of all kinds being planted — when the fruit ripens, the seeds appear in the same
form as the original. || 2 || The one sky is reflected in thousands of water jugs, but
when the jugs are broken, only the sky remains. Doubt comes from greed, emotional
attachment and the corruption of Maya. Freed from doubt, one realizes the One Lord
alone. || 3 || He is imperishable; He will never pass away. He does not come, and He
does not go. The Perfect Guru has washed away the filth of ego. Says Nanak, I have
obtained the supreme status. || 4 || 1 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Whatever God
wills, that alone happens. Without You, there is no other at all. The humble being
serves Him, and so all his works are perfectly successful. O Lord, please preserve the
honor of Your slaves. || 1 || I seek Your Sanctuary, O Perfect, Merciful Lord. Without
You, who would cherish and love me? || 1 || Pause || He is permeating and
pervading the water, the land and the sky. God dwells near at hand; He is not far away.
By trying to please other people, nothing is accomplished. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 737 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
When someone is attached to the True Lord, his ego is taken away. || 2 || He alone is
attached, whom the Lord Himself attaches. The jewel of spiritual wisdom is awakened
deep within. Evil-mindedness is eradicated, and the supreme status is attained. By
Guru‟s Grace, meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 3 || Pressing my palms
together, I offer my prayer; if it pleases You, Lord, please bless me and fulfill me. Grant
Your Mercy, Lord, and bless me with devotion. Servant Nanak meditates on God
forever. || 4 || 2 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Blessed is that soul-bride, who realizes
God. She obeys the Hukam of His Order, and abandons her self-conceit. Imbued with
her Beloved, she celebrates in delight. || 1 || Listen, O my companions — these are
the signs on the Path to meet God. Dedicate your mind and body to Him; stop living to
please others. || 1 || Pause || One soul-bride counsels another, to do only that
which pleases God. Such a soul-bride merges into the Being of God. || 2 || One who
is in the grip of pride does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence. She regrets
and repents, when her life-night passes away. The unfortunate self-willed manmukhs
suffer in pain. || 3 || I pray to God, but I think that He is far away. God is
imperishable and eternal; He is pervading and permeating everywhere. Servant Nanak
sings of Him; I see Him Ever-present everywhere. || 4 || 3 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL:
The Giver has put this household of my being under my own control. I am now the
mistress of the Lord‟s Home. My Husband Lord has made the ten senses and organs of
actions my slaves. I have gathered together all the faculties and facilities of this house.
I am thirsty with desire and longing for my Husband Lord. || 1 || What Glorious
Virtues of my Beloved Husband Lord should I describe? He is All-knowing, totally
beautiful and merciful; He is the Destroyer of ego. || 1 || Pause || I am adorned
with Truth, and I have applied the mascara of the Fear of God to my eyes. I have
chewed the betel-leaf of the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. My bracelets,
robes and ornaments beautifully adorn me. The soul-bride becomes totally happy, when
her Husband Lord comes to her home. || 2 || By the charms of virtue, I have enticed
and fascinated my Husband Lord. He is under my power — the Guru has dispelled my
doubts. My mansion is lofty and elevated. Renouncing all other brides, my Beloved has
become my lover. || 3 || The sun has risen, and its light shines brightly. I have
prepared my bed with infinite care and faith. My Darling Beloved is new and fresh; He
has come to my bed to enjoy me. O Servant Nanak, my Husband Lord has come; the
soul-bride has found peace. || 4 || 4 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: An intense yearning
to meet God has welled up in my heart. I have gone out searching to find my Beloved
Husband Lord. Hearing news of my Beloved, I have laid out my bed in my home..
Wandering, wandering all around, I came, but I did not even see Him. || 1 || How
can this poor heart be comforted? Come and meet me, O Friend; I am a sacrifice to
You. || 1 || Pause || One bed is spread out for the bride and her Husband Lord. The
bride is asleep, while her Husband Lord is always awake. The bride is intoxicated, as if
she has drunk wine. The soul-bride only awakens when her Husband Lord calls to her.
|| 2 || She has lost hope — so many days have passed. I have travelled through all
the lands and the countries. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 738 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I cannot survive, even for an instant, without the feet of my Beloved. When God
becomes Merciful, I become fortunate, and then I meet Him. || 3 || Becoming
Merciful, He has united me with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. The fire has
been quenched, and I have found my Husband Lord within my own home. I am now
adorned with all sorts of decorations. Says Nanak, the Guru has dispelled my doubt. ||
4 || Wherever I look, I see my Husband Lord there, O Siblings of Destiny. When the
door is opened, then the mind is restrained. || 1 || Second Pause || 5 || SOOHEE,
FIFTH MEHL: What virtues and excellences of Yours should I cherish and contemplate?
I am worthless, while You are the Great Giver. I am Your slave — what clever tricks
could I ever try? This soul and body are totally Yours || 1 || O my Darling, Blissful
Beloved, who fascinates my mind — I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your
Darshan. || 1 || Pause || O God, You are the Great Giver, and I am just a poor
beggar; You are forever and ever benevolent. I cannot accomplish anything by myself,
O my Unapproachable and Infinite Lord and Master. || 2 || What service can I
perform? What should I say to please You? How can I gain the Blessed Vision of Your
Darshan? Your extent cannot be found — Your limits cannot be found. My mind longs
for Your Feet. || 3 || I beg with persistence to receive this gift, that the dust of the
Saints might touch my face. The Guru has showered His Mercy upon servant Nanak;
reaching out with His Hand, God has delivered him. || 4 || 6 ||
SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

His service is insignificant, but his demands are very great. He does not obtain the
Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, but he says that he has arrived there || 1 || He
competes with those who have been accepted by the Beloved Lord. This is how
stubborn the false fool is! || 1 || Pause || He wears religious robes, but he does not
practice Truth. He says that he has found the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, but he
cannot even get near it. || 2 || He says that he is unattached, but he is intoxicated
with Maya. There is no love in his mind, and yet he says that he is imbued with the
Lord. || 3 || Says Nanak, hear my prayer, God: I am silly, stubborn and filled with
sexual desire — please, liberate me! || 4 || I gaze upon the glorious greatness of the
Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. You are the Giver of Peace, the Loving Primal Being. ||
1 || Second Pause || 1 || 7 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: He gets up early, to do his
evil deeds, but when it is time to meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, then he
sleeps. || 1 || The ignorant person does not take advantage of the opportunity. He is
attached to Maya, and engrossed in worldly delights. || 1 || Pause || He rides the
waves of greed, puffed up with joy. He does not see the Blessed Vision of the Darshan
of the Holy. || 2 || The ignorant clown will never understand. Again and again, he
becomes engrossed in entanglements. || 1 || Pause || He listens to the sounds of
sin and the music of corruption, and he is pleased. His mind is too lazy to listen to the
Praises of the Lord. || 3 || You do not see with your eyes — you are so blind! You
shall have to leave all these false affairs. || 1 || Pause || Says Nanak, please forgive
me, God. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 739 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Have Mercy upon me, and bless me with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
|| 4 || He alone obtains something, who becomes the dust under the feet of all. And
he alone repeats the Naam, whom God causes to understand. || 1 || Pause || 2 || 8
|| SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Within the home of his own self, he does not even come to
see his Lord and Master. And yet, around his neck, he hangs a stone god. || 1 || The
faithless cynic wanders around, deluded by doubt. He churns water, and after wasting
his life away, he dies. || 1 || Pause || That stone, which he calls his god, that stone
pulls him down and drowns him. || 2 || O sinner, you are untrue to your own self; a
boat of stone will not carry you across. || 3 || Meeting the Guru, O Nanak, I know my
Lord and Master. The Perfect Architect of Destiny is pervading and permeating the
water, the land and the sky. || 4 || 3 || 9 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: How have you
enjoyed your Dear Beloved? O sister, please teach me, please show me. || 1 ||
Crimson, crimson, crimson — this is the color of the soul-bride who is imbued with the
Love of her Beloved. || 1 || Pause || I wash Your Feet with my eye-lashes.
Wherever You send me, there I will go. || 2 || I would trade meditation, austerity,
self-discipline and celibacy, if I could only meet the Lord of my life, for even an instant.
|| 3 || She who eradicates her self-conceit, power and arrogant intellect, O Nanak, is
the true soul-bride. || 4 || 4 || 10 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: You are my Life, the
very Support of my breath of life. Gazing upon You, beholding You, my mind is soothed
and comforted. || 1 || You are my Friend, You are my Beloved. I shall never forget
You. || 1 || Pause || I am Your indentured servant; I am Your slave. You are my
Great Lord and Master, the treasure of excellence. || 2 || There are millions of
servants in Your Court — Your Royal Darbaar. Each and every instant, You dwell with
them. || 3 || I am nothing; everything is Yours. Through and through, You abide with
Nanak. || 4 || 5 || 11 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: His Mansions are so comfortable,
and His gates are so lofty. Within them, His beloved devotees dwell. || 1 || The
Natural Speech of God is so very sweet. How rare is that person, who sees it with his
eyes. || 1 || Pause || There, in the arena of the congregation, the divine music of
the Naad, the sound current, is sung. There, the Saints celebrate with their Lord. || 2
|| Neither birth nor death is there, neither pain nor pleasure. The Ambrosial Nectar of
the True Name rains down there. || 3 || From the Guru, I have come to know the
mystery of this speech. Nanak speaks the Bani of the Lord, Har, Har. || 4 || 6 || 12 ||
SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: By the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, millions of sins are
erased. Meeting with them, this terrifying world-ocean is crossed over || 1 || They are
my companions, and they are my dear friends, who inspire me to remember the Lord‟s
Name. || 1 || Pause || Hearing the Word of His Shabad, I am totally at peace. When
I serve Him, the Messenger of Death is chased away. || 2 || His comfort and
consolation soothes and supports my mind. Remembering Him in meditation, my face is
radiant and bright. || 3 || God embellishes and supports His servants. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 740 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Nanak seeks the Protection of their Sanctuary; he is forever a sacrifice to them. || 4 ||
7 || 13 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The angelic beings and demi-gods are not
permitted to remain here. The silent sages and humble servants also must arise and
depart. || 1 || Only those who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har, are seen to live on. In
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, they obtain the Blessed Vision of the
Lord‟s Darshan. || 1 || Pause || Kings, emperors and merchants must die. Whoever
is seen shall be consumed by death. || 2 || Mortal beings are entangled, clinging to
false worldly attachments. And when they must leave them behind, then they regret
and grieve. || 3 || O Lord, O treasure of mercy, please bless Nanak with this gift, that
he may chant Your Name, day and night. || 4 || 8 || 14 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL:
You dwell deep within the heart of each and every being. The entire universe is strung
on Your Thread. || 1 || You are my Beloved, the Support of my breath of life.
Beholding You, gazing upon You, my mind blossoms forth. || 1 || Pause ||
Wandering, wandering, wandering through countless incarnations, I have grown so
weary. Now, I hold tight to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. || 2 || You
are inaccessible, incomprehensible, invisible and infinite. Nanak remembers You in
meditation, day and night. || 3 || 9 || 15 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: What is the use
of the glory of Maya? It disappears in no time at all. || 1 || This is a dream, but the
sleeper does not know it. In his unconscious state, he clings to it. || 1 || Pause ||
The poor fool is enticed by the great attachments of the world. Gazing upon them,
watching them, he must still arise and depart. || 2 || The Royal Court of His Darbaar
is the highest of the high. He creates and destroys countless beings. || 3 || There has
never been any other, and there shall never be. O Nanak, meditate on the One God. ||
4 || 10 || 16 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Meditating, meditating in remembrance on
Him, I live. I wash Your Lotus Feet, and drink in the wash water. || 1 || He is my
Lord, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. My Lord and Master abides with His
humble devotees. || 1 || Pause || Hearing, hearing Your Ambrosial Naam, I
meditate on it. Twenty-four hours a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. || 2 ||
Beholding, beholding Your divine play, my mind is in bliss. Your Glorious Virtues are
infinite, O God, O Lord of supreme bliss. || 3 || Meditating in remembrance on Him,
fear cannot touch me. Forever and ever, Nanak meditates on the Lord. || 4 || 11 || 17
|| SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Within my heart, I meditate on the Word of the Guru‟s
Teachings. With my tongue, I chant the Chant of the Lord. || 1 || The image of His
vision is fruitful; I am a sacrifice to it. His Lotus Feet are the Support of the mind, the
Support of the very breath of life. || 1 || Pause || In the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, the cycle of birth and death is ended. To hear the Ambrosial
Sermon is the support of my ears. || 2 || I have renounced sexual desire, anger,
greed and emotional attachment. I have enshrined the Naam within myself, with
charity, true cleansing and righteous conduct. || 3 || Says Nanak, I have
contemplated this essence of reality; chanting the Name of the Lord, I am carried
across. || 4 || 12 || 18 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The sinner is absorbed in greed
and emotional attachment. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 741 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He has not performed any service to the Creator Lord. || 1 || O God, Your Name is
the Purifier of sinners. I am worthless — please save me! || 1 || Pause || O God,
You are the Great Giver, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. The body of the
egotistical human is perishable. || 2 || Tastes and pleasures, conflicts and jealousy,
and intoxication with Maya — attached to these, the jewel of human life is wasted. || 3
|| The Sovereign Lord King is the Destroyer of pain, the Life of the world. Forsaking
everything, Nanak has entered His Sanctuary. || 4 || 13 || 19 || SOOHEE, FIFTH
MEHL: He sees with his eyes, but he is called blind; he hears, but he does not hear.
And the One who dwells near at hand, he thinks that He is far away; the sinner is
committing sins. || 1 || Do only those deeds which will save you, O mortal being.
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and the Ambrosial Word of His Bani. || 1 ||
Pause || You are forever imbued with the love of horses and mansions. Nothing shall
go along with you. || 2 || You may clean and decorate the vessel of clay, but it is so
very filthy; it shall receive its punishment from the Messenger of Death. || 3 || You
are bound by sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment. You are sinking
down into the great pit. || 4 || Hear this prayer of Nanak, O Lord; I am a stone,
sinking down — please, rescue me! || 5 || 14 || 20 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: One
who remains dead while yet alive understands God. He meets that humble being
according to the karma of his past actions. || 1 || Listen, O friend — this is how to
cross over the terrifying world-ocean. Meet with the Holy, and chant the Lord‟s Name
|| 1 || Pause || There is no other to know, except for the One Lord. So realize that
the Supreme Lord God is within each and every heart. || 2 || Whatever He does,
accept that as good. Know the value of the beginning and the end. || 3 || Says
Nanak, I am a sacrifice to that humble being, within whose heart the Lord dwells. || 4
|| 15 || 21 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Guru is the Transcendent Lord, the Creator
Lord. He gives His Support to the entire Universe. || 1 || Meditate within your mind
on the Lotus Feet of the Guru. Pain and suffering shall leave this body. || 1 || Pause
|| The True Guru saves the drowning being from the terrifying world-ocean. He
reunites those who were separated for countless incarnations. || 2 || Serve the Guru,
day and night. Your mind shall come to have peace, pleasure and poise. || 3 || By
great good fortune, one obtains the dust of the feet of the True Guru. Nanak is forever
a sacrifice to the True Guru. || 4 || 16 || 22 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: I am a
sacrifice to my True Guru. Twenty-four hours a day, I sing the Praises of the Lord, Har,
Har. || 1 || Meditate in remembrance on God, your Lord and Master. He is the Innerknower, the Searcher of all hearts. || 1 || Pause || So love the Lord‟s Lotus Feet,
and live a lifestyle which is true, perfect and spotless. || 2 || By the Grace of the
Saints, the Lord comes to dwell within the mind, and the sins and residues of countless
incarnations are eradicated. || 3 || Please be Merciful, O God, O Merciful to the meek. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 742 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints. || 4 || 17 || 23 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL:
Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live. My karma is perfect, O my God.
|| 1 || Please, listen to this prayer, O my God. Please bless me with Your Name, and
make me Your chaylaa, Your disciple. || 1 || Pause || Please keep me under Your
Protection, O God, O Great Giver. By Guru‟s Grace, a few people understand this. || 2
|| Please hear my prayer, O God, my Friend. May Your Lotus Feet abide within my
consciousness. || 3 || Nanak makes one prayer: may I never forget You, O perfect
treasure of virtue. || 4 || 18 || 24 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: He is my friend,
companion, child, relative and sibling. Wherever I look, I see the Lord as my companion
and helper. || 1 || The Lord‟s Name is my social status, my honor and wealth. He is
my pleasure, poise, bliss and peace. || 1 || Pause || I have strapped on the armor of
meditation on the Supreme Lord God. It cannot be pierced, even by millions of
weapons. || 2 || The Sanctuary of the Lord‟s Feet is my fortress and battlement. The
Messenger of Death, the torturer, cannot demolish it. || 3 || Slave Nanak is forever a
sacrifice to the selfless servants and Saints of the Sovereign Lord, the Destroyer of ego.
|| 4 || 19 || 25 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Where the Glorious Praises of God, the
Lord of the world are continually sung, there is bliss, joy, happiness and peace. || 1 ||
Come, O my companions — let us go and enjoy God. Let us fall at the feet of the holy,
humble beings. || 1 || Pause || I pray for the dust of the feet of the humble. It shall
wash away the sinful residues of countless incarnations. || 2 || I dedicate my mind,
body, breath of life and soul to God. Remembering the Lord in meditation, I have
eradicated pride and emotional attachment. || 3 || O Lord, O Merciful to the meek,
please give me faith and confidence, so that slave Nanak may remain absorbed in Your
Sanctuary. || 4 || 20 || 26 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The city of heaven is where the
Saints dwell. They enshrine the Lotus Feet of God within their hearts. || 1 || Listen, O
my mind and body, and let me show you the way to find peace, so that you may eat
and enjoy the various delicacies of the Lord || 1 || Pause || Taste the Ambrosial
Nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your mind. Its taste is wondrous — it
cannot be described. || 2 || Your greed shall die, and your thirst shall be quenched.
The humble beings seek the Sanctuary of the Supreme Lord God. || 3 || The Lord
dispels the fears and attachments of countless incarnations. God has showered His
Mercy and Grace upon slave Nanak. || 4 || 21 || 27 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: God
covers the many shortcomings of His slaves. Granting His Mercy, God makes them His
own. || 1 || You emancipate Your humble servant, and rescue him from the noose of
the world, which is just a dream. || 1 || Pause || Even huge mountains of sin and
corruption are removed in an instant by the Merciful Lord. || 2 || Sorrow, disease and
the most terrible calamities are removed by meditating on the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 743 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Bestowing His Glance of Grace, He attaches us to the hem of His robe. Grasping the
Lord‟s Feet, O Nanak, we enter His Sanctuary. || 4 || 22 || 28 || SOOHEE, FIFTH
MEHL: One who withdraws from God‟s Path, and attaches himself to the world, is
known as a sinner in both worlds. || 1 || He alone is approved, who pleases the Lord.
Only He Himself knows His creative omnipotence. || 1 || Pause || One who practices
truth, righteous living, charity and good deeds, has the supplies for God‟s Path. Worldly
success shall not fail him. || 2 || Within and among all, the One Lord is awake. As He
attaches us, so are we attached. || 3 || You are inaccessible and unfathomable, O my
True Lord and Master. Nanak speaks as You inspire him to speak. || 4 || 23 || 29 ||
SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: In the early hours of the morning, I chant the Lord‟s Name. I
have fashioned a shelter for myself, hear and hereafter. || 1 || Forever and ever, I
chant the Lord‟s Name, and the desires of my mind are fulfilled. || 1 || Pause || Sing
the Praises of the Eternal, Imperishable Lord God, night and day. In life, and in death,
you shall find your eternal, unchanging home. || 2 || So serve the Sovereign Lord,
and you shall never lack anything. While eating and consuming, you shall pass your life
in peace. || 3 || O Life of the World, O Primal Being, I have found the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy. By Guru‟s Grace, O Nanak, I meditate on the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. || 4 || 24 || 30 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: When the Perfect Guru
becomes merciful, my pains are taken away, and my works are perfectly completed. ||
1 || Gazing upon, beholding the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I live; I am a sacrifice
to Your Lotus Feet. Without You, O my Lord and Master, who belongs to me? || 1 ||
Pause || I have fallen in love with the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, by the
karma of my past actions and my pre-ordained destiny. || 2 || Chant the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har; how wondrous is His glory! The three types of illness cannot consume
it. || 3 || May I never forget, even for an instant, the Lord‟s Feet. Nanak begs for this
gift, O my Beloved. || 4 || 25 || 31 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: May there be such an
auspicious time, O my Beloved, when, with my tongue, I may chant the Lord‟s Name ||
1 || Hear my prayer, O God, O Merciful to the meek. The Holy Saints ever sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord, the Source of Nectar. || 1 || Pause || Your meditation
and remembrance is life-giving, God. You dwell near those upon whom You show
mercy. || 2 || Your Name is the food to satisfy the hunger of Your humble servants.
You are the Great Giver, O Lord God. || 3 || The Saints take pleasure in repeating the
Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, the Lord, the Great Giver, is All-knowing. || 4 || 26 || 32 ||
SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Your life is slipping away, but you never even notice. You are
constantly entangled in false attachments and conflicts. || 1 || Meditate, vibrate
constantly, day and night, on the Lord. You shall be victorious in this priceless human
life, in the Protection of the Lord‟s Sanctuary. || 1 || Pause || You eagerly commit
sins and practice corruption, but you do not enshrine the jewel of the Lord‟s Name
within your heart, even for an instant. || 2 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 744 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Feeding and pampering your body, your life is passing away, but you do not experience
the state of victory of the Lord of the Universe. || 3 || So enter the Sanctuary of the
All-powerful, Unfathomable Lord and Master. O God, O Searcher of hearts, please, save
Nanak! || 4 || 27 || 33 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Cross over the terrifying worldocean in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Remember in meditation the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the source of jewels. || 1 || Remembering, remembering
the Lord in meditation, I live. All pain, disease and suffering is dispelled, meeting the
Perfect Guru; sin has been eradicated. || 1 || Pause || The immortal status is
obtained through the Name of the Lord; the mind and body become spotless and pure,
which is the true purpose of life. || 2 || Twenty-four hours a day, meditate on the
Supreme Lord God. By pre-ordained destiny, the Name is obtained. || 3 || I have
entered His Sanctuary, and I meditate on the Lord, Merciful to the meek. Nanak longs
for the dust of the Saints. || 4 || 28 || 34 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The beautiful
one does not know the work of his own home. The fool is engrossed in false
attachments. || 1 || As You attach us, so we are attached. When You bless us with
Your Name, we chant it. || 1 || Pause || The Lord‟s slaves are imbued with the Love
of the Lord. They are intoxicated with the Lord, night and day. || 2 || Reaching out to
grasp hold of our arms, God lifts us up. Separated for countless incarnations, we are
united with Him again. || 3 || Save me, O God, O my Lord and Master — shower me
with Your Mercy. Slave Nanak seeks Sanctuary at Your Door, O Lord. || 4 || 29 || 35 ||
SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: By the Grace of the Saints, I have found my eternal home. I
have found total peace, and I shall not waver again. || 1 || I meditate on the Guru,
and the Lord‟s Feet, within my mind. In this way, the Creator Lord has made me steady
and stable. || 1 || Pause || I sing the Glorious Praises of the unchanging, eternal
Lord God, and the noose of death is snapped. || 2 || Showering His Mercy, he has
attached me to the hem of His robe. In constant bliss, Nanak sings His Glorious Praises.
|| 3 || 30 || 36 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Words, the Teachings of the Holy
Saints, are Ambrosial Nectar. Whoever meditates on the Lord‟s Name is emancipated;
he chants the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with his tongue. || 1 || Pause || The
pains and sufferings of the Dark Age of Kali Yuga are eradicated, when the One Name
abides within the mind. || 1 || I apply the dust of the feet of the Holy to my face and
forehead. Nanak has been saved, in the Sanctuary of the Guru, the Lord. || 2 || 31 ||
37 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe,
the Merciful Lord. Please, bless me with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, O Perfect,
Compassionate Lord. || 1 || Pause || Please, grant Your Grace, and cherish me. My
soul and body are all Your property. || 1 || Only meditation on the Ambrosial Naam,
the Name of the Lord, will go along with you. Nanak begs for the dust of the Saints. ||
2 || 32 || 38 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Without Him, there is no other at all. The
True Lord Himself is our anchor. || 1 || The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is our only
support. The Creator, the Cause of causes, is All-powerful and Infinite. || 1 || Pause
|| He has eradicated all illness, and healed me. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 745 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, He Himself has become my Savior. || 2 || 33 || 39 || SOOHEE, FIFTH
MEHL: Everyone longs for the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan. By perfect destiny,
it is obtained. || Pause || Forsaking the Beautiful Lord, how can they go to sleep?
The great enticer Maya has led them down the path of sin. || 1 || This butcher has
separated them from the Beloved Lord. This merciless one shows no mercy at all to the
poor beings. || 2 || Countless lifetimes have passed away, wandering aimlessly. The
terrible, treacherous Maya does not even allow them to dwell in their own home. || 3 ||
Day and night, they receive the rewards of their own actions. Don‟t blame anyone else;
your own actions lead you astray. || 4 || Listen, O Friend, O Saint, O humble Sibling
of Destiny: in the Sanctuary of the Lord‟s Feet, Nanak has found Salvation. || 5 || 34 ||
40 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE:

Even a crude hut is sublime and beautiful, if the Lord‟s Praises are sung within it. Those
mansions where the Lord is forgotten are useless. || 1 || Pause || Even poverty is
bliss, if God comes to mind in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. This worldly
glory might just as well burn; it only traps the mortals in Maya. || 1 || One may have
to grind corn, and wear a coarse blanket, but still, one can find peace of mind and
contentment. Even empires are of no use at all, if they do not bring satisfaction. || 2 ||
Someone may wander around naked, but if he loves the One Lord, he receives honor
and respect. Silk and satin clothes are worthless, if they lead to greed. || 3 ||
Everything is in Your Hands, God. You Yourself are the Doer, the Cause of causes. With
each and every breath, may I continue to remember You. Please, bless Nanak with this
gift. || 4 || 1 || 41 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord‟s Saint is my life and wealth.
I am his water-carrier. He is dearer to me than all my siblings, friends and children. ||
1 || Pause || I make my hair into a fan, and wave it over the Saint. I bow my head
low, to touch his feet, and apply his dust to my face. || 1 || I offer my prayer with
sweet words, in sincere humility. Renouncing egotism, I enter His Sanctuary. I have
found the Lord, the treasure of virtue. || 2 || I gaze upon the Blessed Vision of the
Lord‟s humble servant, again and again. I cherish and gather in His Ambrosial Words
within my mind; time and time again, I bow to Him. || 3 || In my mind, I wish, hope
and beg for the Society of the Lord‟s humble servants. Be Merciful to Nanak, O God,
and lead him to the feet of Your slaves. || 4 || 2 || 42 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: She
has enticed the worlds and solar systems; I have fallen into her clutches. O Lord, please
save this corrupt soul of mine; please bless me with Your Name. || 1 || Pause || She
has not brought anyone peace, but still, I chase after her. She forsakes everyone, but
still, I cling to her, again and again. || 1 || Have Mercy on me, O Lord of Compassion;
please let me sing Your Glorious Praises, O Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 746 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
This is Nanak‟s prayer, O Lord, that he may join and merge with the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy. || 2 || 3 || 43 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE, PARTAAL:

Love of the enticing Beloved Lord is the most glorious love. Meditate, O mind, on the
One Lord of the Universe — nothing else is of any account. Attach your mind to the
Saints, and abandon the path of duality. || 1 || Pause || The Lord is absolute and
unmanifest; He has assumed the most sublime manifestation. He has fashioned
countless body chambers of many, varied, different, myriad forms. Within them, the
mind is the policeman; my Beloved lives in the temple of my inner self. He plays there
in ecstasy. He does not die, and he never grows old. || 1 || He is engrossed in
worldly activities, wandering around in various ways. He steals the property of others,
and is surrounded by corruption and sin. But now, he joins the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, and stands before the Lord‟s Gate. He obtains the Blessed Vision
of the Lord‟s Darshan. Nanak has met the Guru; he shall not be reincarnated again. ||
2 || 1 || 44 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord has made this world a stage; He
fashioned the expanse of the entire creation. || 1 || Pause || He fashioned it in
various ways, with limitless colors and forms. He watches over it with joy, and He never
tires of enjoying it. He enjoys all the delights, and yet He remains unattached. || 1 ||
He has no color, no sign, no mouth and no beard. I cannot describe Your play. Nanak is
the dust of the feet of the Saints. || 2 || 2 || 45 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: I have
come to You. I have come to Your Sanctuary. I have come to place my faith in You. I
have come seeking Mercy. If it pleases You, save me, O my Lord and Master. The Guru
has placed me upon the Path. || 1 || Pause || Maya is very treacherous and difficult
to pass through. It is like a violent wind-storm. || 1 || I am so afraid to hear that the
Righteous Judge of Dharma is so strict and stern. || 2 || The world is a deep, dark
pit; it is all on fire. || 3 || I have grasped the Support of the Holy Saints. Nanak
meditates on the Lord. Now, I have found the Perfect Lord. || 4 || 3 || 46 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL, SIXTH HOUSE:

I offer this prayer to the True Guru, to bless me with the sustenance of the Naam.
When the True King is pleased, the world is rid of its diseases. || 1 || You are the
Support of Your devotees, and the Shelter of the Saints, O True Creator Lord. || 1 ||
Pause || True are Your devices, and True is Your Court. True are Your treasures, and
True is Your expanse. || 2 || Your Form is inaccessible, and Your Vision is
incomparably beautiful. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 747 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I am a sacrifice to Your servants; they love Your Name, O Lord. || 3 || All desires are
fulfilled, when the Inaccessible and Infinite Lord is obtained. Guru Nanak has met the
Supreme Lord God; I am a sacrifice to Your Feet. || 4 || 1 || 47 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL, SEVENTH HOUSE:

He alone obeys Your Will, O Lord, unto whom You are Merciful. That alone is devotional
worship, which is pleasing to Your Will. You are the Cherisher of all beings. || 1 || O
my Sovereign Lord, You are the Support of the Saints. Whatever pleases You, they
accept. You are the sustenance of their minds and bodies. || 1 || Pause || You are
kind and compassionate, the treasure of mercy, the fulfiller of our hopes. You are the
Beloved Lord of life of all Your devotees; You are the Beloved of Your devotees. || 2 ||
You are unfathomable, infinite, lofty and exalted. There is no one else like You. This is
my prayer, O my Lord and Master; may I never forget You, O Peace-giving Lord. || 3 ||
Day and night, with each and every breath, I sing Your Glorious Praises, if it is pleasing
to Your Will. Nanak begs for the peace of Your Name, O Lord and Master; as it is
pleasing to Your Will, I shall attain it. || 4 || 1 || 48 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Where
is that place, where You are never forgotten, Lord? Twenty-four hours a day, they
meditate on You, and their bodies become spotless and pure. || 1 || O my Lord, I
have come searching for that place. After seeking and searching, I found Sanctuary in
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. || 1 || Pause || Reading and reciting
the Vedas, Brahma grew weary, but he did not find even a tiny bit of God‟s worth. The
seekers and Siddhas wander around bewailing; they too are enticed by Maya. || 2 ||
There were ten regal incarnations of Vishnu; and then there was Shiva, the renunciate.
He did not find Your limits either, although he grew weary of smearing his body with
ashes. || 3 || Peace, poise and bliss are found in the subtle essence of the Naam. The
Lord‟s Saints sing the songs of joy. I have obtained the Fruitful Vision of Guru Nanak‟s
Darshan, and with my mind and body I meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. || 4 || 2 || 49
|| SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The religious rites, rituals and hypocrisies which are seen,
are plundered by the Messenger of Death, the ultimate tax collector. In the state of
Nirvaanaa, sing the Kirtan of the Creator‟s Praises; contemplating Him in meditation,
even for an instant, one is saved. || 1 || O Saints, cross over the world-ocean. One
who practices the Teachings of the Saints, by Guru‟s Grace, is carried across. || 1 ||
Pause || Millions of cleansing baths at sacred shrines of pilgrimage only fill the mortal
with filth in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. One who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord
in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, becomes spotlessly pure. || 2 || One
may read all the books of the Vedas, the Bible, the Simritees and the Shaastras, but
they will not bring liberation. One who, as Gurmukh, chants the One Word, acquires a
spotlessly pure reputation. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 748 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The four castes — the Kh‟shaatriyas, Brahmins, Soodras and Vaishyas — are equal in
respect to the teachings. One who, as Gurmukh, chants the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, is saved. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Nanak, God is permeating the hearts of
each and every being. || 4 || 3 || 50 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Whatever God
causes to happen is accepted, by those who are attuned to the Love of the Lord‟s
Name. Those who fall at the Feet of God are respected everywhere. || 1 || O my
Lord, no one is as great as the Lord‟s Saints. The devotees are in harmony with their
God; He is in the water, the land, and the sky. || 1 || Pause || Millions of sinners
have been saved in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; the Messenger of
Death does not even approach them. Those who have been separated from the Lord,
for countless incarnations, are reunited with the Lord again. || 2 || Attachment to
Maya, doubt and fear are eradicated, when one enters the Sanctuary of the Saints.
Whatever wishes one harbors, are obtained from the Saints. || 3 || How can I
describe the glory of the Lord‟s humble servants? They are pleasing to their God. Says
Nanak, those who meet the True Guru, become independent of all obligations. || 4 || 4
|| 51 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Giving me Your Hand, You saved me from the
terrible fire, when I sought Your Sanctuary. Deep within my heart, I respect Your
strength; I have abandoned all other hopes. || 1 || O my Sovereign Lord, when You
enter my consciousness, I am saved. || 1 || Pause || You pulled me up out of the
deep, dark pit. You have become merciful to me. You care for me, and bless me with
total peace; You Yourself cherish me. || 2 || The Transcendent Lord has blessed me
with His Glance of Grace; breaking my bonds, He has delivered me. God Himself
inspires me to worship Him; He Himself inspires me to serve Him. || 3 || My doubts
have gone, my fears and infatuations have been dispelled, and all my sorrows are gone.
O Nanak, the Lord, the Giver of peace has been merciful to me. I have met the Perfect
True Guru. || 4 || 5 || 52 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: When nothing existed, what
deeds were being done? And what karma caused anyone to be born at all? The Lord
Himself set His play in motion, and He Himself beholds it. He created the Creation. || 1
|| O my Sovereign Lord, I cannot do anything at all by myself. He Himself is the
Creator, He Himself is the Cause. He is pervading deep within all. || 1 || Pause || If
my account were to be judged, I would never be saved. My body is transitory and
ignorant. Take pity upon me, O Creator Lord God; Your Forgiving Grace is singular and
unique. || 2 || You created all beings and creatures. Each and every heart meditates
on You. Your condition and expanse are known only to You; the value of Your creative
omnipotence cannot be estimated. || 3 || I am worthless, foolish, thoughtless and
ignorant. I know nothing about good actions and righteous living. Take pity on Nanak,
that he may sing Your Glorious Praises; and that Your Will may seem sweet to him. ||
4 || 6 || 53 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 749 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Your Saints are very fortunate; their homes are filled with the wealth of the Lord‟s
Name. Their birth is approved, and their actions are fruitful. || 1 || O my Lord, I am a
sacrifice to the humble servants of the Lord. I make my hair into a fan, and wave it over
them; I apply the dust of their feet to my face. || 1 || Pause || Those generous,
humble beings are above both birth and death. They give the gift of the soul, and
practice devotional worship; they inspire others to meet the Lord. || 2 || True are
their commands, and true are their empires; they are attuned to the Truth. True is their
happiness, and true is their greatness. They know the Lord, to whom they belong. || 3
|| I wave the fan over them, carry water for them, and grind corn for the humble
servants of the Lord. Nanak offers this prayer to God — please, grant me the sight of
Your humble servants. || 4 || 7 || 54 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The True Guru is the
Transcendent Lord, the Supreme Lord God; He Himself is the Creator Lord. Your
servant begs for the dust of Your feet. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your
Darshan. || 1 || O my Sovereign Lord, as You keep me, so do I remain. When it
pleases You, I chant Your Name. You alone can grant me peace. || 1 || Pause ||
Liberation, comfort and proper lifestyle come from serving You; You alone cause us to
serve You. That place is heaven, where the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises are sung. You
Yourself instill faith into us. || 2 || Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance
on the Naam, I live; my mind and body are enraptured. I wash Your Lotus Feet, and
drink in this water, O my True Guru, O Merciful to the meek. || 3 || I am a sacrifice to
that most wonderful time when I came to Your Door. God has become compassionate
to Nanak; I have found the Perfect True Guru. || 4 || 8 || 55 || SOOHEE, FIFTH
MEHL: When You come to mind, I am totally in bliss. One who forgets You might just
as well be dead. That being, whom You bless with Your Mercy, O Creator Lord,
constantly meditates on You. || 1 || O my Lord and Master, You are the honor of the
dishonored such as me. I offer my prayer to You, God; listening, listening to the Word
of Your Bani, I live. || 1 || Pause || May I become the dust of the feet of Your
humble servants. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I enshrine Your
Ambrosial Word within my heart. By Your Grace, I have found the Company of the Holy.
|| 2 || I place the state of my inner being before You; there is no other as great as
You. He alone is attached, whom You attach; he alone is Your devotee. || 3 || With
my palms pressed together, I beg for this one gift; O my Lord and Master, if it pleases
You, I shall obtain it. With each and every breath, Nanak adores You; twenty-four hours
a day, I sing Your Glorious Praises. || 4 || 9 || 56 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: When
You stand over our heads, O Lord and Master, how can we suffer in pain? The mortal
being does not know how to chant Your Name — he is intoxicated with the wine of
Maya, and the thought of death does not even enter his mind. || 1 || O my Sovereign
Lord, You belong to the Saints, and the Saints belong to You. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 750 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Your servant is not afraid of anything; the Messenger of Death cannot even approach
him. || 1 || Pause || Those who are attuned to Your Love, O my Lord and Master,
are released from the pains of birth and death. No one can erase Your Blessings; the
True Guru has given me this assurance. || 2 || Those who meditate on the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, obtain the fruits of peace. Twenty-four hours a day, they worship
and adore You. In Your Sanctuary, with Your Support, they subdue the five villains. ||
3 || I know nothing about wisdom, meditation and good deeds; I know nothing about
Your excellence. Guru Nanak is the greatest of all; He saved my honor in this Dark Age
of Kali Yuga. || 4 || 10 || 57 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: Renouncing everything, I
have come to the Guru‟s Sanctuary; save me, O my Savior Lord! Whatever You link me
to, to that I am linked; what can this poor creature do? || 1 || O my Dear Lord God,
You are the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. Be Merciful to me, O Divine,
Compassionate Guru, that I may constantly sing the Glorious Praises of my Lord and
Master. || 1 || Pause || Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate on my God; by Guru‟s
Grace, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean. Renouncing self-conceit, I have become
the dust of all men‟s feet; in this way, I die, while I am still alive. || 2 || How fruitful
is the life of that being in this world, who chants the Name in the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy. All desires are fulfilled, for the one who is blessed with God‟s
Kindness and Mercy. || 3 || O Merciful to the meek, Kind and Compassionate Lord
God, I seek Your Sanctuary. Take pity upon me, and bless me with Your Name. Nanak
is the dust of the feet of the Holy. || 4 || 11 || 58 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, ASHTAPADEE, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

I am totally without virtue; I have no virtue at all. How can I meet my Husband Lord?
|| 1 || I have no beauty, no enticing eyes. I do not have a noble family, good manners
or a sweet voice. || 1 || Pause || The soul-bride adorns herself with peace and
poise. But she is a happy soul-bride, only if her Husband Lord is pleased with her. || 2
|| He has no form or feature; at the very last instant, he cannot suddenly be
contemplated. || 3 || I have no understanding, intellect or cleverness. Have Mercy
upon me, God, and attach me to Your Feet. || 4 || She may be very clever, but this
does not please her Husband Lord. Attached to Maya, she is deluded by doubt. || 5 ||
But if she gets rid of her ego, then she merges in her Husband Lord. Only then can the
soul-bride obtain the nine treasures of her Beloved. || 6 || Separated from You for
countless incarnations, I have suffered in pain. Please take my hand, O my Beloved
Sovereign Lord God. || 7 || Prays Nanak, the Lord is, and shall always be. She alone
is ravished and enjoyed, with whom the Beloved Lord is pleased. || 8 || 1 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 751 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, NINTH HOUSE:

The color of safflower is transitory; it lasts for only a few days. Without the Name, the
false woman is deluded by doubt and plundered by thieves. But those who are attuned
to the True Lord, are not reincarnated again. || 1 || How can one who is already dyed
in the color of the Lord‟s Love, be colored any other color? So serve God the Dyer, and
focus your consciousness on the True Lord. || 1 || Pause || You wander around in
the four directions, but without the good fortune of destiny, you shall never obtain
wealth. If you are plundered by corruption and vice, you shall wander around, but like a
fugitive, you shall find no place of rest. Only those who are protected by the Guru are
saved; their minds are attuned to the Word of the Shabad. || 2 || Those who wear
white clothes, but have filthy and stone-hearted minds, may chant the Lord‟s Name with
their mouths, but they are engrossed in duality; they are thieves. They do not
understand their own roots; they are beasts. They are just animals! || 3 || Constantly,
continually, the mortal seeks pleasures. Constantly, continually, he begs for peace. But
he does not think of the Creator Lord, and so he is overtaken by pain, again and again.
But one, within whose mind the Giver of pleasure and pain dwells — how can his body
feel any need? || 4 || One who has a karmic debt to pay off is summoned, and the
Messenger of Death smashes his head. When his account is called for, it has to be
given. After it is reviewed, payment is demanded. Only love for the True One will save
you; the Forgiver forgives. || 5 || If you make any friend other than God, you shall
die and mingle with the dust. Gazing upon the many games of love, you are beguiled
and bewildered; you come and go in reincarnation. Only by God‟s Grace can you be
saved. By His Grace, He unites in His Union. || 6 || O careless one, you are totally
lacking any wisdom; do not seek wisdom without the Guru. By indecision and inner
conflict, you shall come to ruin. Good and bad both pull at you. Without being attuned
to the Word of the Shabad and the Fear of God, all come under the gaze of the
Messenger of Death. || 7 || He who created the creation and sustains it, gives
sustenance to all. How can you forget Him from your mind? He is the Great Giver,
forever and ever. Nanak shall never forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the
Support of the unsupported. || 8 || 1 || 2 ||
SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, KAAFEE, TENTH HOUSE:

This human birth is so difficult to obtain; the Gurmukh obtains it. The mind and body
are dyed in the deep red color of devotional love, if it pleases the True Guru. || 1 ||
Hel departs with his life embellished and successful, taking the merchandise of the True
Name. He is honored in the Darbaar, the Royal Court, of the Lord, through the Shabad,
the Word of the True Guru, and the Fear of God. || 1 || Pause || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 752 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
One who praises the True Lord with his mind and body, pleases the Mind of the True
Lord. Attuned to the Beloved Lord, the mind is appeased, and finds the Perfect Guru. ||
2 || I live, by cherishing Your Glorious Virtues; You dwell deep within me. You dwell
within my mind, and so it naturally celebrates in joyful delight. || 3 || O my foolish
mind, how can I teach and instruct you? As Gurmukh, sing the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, and so become attuned to His Love. || 4 || Continually, continuously, remember
and cherish your Beloved Lord in your heart. For if you depart with virtue, then pain
shall never afflict you. || 5 || The self-willed manmukh wanders around, deluded by
doubt; he does not enshrine love for the Lord. He dies as a stranger to his own self,
and his mind and body are spoiled. || 6 || Performing service to the Guru, you shall
go home with the profit. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Bani, and the Shabad, the
Word of God, the state of Nirvaanaa is attained. || 7 || Nanak makes this one prayer:
if it pleases Your Will, bless me with a home in Your Name, Lord, that I may sing Your
Glorious Praises. || 8 || 1 || 3 || SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL: As iron is melted in the
forge and re-shaped, so is the godless materialist reincarnated, and forced to wander
aimlessly. || 1 || Without understanding, everything is suffering, earning only more
suffering. In his ego, he comes and goes, wandering in confusion, deluded by doubt. ||
1 || Pause || You save those who are Gurmukh, O Lord, through meditation on Your
Naam. You blend with Yourself, by Your Will, those who practice the Word of the
Shabad. || 2 || You created the Creation, and You Yourself gaze upon it; whatever
You give, is received. You watch, establish and disestablish; You keep all in Your vision
at Your Door. || 3 || The body shall turn to dust, and the soul shall fly away. So
where are their homes and resting places now? They do not find the Mansion of the
Lord‟s Presence, either. || 4 || In the pitch darkness of broad daylight, their wealth is
being plundered. Pride is looting their homes like a thief; where can they file their
complaint? || 5 || The thief does not break into the home of the Gurmukh; he is
awake in the Name of the Lord. The Word of the Shabad puts out the fire of desire;
God‟s Light illuminates and enlightens. || 6 || The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is a
jewel, a ruby; the Guru has taught me the Word of the Shabad. One who follows the
Guru‟s Teachings remains forever free of desire. || 7 || Night and day, enshrine the
Lord‟s Name within your mind. Please unite Nanak in Union, O Lord, if it is pleasing to
Your Will. || 8 || 2 || 4 || SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL: Never forget the Naam, the Name
of the Lord, from your mind; night and day, meditate on it. As You keep me, in Your
Merciful Grace, so do I find peace. || 1 || I am blind, and the Lord‟s Name is my cane.
I remain under the Sheltering Support of my Lord and Master; I am not enticed by
Maya the enticer. || 1 || Pause || Wherever I look, there the Guru has shown me
that God is always with me. Searching inwardly and outwardly as well, I came to see
Him, through the Word of the Shabad. || 2 || So serve the True Guru with love,
through the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. As it pleases You, so by Your
Will, You destroy my doubts and fears. || 3 || At the very moment of birth, he is
afflicted with pain, and in the end, he comes only to die. Birth and death are validated
and approved, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 4 || When there is no ego,
there You are; You fashioned all of this. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 753 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
You Yourself establish and disestablish; through the Word of Your Shabad, You elevate
and exalt. || 5 || When the body rolls in the dust, it is not known where the soul has
gone. He Himself is permeating and pervading; this is wonderful and amazing! || 6 ||
You are not far away, God; You know everything. The Gurmukh sees You ever-present;
You are deep within the nucleus of our inner self. || 7 || Please, bless me with a
home in Your Name; may my inner self be at peace. May slave Nanak sing Your
Glorious Praises; O True Guru, please share the Teachings with me. || 8 || 3 || 5 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE, ASHTAPADEES:

Everything comes from the Naam, the Name of the Lord; without the True Guru, the
Naam is not experienced. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is the sweetest and most
sublime essence, but without tasting it, its flavor cannot be experienced. He wastes this
human life in exchange for a mere shell; he does not understand his own self. But, if he
becomes Gurmukh, then he comes to know the One Lord, and the disease of egotism
does not afflict him. || 1 || I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who has lovingly attached me
to the True Lord. Concentrating on the Word of the Shabad, the soul is illumined and
enlightened. I remain absorbed in celestial ecstasy. || 1 || Pause || The Gurmukh
sings the Praises of the Lord; the Gurmukh understands. The Gurmukh contemplates
the Word of the Shabad. Body and soul are totally rejuvenated through the Guru; the
Gurmukh‟s affairs are resolved in his favor. The blind self-willed manmukh acts blindly,
and earns only poison in this world. Enticed by Maya, he suffers in constant pain,
without the most Beloved Guru. || 2 || He alone is a selfless servant, who serves the
True Guru, and walks in harmony with the True Guru‟s Will. The True Shabad, the Word
of God, is the True Praise of God; enshrine the True Lord within your mind. The
Gurmukh speaks the True Word of Gurbani, and egotism departs from within. He
Himself is the Giver, and True are His actions. He proclaims the True Word of the
Shabad. || 3 || The Gurmukh works, and the Gurmukh earns; the Gurmukh inspires
others to chant the Naam. He is forever unattached, imbued with the Love of the True
Lord, intuitively in harmony with the Guru. The self-willed manmukh always tells lies; he
plants the seeds of poison, and eats only poison. He is bound and gagged by the
Messenger of Death, and burnt in the fire of desire; who can save him, except the
Guru? || 4 || True is that place of pilgrimage, where one bathes in the pool of Truth,
and achieves self-realization as Gurmukh. The Gurmukh understands his own self. The
Lord has shown that the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is the sixty-eight sacred shrines of
pilgrimage; bathing in it, filth is washed away. True and Immaculate is the True Word
of His Shabad; no filth touches or clings to Him. True Praise, True Devotional Praise, is
obtained from the Perfect Guru. || 5 || Body, mind, everything belongs to the Lord;
but the evil-minded ones cannot even say this. If such is the Hukam of the Lord‟s
Command, then one becomes pure and spotless, and the ego is taken away from
within. I have intuitively tasted the Guru‟s Teachings, and the fire of my desire has
been quenched. Attuned to the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, one is naturally intoxicated,
merging imperceptibly into the Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 754 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 6 || The Name of the Lord is known as True, through the Love of the Beloved Guru.
True Glorious Greatness is obtained from the Guru, through the Beloved True Name.
The One True Lord is permeating and pervading among all; how rare is the one who
contemplates this. The Lord Himself unites us in Union, and forgives us; He embellishes
us with true devotional worship. || 7 || All is Truth; Truth, and Truth alone is
pervading; how rare is the Gurmukh who knows this. Birth and death occur by the
Hukam of His Command; the Gurmukh understands his own self. He meditates on the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, and so pleases the True Guru. He receives whatever
rewards he desires. O Nanak, one who eradicates self-conceit from within, has
everything. || 8 || 1 || SOOHEE, THIRD MEHL: The body-bride is very beautiful; she
dwells with her Husband Lord. She becomes the happy soul-bride of her True Husband
Lord, contemplating the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The Lord‟s devotee is forever
attuned to the Lord‟s Love; her ego is burnt away from within. || 1 || Waaho! Waaho!
Blessed, blessed is the Word of the Perfect Guru‟s Bani. It wells up and springs forth
from the Perfect Guru, and merges into Truth. || 1 || Pause || Everything is within
the Lord — the continents, worlds and nether regions. The Life of the World, the Great
Giver, dwells within the body; He is the Cherisher of all. The body-bride is eternally
beautiful; the Gurmukh contemplates the Naam. || 2 || The Lord Himself dwells
within the body; He is invisible and cannot be seen. The foolish self-willed manmukh
does not understand; he goes out searching for the Lord externally. One who serves
the True Guru is always at peace; the True Guru has shown me the Invisible Lord. || 3
|| Within the body there are jewels and precious treasures, the over-flowing treasure
of devotion. Within this body are the nine continents of the earth, its markets, cities and
streets. Within this body are the nine treasures of the Naam; contemplating the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, it is obtained. || 4 || Within the body, the Lord estimates the
weight; He Himself is the weigher. This mind is the jewel, the gem, the diamond; it is
absolutely priceless. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, cannot be purchased at any
price; the Naam is obtained by contemplating the Guru. || 5 || One who becomes
Gurmukh searches this body; all others just wander around in confusion. That humble
being alone obtains it, unto whom the Lord bestows it. What other clever tricks can
anyone try? Within the body, the Fear of God and Love for Him abides; by Guru‟s
Grace, they are obtained. || 6 || Within the body, are Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva,
from whom the whole world emanated. The True Lord has staged and contrived His
own play; the expanse of the Universe comes and goes. The Perfect True Guru Himself
has made it clear, that emancipation comes through the True Name. || 7 || That
body, which serves the True Guru, is embellished by the True Lord Himself. Without the
Name, the mortal finds no place of rest in the Court of the Lord; he shall be tortured by
the Messenger of Death. O Nanak, true glory is bestowed, when the Lord showers His
Mercy. || 8 || 2 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 755 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
RAAG SOOHEE, THIRD MEHL, TENTH HOUSE:

Do not praise the world; it shall simply pass away. Do not praise other people; they
shall die and turn to dust. || 1 || Waaho! Waaho! Hail, hail to my Lord and Master. As
Gurmukh, forever praise the One who is forever True, Independent and Carefree. || 1
|| Pause || Making worldly friendships, the self-willed manmukhs burn and die. In
the City of Death, they are bound and gagged and beaten; this opportunity shall never
come again. || 2 || The lives of the Gurmukhs are fruitful and blessed; they are
committed to the True Word of the Shabad. Their souls are illuminated by the Lord, and
they dwell in peace and pleasure. || 3 || Those who forget the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad are engrossed in the love of duality. Their hunger and thirst never leave them,
and night and day, they wander around burning. || 4 || Those who make friendships
with the wicked, and harbor animosity to the Saints, shall drown with their families, and
their entire lineage shall be obliterated. || 5 || It is not good to slander anyone, but
the foolish, self-willed manmukhs still do it. The faces of the slanderers turn black, and
they fall into the most horrible hell. || 6 || O mind, as you serve, so do you become,
and so are the deeds that you do. Whatever you yourself plant, that is what you shall
have to eat; nothing else can be said about this. || 7 || The speech of the great
spiritual beings has a higher purpose. They are filled to over-flowing with Ambrosial
Nectar, and they have absolutely no greed at all. || 8 || The virtuous accumulate
virtue, and teach others. Those who meet with them are so very fortunate; night and
day, they chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 9 || He who created the
Universe, gives sustenance to it. The One Lord alone is the Great Giver. He Himself is
the True Master. || 10 || That True Lord is always with you; the Gurmukh is blessed
with His Glance of Grace. He Himself shall forgive you, and merge you into Himself;
forever cherish and contemplate God. || 11 || The mind is impure; only the True Lord
is pure. So how can it merge into Him? God merges it into Himself, and then it remains
merged; through the Word of His Shabad, the ego is burnt away. || 12 || Cursed is
the life in this world, of one who forgets her True Husband Lord. The Lord grants His
Mercy, and she does not forget Him, if she contemplates the Guru‟s Teachings. || 13 ||
The True Guru unites her, and so she remains united with Him, with the True Lord
enshrined within her heart. And so united, she will not be separated again; she remains
in the love and affection of the Guru. || 14 || I praise my Husband Lord,
contemplating the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Meeting with my Beloved, I have found
peace; I am His most beautiful and happy soul-bride. || 15 || The mind of the selfwilled manmukh is not softened; his consciousness is totally polluted and stonehearted. Even if the venomous snake is fed on milk, it shall still be filled with poison. ||
16 || He Himself does — who else should I ask? He Himself is the Forgiving Lord.
Through the Guru‟s Teachings, filth is washed away, and then, one is embellished with
the ornament of Truth. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 756 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 17 || True is the Banker, and True are His traders. The false ones cannot remain
there. They do not love the Truth — they are consumed by their pain. || 18 || The
world wanders around in the filth of egotism; it dies, and is re-born, over and again. He
acts in accordance with the karma of his past actions, which no one can erase. || 19 ||
But if he joins the Society of the Saints, then he comes to embrace love for the Truth.
Praising the True Lord with a truthful mind, he becomes true in the Court of the True
Lord. || 20 || The Teachings of the Perfect Guru are perfect; meditate on the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, day and night. Egotism and self-conceit are terrible diseases;
tranquility and stillness come from within. || 21 || I praise my Guru; bowing down to
Him again and again, I fall at His Feet. I place my body and mind in offering unto Him,
eradicating self-conceit from within. || 22 || Indecision leads to ruin; focus your
attention on the One Lord. Renounce egotism and self-conceit, and remain merged in
Truth. || 23 || Those who meet with the True Guru are my Siblings of Destiny; they
are committed to the True Word of the Shabad. Those who merge with the True Lord
shall not be separated again; they are judged to be True in the Court of the Lord. || 24
|| They are my Siblings of Destiny, and they are my friends, who serve the True Lord.
They sell off their sins and demerits like straw, and enter into the partnership of virtue.
|| 25 || In the partnership of virtue, peace wells up, and they perform true devotional
worship service. They deal in Truth, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and they
earn the profit of the Naam. || 26 || Gold and silver may be earned by committing
sins, but they will not go with you when you die. Nothing will go with you in the end,
except the Name; all are plundered by the Messenger of Death. || 27 || The Lord‟s
Name is the nourishment of the mind; cherish it, and preserve it carefully within your
heart. This nourishment is inexhaustible; it is always with the Gurmukhs. || 28 || O
mind, if you forget the Primal Lord, you shall depart, having lost your honor. This world
is engrossed in the love of duality; follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and meditate on the
True Lord. || 29 || The Lord‟s value cannot be estimated; the Lord‟s Praises cannot be
written down. When one‟s mind and body are attuned to the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, one remains merged in the Lord. || 30 || My Husband Lord is playful; He has
imbued me with His Love, with natural ease. The soul-bride is imbued with His Love,
when her Husband Lord merges her into His Being. || 31 || Even those who have
been separated for so very long, are reunited with Him, when they serve the True Guru.
The nine treasures of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are deep within the nucleus of
the self; consuming them, they are still never exhausted. Chant the Glorious Praises of
the Lord, with natural ease. || 32 || They are not born, and they do not die; they do
not suffer in pain. Those who are protected by the Guru are saved. They celebrate with
the Lord. || 33 || Those who are united with the Lord, the True Friend, are not
separated again; night and day, they remain blended with Him. In this world, only a
rare few are known, O Nanak, to have obtained the True Lord. || 34 || 1 || 3 ||
SOOHEE, THIRD MEHL: The Dear Lord is subtle and inaccessible; how can we ever
meet Him? Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, doubt is dispelled, and the
Carefree Lord comes to abide in the mind. || 1 || The Gurmukhs chant the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 757 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I am a sacrifice to those who chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord in their minds
forever. || 1 || Pause || The Guru is like the Mansarovar Lake; only the very
fortunate beings find Him. The Gurmukhs, the selfless servants, seek out the Guru; the
swan-souls feed there on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 2 || The Gurmukhs
meditate on the Naam, and remain linked to the Naam. Whatever is pre-ordained,
accept it as the Will of the Guru. || 3 || By great good fortune, I searched my home,
and found the treasure of the Naam. The Perfect Guru has shown God to me; I have
realized the Lord, the Supreme Soul. || 4 || There is One God of all; there is no other
at all. By Guru‟s Grace, the Lord comes to abide in the mind; in the heart of such a one,
He is revealed. || 5 || God is the Inner-knower of all hearts; God dwells in every
place. So who should we call evil? Behold the Word of the Shabad, and lovingly dwell
upon it. || 6 || He calls others bad and good, as long as he is in duality. The Gurmukh
understands the One and Only Lord; He is absorbed in the One Lord. || 7 || That is
selfless service, which pleases God, and which is approved by God. Servant Nanak
worships the Lord in adoration; he focuses his consciousness on the Guru‟s Feet. || 8 ||

RAAG SOOHEE, ASHTAPADEES, FOURTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

If only someone would come, and lead me to meet my Darling Beloved; I would sell
myself to him. || 1 || I long for the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan. When the
Lord shows Mercy unto me, then I meet the True Guru; I meditate on the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Pause || If You will bless me with happiness, then I will
worship and adore You. Even in pain, I will meditate on You. || 2 || Even if You give
me hunger, I will still feel satisfied; I am joyful, even in the midst of sorrow. || 3 || I
would cut my mind and body apart into pieces, and offer them all to You; I would burn
myself in fire. || 4 || I wave the fan over You, and carry water for You; whatever You
give me, I take. || 5 || Poor Nanak has fallen at the Lord‟s Door; please, O Lord, unite
me with Yourself, by Your Glorious Greatness. || 6 || Taking out my eyes, I place them
at Your Feet; after travelling over the entire earth, I have come to understand this. || 7
|| If You seat me near You, then I worship and adore You. Even if You beat me and
drive me out, I will still meditate on You. || 8 || If people praise me, the praise is
Yours. Even if they slander me, I will not leave You. || 9 || If You are on my side,
then anyone can say anything. But if I were to forget You, then I would die. || 10 || I
am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my Guru; falling at His Feet, I surrender to the Saintly
Guru. || 11 || Poor Nanak has gone insane, longing for the Blessed Vision of the
Lord‟s Darshan. || 12 || Even in violent storms and torrential rain, I go out to catch a
glimpse of my Guru. || 13 || Even though the oceans and the salty seas are very
vast, the GurSikh will cross over it to get to his Guru. || 14 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 758 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Just as the mortal dies without water, so does the Sikh die without the Guru. || 15 ||
Just as the earth looks beautiful when the rain falls, so does the Sikh blossom forth
meeting the Guru. || 16 || I long to be the servant of Your servants; I call upon You
reverently in prayer. || 17 || Nanak offers this prayer to the Lord, that he may meet
the Guru, and find peace. || 18 || You Yourself are the Guru, and You Yourself are
the chaylaa, the disciple; through the Guru, I meditate on You. || 19 || Those who
serve You, become You. You preserve the honor of Your servants. || 20 || O Lord,
Your devotional worship is a treasure over-flowing. One who loves You, is blessed with
it. || 21 || That humble being alone receives it, unto whom You bestow it. All other
clever tricks are fruitless. || 22 || Remembering, remembering, remembering my
Guru in meditation, my sleeping mind is awakened. || 23 || Poor Nanak begs for this
one blessing, that he may become the slave of the slaves of the Lord. || 24 || Even if
the Guru rebukes me, He still seems very sweet to me. And if He actually forgives me,
that is the Guru‟s greatness. || 25 || That which Gurmukh speaks is certified and
approved. Whatever the self-willed manmukh says is not accepted. || 26 || Even in
the cold, the frost and the snow, the GurSikh still goes out to see his Guru. || 27 || All
day and night, I gaze upon my Guru; I install the Guru‟s Feet in my eyes. || 28 || I
make so many efforts for the sake of the Guru; only that which pleases the Guru is
accepted and approved. || 29 || Night and day, I worship the Guru‟s Feet in
adoration; have Mercy upon me, O my Lord and Master. || 30 || The Guru is Nanak‟s
body and soul; meeting the Guru, he is satisfied and satiated. || 31 || Nanak‟s God is
perfectly permeating and all-pervading. Here and there and everywhere, the Lord of the
Universe. || 32 || 1 ||

Deep within myself, I have enshrined true love for my Beloved. My body and soul are in
ecstasy; I see my Guru before me. || 1 || I have purchased the Name of the Lord,
Har, Har. I have obtained the Inaccessible and Unfathomable Ambrosial Nectar from the
Perfect Guru. || 1 || Pause || Gazing upon the True Guru, I blossom forth in
ecstasy; I am in love with the Name of the Lord. Through His Mercy, the Lord has
united me with Himself, and I have found the Door of Salvation. || 2 || The True
Guru is the Lover of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Meeting Him, I dedicate my body
and mind to Him. And if it is so pre-ordained, then I shall automatically drink in the
Ambrosial Nectar. || 3 || Praise the Guru while you are asleep, and call on the Guru
while you are up. If only I could meet such a Gurmukh; I would wash His Feet. || 4 ||
I long for such a Friend, to unite me with my Beloved. Meeting the True Guru, I have
found the Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 759 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He has met me, easily and effortlessly. || 5 || The True Guru is the Ocean of Virtue of
the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I have such a yearning to see Him! Without Him, I
cannot live, even for an instant. If I do not see Him, I die. || 6 || As the fish cannot
survive at all without water, the Saint cannot live without the Lord. Without the Lord‟s
Name, he dies. || 7 || I am so much in love with my True Guru! How could I even live
without the Guru, O my mother? I have the Support of the Word of the Guru‟s Bani.
Attached to Gurbani, I survive. || 8 || The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is a jewel; by
the Pleasure of His Will, the Guru has given it, O my mother. The True Name is my only
Support. I remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord‟s Name. || 9 || The wisdom of the
Guru is the treasure of the Naam. The Guru implants and enshrines the Lord‟s Name.
He alone receives it, he alone gets it, who comes and falls at the Guru‟s Feet. || 10 ||
If only someone would come and tell me the Unspoken Speech of the Love of my
Beloved. I would dedicate my mind to him; I would bow down in humble respect, and
fall at his feet. || 11 || You are my only Friend, O my All-knowing, All-powerful
Creator Lord. You have brought me to meet with my True Guru. Forever and ever, You
are my only strength. || 12 || My True Guru, forever and ever, does not come and go.
He is the Imperishable Creator Lord; He is permeating and pervading among all. || 13
|| I have gathered in the wealth of the Lord‟s Name. My facilities and faculties are
intact, safe and sound. O Nanak, I am approved and respected in the Court of the Lord;
the Perfect Guru has blessed me! || 14 || 1 || 2 || 11 ||

He is entangled in sinful associations; his mind is troubled by so very many waves. || 1

is the Perfect Transcendent Lord. || 1 || Pause || He remains entangled in the
intoxication of worldly love. His excessive thirst is never quenched. || 2 || Anger is
the outcaste which hides within his body; he is in the utter darkness of ignorance, and
he does not understand. || 3 || Afflicted by doubt, the shutters are shut tight; he
cannot go to God‟s Court. || 4 || The mortal is bound and gagged by hope and fear;
he cannot find the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, and so he wanders around like a
stranger. || 5 || He falls under the power of all negative influences; he wanders
around thirsty like a fish out of water. || 6 || I have no clever tricks or techniques;
You are my only hope, O my Lord God Master. || 7 || Nanak offers this prayer to the
Saints — please let me merge and blend with You. || 8 || God has shown Mercy, and
I have found the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Nanak is satisfied, finding the

Attachment to sex is an ocean of fire and pain. By Your Grace, O Sublime Lord, please
save me from it. || 1 || I seek the Sanctuary of the Lotus Feet of the Lord. He is the
Master of the meek, the Support of His devotees. || 1 || Pause || Master of the
masterless, Patron of the forlorn, Eradicator of fear of His devotees. In the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy, the Messenger of Death cannot even touch them. ||
2 || The Merciful, Incomparably Beautiful, Embodiment of Life. Vibrating the Glorious
Virtues of the Lord, the noose of the Messenger of Death is cut away. || 3 || One who
constantly chants the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam with his tongue, is not touched or
affected by Maya, the embodiment of disease. || 4 || Chant and meditate on God, the
Lord of the Universe, and all of your companions shall be carried across; the five
thieves will not even approach. || 5 || One who meditates on the One God in thought,
word and deed — that humble being receives the fruits of all rewards. || 6 ||
Showering His Mercy, God has made me His own; He has blessed me with the unique

Gazing upon them, my mind is enraptured. How can I join them and be with them?
They are Saints and friends, good friends of my mind, who inspire me and help me tune
in to God‟s Love. My love for them shall never die; it shall never, ever be broken. || 1
|| O Supreme Lord God, please grant me Your Grace, that I might constantly sing Your
Glorious Praises. Come, and meet with me, O Saints, and good friends; let us chant and
meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Best Friend of my mind. || 1 ||
Pause || He does not see, he does not hear, and he does not understand; he is blind,
enticed and bewitched by Maya. His body is false and transitory; it shall perish. And
still, he entangles himself in false pursuits. They alone depart victorious, who have
meditated on the Naam; they stick with the Perfect Guru. || 2 || By the Hukam of
God‟s Will, they come into this world, and they leave upon receipt of His Hukam. By His
Hukam, the Expanse of the Universe is expanded. By His Hukam, they enjoy pleasures.
One who forgets the Creator Lord, suffers sorrow and separation. || 3 || One who is
pleasing to his God, goes to His Court dressed in robes of honor. One who meditates on
the Naam, the One Name, finds peace in this world; his face is radiant and bright. The
Supreme Lord confers honor and respect on those who serve the Guru with true love.
|| 4 || He is pervading and permeating the spaces and interspaces; He loves and
cherishes all beings. I have accumulated the true treasure, the wealth and riches of the
One Name. I shall never forget Him from my mind, since He has been so merciful to
me.

6 || They alone bear true love for their God, within whose minds He Himself dwells. So
dwell only with those who share their virtues; chant and meditate on God, twenty-four
hours a day. They are attuned to the Love of the Transcendent Lord; all their sorrows
and afflictions are dispelled. || 7 || You are the Creator, You are the Cause of causes;
You are the One and the many. You are All-powerful, You are present everywhere; You
are the subtle intellect, the clear wisdom. Nanak chants and meditates forever on the

You within my heart. || 3 || Let my feet walk on Your Path, and let my eyes behold
the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. With my ears, I will listen to Your Sermon, if the
Guru becomes merciful to me. || 4 || Hundreds of thousands and millions do not

me with Your Darshan, that I may revel in Your Love. || 6 || Seeing Him, my mind is
comforted and consoled, and my sins and mistakes are far removed. How could I ever
forget Him, O my mother? He is permeating and pervading everywhere. || 7 || In
humility, I bowed down in surrender to Him, and He naturally met me. I have received
what was pre-ordained for me, O Nanak, with the help and assistance of the Saints. ||
8 || 1 || 4 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Simritees, the Vedas, the Puraanas and the
other holy scriptures proclaim that without the Naam, everything is false and worthless.

the Holy. || 1 || Pause || Those who indulge in attachment, conflict and egotism
shall surely weep and cry. Those who are separated from the Naam shall never find any
peace. || 2 || Crying out, “Mine! Mine!”, he is bound in bondage. Entangled in Maya,
he is reincarnated in heaven and hell. || 3 || Searching, searching, searching, I have
come to understand the essence of reality. Without the Naam, there is no peace at all,
and the mortal will surely fail.

alone join the Saadh Sangat, unto whom the Lord becomes Merciful. They chant and
meditate on the Ambrosial Name of the Lord. || 6 || Uncounted millions, so many
they are endless, search for Him. But only that one, who understands his own self, sees
God near at hand. || 7 || Never forget me, O Great Giver — please bless me with
Your Naam.To sing Your Glorious Praises day and night — O Nanak, this is my heart-felt
desire. || 8 || 2 || 5 || 16 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, KUCHAJEE ~ THE UNGRACEFUL BRIDE:

I am ungraceful and ill-mannered, full of endless faults. How can I go to enjoy my
Husband Lord? Each of His soul-brides is better than the rest — who even knows my
name? Those brides who enjoy their Husband Lord are very blessed, resting in the
shade of the mango tree. I do not have their virtue — who can I blame for this? Which
of Your Virtues, O Lord, should I speak of? Which of Your Names should I chant? I
cannot even reach one of Your Virtues. I am forever a sacrifice to You. Gold, silver,
pearls and rubies are pleasing. My Husband Lord has blessed me with these things, and
I have focused my thoughts on them. Palaces of brick and mud are built and decorated
with stones; I have been fooled by these decorations, and I do not sit near my Husband
Lord. The cranes shriek overhead in the sky, and the herons have come to rest. The
bride has gone to her father-in-law‟s house; in the world hereafter, what face will she
show? She kept sleeping as the day dawned; she forgot all about her journey. She
separated herself from her Husband Lord, and now she suffers in pain. Virtue is in You,
O Lord; I am totally without virtue. This is Nanak‟s only prayer: You give all Your nights
to the virtuous soul-brides. I know I am unworthy, but isn‟t there a night for me as
well? || 1 || SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, SUCHAJEE ~ THE NOBLE AND GRACEFUL
BRIDE: When I have You, then I have everything. O my Lord and Master, You are my
wealth and capital. Within You, I abide in peace; within You, I am congratulated. By the
Pleasure of Your Will, You bestow thrones and greatness. And by the Pleasure of Your
Will, You make us beggars and wanderers. By the Pleasure of Your Will, the ocean flows
in the desert, and the lotus blossoms in the sky. By the Pleasure of Your Will, one
crosses over the terrifying world-ocean; by the Pleasure of Your Will, he sinks down into
it. By the Pleasure of His Will, that Lord becomes my Husband, and I am imbued with
the Praises of the Lord, the treasure of virtue. By the Pleasure of Your Will, O my
Husband Lord, I am afraid of You, and I come and go, and die. You, O my Husband
Lord, are inaccessible and immeasurable; talking and speaking of You, I have fallen at
Your Feet. What should I beg for? What should I say and hear? I am hungry and thirsty
for the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings, I
have found my Husband Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 763 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
This is Nanak‟s true prayer. || 2 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL, GUNVANTEE ~ THE
WORTHY AND VIRTUOUS BRIDE: When I see a Sikh of the Guru, I humbly bow and
fall at his feet. I tell to him the pain of my soul, and beg him to unite me with the Guru,
my Best Friend. I ask that he impart to me such an understanding, that my mind will
not go out wandering anywhere else. I dedicate this mind to you. Please, show me the
Path to God. I have come so far, seeking the Protection of Your Sanctuary. Within my
mind, I place my hopes in You; please, take my pain and suffering away! So walk on
this Path, O sister soul-brides; do that work which the Guru tells you to do. Abandon
the intellectual pursuits of the mind, and forget the love of duality. In this way, you
shall obtain the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan; the hot winds shall not even touch
you. By myself, I do not even know how to speak; I speak all that the Lord commands.
I am blessed with the treasure of the Lord‟s devotional worship; Guru Nanak has been
kind and compassionate to me. I shall never again feel hunger or thirst; I am satisfied,
satiated and fulfilled. When I see a Sikh of the Guru, I humbly bow and fall at his feet.

RAAG SOOHEE, CHHANT, FIRST MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

Intoxicated with the wine of youth, I did not realize that I was only a guest at my
parents‟ home (in this world). My consciousness is polluted with faults and mistakes;
without the Guru, virtue does not even enter into me. I have not known the value of
virtue; I have been deluded by doubt. I have wasted away my youth in vain. I have not
known my Husband Lord, His celestial home and gate, or the Blessed Vision of His
Darshan. I have not had the pleasure of my Husband Lord‟s celestial peace. After
consulting the True Guru, I have not walked on the Path; the night of my life is passing
away in sleep. O Nanak, in the prime of my youth, I am a widow; without my Husband
Lord, the soul-bride is wasting away. || 1 || O father, give me in marriage to the
Lord; I am pleased with Him as my Husband. I belong to Him. He is pervading
throughout the four ages, and the Word of His Bani permeates the three worlds. The
Husband Lord of the three worlds ravishes and enjoys His virtuous brides, but He keeps
the ungraceful and unvirtuous ones far away. As are our hopes, so are our minds‟
desires, which the All-pervading Lord brings to fulfillment. The bride of the Lord is
forever happy and virtuous; she shall never be a widow, and she shall never have to
wear dirty clothes. O Nanak, I love my True Husband Lord; my Beloved is the same,
age after age. || 2 || O Baba, calculate that auspicious moment, when I too shall be
going to my in-laws‟ house. The moment of that marriage will be set by the Hukam of
God‟s Command; His Will cannot be changed. The karmic record of past deeds, written
by the Creator Lord, cannot be erased by anyone. The most respected member of the
marriage party, my Husband, is the independent Lord of all beings, pervading and
permeating the three worlds. Maya, crying out in pain, leaves, seeing that the bride and
the groom are in love. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 764 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, the peace of the Mansion of God‟s Presence comes through the True Word of the
Shabad; the bride keeps the Guru‟s Feet enshrined in her mind. || 3 || My father has
given me in marriage far away, and I shall not return to my parents‟ home. I am delighted
to see my Husband Lord near at hand; in His Home, I am so beautiful. My True Beloved
Husband Lord desires me; He has joined me to Himself, and made my intellect pure and
sublime. By good destiny I met Him, and was given a place of rest; through the Guru‟s
Wisdom, I have become virtuous. I gather lasting Truth and contentment in my lap, and
my Beloved is pleased with my truthful speech. O Nanak, I shall not suffer the pain of
separation; through the Guru‟s Teachings, I merge into the loving embrace of the Lord‟s
Being. || 4 || 1 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, CHHANT, SECOND HOUSE:

My friends have come into my home. The True Lord has united me with them. The Lord
automatically united me with them when it pleased Him; uniting with the chosen ones, I
have found peace. I have obtained that thing, which my mind desired. Meeting with them,
night and day, my mind is pleased; my home and mansion are beautified. The unstruck
sound current of the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds, vibrates and resounds; my
friends have come into my home. || 1 || So come, my beloved friends, and sing the
songs of joy, O sisters. Sing the true songs of joy and God will be pleased. You shall be
celebrated throughout the four ages. My Husband Lord has come into my home, and my
place is adorned and decorated. Through the Shabad, my affairs have been resolved.
Applying the ointment, the supreme essence, of divine wisdom to my eyes, I see the Lord‟s
form throughout the three worlds. So join with me, my sisters, and sing the songs of joy
and delight; my friends have come into my home. || 2 || My mind and body are
drenched with Ambrosial Nectar; deep within the nucleus of my self, is the jewel of the
Lord‟s Love. This invaluable jewel is deep within me; I contemplate the supreme essence of
reality. Living beings are mere beggars; You are the Giver of rewards; You are the Giver to
each and every being. You are Wise and All-knowing, the Inner-knower; You Yourself
created the creation. So listen, O my sisters — the Enticer has enticed my mind. My body
and mind are drenched with Nectar. || 3 || O Supreme Soul of the World, Your play is
true. Your play is true, O Inaccessible and Infinite Lord; without You, who can make me
understand? There are millions of Siddhas and enlightened seekers, but without You, who
can call himself one? Death and rebirth drive the mind insane; only the Guru can hold it in
its place. O Nanak, one who burns away his demerits and faults with the Shabad,
accumulates virtue, and finds God. || 4 || 1 || 2 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, FIRST MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

Come, my friend, so that I may behold the blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I stand in my
doorway, watching for You; my mind is filled with such a great yearning. My mind is filled
with such a great yearning; hear me, O God — I place my faith in You. Gazing upon the
Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, I have become free of desire; the pains of birth and death
are taken away. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 765 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Your Light is in everyone; through it, You are known. Through love, You are easily met.
O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to my Friend; He has come home to meet with those who are
true. || 1 || When her Friend comes to her home, the bride is very pleased. She is
fascinated with the True Word of the Lord‟s Shabad; gazing upon her Lord and Master,
she is filled with joy. She is filled with virtuous joy, and is totally pleased, when she is
ravished and enjoyed by her Lord, and imbued with His Love. Her faults and demerits
are eradicated, and she roofs her home with virtue, through the Perfect Lord, the
Architect of Destiny. Conquering the thieves, she dwells as the mistress of her home,
and administers justice wisely. O Nanak, through the Lord‟s Name, she is emancipated;
through the Guru‟s Teachings, she meets her Beloved. || 2 || The young bride has
found her Husband Lord; her hopes and desires are fulfilled. She enjoys and ravishes
her Husband Lord, and blends into the Word of the Shabad, pervading and permeating
everywhere; the Lord is not far away. God is not far away; He is in each and every
heart. All are His brides. He Himself is the Enjoyer, He Himself ravishes and enjoys; this
is His glorious greatness. He is imperishable, immovable, invaluable and infinite. The
True Lord is obtained through the Perfect Guru. O Nanak, He Himself unites in Union;
by His Glance of Grace, He lovingly attunes them to Himself. || 3 || My Husband Lord
dwells in the loftiest balcony; He is the Supreme Lord of the three worlds. I am amazed,
gazing upon His glorious excellence; the unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates
and resonates. I contemplate the Shabad, and perform sublime deeds; I am blessed
with the insignia, the banner of the Lord‟s Name. Without the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, the false find no place of rest; only the jewel of the Naam brings acceptance and
renown. Perfect is my honor, perfect is my intellect and password. I shall not have to
come or go. O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands her own self; she becomes like her
Imperishable Lord God. || 4 || 1 || 3 ||

RAAG SOOHEE, CHHANT, FIRST MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE:
The One who created the world, watches over it; He enjoins the people of the world to
their tasks. Your gifts, O Lord, illuminate the heart, and the moon casts its light on the
body. The moon glows, by the Lord‟s gift, and the darkness of suffering is taken away.
The marriage party of virtue looks beautiful with the Groom; He chooses His enticing
bride with care. The wedding is performed with glorious splendor; He has arrived,
accompanied by the vibrations of the Panch Shabad, the Five Primal Sounds. The One
who created the world, watches over it; He enjoins the people of the world to their
tasks. || 1 || I am a sacrifice to my pure friends, the immaculate Saints. This body is
attached to them, and we have shared our minds. We have shared our minds — how
could I forget those friends? Seeing them brings joy to my heart; I keep them clasped
to my soul. They have all virtues and merits, forever and ever; they have no demerits
or faults at all. I am a sacrifice to my pure friends, the immaculate Saints. || 2 || One
who has a basket of fragrant virtues, should enjoy its fragrance. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 766 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
If my friends have virtues, I will share in them. Let us form a partnership, and share our
virtues; let us abandon our faults, and walk on the Path. Let us wear our virtues like silk
clothes; let us decorate ourselves, and enter the arena. Let us speak of goodness,
wherever we go and sit; let us skim off the Ambrosial Nectar, and drink it in. One who
has a basket of fragrant virtues, should enjoy its fragrance. || 3 || He Himself acts;
unto whom should we complain? No one else does anything. Go ahead and complain to
Him, if He makes a mistake. If He makes a mistake, go ahead and complain to Him; but
how can the Creator Himself make a mistake? He sees, He hears, and without our
asking, without our begging, He gives His gifts. The Great Giver, the Architect of the
Universe, gives His gifts. O Nanak, He is the True Lord. He Himself acts; unto whom
should we complain? No one else does anything. || 4 || 1 || 4 || SOOHEE, FIRST
MEHL: My mind is imbued with His Glorious Praises; I chant them, and He is pleasing
to my mind. Truth is the ladder to the Guru; climbing up to the True Lord, peace is
obtained. Celestial peace comes; the Truth pleases me. How could these True
Teachings ever be erased? He Himself is Undeceivable; how could He ever be deceived
by cleansing baths, charity, spiritual wisdom or ritual bathings? Fraud, attachment and
corruption are taken away, as are falsehood, hypocrisy and duality. My mind is imbued
with His Glorious Praises; I chant them, and He is pleasing to my mind. || 1 || So
praise your Lord and Master, who created the creation. Filth sticks to the polluted mind;
how rare are those who drink in the Ambrosial Nectar. Churn this Ambrosial Nectar, and
drink it in; dedicate this mind to the Guru, and He will value it highly. I intuitively
realized my God, when I linked my mind to the True Lord. I will sing the Lord‟s Glorious
Praises with Him, if it pleases Him; how could I meet Him by being a stranger to Him?
So praise your Lord and Master, who created the creation. || 2 || When He comes,
what else remains behind? How can there be any coming or going then? When the
mind is reconciled with its Beloved Lord, it is blended with Him. True is the speech of
one who is imbued with the Love of his Lord and Master, who fashioned the body
fortress from a mere bubble. He is the Master of the five elements; He Himself is the
Creator Lord. He embellished the body with Truth. I am worthless; please hear me, O
my Beloved! Whatever pleases You is True. One who is blessed with true
understanding, does not come and go. || 3 || Apply such an ointment to your eyes,
which is pleasing to your Beloved. I realize, understand and know Him, only if He
Himself causes me to know Him. He Himself shows me the Way, and He Himself leads
me to it, attracting my mind. He Himself causes us to do good and bad deeds; who can
know the value of the Mysterious Lord? I know nothing of Tantric spells, magical
mantras and hypocritical rituals; enshrining the Lord within my heart, my mind is
satisfied. The ointment of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is only understood by one
who realizes the Lord, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 4 || I have my own
friends; why should I go to the home of a stranger? My friends are imbued with the
True Lord; He is with them, in their minds. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 767 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
In their minds, these friends celebrate in happiness; all good karma, righteousness and
Dharma, the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, charity and worship, are found in the
love of the True Name. He Himself creates, establishes and beholds all, by the Pleasure
of His Will. My friends are happy in the Love of the Lord; they nurture love for their
Beloved. || 5 || If a blind man is made the leader, how will he know the way? He is
impaired, and his understanding is inadequate; how will he know the way? How can he
follow the path and reach the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence? Blind is the
understanding of the blind. Without the Lord‟s Name, they cannot see anything; the
blind are drowned in worldly entanglements. Day and night, the Divine Light shines
forth and joy wells up, when the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad abides in the mind. With
your palms pressed together, pray to the Guru to show you the way. || 6 || If the
man becomes a stranger to God, then all the world becomes a stranger to him. Unto
whom should I tie up and give the bundle of my pains? The whole world is overflowing
with pain and suffering; who can know the state of my inner self? Comings and goings
are terrible and dreadful; there is no end to the rounds of reincarnation. Without the
Naam, he is vacant and sad; he does not listen to the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. If the
mind becomes a stranger to God, then all the world becomes a stranger to him. || 7 ||
One who finds the Guru‟s Mansion within the home of his own being, merges in the Allpervading Lord. The sevadar performs selfless service when he is pleased, and
confirmed in the True Word of the Shabad. Confirmed in the Shabad, with her being
softened by devotion, the bride dwells in the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, deep
within her being. The Creator Himself creates; God Himself, in the end, is endless.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the mortal is united, and then embellished;
the unstruck melody of the sound current resounds. One who finds the Guru‟s Mansion
within the home of his own being, merges in the All-pervading Lord. || 8 || Why
praise that which is created? Praise instead the One who created it and watches over it.
His value cannot be estimated, no matter how much one may wish. He alone can
estimate the Lord‟s value, whom the Lord Himself causes to know. He is not mistaken;
He does not make mistakes. He alone celebrates victory, who is pleasing to You,
through the Invaluable Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. I am lowly and abject — I offer my
prayer; may I never forsake the True Name, O Sibling of Destiny. O Nanak, the One
who created the creation, watches over it; He alone bestows understanding. || 9 || 2 ||

RAAG SOOHEE, CHHANT, THIRD MEHL, SECOND HOUSE:

Meditate on the Lord, and find peace and pleasure. As Gurmukh, obtain the Lord‟s
fruitful rewards. As Gurmukh, obtain the fruit of the Lord, and meditate on the Lord‟s
Name; the pains of countless lifetimes shall be erased. I am a sacrifice to my Guru, who
has arranged and resolved all my affairs. The Lord God will bestow His Grace, if you
meditate on the Lord; O humble servant of the Lord, you shall obtain the fruit of peace.
Says Nanak, listen O humble Sibling of Destiny: meditate on the Lord, and find peace
and pleasure. || 1 || Hearing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I am intuitively
drenched with His Love. Under Guru‟s Instruction, I meditate intuitively on the Naam.
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 768 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Those who have such pre-ordained destiny, meet the Guru, and their fears of birth and
death leave them. One who eliminates evil-mindedness and duality from within himself,
that humble being lovingly focuses his mind on the Lord. Those, upon whom my Lord
and Master bestows His Grace, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, night and day.
Hearing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I am intuitively drenched with His Love. || 2
|| In this age, emancipation comes only from the Lord‟s Name. Contemplative
meditation on the Word of the Shabad emanates from the Guru. Contemplating the
Guru‟s Shabad, one comes to love the Lord‟s Name; he alone obtains it, unto whom the
Lord shows Mercy. In peace and poise, he sings the Lord‟s Praises day and night, and
all sinful residues are eradicated. All are Yours, and You belong to all. I am Yours, and
You are mine. In this age, emancipation comes only from the Lord‟s Name. || 3 ||
The Lord, my Friend has come to dwell within the home of my heart; singing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord, one is satisfied and fulfilled. Singing the Glorious Praises of
the Lord, one is satisfied forever, never to feel hunger again. That humble servant of
the Lord, who meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is worshipped in the ten
directions. O Nanak, He Himself joins and separates; there is no other than the Lord.
The Lord, my Friend has come to dwell within the home of my heart. || 4 || 1 ||

RAAG SOOHEE, THIRD MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:
The Dear Lord protects His humble devotees; throughout the ages, He has protected
them. Those devotees who become Gurmukh burn away their ego, through the Word of
the Shabad. Those who burn away their ego through the Shabad, become pleasing to
my Lord; their speech becomes True. They perform the Lord‟s true devotional service,
day and night, as the Guru has instructed them. The devotees‟ lifestyle is true, and
absolutely pure; the True Name is pleasing to their minds. O Nanak, the those
devotees, who practice Truth, and only Truth, look beauteous in the Court of the True
Lord. || 1 || The Lord is the social class and honor of His devotees; the Lord‟s
devotees merge in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They worship the Lord in devotion,
and eradicate self-conceit from within themselves; they understand merits and
demerits. They understand merits and demerits, and chant the Lord‟s Name; devotional
worship is sweet to them. Night and day, they perform devotional worship, day and
night, and in the home of the self, they remain detached. Imbued with devotion, their
minds remain forever immaculate and pure; they see their Dear Lord always with them.
O Nanak, those devotees are True in the Court of the Lord; night and day, they dwell
upon the Naam. || 2 || The self-willed manmukhs practice devotional rituals without
the True Guru, but without the True Guru, there is no devotion. They are afflicted with
the diseases of egotism and Maya, and they suffer the pains of death and rebirth. The
world suffers the pains of death and rebirth, and through the love of duality, it is
ruined; without the Guru, the essence of reality is not known. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 769 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Without devotional worship, everyone in the world is deluded and confused, and in the
end, they depart with regrets. Among millions, there is scarcely one who realizes the
Name of the True Lord. O Nanak, through the Naam, greatness is obtained; in the love
of duality, all honor is lost. || 3 || In the home of the devotees, is the joy of true
marriage; they chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord forever. He Himself blesses them
with the treasure of devotion; conquering the thorny pain of death, they merge in the
Lord. Conquering the thorny pain of death, they merge in the Lord; they are pleasing to
the Lord‟s Mind, and they obtain the true treasure of the Naam. This treasure is
inexhaustible; it will never be exhausted. The Lord automatically blesses them with it.
The humble servants of the Lord are exalted and elevated, forever on high; they are
adorned with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. O Nanak, He Himself forgives them, and
merges them with Himself; throughout the ages, they are glorified. || 4 || 1 || 2 ||
SOOHEE, THIRD MEHL: Through the True Word of the Shabad, true happiness
prevails, there where the True Lord is contemplated. Egotism and all sinful residues are
eradicated, when one keeps the True Lord enshrined in the heart. One who keeps the
True Lord enshrined in the heart, crosses over the terrible and dreadful world-ocean; he
shall not have to cross over it again. True is the True Guru, and True is the Word of His
Bani; through it, the True Lord is seen. One who sings the Glorious Praises of the True
Lord merges in Truth; he beholds the True Lord everywhere. O Nanak, True is the Lord
and Master, and True is His Name; through Truth, comes emancipation. || 1 || The
True Guru reveals the True Lord; the True Lord preserves our honor. The true food is
love for the True Lord; through the True Name, peace is obtained. Through the True
Name, the mortal finds peace; he shall never die, and never again enter the womb of
reincarnation. His light blends with the Light, and he merges into the True Lord; he is
illuminated and enlightened with the True Name. Those who know the Truth are True;
night and day, they meditate on Truth. O Nanak, those whose hearts are filled with the
True Name, never suffer the pains of separation. || 2 || In that home, and in that
heart, where the True Bani of the Lord‟s True Praises are sung, the songs of joy
resound. Through the immaculate virtues of the True Lord, the body and mind are
rendered True, and God, the True Primal Being, dwells within. Such a person practices
only Truth, and speaks only Truth; whatever the True Lord does, that alone comes to
pass. Wherever I look, there I see the True Lord pervading; there is no other at all.
From the True Lord, we emanate, and into the True Lord, we shall merge; death and
birth come from duality. O Nanak, He Himself does everything; He Himself is the Cause.
|| 3 || The true devotees look beautiful in the Darbaar of the Lord‟s Court. They speak
Truth, and only Truth. Deep within the nucleus of their heart, is the True Word of the
Lord‟s Bani. Through the Truth, they understand themselves. They understand
themselves, and so know the True Lord, through their true intuition. True is the
Shabad, and True is its Glory; peace comes only from Truth. Imbued with Truth, the
devotees love the One Lord; they do not love any other. O Nanak, he alone obtains the
True Lord, who has such pre-ordained destiny written upon his forehead. || 4 || 2 || 3
|| SOOHEE, THIRD MEHL: The soul-bride may wander throughout the four ages, but
still, without the True Guru, she will not find her True Husband Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 770 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Kingdom of the Lord is permanent, and forever unchanging; there is no other than
Him. There is no other than Him — He is True forever; the Gurmukh knows the One
Lord. That soul-bride, whose mind accepts the Guru‟s Teachings, meets her Husband
Lord. Meeting the True Guru, she finds the Lord; without the Lord‟s Name, there is no
liberation. O Nanak, the soul-bride ravishes and enjoys her Husband Lord; her mind
accepts Him, and she finds peace. || 1 || Serve the True Guru, O young and innocent
bride; thus you shall obtain the Lord as your Husband. You shall be the virtuous and
happy bride of the True Lord forever; and you shall never again wear soiled clothes.
Your clothes shall never again be soiled; how rare are those few, who, as Gurmukh,
recognize this, and conquer their ego. So make your practice the practice of good
deeds; merge into the Word of the Shabad, and deep within, come to know the One
Lord. The Gurmukh enjoys God, day and night, and so obtains true glory. O Nanak, the
soul-bride enjoys and ravishes her Beloved; God is pervading and permeating
everywhere. || 2 || Serve the Guru, O young and innocent soul-bride, and he will lead
to you meet your Husband Lord. The bride is imbued with the Love of her Lord;
meeting with her Beloved, she finds peace. Meeting her Beloved, she finds peace, and
merges in the True Lord; the True Lord is pervading everywhere. The bride makes
Truth her decorations, day and night, and remains absorbed in the True Lord. The Lord,
the Giver of peace, is realized through His Shabad; He hugs His bride close in His
embrace. O Nanak, the bride obtains the Mansion of His Presence; through the Guru‟s
Teachings, she finds her Lord. || 3 || The Primal Lord, my God, has united His young
and innocent bride with Himself. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, her heart is illumined

SOOHEE, THIRD MEHL: Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har, Har; the
Gurmukh obtains the Lord. Night and day, chant the Word of the Shabad; night and

vibrates, and the Dear Lord comes into the home of my heart; O ladies, sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. That soul-bride, who performs devotional worship service
to the Guru night and day, becomes the Beloved bride of her Lord. Those humble
beings, whose hearts are filled with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, are adorned with
the Shabad. O Nanak, their hearts are forever filled with happiness; the Lord, in His
Mercy, enters into their hearts. || 1 || The minds of the devotees are filled with bliss;
they remain lovingly absorbed in the Lord‟s Name. The mind of the Gurmukh is
immaculate and pure; she sings the Immaculate Praises of the Lord. Singing His
Immaculate Praises, she enshrines in her mind the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and
the Ambrosial Word of His Bani. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 771 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Those humble beings, within whose minds it abides, are emancipated; the Shabad
permeates each and every heart. Singing Your Glorious Praises, they merge naturally
into You, O Lord; through the Shabad, they are united in Union with You. O Nanak,
their lives are fruitful; the True Guru places them on the Lord‟s Path. || 2 || Those
who join the Society of the Saints are absorbed in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they are forever „jivan mukta‟ — liberated
while yet alive; they are lovingly absorbed in the Name of the Lord. They center their
consciousness on the Lord‟s Name; through the Guru, they are united in His Union.
Their minds are imbued with the Lord‟s Love. They find the Lord, the Giver of peace,
and they eradicate attachments; night and day, they contemplate the Naam. They are
imbued with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and intoxicated with celestial peace; the
Naam abides in their minds. O Nanak, the homes of their hearts are filled with
happiness, forever and always; they are absorbed in serving the True Guru. || 3 ||
Without the True Guru, the world is deluded by doubt; it does not obtain the Mansion of
the Lord‟s Presence. As Gurmukh, some are united in the Lord‟s Union, and their pains
are dispelled. Their pains are dispelled, when it is pleasing to the Lord‟s Mind; imbued
with His Love, they sing His Praises forever. The Lord‟s devotees are pure and humble
forever; throughout the ages, they are forever respected. They perform true devotional
worship service, and are honored in the Lord‟s Court; the True Lord is their hearth and
home. O Nanak, true are their songs of joy, and true is their word; through the Word of
the Shabad, they find peace. || 4 || 4 || 5 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: If you long for
your Husband Lord, O young and innocent bride, then focus your consciousness on the
Guru‟s feet. You shall be a happy soul bride of your Dear Lord forever; He does not die
or leave. The Dear Lord does not die, and He does not leave; through the peaceful

Lord. || 3 || The mind of the soul bride is very happy, when she meets her Friend,

is the Naam, the Name of the Lord; contemplate it, through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. The mind and body of the Gurmukh is drenched with the Lord, the Beloved
Lord. Through the Name of the Beloved Lord, all one‟s ancestors and generations are
redeemed; chant the Lord‟s Name with your mouth. Comings and goings cease, peace
is obtained, and in the home of the heart, one‟s awareness is absorbed in the unstruck
melody of the sound current. I have found the One and only Lord, Har, Har. The Lord
God has showered His Mercy upon Nanak. The song of joy is the Naam, the Name of

far away from some, while for others, He is the Support of the mind. For some, the
Creator Lord is the Support of the mind; He is obtained by great good fortune, through
the Guru. The One Lord God, the Master, is in each and every heart; the Gurmukh sees
the unseen. The mind is satisfied, in natural ecstasy, O Nanak, contemplating God. In
each and every heart, and deep within all, is the One Lord, the Husband Lord of all. ||
3 || Those who serve the Guru, the True Guru, the Giver, merge in the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. O Lord, please bless me with the dust of the feet of the Perfect Guru, so
that I, a sinner, may be liberated. Even sinners are liberated, by eradicating their
egotism; they obtain a home within their own heart. With clear unerstanding, the night
of their lives passes peacefully; through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Naam is revealed to
them. Through the Lord, Har, Har, I am in ecstasy, day and night. O Nanak, the Lord
seems sweet. Those who serve the Guru, the True Guru, the Giver, merge in the Name
of the Lord, Har, Har. || 4 || 6 || 7 || 5 || 7 || 12 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 773 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ

RAAG SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL, CHHANT, FIRST HOUSE:
If only I could meet the True Guru, the Primal Being. Discarding my faults and sins, I
would chant the Lord‟s Glorious Praises. I meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
Har, Har. Continuously, continually, I chant the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. Gurbani always
seems so sweet; I have eradicated the sinful residues from within. The disease of
egotism is gone, fear has left, and I am absorbed in celestial peace. Through the Word
of the Guru‟s Shabad, the bed of my body has become cozy and beautiful, and I enjoy
the essence of spiritual wisdom. Night and day, I continually enjoy peace and pleasure.
O Nanak, this is my pre-ordained destiny. || 1 || The soul-bride is lovingly
embellished with truth and contentment; her Father, the Guru, has come to engage her

Singing the Guru‟s Bani, I have obtained the supreme status; meeting with the Saints,
the self-elect, I am blessed and adorned. Anger and attachment have left my body and
run away; I have eradicated hypocrisy and doubt. The pain of egotism is gone, and I
have found peace; my body has become healthy and free of disease. By Guru‟s Grace,
O Nanak, I have realized God, the ocean of virtue. || 2 || The self-willed manmukh is
separated, far away from God; she does not obtain the Mansion of His Presence, and
she burns. Egotism and falsehood are deep within her; deluded by falsehood, she deals
only in falsehood. Practicing fraud and falsehood, she suffers terrible pain; without the
True Guru, she does not find the way. The foolish soul-bride wanders along dismal
pathways; each and every moment, she is bumped and pushed. God, the Great Giver,
shows His Mercy, and leads her to meet the True Guru, the Primal Being. Those beings
who have been separated for countless incarnations, O Nanak, are reunited with the
Lord, with intuitive ease. || 3 || Calculating the most auspicious moment, the Lord
comes into the bride‟s home; her heart is filled with ecstasy. The Pandits and
astrologers have come, to sit and consult the almanacs. They have consulted the

separated again. || 4 || 1 || SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL: In the first round of the
marriage ceremony, the Lord sets out His Instructions for performing the daily duties of
married life. Instead of the hymns of the Vedas to Brahma, embrace the righteous
conduct of Dharma, and renounce sinful actions. Meditate on the Lord‟s Name; embrace
and enshrine the contemplative remembrance of the Naam. Worship and adore the
Guru, the Perfect True Guru, and all your sinful residues shall be dispelled. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 774 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
By great good fortune, celestial bliss is attained, and the Lord, Har, Har, seems sweet to

the Fear of God, the Fearless Lord in the mind, the filth of egotism is eradicated. In the
Fear of God, the Immaculate Lord, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and behold the
Lord‟s Presence before you. The Lord, the Supreme Soul, is the Lord and Master of the
Universe; He is pervading and permeating everywhere, fully filling all spaces. Deep
within, and outside as well, there is only the One Lord God. Meeting together, the
humble servants of the Lord sing the songs of joy. Servant Nanak proclaims that, in
this, the second round of the marriage ceremony, the unstruck sound current of the
Shabad resounds. || 2 || In the third round of the marriage ceremony, the mind is
filled with Divine Love. Meeting with the humble Saints of the Lord, I have found the
Lord, by great good fortune. I have found the Immaculate Lord, and I sing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. I speak the Word of the Lord‟s Bani. By great good fortune, I have
found the humble Saints, and I speak the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. The Name of
the Lord, Har, Har, Har, vibrates and resounds within my heart; meditating on the Lord,
I have realized the destiny inscribed upon my forehead. Servant Nanak proclaims that,
in this, the third round of the marriage ceremony, the mind is filled with Divine Love for
the Lord. || 3 || In the fourth round of the marriage ceremony, my mind has become
peaceful; I have found the Lord. As Gurmukh, I have met Him, with intuitive ease; the
Lord seems so sweet to my mind and body. The Lord seems so sweet; I am pleasing to
my God. Night and day, I lovingly focus my consciousness on the Lord. I have obtained
my Lord and Master, the fruit of my mind‟s desires. The Lord‟s Name resounds and
resonates. The Lord God, my Lord and Master, blends with His bride, and her heart
blossoms forth in the Naam. Servant Nanak proclaims that, in this, the fourth round of
the marriage ceremony, we have found the Eternal Lord God. || 4 || 2 ||

enjoyments, and they sleep in peace; they remain lovingly absorbed in the Word of the
Shabad. By great good fortune, one obtains the Perfect Guru; night and day, meditate
on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. In absolute ease and poise, one meets the Life of
the World. O Nanak, one is absorbed in the state of absolute absorption. || 1 ||
Joining the Society of the Saints, I bathe in the Immaculate Pool of the Lord. Bathing in
these Immaculate Waters, my filth is removed, and my body is purified and sanctified.
The filth of intellectual evil-mindedness is removed, doubt is gone, and the pain of
egotism is dispelled. By God‟s Grace, I found the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. I
dwell in the home of my own inner being. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 775 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
My tongue tastes the taste of the Lord‟s joyous song; O Nanak, the Naam shines forth
brightly. || 2 || The Gurmukh loves the Name of the Lord; deep within, she
contemplates the jewel of the Naam. Those who love the Lord‟s Name are emancipated
through the Word of the Shabad. The darkness of ignorance is dispelled. Spiritual
wisdom burns brilliantly, illuminating the heart; their homes and temples are
embellished and blessed. I have made my body and mind into adornments, and
dedicated them to the True Lord God, pleasing Him. Whatever God says, I gladly do. O
Nanak, I have merged into the fiber of His Being. || 3 || The Lord God has arranged
the marriage ceremony; He has come to marry the Gurmukh. He has come to marry the
Gurmukh, who has found the Lord. That bride is very dear to her Lord. The humble
Saints join together and sing the songs of joy; the Dear Lord Himself has adorned the
soul-bride. The angels and mortal beings, the heavenly heralds and celestial singers,
have come together and formed a wondrous wedding party. O Nanak, I have found my
True Lord God, who never dies, and is not born. || 4 || 1 || 3 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, CHHANT, FOURTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

Come, humble Saints, and sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Let us
gather together as Gurmukh; within the home of our own heart, the Shabad vibrates
and resonates. The many melodies of the Shabad are Yours, O Lord God; O Creator
Lord, You are everywhere. Day and night, I chant His Praises forever, lovingly focusing
on the True Word of the Shabad. Night and day, I remain intuitively attuned to the
Lord‟s Love; in my heart, I worship the Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, I have
realized the One Lord; I do not know any other. || 1 || He is contained amongst all;
He is God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. One who meditates and dwells
upon God, through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, knows that God, my Lord and
Master, is pervading everywhere. God, my Lord and Master, is the Inner-knower, the
Searcher of hearts; He pervades and permeates each and every heart. Through the
Guru‟s Teachings, Truth is obtained, and then, one merges in celestial bliss. There is no
other than Him. I sing His Praises with intuitive ease. If it pleases God, He shall unite
me with Himself. O Nanak, through the Shabad, God is known; meditate on the Naam,
day and night. || 2 || This world is treacherous and impassable; the self-willed
manmukh cannot cross over. Within him is egotism, self-conceit, sexual desire, anger
and cleverness. Within him is cleverness; he is not approved, and his life is uselessly
wasted and lost. On the Path of Death, he suffers in pain, and must endure abuse; in
the end, he departs regretfully. Without the Name, he has no friends, no children,
family or relatives. O Nanak, the wealth of Maya, attachment and ostentatious shows —
none of them shall go along with him to the world hereafter. || 3 || I ask my True
Guru, the Giver, how to cross over the treacherous and difficult world-ocean. Walk in
harmony with the True Guru‟s Will, and remain dead while yet alive. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 776 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Remaining dead while yet alive, cross over the terrifying world-ocean; as Gurmukh,
merge in the Naam. One obtains the Perfect Primal Lord, by great good fortune,
lovingly focusing on the True Name. The intellect is enlightened, and the mind is
satisfied, through the glory of the Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, God is found, merging in the
Shabad, and one‟s light blends into the Light. || 4 || 1 || 4 ||
SOOHEE, FOURTH MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE:

O humble Saints, I have met my Beloved Guru; the fire of my desire is quenched, and
my yearning is gone. I dedicate my mind and body to the True Guru; I pray that may
He unite me with God, the treasure of virtue. Blessed, blessed is the Guru, the Supreme
Being, who tells me of the most blessed Lord. By great good fortune, servant Nanak has
found the Lord; he blossoms forth in the Naam. || 1 || I have met my Beloved Friend,
the Guru, who has shown me the Path to the Lord. Come home — I have been
separated from You for so long! Please, let me merge with You, through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, O my Lord God. Without You, I am so sad; like a fish out of water, I
shall die. The very fortunate ones meditate on the Lord; servant Nanak merges into the
Naam. || 2 || The mind runs around in the ten directions; the self-willed manmukh
wanders around, deluded by doubt. In his mind, he continually conjures up hopes; his
mind is gripped by hunger and thirst. There is an infinite treasure buried within the
mind, but still, he goes out, searching for poison. O servant Nanak, praise the Naam,
the Name of the Lord; without the Name, he rots away, and wastes away to death. || 3
|| Finding the beautiful and fascinating Guru, I have conquered my mind, through the
Bani, the Word of my Beloved Lord. My heart has forgotten its common sense and
wisdom; my mind has forgotten its hopes and cares. Deep within my self, I feel the
pains of divine love. Beholding the Guru, my mind is comforted and consoled. Awaken
my good destiny, O God — please, come and meet me! Each and every instant, servant
Nanak is a sacrifice to You. || 4 || 1 || 5 || SOOHEE, CHHANT, FOURTH MEHL:
Eradicate the poison of egotism, O human being; it is holding you back from meeting
your Lord God. This golden-colored body has been disfigured and ruined by egotism.
Attachment to Maya is total darkness; this foolish, self-willed manmukh is attached to it.
O servant Nanak, the Gurmukh is saved; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, he is
released from egotism. || 1 || Overcome and subdue this mind; your mind wanders
around continually, like a falcon. The mortal‟s life-night passes painfully, in constant

RAAG SOOHEE, CHHANT, FIFTH MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

Listen, madman: gazing upon the world, why have you gone crazy? Listen, madman:
you have been trapped by false love, which is transitory, like the fading color of the
safflower. Gazing upon the false world, you are fooled. It is not worth even half a shell.
Only the Name of the Lord of the Universe is permanent. You shall take on the deep
and lasting red color of the poppy, contemplating the sweet Word of the Guru‟s Shabad.
You remain intoxicated with false emotional attachment; you are attached to falsehood.
Nanak, meek and humble, seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord, the treasure of mercy. He
preserves the honor of His devotees. || 1 || Listen, madman: serve your Lord, the
Master of the breath of life. Listen, madman: whoever comes, shall go. Listen, O
wandering stranger: that which you believe to be permanent, shall all pass away; so
remain in the Saints‟ Congregation. Listen, renunciate: by your good destiny, obtain the
Lord, and remain attached to God‟s Feet. Dedicate and surrender this mind to the Lord,
and have no doubts; as Gurmukh, renounce your great pride. O Nanak, the Lord carries
the meek and humble devotees across the terrifying world-ocean. What Glorious Virtues
of Your should I chant and recite? || 2 || Listen, madman: why do you harbor false
pride? Listen, madman: all your egotism and pride shall be overcome. What you think is
permanent, shall all pass away. Pride is false, so become the slave of God‟s Saints.

your pre-ordained destiny. One whom the Lord causes to meditate intuitively, serves
the Guru, and drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord‟s
Door; I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to Him. || 3 || Listen,
madman: do not think that you have found God. Listen, madman: be the dust under
the feet of those who meditate on God. Those who meditate on God find peace. By
great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of their Darshan is obtained. Be humble, and be
forever a sacrifice, and your self-conceit shall be totally eradicated. One who has found
God is pure, with blessed destiny. I would sell myself to him. Nanak, the meek and
humble, seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord, the ocean of peace. Make him Your own, and
preserve his honor. || 4 || 1 || SOOHEE, FIFTH MEHL: The True Guru was satisfied

VAAR OF SOOHEE, WITH SHALOKS OF THE THIRD MEHL:
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: In her red robes, the discarded bride goes out, seeking
enjoyment with another‟s husband. She leaves the husband of her own home, enticed
by her love of duality. She finds it sweet, and eats it up; her excessive sensuality only
makes her disease worse. She forsakes the Lord, her sublime Husband, and then later,
she suffers the pain of separation from Him. But she who becomes Gurmukh, turns
away from corruption and adorns herself, attuned to the Love of the Lord. She enjoys
her celestial Husband Lord, and enshrines the Lord‟s Name within her heart. She is
humble and obedient; she is His virtuous bride forever; the Creator unites her with
Himself. O Nanak, she who has obtained the True Lord as her husband, is a happy soulbride forever. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O meek, red-robed bride, keep your Husband
Lord always in your thoughts. O Nanak, your life shall be embellished, and your
generations shall be saved along with you. || 2 || PAUREE: He Himself established
His throne, in the Akaashic ethers and the nether worlds. By the Hukam of His
Command, He created the earth, the true home of Dharma. He Himself created and
destroys; He is the True Lord, merciful to the meek. You give sustenance to all; how
wonderful and unique is the Hukam of Your Command! You Yourself are permeating

red-robed woman becomes a happy soul-bride, only when she accepts the True Name.
Become pleasing to your True Guru, and you shall be totally beautified; otherwise,
there is no place of rest. So decorate yourself with the decorations that will never stain,
and love the Lord day and night. O Nanak, what is the character of the happy soulbride? Within her, is Truth; her face is bright and radiant, and she is absorbed in her
Lord and Master. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O people: I am in red, dressed in a red robe.
But my Husband Lord is not obtained by any robes; I have tried and tried, and given up
wearing robes. O Nanak, they alone obtain their Husband Lord, who listen to the Guru‟s
Teachings. Whatever pleases Him, happens. In this way, the Husband Lord is met. || 2
|| 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 786 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
PAUREE: By His Command, He created the creation, the world with its many species of
beings. I do not know how great Your Command is, O Unseen and Infinite True Lord.
You join some with Yourself; they reflect on the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Those who
are imbued with the True Lord are immaculate and pure; they conquer egotism and
corruption. He alone is united with You, whom You unite with Yourself; he alone is true.
|| 2 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O red-robed woman, the whole world is red,
engrossed in evil-mindedness and the love of duality. In an instant, this falsehood
totally vanishes; like the shade of a tree, it is gone. The Gurmukh is the deepest
crimson of crimson, dyed in the permanent color of the Lord‟s Love. She turns away
from Maya, and enters the celestial home of the Lord; the Ambrosial Name of the Lord
dwells within her mind. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to my Guru; meeting Him, I sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The red color is vain and useless;
it cannot help you obtain your Husband Lord. This color does not take long to fade; she
who loves duality, ends up a widow. She who loves to wear her red dress is foolish and
double-minded. So make the True Word of the Shabad your red dress, and let the Fear
of God, and the Love of God, be your ornaments and decorations. O Nanak, she is a
happy soul-bride forever, who walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. || 2 ||
PAUREE: He Himself created Himself, and He Himself evaluates Himself. His limits
cannot be known; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He is understood. In the
darkness of attachment to Maya, the world wanders in duality. The self-willed
manmukhs find no place of rest; they continue coming and going. Whatever pleases
Him, that alone happens. All walk according to His Will. || 3 || SHALOK, THIRD
MEHL: The red-robed bride is vicious; she forsakes God, and cultivates love for another
man. She has neither modesty or self-discipline; the self-willed manmukh constantly
tells lies, and is ruined by the bad karma of evil deeds. She who has such pre-ordained
destiny, obtains the True Guru has her Husband. She discards all her red dresses, and
wears the ornaments of mercy and forgiveness around her neck. In this world and the
next, she receives great honor, and the whole world worships her. She who is enjoyed
by her Creator Lord stands out, and does not blend in with the crowd. O Nanak, the
Gurmukh is the happy soul-bride forever; she has the Imperishable Lord God as her
Husband. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: The red color is like a dream in the night; it is like a
necklace without a string. The Gurmukhs take on the permanent color, contemplating
the Lord God. O Nanak, with the supreme sublime essence of the Lord‟s Love, all sins
and evil deeds are turned to ashes. || 2 || PAUREE: He Himself created this world,
and staged this wondrous play. Into the body of the five elements, He infused
attachment, falsehood and self-conceit. The ignorant, self-willed manmukh comes and
goes, wandering in reincarnation. He Himself teaches some to become Gurmukh,
through the spiritual wisdom of the Lord. He blesses them with the treasure of
devotional worship, and the wealth of the Lord‟s Name. || 4 || SHALOK, THIRD
MEHL: 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 787 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O red-robed woman, discard your red dress, and then, you shall come to love your
Husband Lord. By wearing her red dress, no one has found her Husband Lord; the selfwilled manmukh is burnt to death. Meeting the True Guru, she discards her red dress,
and eradicates egotism from within. Her mind and body are imbued with the deep red
color of His Love, and her tongue is imbued, singing His Praises and excellences. She
becomes His soul-bride forever, with the Word of the Shabad in her mind; she makes
the Fear of God and the Love of God her ornaments and decorations. O Nanak, by His
Merciful Grace, she obtains the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence, and keeps Him
enshrined in her heart. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O bride, forsake your red dress, and
decorate yourself with the crimson color of His Love. Your comings and goings shall be
forgotten, contemplating the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The soul-bride is adorned and
beautiful; the Celestial Lord, her Husband, abides in her home. O Nanak, the bride
ravishes and enjoys Him; and He, the Ravisher, ravishes and enjoys her. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The foolish, self-willed manmukh is engrossed in false attachment to family.
Practicing egotism and self-conceit, he dies and departs, taking nothing along with him.
He does not understand that the Messenger of Death is hovering over his head; he is
deluded by duality. This opportunity will not come into his hands again; the Messenger
of Death will seize him. He acts according to his pre-ordained destiny. || 5 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Do not call them „satee‟, who burn themselves along with their
husbands‟ corpses. O Nanak, they alone are known as „satee‟, who die from the shock
of separation. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: They are also known as „satee‟, who abide in
modesty and contentment. They serve their Lord, and rise in the early hours to
contemplate Him. || 2 || THIRD MEHL: The widows burn themselves in the fire,
along with their husbands‟ corpses. If they truly knew their husbands, then they suffer
terrible bodily pain. O Nanak, if they did not truly know their husbands, why should they
burn themselves in the fire? Whether their husbands are alive or dead, those wives
remain far away from them. || 3 || PAUREE: You created pain along with pleasure; O
Creator, such is the writ You have written. There is no other gift as great as the Name;
it has no form or sign. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is an inexhaustible treasure; it
abides in the mind of the Gurmukh. In His Mercy, He blesses us with the Naam, and
then, the writ of pain and pleasure is not written. Those humble servants who serve
with love, meet the Lord, chanting the Chant of the Lord. || 6 || SHALOK, SECOND
MEHL: They know that they will have to depart, so why do they make such
ostentatious displays? Those who do not know that they will have to depart, continue to
arrange their affairs. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: He accumulates wealth during the night
of his life, but in the morning, he must depart. O Nanak, it shall not go along with him,
and so he regrets. || 2 || SECOND MEHL: Paying a fine under pressure, does not
bring either merit or goodness. That alone is a good deed, O Nanak, which is done by
one‟s own free will. || 3 || SECOND MEHL: Stubborn-mindedness will not win the
Lord to one‟s side, no matter how much it is tried. The Lord is won over to your side, by
offering Him your true love, O servant Nanak, and contemplating the Word of the
Shabad. || 4 || PAUREE: The Creator created the world; He alone understands it. He
Himself created the Universe, and He Himself shall destroy it afterwards. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 788 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
All have grown weary of wandering throughout the four ages, but none know the Lord‟s
worth. The True Guru has shown me the One Lord, and my mind and body are at
peace. The Gurmukh praises the Lord forever; that alone happens, which the Creator
Lord does. || 7 || SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Those who have the Fear of God, have
no other fears; those who do not have the Fear of God, are very afraid. O Nanak, this
mystery is revealed at the Court of the Lord. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: That which
flows, mingles with that which flows; that which blows, mingles with that which blows.
The living mingle with the living, and the dead mingle with the dead. O Nanak, praise
the One who created the creation. || 2 || PAUREE: Those who meditate on the True
Lord are true; they contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. They subdue their ego,
purify their minds, and enshrine the Lord‟s Name within their hearts. The fools are
attached to their homes, mansions and balconies. The self-willed manmukhs are caught
in darkness; they do not know the One who created them. He alone understands,
whom the True Lord causes to understand; what can the helpless creatures do? || 8 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O bride, decorate yourself, after you surrender and accept
your Husband Lord. Otherwise, your Husband Lord will not come to your bed, and your
ornaments will be useless. O bride, your decorations will adorn you, only when your
Husband Lord‟s Mind is pleased. Your ornaments will be acceptable and approved, only
when your Husband Lord loves you. So make the Fear of God your ornaments, joy your
betel nuts to chew, and love your food. Surrender your body and mind to your Husband
Lord, and then, O Nanak, He will enjoy you. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The wife takes
flowers, and fragrance of betel, and decorates herself. But her Husband Lord does not
come to her bed, and so these efforts are useless. || 2 || THIRD MEHL: They are not
said to be husband and wife, who merely sit together. They alone are called husband
and wife, who have one light in two bodies. || 3 || PAUREE: Without the Fear of God,
there is no devotional worship, and no love for the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Meeting with the True Guru, the Fear of God wells up, and one is embellished with the
Fear and the Love of God. When the body and mind are imbued with the Lord‟s Love,
egotism and desire are conquered and subdued. The mind and body become
immaculately pure and very beautiful, when one meets the Lord, the Destroyer of ego.
Fear and love all belong to Him; He is the True Lord, permeating and pervading the
Universe. || 9 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Waaho! Waaho! You are wonderful and
great, O Lord and Master; You created the creation, and made us. You made the
waters, waves, oceans, pools, plants, clouds and mountains. You Yourself stand in the
midst of what You Yourself created. The selfless service of the Gurmukhs is approved;
in celestial peace, they live the essence of reality. They receive the wages of their labor,
begging at the Door of their Lord and Master. O Nanak, the Court of the Lord is
overflowing and carefree; O my True Carefree Lord, no one returns empty-handed from
Your Court. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: The teeth are like brilliant, beautiful pearls, and the
eyes are like sparkling jewels. Old age is their enemy, O Nanak; when they grow old,
they waste away. || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 789 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
2 || PAUREE: Praise the Lord, forever and ever; dedicate your body and mind to Him.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I have found the True, Profound and
Unfathomable Lord. The Lord, the jewel of jewels, is permeating my mind, body and
heart. The pains of birth and death are gone, and I shall never again be consigned to
the cycle of reincarnation. O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the ocean
of excellence. || 10 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, burn this body; this burnt
body has forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The dirt is piling up, and in the
world hereafter, your hand shall not be able to reach down into this stagnant pond to
clean it out. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, wicked are the uncountable actions of the
mind. They bring terrible and painful retributions, but if the Lord forgives me, then I will
be spared this punishment. || 2 || PAUREE: True is the Command He sends forth,
and True are the Orders He issues. Forever unmoving and unchanging, permeating and
pervading everywhere, He is the All-knowing Primal Lord. By Guru‟s Grace, serve Him,
through the True Insignia of the Shabad. That which He makes is perfect; through the
Guru‟s Teachings, enjoy His Love. He is inaccessible, unfathomable and unseen; as
Gurmukh, know the Lord. || 11 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, the bags of coins
are brought in and placed in the Court of our Lord and Master, and there, the genuine
and the counterfeit are separated. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: They go and bathe at sacred
shrines of pilgrimage, but their minds are still evil, and their bodies are thieves. Some of
their filth is washed off by these baths, but they only accumulate twice as much. Like a
gourd, they may be washed off on the outside, but on the inside, they are still filled
with poison. The holy man is blessed, even without such bathing, while a thief is a thief,
no matter how much he bathes. || 2 || PAUREE: He Himself issues His Commands,
and links the people of the world to their tasks. He Himself joins some to Himself, and
through the Guru, they find peace. The mind runs around in the ten directions; the
Guru holds it still. Everyone longs for the Name, but it is only found through the Guru‟s
Teachings. Your pre-ordained destiny, written by the Lord in the very beginning, cannot
be erased. || 12 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: The two lamps light the fourteen
markets. There are just as many traders as there are living beings. The shops are open,
and trading is going on; whoever comes there, is bound to depart. The Righteous Judge
of Dharma is the broker, who gives his sign of approval. O Nanak, those who earn the
profit of the Naam are accepted and approved. And when they return home, they are
greeted with cheers; they obtain the glorious greatness of the True Name. || 1 ||
FIRST MEHL: Even when the night is dark, whatever is white retains its white color.
And even when the light of day is dazzlingly bright, whatever is black retains its black
color. The blind fools have no wisdom at all; their understanding is blind. O Nanak,
without the Lord‟s Grace, they will never receive honor. || 2 || PAUREE: The True
Lord Himself created the body-fortress. Some are ruined through the love of duality,
engrossed in egotism. This human body is so difficult to obtain; the self-willed
manmukhs suffer in pain. He alone understands, whom the Lord Himself causes to
understand; he is blessed by the True Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 790 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He created the entire world for His play; He is pervading amongst all. || 13 ||
SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Thieves, adulterers, prostitutes and pimps, make friendships
with the unrighteous, and eat with the unrighteous. They do not know the value of the
Lord‟s Praises, and Satan is always with them. If a donkey is anointed with sandalwood
paste, he still loves to roll in the dirt. O Nanak, by spinning falsehood, a fabric of
falsehood is woven. False is the cloth and its measurement, and false is pride in such a
garment. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: The callers to prayer, the flute-players, the hornblowers, and also the singers — some are givers, and some are beggars; they become
acceptable only through Your Name, Lord. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to those who hear
and accept the Name. || 2 || PAUREE: Attachment to Maya is totally false, and false
are those who go that way. Through egotism, the world is caught in conflict and strife,
and it dies. The Gurmukh is free of conflict and strife, and sees the One Lord, pervading
everywhere. Recognizing that the Supreme Soul is everywhere, he crosses over the
terrifying world-ocean. His light merges into the Light, and he is absorbed into the
Lord‟s Name. || 14 || SHALOK: FIRST MEHL: O True Guru, bless me with Your
charity; You are the All-powerful Giver. May I subdue and quiet my egotism, pride,
sexual desire, anger and self-conceit. Burn away all my greed, and give me the Support
of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Day and night, keep me ever-fresh and new,
spotless and pure; let me never be soiled by sin. O Nanak, in this way I am saved; by
Your Grace, I have found peace. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: There is only the one Husband
Lord, for all who stand at His Door. O Nanak, they ask for news of their Husband Lord,
from those who are imbued with His Love. || 2 || FIRST MEHL: All are imbued with
love for their Husband Lord; I am a discarded bride — what good am I? My body is
filled with so many faults; my Lord and Master does not even turn His thoughts to me.
|| 3 || FIRST MEHL: I am a sacrifice to those who praise the Lord with their mouths.
All the nights are for the happy soul-brides; I am a discarded bride — if only I could
have even one night with Him! || 4 || PAUREE: I am a beggar at Your Door, begging
for charity; O Lord, please grant me Your Mercy, and give to me. As Gurmukh, unite
me, your humble servant, with You, that I may receive Your Name. Then, the unstruck
melody of the Shabad will vibrate and resound, and my light will blend with the Light.
Within my heart, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and celebrate the Word of the
Lord‟s Shabad. The Lord Himself is pervading and permeating the world; so fall in love
with Him! || 15 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Those who do not obtain the sublime
essence, the love and delight of their Husband Lord, are like guests in a deserted
house; they leave just as they have come, empty-handed. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: He
receives hundreds and thousands of reprimands, day and night; the swan-soul has
renounced the Lord‟s Praises, and attached itself to a rotting carcass. Cursed is that life,
in which one only eats to fill his belly. O Nanak, without the True Name, all one‟s
friends turn to enemies. || 2 || PAUREE: The minstrel continually sings the Glorious
Praises of the Lord, to embellish his life. The Gurmukh serves and praises the True
Lord, enshrining Him within his heart. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 791 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He obtains his own home and mansion, by loving the Naam, the Name of the Lord. As
Gurmukh, I have obtained the Naam; I am a sacrifice to the Guru. You Yourself
embellish and adorn us, O Creator Lord. || 16 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: When the
lamp is lit, the darkness is dispelled; reading the Vedas, sinful intellect is destroyed.
When the sun rises, the moon is not visible. Wherever spiritual wisdom appears,
ignorance is dispelled. Reading the Vedas is the world‟s occupation; the Pandits read
them, study them and contemplate them. Without understanding, all are ruined. O
Nanak, the Gurmukh is carried across. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Those who do not savor
the Word of the Shabad, do not love the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They speak
insipidly with their tongues, and are continually disgraced. O Nanak, they act according
to the karma of their past actions, which no one can erase. || 2 || PAUREE: One who
praises his God, receives honor. He drives out egotism from within himself, and
enshrines the True Name within his mind. Through the True Word of the Guru‟s Bani,
he chants the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and finds true peace. He is united with the
Lord, after being separated for so long; the Guru, the Primal Being, unites him with the
Lord. In this way, his filthy mind is cleansed and purified, and he meditates on the
Name of the Lord. || 17 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: With the fresh leaves of the body,
and the flowers of virtue, Nanak has weaved his garland. The Lord is pleased with such
garlands, so why pick any other flowers? || 1 || SECOND MEHL: O Nanak, it is the
spring season for those, within whose homes their Husband Lord abides. But those,
whose Husband Lord is far away in distant lands, continue burning, day and night. || 2
|| PAUREE: The Merciful Lord Himself forgives those who dwell upon the Word of the
Guru, the True Guru. Night and day, I serve the True Lord, and chant His Glorious
Praises; my mind merges into Him. My God is infinite; no one knows His limit. Grasping
hold of the feet of the True Guru, meditate continually on the Lord‟s Name. Thus you
shall obtain the fruits of your desires, and all wishes shall be fulfilled within your home.
|| 18 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Spring brings forth the first blossoms, but the Lord
blossoms earlier still. By His blossoming, everything blossoms; no one else causes Him
to blossom forth. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: He blossoms forth even earlier than the
spring; reflect upon Him. O Nanak, praise the One who gives Support to all. || 2 ||
SECOND MEHL: By uniting, the united one is not united; he unites, only if he is united.
But if he unites deep within his soul, then he is said to be united. || 3 || PAUREE:
Praise the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, and practice truthful deeds. Attached to other
deeds, one is consigned to wander in reincarnation. Attuned to the Name, one obtains
the Name, and through the Name, sings the Lord‟s Praises. Praising the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad, he merges in the Lord‟s Name. Service to the True Guru is fruitful and
rewarding; serving Him, the fruits are obtained. || 19 || SHALOK, SECOND MEHL:
Some people have others, but I am forlorn and dishonored; I have only You, Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 792 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I might as well just die crying, if You will not come into my mind. || 1 || SECOND
MEHL: When there is peace and pleasure, that is the time to remember your Husband
Lord. In times of suffering and pain, remember Him then as well. Says Nanak, O wise
bride, this is the way to meet your Husband Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: I am a worm —
how can I praise You, O Lord; Your glorious greatness is so great! You are inaccessible,
merciful and unapproachable; You Yourself unite us with Yourself. I have no other
friend except You; in the end, You alone will be my Companion and Support. You save
those who enter Your Sanctuary.. O Nanak, He is care-free; He has no greed at all. ||
20 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, THE WORD OF KABEER JEE, AND ALL THE DEVOTEES. OF
KABEER:

Since your birth, what have you done? You have never even chanted the Name of the
Lord. || 1 || You have not meditated on the Lord; what thoughts are you attached to?
What preparations are you making for your death, O unfortunate one? || 1 || Pause ||
Through pain and pleasure, you have taken care of your family. But at the time of
death, you shall have to endure the agony all alone. || 2 || When you are seized by
the neck, then you shall cry out. Says Kabeer, why didn‟t you remember the Lord
before this? || 3 || 1 || SOOHEE, KABEER JEE: My innocent soul trembles and
shakes. I do not know how my Husband Lord will deal with me. || 1 || The night of
my youth has passed away; will the day of old age also pass away? My dark hairs, like
bumble bees, have gone away, and grey hairs, like cranes, have settled upon my head.
|| 1 || Pause || Water does not remain in the unbaked clay pot; when the soul-swan
departs, the body withers away. || 2 || I decorate myself like a young virgin; but how
can I enjoy pleasures, without my Husband Lord? || 3 || My arm is tired, driving away
the crows. Says Kabeer, this is the way the story of my life ends. || 4 || 2 || SOOHEE,
KABEER JEE: Your time of service is at its end, and you will have to give your account.
The hard-hearted Messenger of Death has come to take you away. What have you
earned, and what have you lost? Come immediately! You are summoned to His Court!
|| 1 || Get going! Come just as you are! You have been summoned to His Court. The
Order has come from the Court of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || I pray to the Messenger
of Death: please, I still have some outstanding debts to collect in the village. I will
collect them tonight; I will also pay you something for your expenses, and I will recite
my morning prayers on the way. || 2 || Blessed, blessed is the most fortunate servant
of the Lord, who is imbued with the Lord‟s Love, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy. Here and there, the humble servants of the Lord are always happy. They win
the priceless treasure of this human life. || 3 || When he is awake, he is sleeping, and
so he loses this life. The property and wealth he has accumulated passes on to
someone else. Says Kabeer, those people are deluded, who forget their Lord and
Master, and roll in the dust. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 793 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 4 || 3 || SO0HEE, KABEER JEE, LALLIT: My eyes are exhausted, and my ears are
tired of hearing; my beautiful body is exhausted. Driven forward by old age, all my
senses are exhausted; only my attachment to Maya is not exhausted. || 1 || O mad
man, you have not obtained spiritual wisdom and meditation. You have wasted this
human life, and lost. || 1 || Pause || O mortal, serve the Lord, as long as the breath
of life remains in the body. And even when your body dies, your love for the Lord shall
not die; you shall dwell at the Feet of the Lord. || 2 || When the Word of the Shabad
abides deep within, thirst and desire are quenched. When one understands the Hukam
of the Lord‟s Command, he plays the game of chess with the Lord; throwing the dice,
he conquers his own mind. || 3 || Those humble beings, who know the Imperishable
Lord and meditate on Him, are not destroyed at all. Says Kabeer, those humble beings
who know how to throw these dice, never lose the game of life. || 4 || 4 || SOOHEE,
LALIT, KABEER JEE: In the one fortress of the body, there are five rulers, and all five
demand payment of taxes. I have not farmed anyone‟s land, so such payment is
difficult for me to pay. || 1 || O people of the Lord, the tax-collector is constantly
torturing me! Raising my arms up, I complained to my Guru, and He has saved me. ||
1 || Pause || The nine tax-assessors and the ten magistrates go out; they do not
allow their subjects to live in peace. They do not measure with a full tape, and they
take huge amounts in bribes. || 2 || The One Lord is contained in the seventy-two
chambers of the body, and He has written off my account. The records of the Righteous
Judge of Dharma have been searched, and I owe absolutely nothing. || 3 || Let no
one slander the Saints, because the Saints and the Lord are as one. Says Kabeer, I
have found that Guru, whose Name is Clear Understanding. || 4 || 5 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, THE WORD OF SREE RAVI DAAS JEE:

The happy soul-bride knows the worth of her Husband Lord. Renouncing pride, she
enjoys peace and pleasure. She surrenders her body and mind to Him, and does not
remain separate from Him. She does not see or hear, or speak to another. || 1 ||
How can anyone know the pain of another, if there is no compassion and sympathy
within? || 1 || Pause || The discarded bride is miserable, and loses both worlds; she
does not worship her Husband Lord. The bridge over the fire of hell is difficult and
treacherous. No one will accompany you there; you will have to go all alone. || 2 ||
Suffering in pain, I have come to Your Door, O Compassionate Lord. I am so thirsty for
You, but You do not answer me. Says Ravi Daas, I seek Your Sanctuary, God; as You
know me, so will You save me. || 3 || 1 || SOOHEE: That day which comes, that day
shall go. You must march on; nothing remains stable. Our companions are leaving, and
we must leave as well. We must go far away. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 794 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Death is hovering over our heads. || 1 || Why are you asleep? Wake up, you ignorant
fool! You believe that your life in the world is true. || 1 || Pause || The One who
gave you life shall also provide you with nourishment. In each and every heart, He runs
His shop. Meditate on the Lord, and renounce your egotism and self-conceit. Within
your heart, contemplate the Naam, the Name of the Lord, sometime. || 2 || Your life
has passed away, but you have not arranged your path. Evening has set in, and soon
there will be darkness on all sides. Says Ravi Daas, O ignorant mad-man, don‟t you
realize, that this world is the house of death?! || 3 || 2 || SOOHEE: You may have
lofty mansions, halls and kitchens. But you cannot stay in them, even for an instant,
after death. || 1 || This body is like a house of straw. When it is burnt, it mixes with
dust. || 1 || Pause || Even relatives, family and friends begin to say, “Take his body
out, immediately!” || 2 || And the wife of his house, who was so attached to his body
and heart, runs away, crying out, “Ghost! Ghost!” || 3 || Says Ravi Daas, the whole
world has been plundered, but I have escaped, chanting the Name of the One Lord. ||
4 || 3 ||
RAAG SOOHEE, THE WORD OF SHAYKH FAREED JEE:

Burning and burning, writhing in pain, I wring my hands. I have gone insane, seeking
my Husband Lord. O my Husband Lord, You are angry with me in Your Mind. The fault
is with me, and not with my Husband Lord. || 1 || O my Lord and Master, I do not
know Your excellence and worth. Having wasted my youth, now I come to regret and
repent. || 1 || Pause || O black bird, what qualities have made you black? “I have
been burnt by separation from my Beloved.” Without her Husband Lord, how can the
soul-bride ever find peace? When He becomes merciful, then God unites us with
Himself. || 2 || The lonely soul-bride suffers in the pit of the world. She has no
companions, and no friends. In His Mercy, God has united me with the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy. And when I look again, then I find God as my Helper. || 3 ||
The path upon which I must walk is very depressing. It is sharper than a two-edged
sword, and very narrow. That is where my path lies. O Shaykh Fareed, think of that
path early on. || 4 || 1 || SOOHEE, LALIT: You were not able to make yourself a raft
when you should have. When the ocean is churning and over-flowing, then it is very
difficult to cross over it. || 1 || Do not touch the safflower with your hands; its color
will fade away, my dear. || 1 || Pause || First, the bride herself is weak, and then,
her Husband Lord‟s Order is hard to bear. Milk does not return to the breast; it will not
be collected again. || 2 || Says Fareed, O my companions, when our Husband Lord
calls, the soul departs, sad at heart, and this body returns to dust. || 3 || 2 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 795 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.
TRUTH IS THE NAME.
CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED. NO FEAR. NO HATRED.
IMAGE OF THE UNDYING. BEYOND BIRTH. SELF-EXISTENT.
BY GURU‟S GRACE:
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIRST MEHL, CHAU-PADAS, FIRST HOUSE:
You are the Emperor, and I call You a chief — how does this add to Your greatness? As
You permit me, I praise You, O Lord and Master; I am ignorant, and I cannot chant
Your Praises. || 1 || Please bless me with such understanding, that I may sing Your
Glorious Praises. May I dwell in Truth, according to Your Will. || 1 || Pause ||
Whatever has happened, has all come from You. You are All-knowing. Your limits
cannot be known, O my Lord and Master; I am blind — what wisdom do I have? || 2 ||
What should I say? While talking, I talk of seeing, but I cannot describe the
indescribable. As it pleases Your Will, I speak; it is just the tiniest bit of Your greatness.
|| 3 || Among so many dogs, I am an outcast; I bark for my body‟s belly. Without
devotional worship, O Nanak, even so, still, my Master‟s Name does not leave me. || 4
|| 1 || BILAAWAL, FIRST MEHL: My mind is the temple, and my body is the simple
cloth of the humble seeker; deep within my heart, I bathe at the sacred shrine. The
One Word of the Shabad abides within my mind; I shall not come to be born again. ||
1 || My mind is pierced through by the Merciful Lord, O my mother! Who can know
the pain of another? I think of none other than the Lord. || 1 || Pause || O Lord,
inaccessible, unfathomable, invisible and infinite: please, take care of me! In the water,
on the land and in sky, You are totally pervading. Your Light is in each and every heart.
|| 2 || All teachings, instructions and understandings are Yours; the mansions and
sanctuaries are Yours as well. Without You, I know no other, O my Lord and Master; I
continually sing Your Glorious Praises. || 3 || All beings and creatures seek the
Protection of Your Sanctuary; all thought of their care rests with You. That which
pleases Your Will is good; this alone is Nanak‟s prayer. || 4 || 2 || BILAAWAL, FIRST
MEHL: He Himself is the Word of the Shabad, and He Himself is the Insignia. He
Himself is the Listener, and He Himself is the Knower. He Himself created the creation,
and He Himself beholds His almighty power. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 796 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
You are the Great Giver; Your Name alone is approved. || 1 || Such is the Name of
the Immaculate, Divine Lord. I am just a beggar; You are invisible and unknowable. ||
1 || Pause || Love of Maya is like a cursed woman, ugly, dirty and promiscuous.
Power and beauty are false, and last for only a few days. But when one is blessed with
the Naam, the darkness within is illuminated. || 2 || I tasted Maya and renounced it,
and now, I have no doubts. One whose father is known, cannot be illegitimate. One
who belongs to the One Lord, has no fear. The Creator acts, and causes all to act. One
who dies in the Word of the Shabad conquers his mind, through his mind. Keeping his
mind restrained, he enshrines the True Lord within his heart. He does not know any
other, and he is a sacrifice to the Guru. O Nanak, attuned to the Naam, he is
emancipated. || 4 || 3 || BILAAVAL, FIRST MEHL: Through the Word of the Guru‟s
Teachings, the mind intuitively meditates on the Lord. Imbued with the Lord‟s Love, the
mind is satisfied. The insane, self-willed manmukhs wander around, deluded by doubt.
Without the Lord, how can anyone survive? Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, He
is realized. || 1 || Without the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, how can I live, O my
mother? Without the Lord, my soul cannot survive, even for an instant; the True Guru
has helped me understand this. || 1 || Pause || Forgetting my God, I die in pain.
With each breath and morsel of food, I meditate on my Lord, and seek Him. I remain
always detached, but I am enraptured with the Lord‟s Name. Now, as Gurmukh, I know
that the Lord is always with me. || 2 || The Unspoken Speech is spoken, by the Will
of the Guru. He shows us that God is unapproachable and unfathomable. Without the
Guru, what lifestyle could we practice, and what work could we do? Eradicating
egotism, and walking in harmony with the Guru‟s Will, I am absorbed in the Word of the
Shabad. || 3 || The self-willed manmukhs are separated from the Lord, gathering
false wealth. The Gurmukhs are celebrated with the glory of the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. The Lord has showered His Mercy upon me, and made me the slave of His slaves.
The Name of the Lord is the wealth and capital of servant Nanak. || 4 || 4 ||
BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL, FIRST HOUSE:

Cursed, cursed is the food; cursed, cursed is the sleep; cursed, cursed are the clothes
worn on the body. Cursed is the body, along with family and friends, when one does
not find his Lord and Master in this life. He misses the step of the ladder, and this
opportunity will not come into his hands again; his life is wasted, uselessly. || 1 ||
The love of duality does not allow him to lovingly focus his attention on the Lord; he
forgets the Feet of the Lord. O Life of the World, O Great Giver, you eradicate the
sorrows of your humble servants. || 1 || Pause || You are Merciful, O Great Giver of
Mercy; what are these poor beings? All are liberated or placed into bondage by You;
this is all one can say. One who becomes Gurmukh is said to be liberated, while the
poor self-willed manmukhs are in bondage. || 2 || He alone is liberated, who lovingly
focuses his attention on the One Lord, always dwelling with the Lord. His depth and
condition cannot be described. The True Lord Himself embellishes him. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 797 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Those who wander around, deluded by doubt, are called manmukhs; they are neither
on this side, nor on the other side. || 3 || That humble being, who is blessed by the
Lord‟s Glance of Grace obtains Him, and contemplates the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad.
In the midst of Maya, the Lord‟s servant is emancipated. O Nanak, one who has such
destiny inscribed upon his forehead, conquers and destroys death. || 4 || 1 ||
BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL: How can the unweighable be weighed? If there is anyone
else as great, then he alone could understand the Lord. There is no other than Him.
How can His value be estimated? || 1 || By Guru‟s Grace, He comes to dwell in the
mind. One comes to know Him, when duality departs. || 1 || Pause || He Himself is
the Assayer, applying the touch-stone to test it. He Himself analyzes the coin, and He
Himself approves it as currency. He Himself weights it perfectly. He alone knows; He is
the One and Only Lord. || 2 || All the forms of Maya emanate from Him. He alone
becomes pure and immaculate, who is united with the Lord. He alone is attached,
whom the Lord attaches. All Truth is revealed to him, and then, he merges in the True
Lord. || 3 || He Himself leads the mortals to focus on Him, and He Himself causes
them to chase after Maya. He Himself imparts understanding, and He reveals Himself.
He Himself is the True Guru, and He Himself is the Word of the Shabad. O Nanak, He
Himself speaks and teaches. || 4 || 2 || BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL: My Lord and
Master has made me His servant, and blessed me with His service; how can anyone
argue about this? Such is Your play, One and Only Lord; You are the One, contained
among all. || 1 || When the True Guru is pleased and appeased, one is absorbed in
the Lord‟s Name. One who is blessed by the Lord‟s Mercy, finds the True Guru; night
and day, he automatically remains focused on the Lord‟s meditation. || 1 || Pause ||
How can I serve You? How can I be proud of this? When You withdraw Your Light, O
Lord and Master, then who can speak and teach? || 2 || You Yourself are the Guru,
and You Yourself are the chaylaa, the humble disciple; You Yourself are the treasure of
virtue. As You cause us to move, so do we move, according to the Pleasure of Your
Will, O Lord God. || 3 || Says Nanak, You are the True Lord and Master; who can
know Your actions? Some are blessed with glory in their own homes, while others
wander in doubt and pride. || 4 || 3 || BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL: The perfect Lord
has fashioned the Perfect Creation. Behold the Lord Lord pervading everywhere. In this
play of the world, is the glorious greatness of the True Name. No one should take pride
in himself. || 1 || One who accepts the wisdom of the True Guru‟s Teachings, is
absorbed into the True Guru. The Lord‟s Name abides deep within the nucleus of one
who realizes the Bani of the Guru‟s Word within his soul. || 1 || Pause || Now, this is
the essence of the teachings of the four ages: for the human race, the Name of the
One Lord is the greatest treasure. Celibacy, self-discipline and pilgrimages were the
essence of Dharma in those past ages; but in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Praise of
the Lord‟s Name is the essence of Dharma. || 2 || Each and every age has its own
essence of Dharma; study the Vedas and the Puraanas, and see this as true. They are
Gurmukh, who meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; in this world, they are perfect and
approved. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 798 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Says Nanak, loving the True Lord, the mind‟s egotism and self-conceit is eradicated.
Those who speak and listen to the Lord‟s Name, all find peace. Those who believe in it,
obtain the supreme treasure. || 4 || 4 || BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL: The Lord Himself
attaches the Gurmukh to His Love; joyful melodies permeate his home, and he is
embellished with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The women come and sing the songs
of joy. Meeting with their Beloved, lasting peace is obtained. || 1 || I am a sacrifice to
those, whose minds are filled with the Lord. Meeting with the humble servant of the
Lord, peace is obtained, and one intuitively sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1
|| Pause || They are always imbued with Your Joyful Love; O Dear Lord, You
Yourself come to dwell in their minds. They obtain eternal glory. The Gurmukhs are
united in the Lord‟s Union. || 2 || The Gurmukhs are imbued with the love of the
Word of the Shabad. They abide in the home of their own being, singing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. They are dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord‟s Love; they
look so beautiful. This dye never fades away; they are absorbed in the True Lord. || 3
|| The Shabad deep within the nucleus of the self dispels the darkness of ignorance.
Meeting with my Friend, the True Guru, I have obtained spiritual wisdom. Those who
are attuned to the True Lord, do not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation again. O
Nanak, my Perfect Guru implants the Naam, the Name of the Lord, deep within. || 4 ||
5 || BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL: From the Perfect Guru, I have obtained glorious
greatness. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, has spontaneously come to abide in my
mind. Through the Word of the Shabad, I have burnt away egotism and Maya. Through
the Guru, I have obtained honor in the Court of the True Lord. || 1 || I serve the Lord
of the Universe; I have no other work to do. Night and day, my mind is in ecstasy; as
Gurmukh, I beg for the bliss-giving Naam. || 1 || Pause || From the mind itself,
mental faith is obtained. Through the Guru, I have realized the Shabad. How rare is that
person, who looks upon life and death alike. She shall never die again, and shall not
have to see the Messenger of Death. || 2 || Within the home of the self are all the
millions of treasures. The True Guru has revealed them, and my egotistical pride is
gone. I keep my meditation always focused on the Cosmic Lord. Night and day, I sing
the One Name. || 3 || I have obtained glorious greatness in this age, from the Perfect
Guru, meditating on the Naam. Wherever I look, I see the Lord permeating and
pervading. He is forever the Giver of peace; His worth cannot be estimated. || 4 || By
perfect destiny, I have found the Perfect Guru. He has revealed to me the treasure of
the Naam, deep within the nucleus of my self. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is so
very sweet. O Nanak, my thirst is quenched, and my mind and body have found peace.
|| 5 || 6 || 4 || 6 || 10 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL, THIRD HOUSE:

Effort and intelligence come from God, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; as He
wills, they act. As the violinist plays upon the strings of the violin, so does the Lord play
the living beings. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 799 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue, O mind. According to the preordained destiny written upon my forehead, I have found the Guru, and the Lord abides
within my heart. || 1 || Pause || Entangled in Maya, the mortal wanders around.
Save Your humble servant, O Lord, as you saved Prahlaad from the clutches of
Harnaakash; keep him in Your Sanctuary, Lord. || 2 || How can I describe the state
and the condition, O Lord, of those many sinners you have purified? Ravi Daas, the
leather-worker, who worked with hides and carried dead animals was saved, by
entering the Lord‟s Sanctuary. || 3 || O God, Merciful to the meek, carry Your
devotees across the world-ocean; I am a sinner — save me from sin! O Lord, make me
the slave of the slave of Your slaves; servant Nanak is the slave of Your slaves. || 4 ||
1 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL: I am foolish, idiotic and ignorant; I seek Your
Sanctuary, O Primal Being, O Lord beyond birth. Have Mercy upon me, and save me, O
my Lord and Master; I am a lowly stone, with no good karma at all. || 1 || O my
mind, vibrate and meditate on the Lord, the Name of the Lord. Under Guru‟s
Instructions, obtain the sublime, subtle essence of the Lord; renounce other fruitless
actions. || 1 || Pause || The humble servants of the Lord are saved by the Lord; I
am worthless — it is Your glory to save me. I have no other than You, O my Lord and
Master; I meditate on the Lord, by my good karma. || 2 || Those who lack the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, their lives are cursed, and they must endure terrible pain. They
are consigned to reincarnation over and over again; they are the most unfortunate
fools, with no good karma at all. || 3 || The Naam is the Support of the Lord‟s humble
servants; their good karma is pre-ordained. The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the
Naam within servant Nanak, and his life is fruitful. || 4 || 2 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH
MEHL: My consciousness is lured by emotional attachment and corruption; is is filled
with evil-minded filth. I cannot serve You, O God; I am ignorant — how can I cross
over? || 1 || O my mind, chant the Name of the Lord, the Lord, the Lord of man. God
has showered His Mercy upon His humble servant; meeting with the True Guru, he is
carried across. || 1 || Pause || O my Father, my Lord and Master, Lord God, please
bless me with such understanding, that I may sing Your Praises. Those who are
attached to You are saved, like iron which is carried across with wood. || 2 || The
faithless cynics have little or no understanding; they do not serve the Lord, Har, Har.
Those beings are unfortunate and vicious; they die, and are consigned to reincarnation,
over and over again. || 3 || Those whom You unite with Yourself, O Lord and Master,
bathe in the Guru‟s cleansing pool of contentment. Vibrating upon the Lord, the filth of
their evil-mindedness is washed away; servant Nanak is carried across. || 4 || 3 ||
BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL: Come, O Saints, and join together, O my Siblings of
Destiny; let us tell the Stories of the Lord, Har, Har. The Naam, the Name of the Lord,
is the boat in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga; the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is the boatman
to ferry us across. || 1 || O my mind, chant the Glorious Praises of the Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 800 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
According to the pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon your forehead, sing the Praises of
the Lord; join the Holy Congregation, and cross over the world-ocean. || 1 || Pause ||
Within the body-village is the Lord‟s supreme, sublime essence. How can I obtain it?
Teach me, O humble Saints. Serving the True Guru, you shall obtain the Fruitful Vision
of the Lord‟s Darshan; meeting Him, drink in the ambrosial essence of the Lord‟s
Nectar. || 2 || The Ambrosial Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is so sweet; O Saints of the
Lord, taste it, and see. Under Guru‟s Instruction, the Lord‟s essence seems so sweet;
through it, all corrupt sensual pleasures are forgotten. || 3 || The Name of the Lord is
the medicine to cure all diseases; so serve the Lord, O humble Saints. The four great
blessings are obtained, O Nanak, by vibrating upon the Lord, under Guru‟s Instruction.
|| 4 || 4 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL: Anyone, from any class — Kh‟shaatriya,
Brahman, Soodra or Vaishya — can chant, and meditate on the Mantra of the Lord‟s
Name. Worship the Guru, the True Guru, as the Supreme Lord God; serve Him
constantly, all day and night. || 1 || O humble servants of the Lord, behold the True
Guru with your eyes. Whatever you wish for, you shall receive, chanting the Word of
the Lord‟s Name, under Guru‟s Instruction. || 1 || Pause || People think of many and
various efforts, but that alone happens, which is to happen. All beings seek goodness
for themselves, but what the Lord does — that may not be what we think and expect.
|| 2 || So renounce the clever intellect of your mind, O humble servants of the Lord,
no matter how hard this may be. Night and day, meditate on the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har; accept the wisdom of the Guru, the True Guru. || 3 || Wisdom,
balanced wisdom is in Your power, O Lord and Master; I am the instrument, and You
are the player, O Primal Lord. O God, O Creator, Lord and Master of servant Nanak, as
You wish, so do I speak. || 4 || 5 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL: I meditate on the
source of bliss, the Sublime Primal Being; night and day, I am in ecstasy and bliss. The
Righteous Judge of Dharma has no power over me; I have cast off all subservience to
the Messenger of Death. || 1 || Meditate, O mind, on the Naam, the Name of the
Lord of the Universe. By great good fortune, I have found the Guru, the True Guru; I
sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of supreme bliss. || 1 || Pause || The foolish
faithless cynics are held captive by Maya; in Maya, they continue wandering, wandering
around. Burnt by desire, and bound by the karma of their past actions, they go round
and round, like the ox at the mill press. || 2 || The Gurmukhs, who focus on serving
the Guru, are saved; by great good fortune, they perform service. Those who meditate
on the Lord obtain the fruits of their rewards, and the bonds of Maya are all broken. ||
3 || He Himself is the Lord and Master, and He Himself is the servant. The Lord of the
Universe Himself is all by Himself. O servant Nanak, He Himself is All-pervading; as He
keeps us, we remain. || 4 || 6 ||

RAAG BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL, PARTAAL, THIRTEENTH HOUSE:
O Siblings of Destiny, chant the Name of the Lord, the Purifier of sinners. The Lord
emancipates his Saints and devotees. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 801 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Lord is totally permeating and pervading everywhere; the Name of the Lord is
pervading the water and the land. So sing continuously of the Lord, the Dispeller of
pain. || 1 || Pause || The Lord has made my life fruitful and rewarding. I meditate
on the Lord, the Dispeller of pain. I have met the Guru, the Giver of liberation. The Lord
has made my life‟s journey fruitful and rewarding. Joining the Sangat, the Holy
Congregation, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || O mortal, place your
hopes in the Name of the Lord, and your love of duality shall simply vanish. One who,
in hope, remains unattached to hope, such a humble being meets with his Lord. And
one who sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord‟s Name — servant Nanak falls at his feet.
|| 2 || 1 || 7 || 4 || 6 || 7 || 17 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, CHAU-PADAS, FIRST HOUSE:

He is attached to what he sees. How can I meet You, O Imperishable God? Have Mercy
upon me, and place me upon the Path; let me be attached to the hem of the robe of
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. || 1 || How can I cross over the
poisonous world-ocean? The True Guru is the boat to carry us across. || 1 || Pause ||
The wind of Maya blows and shakes us, but the Lord‟s devotees remain ever-stable.
They remain unaffected by pleasure and pain. The Guru Himself is the Savior above
their heads. || 2 || Maya, the snake, holds all in her coils. They burn to death in
egotism, like the moth lured by seeing the flame. They make all sorts of decorations,
but they do not find the Lord. When the Guru becomes Merciful, He leads them to meet
the Lord. || 3 || I wander around, sad and depressed, seeking the jewel of the One
Lord. This priceless jewel is not obtained by any efforts. That jewel is within the body,
the Temple of the Lord. The Guru has torn away the veil of illusion, and beholding the
jewel, I am delighted. || 4 || One who has tasted it, comes to know its flavor; he is
like the mute, whose mind is filled with wonder. I see the Lord, the source of bliss,
everywhere. Servant Nanak speaks the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and merges in Him.
|| 5 || 1 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The Divine Guru has blessed me with total
happiness. He has linked His servant to His service. No obstacles block my path,
meditating on the incomprehensible, inscrutable Lord. || 1 || The soil has been
sanctified, singing the Glories of His Praises. The residues of sinful mistakes are
eradicated, meditating on the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || He Himself is
pervading everywhere; from the very beginning, and throughout the ages, His Glory
has been radiantly manifest. By Guru‟s Grace, sorrow does not touch me. || 2 || The
Guru‟s Feet seem so sweet to my mind. He is unobstructed, dwelling everywhere. I
found total peace, when the Guru was pleased. || 3 || The Supreme Lord God has
become my Savior. Wherever I look, I see Him there with me. O Nanak, the Lord and
Master protects and cherishes His slaves. || 4 || 2 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: You
are the treasure of peace, O my Beloved God. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 802 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Your Glories are uncounted, O God, my Lord and Master. I am an orphan, entering Your
Sanctuary. Have Mercy on me, O Lord, that I may meditate on Your Feet. || 1 || Take
pity upon me, and abide within my mind; I am worthless — please let me grasp hold of
the hem of Your robe. || 1 || Pause || When God comes into my consciousness,
what misfortune can strike me? The Lord‟s servant does not suffer pain from the
Messenger of Death. All pains are dispelled, when one remembers the Lord in
meditation; God abides with him forever. || 2 || The Name of God is the Support of
my mind and body. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the body is reduced to
ashes. When God comes into my consciousness, all my affairs are resolved. Forgetting
the Lord, one becomes subservient to all. || 3 || I am in love with the Lotus Feet of
the Lord. I am rid of all evil-minded ways. The Mantra of the Lord‟s Name, Har, Har, is
deep within my mind and body. O Nanak, eternal bliss fills the home of the Lord‟s
devotees. || 4 || 3 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE,
TO BE SUNG TO THE TUNE OF YAAN-REE-AY:

You are the Support of my mind, O my Beloved, You are the Support of my mind. All
other clever tricks are useless, O Beloved; You alone are my Protector. || 1 || Pause
|| One who meets with the Perfect True Guru, O Beloved, that humble person is
enraptured. He alone serves the Guru, O Beloved, unto whom the Lord becomes
merciful. Fruitful is the form of the Divine Guru, O Lord and Master; He is overflowing
with all powers. O Nanak, the Guru is the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord;
He is ever-present, forever and ever. || 1 || I live by hearing, hearing of those who
know their God. They contemplate the Lord‟s Name, they chant the Lord‟s Name, and
their minds are imbued with the Lord‟s Name. I am Your servant; I beg to serve Your
humble servants. By the karma of perfect destiny, I do this. This is Nanak‟s prayer: O
my Lord and Master, may I obtain the Blessed Vision of Your humble servants. || 2 ||
They are said to be very fortunate, O Beloved, who who dwell in the Society of the
Saints. They contemplate the Immaculate, Ambrosial Naam, and their minds are
illuminated. The pains of birth and death are eradicated, O Beloved, and the fear of the
Messenger of Death is ended. They alone obtain the Blessed Vision of this Darshan, O
Nanak, who are pleasing to their God. || 3 || O my lofty, incomparable and infinite
Lord and Master, who can know Your Glorious Virtues? Those who sing them are saved,
and those who listen to them are saved; all their sins are erased. You save the beasts,
demons and fools, and even stones are carried across. Slave Nanak seeks Your
Sanctuary; he is forever and ever a sacrifice to You. || 4 || 1 || 4 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: Renounce the tasteless water of corruption, O my companion, and drink in the
supreme nectar of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Without the taste of this nectar, all
have drowned, and their souls have not found happiness. You have no honor, glory or
power — become the slave of the Holy Saints. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 803 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, they alone look beautiful in the Court of the Lord, whom the Lord has made
His Own. || 1 || Maya is a mirage, which deludes the mind, O my companion, like the
scent-crazed deer, or the transitory shade of a tree. Maya is fickle, and does not go with
you, O my companion; in the end, it will leave you. He may enjoy pleasures and sensual
delights with supremely beautiful women, but no one finds peace in this way. Blessed,
blessed are the humble, Holy Saints of the Lord, O my companion. O Nanak, they
meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 2 || Go, O my very fortunate
companion: dwell in the Company of the Saints, and merge with the Lord. There,
neither pain nor hunger nor disease will afflict you; enshrine love for the Lord‟s Lotus
Feet. There is no birth or death there, no coming or going in reincarnation, when you
enter the Sanctuary of the Eternal Lord. Love does not end, and attachment does not
grip you, O Nanak, when you meditate on the One Lord. || 3 || Bestowing His Glance
of Grace, my Beloved has pierced my mind, and I am intuitively attuned to His Love. My
bed is embellished, meeting with my Beloved; in ecstasy and bliss, I sing His Glorious
Praises. O my friends and companions, I am imbued with the Lord‟s Love; the desires of
my mind and body are satisfied. O Nanak, the wonder-struck soul blends with the
Wonderful Lord; this state cannot be described. || 4 || 2 || 5 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE:

The entire Universe is the form of the One Lord. He Himself is the trade, and He
Himself is the trader. || 1 || How rare is that one who is blessed with such spiritual
wisdom. Wherever I go, there I see Him. || 1 || Pause || He manifests many forms,
while still unmanifest and absolute, and yet He has One Form. He Himself is the water,
and He Himself is the waves. || 2 || He Himself is the temple, and He Himself is
selfless service. He Himself is the worshipper, and He Himself is the idol. || 3 || He
Himself is the Yoga; He Himself is the Way. Nanak‟s God is forever liberated. || 4 || 1
|| 6 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: He Himself creates, and He Himself supports. He
Himself causes all to act; He takes no blame Himself. || 1 || He Himself is the
teaching, and He Himself is the teacher. He Himself is the splendor, and He Himself is
the experiencer of it. || 1 || Pause || He Himself is silent, and He Himself is the
speaker. He Himself is undeceivable; He cannot be deceived. || 2 || He Himself is
hidden, and He Himself is manifest. He Himself is in each and every heart; He Himself
is unattached. || 3 || He Himself is absolute, and He Himself is with the Universe.
Says Nanak, all are beggars of God. || 4 || 2 || 7 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: He
places the one who strays back on the Path; such a Guru is found by great good
fortune. || 1 || Meditate, contemplate the Name of the Lord, O mind. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 804 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Beloved Feet of the Guru abide within my heart. || 1 || Pause || The mind is
engrossed in sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment. Breaking my
bonds, the Guru has liberated me. || 2 || Experiencing pain and pleasure, one is born,
only to die again. The Lotus Feet of the Guru bring peace and shelter. || 3 || The
world is drowning in the ocean of fire. O Nanak, holding me by the arm, the True Guru
has saved me. || 4 || 3 || 8 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Body, mind, wealth and
everything, I surrender to my Lord. What is that wisdom, by which I may come to chant
the Name of the Lord, Har, Har? || 1 || Nurturing hope, I have come to beg from
God. Gazing upon You, the courtyard of my heart is embellished. || 1 || Pause ||
Trying several methods, I reflect deeply upon the Lord. In the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, this mind is saved. || 2 || I have neither intelligence, wisdom,
common sense nor cleverness. I meet You, only if You lead me to meet You. || 3 ||
My eyes are content, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of God‟s Darshan. Says Nanak,
such a life is fruitful and rewarding. || 4 || 4 || 9 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Mother,
father, children and the wealth of Maya, will not go along with you. In the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all pain is dispelled. || 1 || God Himself is
pervading, and permeating all. Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue, and pain
will not afflict you. || 1 || Pause || One who is afflicted by the terrible fire of thirst
and desire, becomes cool, chanting the Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. || 2 || By
millions of efforts, peace is not obtained; the mind is satisfied only by singing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 3 || Please bless me with devotion, O God, O Searcher
of hearts. This is Nanak‟s prayer, O Lord and Master. || 4 || 5 || 10 || BILAAVAL,
FIFTH MEHL: By great good fortune, the Perfect Guru is found. Meeting with the Holy
Saints, meditate on the Name of the Lord. || 1 || O Supreme Lord God, I seek Your
Sanctuary. Meditating on the Guru‟s Feet, sinful mistakes are erased. || 1 || Pause ||
All other rituals are just worldly affairs; joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, one is saved. || 2 || One may contemplate the Simritees, Shaastras and Vedas,
but only by chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is one saved and carried across.
|| 3 || Have Mercy upon servant Nanak, O God, and bless him with the dust of the
feet of the Holy, that he may be emancipated. || 4 || 6 || 11 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: I contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad within my heart; all my hopes and
desires are fulfilled. The faces of the humble Saints are radiant and bright; the Lord has
mercifully blessed them with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
Holding them by the hand, He has lifted them up out of the deep, dark pit, and their
victory is celebrated throughout the world. || 2 || He elevates and exalts the lowly,
and fills the empty. They receive the supreme, sublime essence of the Ambrosial Naam.
|| 3 || The mind and body are made immaculate and pure, and sins are burnt to
ashes. Says Nanak, God is pleased with me. || 4 || 7 || 12 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: All desires are fulfilled, O my friend, lovingly centering your consciousness on
the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 805 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on God. The fire of desire is quenched,
singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Pause || One‟s life become
fruitful and rewarding, by great good fortune. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, enshrine love for the Lord. || 2 || Wisdom, honor, wealth, peace and celestial
bliss are attained, if one does not forget the Lord of supreme bliss, even for an instant.
|| 3 || My mind is so very thirsty for the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan. Prays
Nanak, O God, I seek Your Sanctuary. || 4 || 8 || 13 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: I
am worthless, totally lacking all virtues. Bless me with Your Mercy, and make me Your
Own. || 1 || My mind and body are embellished by the Lord, the Lord of the World.
Granting His Mercy, God has come into the home of my heart. || 1 || Pause || He is
the Lover and Protector of His devotees, the Destroyer of fear. Now, I have been
carried across the world-ocean. || 2 || It is God‟s Way to purify sinners, say the
Vedas. I have seen the Supreme Lord with my eyes. || 3 || In the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy, the Lord becomes manifest. O slave Nanak, all pains are relieved.
|| 4 || 9 || 14 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Who can know the value of serving You,
God? God is imperishable, invisible and incomprehensible. || 1 || His Glorious Virtues
are infinite; God is profound and unfathomable. The Mansion of God, my Lord and
Master, is lofty and high. You are unlimited, O my Lord and Master. || 1 || Pause ||
There is no other than the One Lord. You alone know Your worship and adoration. || 2
|| No one can do anything by himself, O Siblings of Destiny. He alone obtains the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, unto whom God bestows it. || 3 || Says Nanak, that
humble being who pleases God, he alone finds God, the treasure of virtue. || 4 || 10 ||
15 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Extending His Hand, the Lord protected you in your
mother‟s womb. Renouncing the sublime essence of the Lord, you have tasted the fruit
of poison. || 1 || Meditate, vibrate on the Lord of the Universe, and renounce all
entanglements. When the Messenger of Death comes to murder you, O fool, then your
body will be shattered and helplessly crumble. || 1 || Pause || You hold onto your
body, mind and wealth as your own, and you do not meditate on the Creator Lord, even
for an instant. || 2 || You have fallen into the deep, dark pit of great attachment.
Caught in the illusion of Maya, you have forgotten the Supreme Lord. || 3 || By great
good fortune, one sings the Kirtan of God‟s Praises. In the Society of the Saints, Nanak
has found God. || 4 || 11 || 16 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Mother, father, children,
relatives and siblings — O Nanak, the Supreme Lord is our help and support. || 1 ||
He blesses us with peace, and abundant celestial bliss. Perfect is the Bani, the Word of
the Perfect Guru. His Virtues are so many, they cannot be counted. || 1 || Pause ||
God Himself makes all arrangements. Meditating on God, desires are fulfilled. || 2 ||
He is the Giver of wealth, Dharmic faith, pleasure and liberation. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 806 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Meditating, meditating in remembrance on the Creator Lord, the Architect of Destiny, I
am fulfilled. || 3 || In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak enjoys the
Lord‟s Love. He has returned home, with the Perfect Guru. || 4 || 12 || 17 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: All treasures come from the Perfect Divine Guru. || 1 ||
Pause || Chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, the man lives. The faithless cynic
dies in shame and misery. || 1 || The Name of the Lord has become my Protector.
The wretched, faithless cynic makes only useless efforts. || 2 || Spreading slander,
many have been ruined. Their necks, heads and feet are tied by death‟s noose. || 3 ||
Says Nanak, the humble devotees chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The
Messenger of Death does not even approach them. || 4 || 13 || 18 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, FOURTH HOUSE, DU-PADAS:

What blessed destiny will lead me to meet my God? Each and every moment and
instant, I continually meditate on the Lord. || 1 || I meditate continually on the Lotus
Feet of God. What wisdom will lead me to attain my Beloved? || 1 || Pause ||
Please, bless me with such Mercy, O my God, that Nanak may never, ever forget You.
|| 2 || 1 || 19 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Within my heart, I meditate on the Lotus
Feet of God. Disease is gone, and I have found total peace. || 1 || The Guru relieved
my sufferings, and blessed me with the gift. My birth has been rendered fruitful, and
my life is approved. || 1 || Pause || The Ambrosial Bani of God‟s Word is the
Unspoken Speech. Says Nanak, the spiritually wise live by meditating on God. || 2 || 2
|| 20 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The Guru, the Perfect True Guru, has blessed me
with peace and tranquility. Peace and joy have welled up, and the mystical trumpets of
the unstruck sound current vibrate. || 1 || Pause || Sufferings, sins and afflictions
have been dispelled. Remembering the Lord in meditation, all sinful mistakes have been
erased. || 1 || Joining together, O beautiful soul-brides, celebrate and make merry.
Guru Nanak has saved my honor. || 2 || 3 || 21 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL:
Intoxicated with the wine of attachment, love of worldly possessions and deceit, and
bound in bondage, he is wild and hideous. Day by day, his life is winding down;
practicing sin and corruption, he is trapped by the noose of Death. || 1 || I seek Your
Sanctuary, O God, Merciful to the meek. I have crossed over the terrible, treacherous,
enormous world-ocean, with the dust of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy.
|| 1 || Pause || O God, Giver of peace, All-powerful Lord and Master, my soul, body
and all wealth are Yours. Please, break my bonds of doubt, O Transcendent Lord,
forever Merciful God of Nanak. || 2 || 4 || 22 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The
Transcendent Lord has brought bliss to all; He has confirmed His Natural Way. He has
become Merciful to the humble, holy Saints, and all my relatives blossom forth in joy.
|| 1 || The True Guru Himself has resolved my affairs. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 807 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He has blessed Hargobind with long life, and taken care of my comfort, happiness and
well-being. || 1 || Pause || The forests, meadows and the three worlds have
blossomed forth in greenery; He gives His Support to all beings. Nanak has obtained
the fruits of his mind‟s desires; his desires are totally fulfilled. || 2 || 5 || 23 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: One who is blessed by the Lord‟s Mercy, passes his time in
contemplative meditation. || 1 || Pause || In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, meditate, and vibrate upon the Lord of the Universe. Singing the Glorious Praises
of the Lord, the noose of death is cut away. || 1 || He Himself is the True Guru, and
He Himself is the Cherisher. Nanak begs for the dust of the feet of the Holy. || 2 || 6 ||
24 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Irrigate your mind with the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har. Night and day, sing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. || 1 || Enshrine such love, O
my mind, that twenty-four hours a day, God will seem near to you. || 1 || Pause ||
Says Nanak, one who has such immaculate destiny — his mind is attached to the Lord‟s
Feet. || 2 || 7 || 25 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The disease is gone; God Himself
took it away. I sleep in peace; peaceful poise has come to my home. || 1 || Pause ||
Eat to your fill, O my Siblings of Destiny. Meditate on the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of
the Lord, within your heart. || 1 || Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Perfect
Guru, who has preserved the honor of His Name. || 2 || 8 || 26 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: The True Guru has protected my hearth and home, and made them permanent.
|| Pause || Whoever slanders these homes, is pre-destined by the Creator Lord to be
destroyed. || 1 || Slave Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of God; the Word of His Shabad is
unbreakable and infinite. || 2 || 9 || 27 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The fever and
sickness are gone, and the diseases are all dispelled. The Supreme Lord God has
forgiven you, so enjoy the happiness of the Saints. || Pause || All joys have entered
your world, and your mind and body are free of disease. So chant continuously the
Glorious Praises of the Lord; this is the only potent medicine. || 1 || So come, and
dwell in your home and native land; this is such a blessed and auspicious occasion. O
Nanak, God is totally pleased with you; your time of separation has come to an end. ||
2 || 10 || 28 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The entanglements of Maya do not go along
with anyone. Even kings and rulers must arise and depart, according to the wisdom of
the Saints. || Pause || Pride goes before the fall — this is a primal law. Those who
practice corruption and sin, are born into countless incarnations, only to die again. || 1
|| The Holy Saints chant Words of Truth; they meditate continually on the Lord of the
Universe. Meditating, meditating in remembrance, O Nanak, those who are imbued with
the color of the Lord‟s Love are carried across. || 2 || 11 || 29 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: The Perfect Guru has blessed me with celestial Samaadhi, bliss and peace. God
is always my Helper and Companion; I contemplate His Ambrosial Virtues. || Pause || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 808 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Triumphant cheers greet me all across the world, and all beings yearn for me. The True
Guru and God are totally pleased with me; no obstacle blocks my way. || 1 || One
who has the Merciful Lord God on his side — everyone becomes his slave. Forever and
ever, O Nanak, glorious greatness rests with the Guru. || 2 || 12 || 30 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, FIFTH HOUSE, CHAU-PADAS:

This perishable realm and world has been made like a house of sand. In no time at all,
it is destroyed, like the paper drenched with water. || 1 || Listen to me, people:
behold, and consider this within your mind. The Siddhas, the seekers, house-holders
and Yogis have forsaken their homes and left. || 1 || Pause || This world is like a
dream in the night. All that is seen shall perish. Why are you attached to it, you fool? ||
2 || Where are your brothers and friends? Open your eyes and see! Some have gone,
and some will go; everyone must take his turn. || 3 || Those who serve the Perfect
True Guru, remain ever-stable at the Door of the Lord. Servant Nanak is the Lord‟s
slave; preserve his honor, O Lord, Destroyer of ego. || 4 || 1 || 31 || BILAAVAL,
FIFTH MEHL: The glories of the world, I cast into the fire. I chant those words, by
which I may meet my Beloved. || 1 || When God becomes Merciful, then He enjoins
me to His devotional service. My mind clings to worldly desires; meeting with the Guru,
I have renounced them. || 1 || Pause || I pray with intense devotion, and offer this
soul to Him. I would sacrifice all other riches, for a moment‟s union with my Beloved. ||
2 || Through the Guru, I am rid of the five villains, as well as emotional love and hate.
My heart is illumined, and the Lord has become manifest; night and day, I remain
awake and aware. || 3 || The blessed soul-bride seeks His Sanctuary; her destiny is
recorded on her forehead. Says Nanak, she obtains her Husband Lord; her body and
mind are cooled and soothed. || 4 || 2 || 32 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: One is dyed
in the color of the Lord‟s Love, by great good fortune. This color is never muddied; no
stain ever sticks to it. || 1 || He finds God, the Giver of peace, with feelings of joy.
The Celestial Lord blends into his soul, and he can never leave Him. || 1 || Pause ||
Old age and death cannot touch him, and he shall not suffer pain again. Drinking in the
Ambrosial Nectar, he is satisfied; the Guru makes him immortal. || 2 || He alone
knows its taste, who tastes the Priceless Name of the Lord. Its value cannot be
estimated; what can I say with my mouth? || 3 || Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of
Your Darshan, O Supreme Lord God.
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 809 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Word of Your Bani is the treasure of virtue. Please bless me with the dust of the
feet of Your slaves; Nanak is a sacrifice. || 4 || 3 || 33 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL:
Keep me under Your Protection, God; shower me with Your Mercy. I do not know how
to serve You; I am just a low-life fool. || 1 || I take pride in You, O my Darling
Beloved. I am a sinner, continuously making mistakes; You are the Forgiving Lord. || 1
|| Pause || I make mistakes each and every day. You are the Great Giver; I am
worthless. I associate with Maya, your hand-maiden, and I renounce You, God; such
are my actions. || 2 || You bless me with everything, showering me with Mercy; And I
am such an ungrateful wretch! I am attached to Your gifts, but I do not even think of
You, O my Lord and Master. || 3 || There is none other than You, O Lord, Destroyer
of fear. Says Nanak, I have come to Your Sanctuary, O Merciful Guru; I am so foolish —
please, save me! || 4 || 4 || 34 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Don‟t blame anyone
else; meditate on your God. Serving Him, great peace is obtained; O mind, sing His
Praises. || 1 || O Beloved, other than You, who else should I ask? You are my
Merciful Lord and Master; I am filled with all faults. || 1 || Pause || As You keep me,
I remain; there is no other way. You are the Support of the unsupported; You Name is
my only Support. || 2 || One who accepts whatever You do as good — that mind is
liberated. The entire creation is Yours; all are subject to Your Ways. || 3 || I wash
Your Feet and serve You, if it pleases You, O Lord and Master. Be Merciful, O God of
Compassion, that Nanak may sing Your Glorious Praises. || 4 || 5 || 35 || BILAAVAL,
FIFTH MEHL: Death hovers over his head, laughing, but the beast does not
understand. Entangled in conflict, pleasure and egotism, he does not even think of
death. || 1 || So serve your True Guru; why wander around miserable and
unfortunate? You gaze upon the transitory, beautiful safflower, but why do you get
attached to it? || 1 || Pause || You commit sins again and again, to gather wealth to
spend. But your dust shall mix with dust; you shall arise and depart naked. || 2 ||
Those for whom you work, will become your spiteful enemies. In the end, they will run
away from you; why do you burn for them in anger? || 3 || He alone becomes the
dust of the Lord‟s slaves, who has such good karma upon his forehead. Says Nanak, he
is released from bondage, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. || 4 || 6 || 36 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The cripple crosses over the mountain, the fool becomes a
wise man, and the blind man sees the three worlds, by meeting with the True Guru and
being purified. || 1 || This is the Glory of the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;
listen, O my friends. Filth is washed away, millions of sins are dispelled, and the
consciousness becomes immaculate and pure. || 1 || Pause || Such is devotional
worship of the Lord of the Universe, that the ant can overpower the elephant. Whoever
the Lord makes His own, is blessed with the gift of fearlessness. || 2 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 810 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The lion becomes a cat, and the mountain looks like a blade of grass. Those who
worked for half a shell, will be judged very wealthy. || 3 || What glorious greatness of
Yours can I describe, O Lord of infinite excellences? Please bless me with Your Mercy,
and grant me Your Name; O Nanak, I am lost without the Blessed Vision of Your
Darshan. || 4 || 7 || 37 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: He is constantly entangled in
pride, conflict, greed and tasty flavors. He is involved in deception, fraud, household
affairs and corruption. || 1 || I have seen this with my eyes, by the Grace of the
Perfect Guru. Power, property, wealth and youth are useless, without the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || Beauty, incense, scented oils, beautiful clothes
and foods — when they come into contact with the body of the sinner, they stink. || 2
|| Wandering, wandering around, the soul is reincarnated as a human, but this body
lasts only for an instant. Losing this opportunity, he must wander again through
countless incarnations. || 3 || By God‟s Grace, he meets the Guru; contemplating the
Lord, Har, Har, he is wonderstruck. He is blessed with peace, poise and bliss, O Nanak,
through the perfect sound current of the Naad. || 4 || 8 || 38 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: The feet of the Saints are the boat, to cross over the world-ocean. In the
wilderness, the Guru places them on the Path, and reveals the secrets of the Lord‟s
Mystery. || 1 || O Lord, Har Har Har, Har Har Haray, Har Har Har, I love You. While
standing up, sitting down and sleeping, think of the Lord, Har Har Har. || 1 || Pause
|| The five thieves run away, when one joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. His investment is intact, and he earns great profits; his household is blessed with
honor. || 2 || His position is unmoving and eternal, his anxiety is ended, and he sees
God everywhere. || 3 || The Virtues of our Virtuous Lord and Master are so profound;
how many of His Glorious Virtues should I speak? Nanak has obtained the Ambrosial
Nectar of the Lord, Har, Har, in the Company of the Holy. || 4 || 9 || 39 || BILAAVAL,
FIFTH MEHL: That life, which has no contact with the Holy, is useless. Joining their
congregation, all doubts are dispelled, and I am emancipated. || 1 || That day, when
I meet with the Holy — I am a sacrifice to that day. Again and again, I sacrifice my
body, mind and soul to them. || 1 || Pause || They have helped me renounce this
ego, and implant this humility within myself. This mind has become the dust of all
men‟s feet, and my self-conceit has been dispelled. || 2 || In an instant, I burnt away
the ideas of slander and ill-will towards others. I see close at hand, the Lord of mercy
and compassion; He is not far away at all. || 3 || My body and mind are cooled and
soothed, and now, I am liberated from the world. Love, consciousness, the breath of
life, wealth and everything, O Nanak, are in the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan. ||
4 || 10 || 40 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: I perform service for Your slave, O Lord,
and wipe his feet with my hair. I offer my head to him, and listen to the Glorious
Praises of the Lord, the source of bliss. || 1 || Meeting You, my mind is rejuvenated,
so please meet me, O Merciful Lord. Night and day, my mind enjoys bliss,
contemplating the Lord of Compassion. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 811 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || Pause || God‟s Holy people are the saviors of the world; I grab hold of the
hem of their robes. Bless me, O God, with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints.
|| 2 || I have no skill or wisdom at all, nor any work to my credit. Please, protect me
from doubt, fear and emotional attachment, and cut away the noose of Death from my
neck. || 3 || I beg of You, O Lord of Mercy, O my Father, please cherish me! I sing
Your Glorious Praises, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Lord, Home of
peace. || 4 || 11 || 41 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Whatever You wish, You do.
Without You, there is nothing. Gazing upon Your Glory, the Messenger of Death leaves
and goes away. || 1 || By Your Grace, one is emancipated, and egotism is dispelled.
God is omnipotent, possessing all powers; He is obtained through the Perfect, Divine
Guru. || 1 || Pause || Searching, searching, searching — without the Naam,
everything is false. All the comforts of life are found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company
of the Holy; God is the Fulfiller of desires. || 2 || Whatever You attach me to, to that I
am attached; I have burnt away all my cleverness. You are permeating and pervading
everywhere, O my Lord, Merciful to the meek. || 3 || I ask for everything from You,
but only the very fortunate ones obtain it. This is Nanak‟s prayer, O God, I live by
singing Your Glorious Praises. || 4 || 12 || 42 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Dwelling in
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, all sinful residues are erased. One who is
attuned to the Love of God, is not cast into the womb of reincarnation. || 1 ||
Chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe, the tongue becomes holy. The mind
and body become immaculate and pure, chanting the Chant of the Guru. || 1 || Pause
|| Tasting the subtle essence of the Lord, one is satisfied; receiving this essence, the
mind becomes happy. The intellect is brightened and illuminated; turning away from
the world, the heart-lotus blossoms forth. || 2 || He is cooled and soothed, peaceful
and content; all his thirst is quenched. The mind‟s wandering in the ten directions is
stopped, and one dwells in the immaculate place. || 3 || The Savior Lord saves him,
and his doubts are burnt to ashes. Nanak is blessed with the treasure of the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. He finds peace, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Saints‟
Darshan. || 4 || 13 || 43 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Carry water for the Lord‟s
slave, wave the fan over him, and grind his corn; then, you shall be happy. Burn in the
fire your power, property and authority. || 1 || Grasp hold of the feet of the servant
of the humble Saints. Renounce and abandon the wealthy, the regal overlords and
kings. || 1 || Pause || The dry bread of the Saints is equal to all treasures. The
thirty-six tasty dishes of the faithless cynic, are just like poison. || 2 || Wearing the
old blankets of the humble devotees, one is not naked. But by putting on the silk
clothes of the faithless cynic, one loses one‟s honor. || 3 || Friendship with the
faithless cynic breaks down mid-way. But whoever serves the humble servants of the
Lord, is emancipated here and hereafter. || 4 || Everything comes from You, O Lord;
You Yourself created the creation. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 812 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Blessed with the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the Holy, Nanak sings the Glorious
Praises of the Lord. || 5 || 14 || 44 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: With my ears, I listen
to the Lord, Har, Har; I sing the Praises of my Lord and Master. I place my hands and
my head upon the feet of the Saints, and meditate on the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || Be
kind to me, O Merciful God, and bless me with this wealth and success. Obtaining the
dust of the feet of the Saints, I apply it to my forehead. || 1 || Pause || I am the
lowest of the low, absolutely the lowest; I offer my humble prayer. I wash their feet,
and renounce my self-conceit; I merge in the Saints‟ Congregation. || 2 || With each
and every breath, I never forget the Lord; I never go to another. Obtaining the Fruitful
Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan, I discard my pride and attachment. || 3 || I am
embellished with truth, contentment, compassion and Dharmic faith. My spiritual
marriage is fruitful, O Nanak; I am pleasing to my God. || 4 || 15 || 45 || BILAAVAL,
FIFTH MEHL: The words of the Holy are eternal and unchanging; this is apparent to
everyone. That humble being, who joins the Saadh Sangat, meets the Sovereign Lord.
|| 1 || This faith in the Lord of the Universe, and peace, are found by meditating on
the Lord. Everyone is speaking in various ways, but the Guru has brought the Lord into
the home of my self. || 1 || Pause || He preserves the honor of those who seek His
Sanctuary; there is no doubt about this at all. In the field of actions and karma, plant
the Lord‟s Name; this opportunity is so difficult to obtain! || 2 || God Himself is the
Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts; He does, and causes everything to be done. He
purifies so many sinners; this is the natural way of our Lord and Master. || 3 || Don‟t
be fooled, O mortal being, by the illusion of Maya. O Nanak, God saves the honor of
those of whom He approves. || 4 || 16 || 46 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: He
fashioned you from clay, and made your priceless body. He covers the many faults in
your mind, and makes you look immaculate and pure. || 1 || So why do you forget
God from your mind? He has done so many good things for you. One who forsakes
God, and blends himself with another, in the end is blended with dust. || 1 || Pause ||
Meditate, meditate in remembrance with each and every breath — do not delay!
Renounce worldly affairs, and merge yourself into God; forsake false loves. || 2 || He
is many, and He is One; He takes part in the many plays. This is as He is, and shall be.
So serve that Supreme Lord God, and accept the Guru‟s Teachings. || 3 || God is said
to be the highest of the high, the greatest of all, our companion. Please, let Nanak be
the slave of the slave of Your slaves. || 4 || 17 || 47 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The
Lord of the Universe is my only Support. I have renounced all other hopes. God is Allpowerful, above all; He is the perfect treasure of virtue. || 1 || The Naam, the Name
of the Lord, is the Support of the humble servant who seeks God‟s Sanctuary. In their
minds, the Saints take the Support of the Transcendent Lord. || 1 || Pause || He
Himself preserves, and He Himself gives. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 813 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He Himself cherishes. Merciful to the meek, the treasure of mercy, He remembers and
protects us with each and every breath. || 2 || Whatever the Creator Lord does is
glorious and great. The Perfect Guru has instructed me, that peace comes by the Will of
our Lord and Master. || 3 || Anxieties, worries and calculations are dismissed; the
Lord‟s humble servant accepts the Hukam of His Command. He does not die, and He
does not leave; Nanak is attuned to His Love. || 4 || 18 || 48 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: The great fire is put out and cooled; meeting with the Guru, sins run away. I fell
into the deep dark pit; giving me His Hand, He pulled me out. || 1 || He is my friend;
I am the dust of His Feet. Meeting with Him, I am at peace; He blesses me with the gift
of the soul. || 1 || Pause || I have now received my pre-ordained destiny. Dwelling
with the Lord‟s Holy Saints, my hopes are fulfilled. || 2 || The fear of the three worlds
is dispelled, and I have found my place of rest and peace. The all-powerful Guru has
taken pity upon me, and the Naam has come to dwell in my mind. || 3 || O God, You
are the Anchor and Support of Nanak. He is the Doer, the Cause of causes; the Allpowerful Lord God is inaccessible and infinite. || 4 || 19 || 49 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: One who forgets God is filthy, poor and low. The fool does not understand the
Creator Lord; instead, he thinks that he himself is the doer. || 1 || Pain comes, when
one forgets Him. Peace comes when one remembers God. This is the way the Saints
are in bliss — they continually sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
The high, He makes low, and the low, he elevates in an instant. The value of the glory
of our Lord and Master cannot be estimated. || 2 || While he gazes upon beautiful
dramas and plays, the day of his departure dawns. The dream becomes the dream, and
his actions do not go along with him. || 3 || God is All-powerful, the Cause of causes;
I seek Your Sanctuary. Day and night, Nanak meditates on the Lord; forever and ever
he is a sacrifice. || 4 || 20 || 50 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: I carry water on my
head, and with my hands I wash their feet. Tens of thousands of times, I am a sacrifice
to them; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, I live. || 1 || The hopes
which I cherish in my mind — my God fulfills them all. With my broom, I sweep the
homes of the Holy Saints, and wave the fan over them. || 1 || Pause || The Saints
chant the Ambrosial Praises of the Lord; I listen, and my mind drinks it in. That sublime
essence calms and soothes me, and quenches the fire of sin and corruption. || 2 ||
When the galaxy of Saints worship the Lord in devotion, I join them, singing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. I bow in reverence to the humble devotees, and apply the
dust of their feet to my face. || 3 || Sitting down and standing up, I chant the Naam,
the Name of the Lord; this is what I do. This is Nanak‟s prayer to God, that he may

there is nowhere else for them to go. O God, Your Name is my power, realm, relatives

rot in their slander; they are seized by the Messenger of Death. || 1 || Pause || The
Saints meditate on the One Lord, and no other. They offer their prayers to the One
Lord, who is pervading and permeating all places. || 2 || I have heard this old story,
spoken by the devotees, that all the wicked are cut apart into pieces, while His humble

holds all power in His hands. No other actions will bring release; save me, O my Lord
and Master. || 1 || I have entered Your Sanctuary, O Perfect Lord of Mercy. Those
whom You preserve and protect, O Lord of the Universe, are saved from the trap of the
world. || 1 || Pause || Hope, doubt, corruption and emotional attachment — in
these, he is engrossed. The false material world abides in his mind, and he does not
understand the Supreme Lord God. || 2 || O Perfect Lord of Supreme Light, all beings
belong to You. As You keep us, we live, O infinite, inaccessible God. || 3 || Cause of
causes, All-powerful Lord God, please bless me with Your Name. Nanak is carried across

Har, Har. || 4 || 27 || 57 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Who? Who has not fallen, by
placing their hopes in you? You are enticed by the great enticer — this is the way to
hell! || 1 || O vicious mind, no faith can be placed in you; you are totally intoxicated.
The donkey‟s leash is only removed, after the load is placed on his back. || 1 || Pause
|| You destroy the value of chanting, intensive meditation and self-discipline; you shall
suffer in pain, beaten by the Messenger of Death. You do not meditate, so you shall
suffer the pains of reincarnation, you shameless buffoon! || 2 || The Lord is your
Companion, your Helper, your Best Friend; but you disagree with Him. You are in love
with the five thieves; this brings terrible pain. || 3 || Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of

Nectar. || 1 || Pause || All beings and creatures dwell in peace; the minds of all
yearn for the Lord. Those who continually remember the Lord, do good deeds for
others; they harbor no ill will towards anyone. || 2 ||

forget the Lord; He is the Master of the masterless. Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of
God; everything is in His hands. || 4 || 29 || 59 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The One
who bound you in the womb and then released you, placed you in the world of joy.
Contemplate His Lotus Feet forever, and you shall be cooled and soothed. || 1 || In
life and in death, this Maya is of no use. He created this creation, but rare are those
who enshrine love for Him. || 1 || Pause || O mortal, the Creator Lord made
summer and winter; He saves you from the heat. From the ant, He makes an elephant;
He reunites those who have been separated. || 2 || Eggs, wombs, sweat and earth —
these are God‟s workshops of creation. It is fruitful for all to practice contemplation of
the Lord. || 3 || I cannot do anything; O God, I seek the Sanctuary of the Holy. Guru
Nanak pulled me up, out of the deep, dark pit, the intoxication of attachment. || 4 ||

searching, in the woods and other places. He is undeceivable, imperishable and
inscrutable; such is my Lord God. || 1 || When shall I behold my God, and delight my
soul? Even better than being awake, is the dream in which I dwell with God. || 1 ||

stages of life, I grow thirsty for the Blessed Vision of the Lord. He has no form or
outline, and He is not made of the five elements; our Lord and Master is imperishable.
|| 2 || How rare are those Saints and great Yogis, who describe the beautiful form of
the Lord. Blessed, blessed are they, whom the Lord meets in His Mercy. || 3 || They
know that He is deep within, and outside as well; their doubts are dispelled. O Nanak,
God meets those, whose karma is perfect. || 4 || 31 || 61 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL:
All beings and creatures are totally pleased, gazing on God‟s glorious radiance. The True
Guru has paid off my debt; He Himself did it. || 1 || Eating and expending it, it is
always available; the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is inexhaustible. Everything is perfectly
arranged; it is never exhausted. || 1 || Pause || In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
of the Holy, I worship and adore the Lord, the infinite treasure. He does not hesitate to
bless me with Dharmic faith, wealth, sexual success and liberation. || 2 || The
devotees worship and adore the Lord of the Universe with single-minded love. They
gather in the wealth of the Lord‟s Name, which cannot be estimated. || 3 || O God, I
seek Your Sanctuary, the glorious greatness of God. Nanak: Your end or limitation
cannot be found, O Infinite World-Lord. || 4 || 32 || 62 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL:

The Shabad, the Word of the True Guru, is the light of the lamp. It dispels the darkness

forever unlimited. Says Nanak, He is the highest of the high. || 4 || 1 || 87 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Without the Lord, nothing is of any use. You are totally
attached to that Enticer Maya; she is enticing you. || 1 || Pause || You shall have to
leave behind your gold, your woman and your beautiful bed; you shall have to depart in
an instant. You are entangled in the lures of sexual pleasures, and you are eating
poisonous drugs. || 1 || You have built and adorned a palace of straw, and under it,
you light a fire. Sitting all puffed-up in such a castle, you stubborn-minded fool, what do
you think you will gain? || 2 || The five thieves stand over your head and seize you. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 822 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Grabbing you by your hair, they will drive you on. You do not see them, you blind and
ignorant fool; intoxicated with ego, you just keep sleeping. || 3 || The net has been
spread out, and the bait has been scattered; like a bird, you are being trapped. Says
Nanak, my bonds have been broken; I meditate on the True Guru, the Primal Being. ||
4 || 2 || 88 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is infinite
and priceless. It is the Beloved of my breath of life, and the Support of my mind; I
remember it, as the betel leaf chewer remembers the betel leaf. || 1 || Pause || I
have been absorbed in celestial bliss, following the Guru‟s Teachings; my body-garment
is imbued with the Lord‟s Love. I come face to face with my Beloved, by great good
fortune; my Husband Lord never wavers. || 1 || I do not need any image, or incense,
or perfume, or lamps; through and through, He is blossoming forth, with me, life and
limb. Says Nanak, my Husband Lord has ravished and enjoyed His soul-bride; my bed
has become very beautiful and sublime. || 2 || 3 || 89 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL:
Chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe, Gobind, Gobind, Gobind, we become
like Him. Since I met the compassionate, Holy Saints, my evil-mindedness has been
driven far away. || 1 || Pause || The Perfect Lord is perfectly pervading everywhere.
He is cool and calm, peaceful and compassionate. Sexual desire, anger and egotistical
desires have all been eliminated from my body. || 1 || Truth, contentment,
compassion, Dharmic faith and purity — I have received these from the Teachings of
the Saints. Says Nanak, one who realizes this in his mind, achieves total understanding.
|| 2 || 4 || 90 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: What am I? Just a poor living being. I
cannot even describe one of Your hairs, O Lord. Even Brahma, Shiva, the Siddhas and
the silent sages do not know Your State, O Infinite Lord and Master. || 1 || What can
I say? I cannot say anything. Wherever I look, I see the Lord pervading. || 1 || Pause
|| And there, where the most terrible tortures are heard to be inflicted by the
Messenger of Death, You are my only help and support, O my God. I have sought His
Sanctuary, and grasped hold of the Lord‟s Lotus Feet; God has helped Guru Nanak to
understand this understanding. || 2 || 5 || 91 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: O
Inaccessible, Beautiful, Imperishable Creator Lord, Purifier of sinners, let me meditate
on You, even for an instant. O Wondrous Lord, I have heard that You are found by
meeting the Saints, and focusing the mind on their feet, their holy feet. || 1 || In
what way, and by what discipline, is He obtained? Tell me, O good man, by what means
can we meditate on Him? || 1 || Pause || If one human being serves another human
being, the one served stands by him. Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary and Protection, O
Lord, ocean of peace; He takes the Support of Your Name alone. || 2 || 6 || 92 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: I seek the Sanctuary of the Saints, and I serve the Saints. I
am rid of all worldly concerns, bonds, entanglements and other affairs. || 1 || Pause
|| I have obtained peace, poise and great bliss from the Guru, through the Lord‟s
Name. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 823 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Such is the sublime essence of the Lord, that I cannot describe it. The Perfect Guru has
turned me away from the world. || 1 || I behold the Fascinating Lord with everyone.
No one is without Him — He is pervading everywhere. The Perfect Lord, the treasure of
mercy, is permeating everywhere. Says Nanak, I am fully fulfilled. || 2 || 7 || 93 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: What does the mind say? What can I say? You are wise and
all-knowing, O God, my Lord and Master; what can I say to You? || 1 || Pause ||
You know even what is not said, whatever is in the soul. O mind, why do you deceive
others? How long will you do this? The Lord is with you; He hears and sees everything.
|| 1 || Knowing this, my mind has become blissful; there is no other Creator. Says
Nanak, the Guru has become kind to me; my love for the Lord shall never wear off. ||
2 || 8 || 94 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Thus, the slanderer crumbles away. This is
the distinctive sign — listen, O Siblings of Destiny: he collapses like a wall of sand. || 1
|| Pause || When the slanderer sees a fault in someone else, he is pleased. Seeing
goodness, he is depressed. Twenty-four hours a day, he plots, but nothing works. The
evil man dies, constantly thinking up evil plans. || 1 || The slanderer forgets God,
death approaches him, and he starts to argue with the humble servant of the Lord. God
Himself, the Lord and Master, is Nanak‟s protector. What can any wretched person do
to him? || 2 || 9 || 95 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Why do you wander in delusion
like this? You act, and incite others to act, and then deny it. The Lord is always with
you; He sees and hears everything. || 1 || Pause || You purchase glass, and discard
gold; you are in love with your enemy, while you renounce your true friend. That which
exists, seems bitter; that which does not exist, seems sweet to you. Engrossed in
corruption, you are burning away. || 1 || The mortal has fallen into the deep, dark pit,
and is entangled in the darkness of doubt, and the bondage of emotional attachment.
Says Nanak, when God becomes merciful, one meets with the Guru, who takes him by
the arm, and lifts him out. || 2 || 10 || 96 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: With my mind,
body and tongue, I remember the Lord. I am in ecstasy, and my anxieties are dispelled;
the Guru has blessed me with total peace. || 1 || Pause || My ignorance has been
totally transformed into wisdom. My God is wise and all-knowing. Giving me His Hand,
He saved me, and now no one can harm me at all. || 1 || I am a sacrifice to the
Blessed Vision of the Holy; by their Grace, I contemplate the Lord‟s Name. Says Nanak,
I place my faith in my Lord and Master; within my mind, I do not believe in any other,
even for an instant. || 2 || 11 || 97 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The Perfect Guru has
has saved me. He has enshrined the Ambrosial Name of the Lord within my heart, and
the filth of countless incarnations has been washed away. || 1 || Pause || The
demons and wicked enemies are driven out, by meditating, and chanting the Chant of
the Perfect Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 824 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
What can any wretched creature do to me? The radiance of my God is gloriously great.
|| 1 || Meditating, meditating, meditating in remembrance, I have found peace; I have
enshrined His Lotus Feet within my mind. Slave Nanak has entered His Sanctuary; there
is none above Him. || 2 || 12 || 98 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Forever and ever,
chant the Name of God. The pains of old age and death shall not afflict you, and in the
Court of the Lord hereafter, your affairs shall be perfectly resolved. || 1 || Pause ||
So forsake your self-conceit, and ever seek Sanctuary. This treasure is obtained only
from the Guru. The noose of birth and death is snapped; this is the insignia, the
hallmark, of the Court of the True Lord. || 1 || Whatever You do, I accept as good. I
have eradicated all egotistical pride from my mind. Says Nanak, I am under His
protection; He created the entire Universe. || 2 || 13 || 99 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: Deep within the nucleus of his mind and body, is God. He continually sings the
Glorious Praises of the Lord, and always does good for others; his tongue is priceless.
|| 1 || Pause || All his generations are redeemed and saved in an instant, and the
filth of countless incarnations is washed away. Meditating, meditating in remembrance
on God, his Lord and Master, he passes blissfully through the forest of poison. || 1 ||
I have obtained the boat of God‟s Feet, to carry me across the terrifying world-ocean.
The Saints, servants and devotees belong to the Lord; Nanak‟s mind is attached to Him.
|| 2 || 14 || 100 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: I am reassured, gazing upon Your
wondrous play. You are my Lord and Master, the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts;
You dwell with the Holy Saints. || 1 || Pause || In an instant, our Lord and Master
establishes and exalts. From a lowly worm, He creates a king. || 1 || May I never
forget You from my heart; slave Nanak prays for this blessing. || 2 || 15 || 101 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The imperishable Lord God is worthy of worship and
adoration. Dedicating my mind and body, I place them before the Lord, the Cherisher of
all beings. || 1 || Pause || His Sanctuary is All-powerful; He cannot be described; He
is the Giver of peace, the ocean of mercy, supremely compassionate. Holding him close
in His embrace, the Lord protects and saves him, and then even the hot wind cannot
touch him. || 1 || Our Merciful Lord and Master is wealth, property and everything to
His humble Saints. Nanak, a beggar, asks for the Blessed Vision of God‟s Darshan;
please, bless him with the dust of the feet of the Saints. || 2 || 16 || 102 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is equal to
millions of efforts. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord, and the Messenger of Death will be frightened away. || 1
|| Pause || To enshrine the Feet of God in one‟s mind and body, is to perform all
sorts of acts of atonement. Coming and going, doubt and fear have run away, and the
sins of countless incarnations are burnt away. || 1 || So become fearless, and vibrate
upon the Lord of the Universe. This is true wealth, obtained only by great good fortune. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 825 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Be merciful, O Perfect God, Great Giver, that slave Nanak may chant Your immaculate
Praises. || 2 || 17 || 103 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The Lord saved me from Sulhi
Khan. The emperor did not succeed in his plot, and he died in disgrace. || 1 || Pause
|| The Lord and Master raised His axe, and chopped off his head; in an instant, he was
reduced to dust. || 1 || Plotting and planning evil, he was destroyed. The One who
created him, gave him a push. Of his sons, friends and wealth, nothing remains; he
departed, leaving behind all his brothers and relatives. Says Nanak, I am a sacrifice to
God, who fulfilled the word of His slave. || 2 || 18 || 104 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL:
Perfect is service to the Perfect Guru. Our Lord and Master Himself is Himself allpervading. The Divine Guru has resolved all my affairs. || 1 || Pause || In the
beginning, in the middle and in the end, God is our only Lord and Master. He Himself
fashioned His Creation. He Himself saves His servant. Great is the glorious grandeur of
my God! || 1 || The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord is the True Guru; all
beings are in His power. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of His Lotus Feet, chanting the
Lord‟s Name, the immaculate Mantra. || 2 || 19 || 105 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL:
He Himself protects me from suffering and sin. Falling at the Guru‟s Feet, I am cooled
and soothed; I meditate on the Lord‟s Name within my heart. || 1 || Pause ||
Granting His Mercy, God has extended His Hands. He is the Emancipator of the World;
His glorious radiance pervades the nine continents. My pain has been dispelled, and
peace and pleasure have come; my desire is quenched, and my mind and body are
truly satisfied. || 1 || He is the Master of the masterless, All-powerful to give
Sanctuary. He is the Mother and Father of the whole Universe. He is the Lover of His
devotees, the Destroyer of fear; Nanak sings and chants the Glorious Praises of his Lord
and Master. || 2 || 20 || 106 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Acknowledge the One, from
whom You originated. Meditating on the Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord, I
have found peace, pleasure and salvation. || 1 || Pause || I met the Perfect Guru,
by great good fortune, and so found the wise and all-knowing Lord, the Inner-knower,
the Searcher of hearts. He gave me His Hand, and making me His own, He saved me;
He is absolutely all-powerful, the honor of the dishonored. || 1 || Doubt and fear
have been dispelled in an instant, and in the darkness, the Divine Light shines forth.
With each and every breath, Nanak worships and adores the Lord; forever and ever, I
am a sacrifice to Him. || 2 || 21 || 107 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Both here and
hereafter, the Mighty Guru protects me. God has embellished this world and the next
for me, and all my affairs are perfectly resolved. || 1 || Pause || Chanting the Name
of the Lord, Har, Har, I have found peace and poise, bathing in the dust of the feet of
the Holy. Comings and goings have ceased, and I have found stability; the pains of
birth and death are eradicated. || 1 || I cross over the ocean of doubt and fear, and
the fear of death is gone; the One Lord is permeating and pervading in each and every
heart. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 826 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Nanak has entered the Sanctuary of the Destroyer of pain; I behold His Presence deep
within, and all around as well. || 2 || 22 || 108 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Gazing
upon the Blessed Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan, all pains run away. Please, never leave
my vision, O Lord; please abide with my soul. || 1 || Pause || My Beloved Lord and
Master is the Support of the breath of life. God, the Inner-knower, is all-pervading. || 1
|| Which of Your Glorious Virtues should I contemplate and remember? With each and
every breath, O God, I remember You. || 2 || God is the ocean of mercy, merciful to
the meek; He cherishes all beings and creatures. || 3 || Twenty-four hours a day,
Your humble servant chants Your Name. You Yourself, O God, have inspired Nanak to
love You. || 4 || 23 || 109 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Body, wealth and youth pass
away. You have not meditated and vibrated upon the Lord‟s Name; while you commit
your sins of corruption in the night, the light of day dawns upon you. || 1 || Pause ||
Continually eating all sorts of foods, the teeth in your mouth crumble, decay and fall
out. Living in egotism and possessiveness, you are deluded; committing sins, you have
no kindness for others. || 1 || The great sins are the terrible ocean of pain; the
mortal is engrossed in them. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of his Lord and Master; taking
him by the arm, God has lifted him up and out. || 2 || 24 || 110 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: God Himself has come into my consciousness. My enemies and opponents have
grown weary of attacking me, and now, I have become happy, O my friends and
Siblings of Destiny. || 1 || Pause || The disease is gone, and all misfortunes have
been averted; the Creator Lord has made me His own. I have found peace, tranquility
and total bliss, enshrining the Name of my Beloved Lord within my heart. || 1 || My
soul, body and wealth are all Your capital; O God, You are my All-powerful Lord and
Master. You are the Saving Grace of Your slaves; slave Nanak is forever Your slave. ||
2 || 25 || 111 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Meditating in remembrance on the Lord of
the Universe, I am emancipated. Suffering is eradicated, and true peace has come,
meditating on the Inner-knower, the Searcher of hearts. || 1 || Pause || All beings
belong to Him — He makes them happy. He is the true power of His humble devotees.
He Himself saves and protects His slaves, who believe in their Creator, the Destroyer of
fear. || 1 || I have found friendship, and hatred has been eradicated; the Lord has
rooted out the enemies and villains. Nanak has been blessed with celestial peace and
poise and total bliss; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, he lives. || 2 || 26 ||
112 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: The Supreme Lord God has become Merciful. The
True Guru has arranged all my affairs; chanting and meditating with the Holy Saints, I
have become happy. || 1 || Pause || God has made me His own, and all my
enemies have been reduced to dust. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 827 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He hugs us close in His embrace, and protects His humble servants; attaching us to the
hem of His robe, he saves us. || 1 || Safe and sound, we have returned home, while
the slanderer‟s face is blackened. Says Nanak, my True Guru is Perfect; by the Grace of
God and Guru, I am so happy. || 2 || 27 || 113 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: I have
fallen in love with my Beloved Lord. || Pause || Cutting it, it does not break, and
releasing it, it does not let go. Such is the string the Lord has tied me with. || 1 ||
Day and night, He dwells within my mind; please bless me with Your Mercy, O my God.
|| 2 || I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to my beauteous Lord; I have heard his Unspoken
Speech and Story. || 3 || Servant Nanak is said to be the slave of His slaves; O my
Lord and Master, please bless me with Your Mercy. || 4 || 28 || 114 || BILAAVAL,
FIFTH MEHL: I meditate on the Lord‟s Feet; I am a sacrifice to Them. My Guru is the
Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent Lord; I enshrine Him within my heart, and
meditate on Him within my mind. || 1 || Pause || Meditate, meditate, meditate in
remembrance on the Giver of peace, who created the whole Universe. With your
tongue, savor the One Lord, and you shall be honored in the Court of the True Lord. ||
1 || He alone obtains this treasure, who joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. O Lord and Master, mercifully bless Nanak with this gift, that he may ever sing the
Glorious Praises of Your Kirtan. || 2 || 29 || 115 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: I have
been saved, in the Sanctuary of the True Guru. I am cheered and applauded
throughout the world; my Supreme Lord God carries me across. || 1 || Pause || The
Perfect Lord fills the Universe; He is the Giver of peace; He cherishes and fulfills the
whole Universe. He is completely filling all places and interspaces; I am a devoted
sacrifice to the Lord‟s Feet. || 1 || The ways of all beings are in Your Power, O my
Lord and Master. All supernatural spiritual powers are Yours; You are the Creator, the
Cause of causes. In the beginning, and throughout the ages, God is our Savior and
Protector; remembering the Lord in meditation, O Nanak, fear is eliminated. || 2 || 30
|| 116 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, DU-PADAS, EIGHTH HOUSE:

I am nothing, God; everything is Yours. In this world, You are the absolute, formless
Lord; in the world hereafter, You are the related Lord of form. You play it both ways, O
my Lord and Master. || 1 || Pause || You exist within the city, and beyond it as well;
O my God, You are everywhere. You Yourself are the King, and You Yourself are the
subject. In one place, You are the Lord and Master, and in another place, You are the
slave. || 1 || From whom should I hide? Whom should I try to deceive? Wherever I
look, I see Him near at hand. I have met with Guru Nanak, the Embodiment of the Holy
Saints. When the drop of water merges into the ocean, it cannot be distinguished as
separate again. || 2 || 1 || 117 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 828 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
You are the all-powerful Cause of causes. Please cover my faults, Lord of the Universe,
O my Guru; I am a sinner — I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. || 1 || Pause ||
Whatever we do, You see and know; there is no way anyone can stubbornly deny this.
Your glorious radiance is great! So I have heard, O God. Millions of sins are destroyed
by Your Name. || 1 || It is my nature to make mistakes, forever and ever; it is Your
Natural Way to save sinners. You are the embodiment of kindness, and the treasure of
compassion, O Merciful Lord; through the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, Nanak has
found the state of redemption in life. || 2 || 2 || 118 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL:
Bless me with such mercy, Lord, that my forehead may touch the feet of the Saints, and
my eyes may behold the Blessed Vision of their Darshan, and my body may fall at the
dust of their feet. || 1 || Pause || May the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad abide within
my heart, and the Lord‟s Name be enshrined within my mind. Drive out the five thieves,
O my Lord and Master, and let my doubts all burn like incense. || 1 || Whatever You
do, I accept as good; I have driven out the sense of duality. You are Nanak‟s God, the
Great Giver; in the Congregation of the Saints, emancipate me. || 2 || 3 || 119 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: I ask for such advice from Your humble servants, that I may
meditate on You, and love You, and serve You, and become part and parcel of Your
Being. || 1 || Pause || I serve His humble servants, and speak with them, and abide
with them. I apply the dust of the feet of His humble servants to my face and forehead;
my hopes, and the many waves of desire, are fulfilled. || 1 || Immaculate and pure
are the praises of the humble servants of the Supreme Lord God; the feet of His
humble servants are equal to millions of sacred shrines of pilgrimage. Nanak bathes in
the dust of the feet of His humble servants; the sinful resides of countless incarnations
have been washed away. || 2 || 4 || 120 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: If it pleases
You, then cherish me. O Supreme Lord God, Transcendent Lord, O True Guru, I am
Your child, and You are my Merciful Father. || 1 || Pause || I am worthless; I have
no virtues at all. I cannot understand Your actions. You alone know Your state and
extent. My soul, body and property are all Yours. || 1 || You are the Inner-knower,
the Searcher of hearts, the Primal Lord and Master; You know even what is unspoken.
My body and mind are cooled and soothed, O Nanak, by God‟s Glance of Grace. || 2 ||
5 || 121 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Keep me with You forever, O God. You are my
Beloved, the Enticer of my mind; without You, my life is totally useless. || 1 || Pause
|| In an instant, You transform the beggar into a king; O my God, You are the Master
of the masterless. You save Your humble servants from the burning fire; You make
them Your own, and with Your Hand, You protect them. || 1 || I have found peace
and cool tranquility, and my mind is satisfied; meditating in remembrance on the Lord,
all struggles are ended. Service to the Lord, O Nanak, is the treasure of treasures; all
other clever tricks are useless. || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 829 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
2 || 6 || 122 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Never forget Your servant, O Lord. Hug me
close in Your embrace, O God, my Lord and Master; consider my primal love for You, O
Lord of the Universe. || 1 || Pause || It is Your Natural Way, God, to purify sinners;
please do not keep my errors in Your Heart. You are my life, my breath of life, O Lord,
my wealth and peace; be merciful to me, and burn away the curtain of egotism. || 1 ||
Without water, how can the fish survive? Without milk, how can the baby survive?
Servant Nanak thirsts for the Lord‟s Lotus Feet; gazing upon the Blessed Vision of his
Lord and Master‟s Darshan, he finds the essence of peace. || 2 || 7 || 123 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Here, and hereafter, there is happiness. The Perfect Guru
has perfectly, totally saved me; the Supreme Lord God has been kind to me. || 1 ||
Pause || The Lord, my Beloved, is pervading and permeating my mind and body; all
my pains and sufferings are dispelled. In celestial peace, tranquility and bliss, I sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord; my enemies and adversaries have been totally destroyed.
|| 1 || God has not considered my merits and demerits; in His Mercy, He has made me
His own. Unweighable is the greatness of the immovable and imperishable Lord; Nanak
proclaims the victory of the Lord. || 2 || 8 || 124 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: Without
the Fear of God, and devotional worship, how can anyone cross over the world-ocean?
Be kind to me, O Saving Grace of sinners; preserve my faith in You, O my Lord and
Master. || 1 || Pause || The mortal does not remember the Lord in meditation; he
wanders around intoxicated by egotism; he is engrossed in corruption like a dog. Utterly
cheated, his life is slipping away; committing sins, he is sinking away. || 1 || I have
come to Your Sanctuary, Destroyer of pain; O Primal Immaculate Lord, may I dwell
upon You in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. O Lord of beautiful hair,
Destroyer of pain, Eradicator of sins, Nanak lives, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of
Your Darshan. || 2 || 9 || 125 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, DU-PADAS, NINTH HOUSE:

He Himself merges us with Himself. When I came to Your Sanctuary, my sins vanished.
|| 1 || Pause || Renouncing egotistical pride and other anxieties, I have sought the
Sanctuary of the Holy Saints. Chanting, meditating on Your Name, O my Beloved,
disease is eradicated from my body. || 1 || Even utterly foolish, ignorant and
thoughtless persons have been saved by the Kind Lord. Says Nanak, I have met the
Perfect Guru; my comings and goings have ended. || 2 || 1 || 126 || BILAAVAL,
FIFTH MEHL: Hearing Your Name, I live. When the Perfect Guru became pleased with
me, then my hopes were fulfilled. || 1 || Pause || Pain is gone, and my mind is
comforted; the music of bliss fascinates me. The yearning to meet my Beloved God has
welled up within me. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 830 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I cannot live without Him, even for an instant. || 1 || You have saved so many
devotees, so many humble servants; so many silent sages contemplate You. The
support of the blind, the wealth of the poor; Nanak has found God, of endless virtues.
|| 2 || 2 || 127 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, THIRTEENTH HOUSE, PARTAAL:

O Enticing Lord, I cannot sleep; I sigh. I am adorned with necklaces, gowns, ornaments
and make-up. I am sad, sad and depressed. When will You come home? || 1 || Pause
|| I seek the Sanctuary of the happy soul-brides; I place my head upon their feet.
Unite me with my Beloved. When will He come to my home? || 1 || Listen, my
companions: tell me how to meet Him. Eradicate all egotism, and then you shall find
your Beloved Lord within the home of your heart. Then, in delight, you shall sing the
songs of joy and praise. Meditate on the Lord, the embodiment of bliss. O Nanak, I
came to the Lord‟s Door, and then, I found my Beloved. || 2 || The Enticing Lord has
revealed His form to me, and now, sleep seems sweet to me. My thirst is totally
quenched, and now, I am absorbed in celestial bliss. How sweet is the story of my
Husband Lord. I have found my Beloved, Enticing Lord. || Second Pause || 1 || 128 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: My ego is gone; I have obtained the Blessed Vision of the
Lord‟s Darshan. I am absorbed in my Lord and Master, the help and support of the
Saints. Now, I hold tight to His Feet. || 1 || Pause || My mind longs for Him, and
does not love any other. I am totally absorbed, in love with His Lotus Feet, like the
bumble bee attached to the honey of the lotus flower. I do not desire any other taste; I
seek only the One Lord. || 1 || I have broken away from the others, and I have been
released from the Messenger of Death. O mind, drink in the subtle essence of the Lord;
join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and turn away from the world. There
is no other, none other than the Lord. O Nanak, love the Feet, the Feet of the Lord. ||
2 || 2 || 129 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, NINTH MEHL, DU-PADAS:

The Name of the Lord is the Dispeller of sorrow — realize this. Remembering Him in
meditation, even Ajaamal the robber and Ganikaa the prostitute were liberated; let your
soul know this. || 1 || Pause || The elephant‟s fear was taken away in an instant, as
soon as he chanted the Lord‟s Name. Listening to Naarad‟s teachings, the child Dhroo
was absorbed in deep meditation. || 1 || He obtained the immovable, eternal state of
fearlessness, and all the world was amazed. Says Nanak, the Lord is the Saving Grace
and the Protector of His devotees; believe it — He is close to you. || 2 || 1 ||
BILAAVAL, NINTH MEHL: Without the Name of the Lord, you shall only find pain.
Without devotional worship, doubt is not dispelled; the Guru has revealed this secret.
|| 1 || Pause || Of what use are sacred shrines of pilgrimage, if one does not enter
the Sanctuary of the Lord? 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 831 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Know that Yoga and sacrificial feasts are fruitless, if one forgets the Praises of God. ||
1 || One who lays aside both pride and attachment, sings the Glorious Praises of the
Lord of the Universe. Says Nanak, the mortal who does this is said to be „jivan mukta‟ —
liberated while yet alive. || 2 || 2 || BILAAVAL, NINTH MEHL: There is no meditation
on the Lord within him. That man wastes his life uselessly — keep this in mind. || 1 ||
Pause || He bathes at sacred shrines of pilgrimage, and adheres to fasts, but he has
no control over his mind. Know that such religion is useless to him. I speak the Truth
for his sake. || 1 || It‟s like a stone, kept immersed in water; still, the water does not
penetrate it. So, understand it: that mortal being who lacks devotional worship is just
like that. || 2 || In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, liberation comes from the Naam. The
Guru has revealed this secret. Says Nanak, he alone is a great man, who sings the
Praises of God. || 3 || 3 ||
BILAAVAL, ASHTAPADEES, FIRST MEHL, TENTH HOUSE:

He dwells close at hand, and sees all, but how rare is the Gurmukh who understands
this. Without the Fear of God, there is no devotional worship. Imbued with the Word of
the Shabad, eternal peace is attained. || 1 || Such is the spiritual wisdom, the
treasure of the Naam; obtaining it, the Gurmukhs enjoy the subtle essence of this
nectar. || 1 || Pause || Everyone talks about spiritual wisdom and spiritual
knowledge. Talking, talking, they argue, and suffer. No one can stop talking and
discussing it. Without being imbued with the subtle essence, there is no liberation. || 2
|| Spiritual wisdom and meditation all come from the Guru. Through the lifestyle of
Truth, the True Lord comes to dwell in the mind. The self-willed manmukh talks about
it, but does not practice it. Forgetting the Name, he finds no place of rest. || 3 ||
Maya has caught the mind in the trap of the whirlpool. Each and every heart is trapped
by this bait of poison and sin. See that whoever has come, is subject to death. Your
affairs shall be adjusted, if you contemplate the Lord in your heart. || 4 || He alone is
a spiritual teacher, who lovingly focuses his consciousness on the Word of the Shabad.
The self-willed, egotistical manmukh loses his honor. The Creator Lord Himself inspires
us to His devotional worship. He Himself blesses the Gurmukh with glorious greatness.
|| 5 || The life-night is dark, while the Divine Light is immaculate. Those who lack the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, are false, filthy and untouchable. The Vedas preach
sermons of devotional worship. Listening, hearing and believing, one beholds the Divine
Light. || 6 || The Shaastras and Simritees implant the Naam within. The Gurmukh
lives in peace and tranquility, doing deeds of sublime purity. The self-willed manmukh
suffers the pains of reincarnation. His bonds are broken, enshrining the Name of the
One Lord. || 7 || Believing in the Naam, one obtains true honor and adoration. Who
should I see? There is none other than the Lord. I see, and I say, that He alone is
pleasing to my mind. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 832 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Says Nanak, there is no other at all. || 8 || 1 || BILAAVAL, FIRST MEHL: The human
acts according to the wishes of the mind. This mind feeds on virtue and vice.
Intoxicated with the wine of Maya, satisfaction never comes. Satisfaction and liberation
come, only to one whose mind is pleasing to the True Lord. || 1 || Gazing upon his
body, wealth, wife and all his possessions, he is proud. But without the Name of the
Lord, nothing shall go along with him. || 1 || Pause || He enjoys tastes, pleasures
and joys in his mind. But his wealth will pass on to other people, and his body will be
reduced to ashes. The entire expanse, like dust, shall mix with dust. Without the Word
of the Shabad, his filth is not removed. || 2 || The various songs, tunes and rhythms
are false. Trapped by the three qualities, people come and go, far from the Lord. In
duality, the pain of their evil-mindedness does not leave them. But the Gurmukh is
emancipated by taking the medicine, and singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 3
|| He may wear a clean loin-cloth, apply the ceremonial mark to his forehead, and
wear a mala around his neck; but if there is anger within him, he is merely reading his
part, like an actor in a play. Forgetting the Naam, the Name of the Lord, he drinks in
the wine of Maya. Without devotional worship to the Guru, there is no peace. || 4 ||
The human is a pig, a dog, a donkey, a cat, a beast, a filthy, lowly wretch, an outcast, if
he turns his face away from the Guru. He shall wander in reincarnation. Bound in
bondage, he comes and goes. || 5 || Serving the Guru, the treasure is found. With
the Naam in the heart, one always prospers. And in the Court of the True Lord, you
shall not called to account. One who obeys the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, is
approved at the Lord‟s Door. || 6 || Meeting the True Guru, one knows the Lord.
Understanding the Hukam of His Command, one acts according to His Will.
Understanding the Hukam of His Command, he dwells in the Court of the True Lord.
Through the Shabad, death and birth are ended. || 7 || He remains detached,
knowing that everything belongs to God. He dedicates his body and mind unto the One
who owns them. He does not come, and he does not go. O Nanak, absorbed in Truth,
he merges in the True Lord. || 8 || 2 ||
BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL, ASHTAPADEES, TENTH HOUSE:

The world is like a crow; with its beak, it croaks spiritual wisdom. But deep within there
is greed, falsehood and pride. Without the Name of the Lord, your thin outer covering
shall wear off, you fool. || 1 || Serving the True Guru, the Naam shall dwell in your
conscious mind. Meeting with the Guru, the Name of the Lord comes to mind. Without
the Name, other loves are false. || 1 || Pause || So do that work, which the Guru
tells you to do. Contemplating the Word of the Shabad, you shall come to the home of
celestial bliss. Through the True Name, you shall obtain glorious greatness. || 2 ||
One who does not understand his own self, but still tries to instruct others, is mentally
blind, and acts in blindness. How can he ever find a home and a place of rest, in the
Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence? || 3 || Serve the Dear Lord, the Inner-knower, the
Searcher of hearts; deep within each and every heart, His Light is shining forth. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 833 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
How can anyone hide anything from Him? || 4 || The True Name is known through
the True Word of the Shabad. The Lord Himself meets that one who eradicates
egotistical pride. The Gurmukh chants the Naam, forever and ever. || 5 || Serving the
True Guru, duality and evil-mindedness are taken away. Guilty mistakes are erased, and
the sinful intellect is cleansed. One‟s body sparkles like gold, and one‟s light merges into
the Light. || 6 || Meeting with the True Guru, one is blessed with glorious greatness.
Pain is taken away, and the Naam comes to dwell within the heart. Imbued with the
Naam, one finds eternal peace. || 7 || Obeying the Guru‟s Instructions, one finds the
sate of salvation. O Nanak, those who follow the Guru‟s Teachings are saved, along
with their families. || 8 || 1 || 3 ||
BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL, ASHTAPADEES, ELEVENTH HOUSE:

One who eliminates his self-centeredness, and eradicates his ego, night and day sings
the songs of the Lord‟s Love. The Gurmukh is inspired, his body is golden, and his light
merges into the Light of the Fearless Lord. || 1 || I take the Support of the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har. I cannot live, for a moment, even for an instant, without the Name
of the Lord; the Gurmukh reads the Sermon of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Pause ||
In the one house of the body, there are ten gates; night and day, the five thieves break
in. They steal the entire wealth of one‟s Dharmic faith, but the blind, self-willed
manmukh does not know it. || 2 || The fortress of the body is overflowing with gold
and jewels; when it is awakened by spiritual wisdom, one enshrines love for the
essence of reality. The thieves and robbers hide out in the body; through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, they are arrested and locked up. || 3 || The Name of the Lord,
Har, Har, is the boat, and the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is the boatman, to carry us
across. The Messenger of Death, the tax collector, does not even come close, and no
thieves or robbers can plunder you. || 4 || I continuously sing the Glorious Praises of
the Lord, day and night; singing the Lord‟s Praises, I cannot find His limits. The mind of
the Gurmukh returns to its own home; it meets the Lord of the Universe, to the beat of
the celestial drum. || 5 || Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan with my
eyes, my mind is satisfied; with my ears, I listen to the Guru‟s Bani, and the Word of
His Shabad. Listening, listening, my soul is softened, delighted by His subtle essence,
chanting the Name of the Lord of the Universe. || 6 || In the grip of the three
qualities, they are engrossed in love and attachment to Maya; only as Gurmukh do they
find the absolute quality, absorption in bliss. With a single, impartial eye, look upon all
alike, and see God pervading all. || 7 || The Light of the Lord‟s Name permeates all;
the Gurmukh knows the unknowable. O Nanak, the Lord has become merciful to the
meek; through loving adoration, he merges in the Lord‟s Name. || 8 || 1 || 4 ||
BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL: Meditate on the cool water of the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har. Perfume yourself with the fragrant scent of the Lord, the sandalwood tree. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 834 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Joining the Society of the Saints, I have obtained the supreme status. I am just a
castor-oil tree, made fragrant by their association. || 1 || Meditate on the Lord of the
Universe, the Master of the world, the Lord of creation. Those humble beings who seek
the Lord‟s Sanctuary are saved, like Prahlaad; they are emancipated and merge with
the Lord. || 1 || Pause || Of all plants, the sandalwood tree is the most sublime.
Everything near the sandalwood tree becomes fragrant like sandalwood. The stubborn,
false faithless cynics are dried up; their egotistical pride separates them far from the
Lord. || 2 || Only the Creator Lord Himself knows the state and condition of
everyone; the Lord Himself makes all the arrangements. One who meets the True Guru
is transformed into gold. Whatever is pre-ordained, is not erased by erasing. || 3 ||
The treasure of jewels is found in the ocean of the Guru‟s Teachings. The treasure of
devotional worship is opened to me. Focused on the Guru‟s Feet, faith wells up within
me; chanting the Glorious Praises of the Lord, I hunger for more. || 4 || I am totally
detached, continually, continuously meditating on the Lord; chanting the Glorious
Praises of the Lord, I express my love for Him. Time and time again, each and every
moment and instant, I express it. I cannot find the Lord‟s limits; He is the farthest of
the far. || 5 || The Shaastras, the Vedas and the Puraanas advise righteous actions,
and the performance of the six religious rituals. The hypocritical, self-willed manmukhs
are ruined by doubt; in the waves of greed, their boat is heavily loaded, and it sinks. ||
6 || So chant the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and through the Naam, find
emancipation. The Simritees and Shaastras recommend the Naam. Eradicating egotism,
one becomes pure. The Gurmukh is inspired, and obtains the supreme status. || 7 ||
This world, with its colors and forms, is all Yours, O Lord; as You attach us, so do we do
our deeds. O Nanak, we are the instruments upon which He plays; as He wills, so is the
path we take. || 8 || 2 || 5 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL: The Gurmukh meditates
on the Inaccessible, Unfathomable Lord. I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice to the True Guru,
the True Primal Being. He has brought the Lord‟s Name to dwell upon my breath of life;
meeting with the True Guru, I am absorbed into the Lord‟s Name. || 1 || The Name
of the Lord is the only Support of His humble servants. I shall live under the protection
of the True Guru. By Guru‟s Grace, I shall attain the Court of the Lord. || 1 || Pause ||
This body is the field of karma; the Gurmukhs plow and work it, and harvest the
essence. The priceless jewel of the Naam becomes manifest, and it pours into their
vessels of love. || 2 || Become the slave of the slave of the slave, of that humble
being who has become the devotee of the Lord. I dedicate my mind and intellect, and
place them in offering before my Guru; by Guru‟s Grace, I speak the Unspoken. || 3 ||
The self-willed manmukhs are engrossed in attachment to Maya; their minds are thirsty,
burning with desire. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I have obtained the Ambrosial
Water of the Naam, and the fire has been put out. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad has
put it out. || 4 || This mind dances before the True Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 835 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The unstruck sound current of the Shabad resounds, vibrating the celestial melody. I
praise the Lord, day and night, moving my feet to the beat of the drum. || 5 ||
Imbued with the Lord‟s Love, my mind sings His Praise, joyfully chanting the Shabad,
the source of nectar and bliss. The stream of immaculate purity flows through the home
of the self within; one who drinks it in, finds peace. || 6 || The stubborn-minded,
egotistical, proud-minded person performs rituals, but these are like sand castles built
by children. When the waves of the ocean come in, they crumble and dissolve in an
instant. || 7 || The Lord is the pool, and the Lord Himself is the ocean; this world is
all a play which He has staged. As the waves of water merge into the water again, O
Nanak, so does He merge into Himself. || 8 || 3 || 6 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL:
My mind wears the ear-rings of the True Guru‟s acquaintance; I apply the ashes of the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad to my body. By body has become immortal, in the Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Both birth and death have come to an end for me. ||
1 || O my mind, remain united with the Saadh Sangat. Be merciful to me, O Lord;
each and every instant, let me wash the Feet of the Holy. || 1 || Pause || Forsaking
family life, he wanders in the forest, but his mind does not remain at rest, even for an
instant. The wandering mind returns home, only when it seeks the Sanctuary of the
Lord‟s Holy people. || 2 || The Sannyaasi renounces his daughters and sons, but his
mind still conjures up all sorts of hopes and desires. With these hopes and desires, he
still does not understand, that only through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad does one
become free of desires, and find peace. || 3 || When detachment from the world
wells up within, he become a naked hermit, but still, his mind roams, wanders and
rambles in the ten directions. He wanders around, but his desires are not satisfied;
joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, he finds the house of kindness and
compassion. || 4 || The Siddhas learn many Yogis postures, but their minds still yearn
for riches, miraculous powers and energy. Satisfaction, contentment and tranquility do
not come to their minds; but meeting the Holy Saints, they are satisfied, and through
the Name of the Lord, spiritual perfection is attained. || 5 || Life is born from the egg,
from the womb, from sweat and from the earth; God created the beings and creatures
of all colors and forms. One who seeks the Sanctuary of the Holy is saved, whether he
is a Kh‟shaatriya, a Brahmin, a Soodra, a Vaishya or the most untouchable of the
untouchables. || 6 || Naam Dayv, Jai Dayv, Kabeer, Trilochan and Ravi Daas the lowcaste leather-worker, blessed Dhanna and Sain; all those who joined the humble Saadh
Sangat, met the Merciful Lord. || 7 || The Lord protects the honor of His humble
servants; He is the Lover of His devotees — He makes them His own. Nanak has
entered the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Life of the world, who has showered His Mercy
upon him, and saved him. || 8 || || 4 || 7 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL: The thirst
for God has welled up deep within me; hearing the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings, my
mind is pierced by His arrow. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 836 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The pain of my mind is known only to my own mind; who can know the pain of
another? || 1 || The Lord, the Guru, the Enticer, has enticed my mind. I am stunned
and amazed, gazing upon my Guru; I have entered the realm of wonder and bliss. || 1
|| Pause || I wander around, exploring all lands and foreign countries; within my
mind, I have such a great longing to see my God. I sacrifice my mind and body to the
Guru, who has shown me the Way, the Path to my Lord God. || 2 || If only someone
would bring me news of God; He seems so sweet to my heart, mind and body. I would
cut off my head and place it under the feet of that one who leads me to meet and unite
with my Lord God. || 3 || Let us go, O my companions, and understand our God; with
the spell of virtue, let us obtain our Lord God. He is called the Lover of His devotees; let
us follow in the footsteps of those who seek God‟s Sanctuary. || 4 || If the soul-bride
adorns herself with compassion and forgiveness, God is pleased, and her mind is
illumined with the lamp of the Guru‟s wisdom. With happiness and ecstasy, my God
enjoys her; I offer each and every bit of my soul to Him. || 5 || I have made the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har, my necklace; my mind tinged with devotion is the intricate
ornament of crowning glory. I have spread out my bed of faith in the Lord, Har, Har. I
cannot abandon Him — my mind is filled with such a great love for Him. || 6 || If God
says one thing, and the soul-bride does something else, then all her decorations are
useless and false. She may adorn herself to meet her Husband Lord, but still, only the
virtuous soul-bride meets God, and the other‟s face is spat upon. || 7 || I am Your
hand-maiden, O Inaccessible Lord of the Universe; what can I do by myself? I am
under Your power. Be merciful, Lord, to the meek, and save them; Nanak has entered
the Sanctuary of the Lord, and the Guru. || 8 || 5 || 8 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL:
My mind and body are filled with love for my Inaccessible Lord and Master. Each and
every instant, I am filled with immense faith and devotion. Gazing upon the Guru, my
mind‟s faith is fulfilled, like the song-bird, which cries and cries, until the rain-drop falls
into its mouth. || 1 || Join with me, join with me, O my companions, and teach me
the Sermon of the Lord. The True Guru has mercifully united me with God. Cutting off
my head, and chopping it into pieces, I offer it to Him. || 1 || Pause || Each and
every hair on my head, and my mind and body, suffer the pains of separation; without
seeing my God, I cannot sleep. The doctors and healers look at me, and are perplexed.
Within my heart, mind and body, I feel the pain of divine love. || 2 || I cannot live for
a moment, for even an instant, without my Beloved, like the opium addict who cannot
live without opium. Those who thirst for God, do not love any other. Without the Lord,
there is no other at all. || 3 || If only someone would come and unite me with God; I
am devoted, dedicated, a sacrifice to him. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 837 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
After being separated from the Lord for countless incarnations, I am re-united with Him,
entering the Sanctuary of the True, True, True Guru. || 4 || There is one bed for the
soul-bride, and the same bed for God, her Lord and Master. The self-willed manmukh
does not obtain the Mansion of the Lord‟s Presence; she wanders around, in limbo.
Uttering, “Guru, Guru”, she seeks His Sanctuary; so God comes to meet her, without a
moment‟s delay. || 5 || One may perform many rituals, but the mind is filled with
hypocrisy, evil deeds and greed. When a son is born in the house of a prostitute, who
can tell the name of his father? || 6 || Because of devotional worship in my past
incarnations, I have been born into this life. The Guru has inspired me to worship the
Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. Worshipping, worshipping Him with devotion, I found the
Lord, and then I merged into the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, Har, Har. || 7 || God
Himself came and ground the henna leaves into powder, and applied it to my body. Our
Lord and Master showers His Mercy upon us, and grasps hold of our arms; O Nanak, He
lifts us up and saves us. || 8 || 6 || 9 || 2 || 1 || 6 || 9 ||
RAAG BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, ASHTAPADEES, TWELFTH HOUSE:

I cannot express the Praises of my God; I cannot express His Praises. I have abandoned
all others, seeking His Sanctuary. || 1 || Pause || God‟s Lotus Feet are Infinite. I am
forever a sacrifice to Them. My mind is in love with Them. If I were to abandon Them,
there is nowhere else I could go. || 1 || I chant the Lord‟s Name with my tongue. The
filth of my sins and evil mistakes is burnt off. Climbing aboard the Boat of the Saints, I
am emancipated. I have been carried across the terrifying world-ocean. || 2 || My
mind is tied to the Lord with the string of love and devotion. This is the Immaculate
Way of the Saints. They forsake sin and corruption. They meet the Formless Lord God.
|| 3 || Gazing upon God, I am wonderstruck. I taste the Perfect Flavor of Bliss. I do
not waver or wander here or there. The Lord God, Har, Har, dwells within my
consciousness. || 4 || Those who constantly remember God, the treasure of virtue,
will never go to hell. Those who listen, fascinated, to the Unstruck Sound-Current of the
Word, will never have to see the Messenger of Death with their eyes. || 5 || I seek
the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Heroic Lord of the World. The Merciful Lord God is under
the power of His devotees. The Vedas do not know the Mystery of the Lord. The silent
sages constantly serve Him. || 6 || He is the Destroyer of the pains and sorrows of
the poor. It is so very difficult to serve Him. No one knows His limits. He is pervading
the water, the land and the sky. || 7 || Hundreds of thousands of times, I humbly
bow to Him. I have grown weary, and I have collapsed at God‟s Door. O God, make me
the dust of the feet of the Holy. Please fulfill this, Nanak‟s wish. || 8 || 1 || BILAAVAL,
FIFTH MEHL: God, please release me from birth and death. I have grown weary, and
collapsed at Your door. I grasp Your Feet, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. The Love of the Lord, Har, Har, is sweet to my mind. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 838 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Be Merciful, and attach me to the hem of Your robe. Nanak meditates on the Naam, the
Name of the Lord. || 1 || O Merciful Master of the meek, You are my Lord and
Master, O Merciful Master of the meek. I yearn for the dust of the feet of the Saints. ||
1 || Pause || The world is a pit of poison, filled with the utter darkness of ignorance
and emotional attachment. Please take my hand, and save me, Dear God. Please bless
me with Your Name, Lord. Without You, God, I have no place at all. Nanak is a sacrifice,
a sacrifice to You. || 2 || The human body is in the grip of greed and attachment.
Without meditating and vibrating upon the Lord, it is reduced to ashes. The Messenger
of Death is dreadful and horrible. The recording scribes of the conscious and the
unconscious, Chitr and Gupt, know all actions and karma. Day and night, they bear
witness. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord. || 3 || O Lord, Destroyer of fear and
egotism, be merciful, and save the sinners. My sins cannot even be counted. Without
the Lord, who can hide them? I thought of Your Support, and seized it, O my Lord and
Master. Please, give Nanak Your hand and save him, Lord! || 4 || The Lord, the
treasure of virtue, the Lord of the world, cherishes and and sustains every heart. My
mind is thirsty for Your Love, and the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. O Lord of the
Universe, please fulfill my hopes. I cannot survive, even for an instant. By great good
fortune, Nanak has found the Lord. || 5 || Without You, God, there is no other at all.
My mind loves You, as the partridge loves the moon, as the fish loves the water, as the
bee and the lotus cannot be separated. As the chakvi bird longs for the sun, so does
Nanak thirst for the Lord‟s feet. || 6 || As the young bride places the hopes of her life
in her husband, as the greedy person looks upon the gift of wealth, as milk is joined to
water, as food is to the very hungry man, and as the mother loves her son, so does
Nanak constantly remember the Lord in meditation. || 7 || As the moth falls into the
lamp, as the thief steals without hesitation, as the elephant is trapped by its sexual
urges, as the sinner is caught in his sins, as the gambler‟s addiction does not leave him,
so is this mind of Nanak‟s attached to the Lord. || 8 || As the deer loves the sound of
the bell, and as the song-bird longs for the rain, the Lord‟s humble servant lives in the
Society of the Saints, lovingly meditating and vibrating upon the Lord of the Universe.
My tongue chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Please bless Nanak with the gift of
the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. || 9 || One who sings the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, and hears them, and writes them, receives all fruits and rewards from the Lord.
He saves all his ancestors and generations, and crosses over the world-ocean. The
Lord‟s Feet are the boat to carry him across. Joining the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, he sings the Praises of the Lord. The Lord protects his honor. Nanak seeks the
Sanctuary of the Lord‟s door. || 10 || 2 ||
BILAAVAL, FIRST MEHL, T‟HITEE ~ THE LUNAR DAYS, TENTH HOUSE,
TO THE DRUM-BEAT JAT:

The First Day: The One Universal Creator is unique, immortal, unborn, beyond social
class or involvement. He is inaccessible and unfathomable, with no form or feature. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 839 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Searching, searching, I have seen Him in each and every heart. I am a sacrifice to one
who sees, and inspires others to see Him. By Guru‟s Grace, I have obtained the
supreme status. || 1 || Whose Name should I chant, and meditate on, except the
Lord of the Universe? Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the Mansion of the
Lord‟s Presence is revealed within the home of one‟s own heart. || 1 || Pause || The
Second Day: Those who are in love with another, come to regret and repent. The are
tied up at Death‟s door, and continue coming and going. What have they brought, and
what will they take with them when they go? The Messenger of Death looms over their
heads, and they endure his beating. Without the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, no one
finds release. Practicing hypocrisy, no one finds liberation. || 2 || The True Lord
Himself created the universe, joining the elements together. Breaking the cosmic egg,
He united, and separated. He made the earth and the sky into places to live. He created
day and night, fear and love. The One who created the Creation, also watches over it.
There is no other Creator Lord. || 3 || The Third Day: He created Brahma, Vishnu and
Shiva, the gods, goddesses and various manifestations. The lights and forms cannot be
counted. The One who fashioned them, knows their value. He evaluates them, and
totally pervades them. Who is close, and who is far away? || 4 || The Fourth Day: He
created the four Vedas, the four sources of creation, and distinct forms of speech. He
created the eighteen Puraanas, the six Shaastras and the three qualities. He alone
understands, whom the Lord causes to understand. One who overcomes the three
qualities, dwells in the fourth state. Prays Nanak, I am his slave. || 5 || The Fifth Day:
The five elements are demons. The Lord Himself is unfathomable and detached. Some
are gripped by doubt, hunger, emotional attachment and desire. Some taste the
sublime essence of the Shabad, and are satisfied. Some are imbued with the Lord‟s
Love, while some die, and are reduced to dust. Some attain the Court and the Mansion
of the True Lord, and behold Him, ever-present. || 6 || The false one has no honor or
fame; like the black crow, he never becomes pure. He is like the bird, imprisoned in a
cage; he paces back and forth behind the bars, but he is not released. He alone is
emancipated, whom the Lord and Master emancipates. He follows the Guru‟s
Teachings, and enshrines devotional worship. || 7 || The Sixth Day: God organized
the six systems of Yoga. The unstruck sound current of the Shabad vibrates of itself. If
God wills it so, then one is summoned to the Mansion of His Presence. One who is
pierced through by the Shabad, obtains honor. Those who wear religious robes burn,
and are ruined. Through Truth, the truthful ones merge into the True Lord. || 8 ||
The Seventh Day: When the body is imbued with Truth and contentment, the seven
seas within are filled with the Immaculate Water. Bathing in good conduct, and
contemplating the True Lord within the heart, one obtains the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, and carries everyone across. With the True Lord in the mind, and the True
Lord lovingly on one‟s lips, one is blessed with the banner of Truth, and meets with no
obstructions. || 9 || The Eighth Day: The eight miraculous powers come when one
subdues his own mind, and contemplates the True Lord through pure actions. Forget
the three qualities of wind, water and fire, and concentrate on the pure True Name.
That human who remains lovingly focused on the Lord, prays Nanak, shall not be
consumed by death. || 10 || The Ninth Day: The Name is the supreme almighty
Master of the nine masters of Yoga, the nine realms of the earth, and each and every
heart. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 840 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
This whole world is the child of Maya. I bow in submission to God, my Protector from
the very beginning of time. He was in the beginning, He has been throughout the ages,
He is now, and He shall always be. He is unlimited, and capable of doing everything. ||
11 || The Tenth Day: Meditate on the Naam, give to charity, and purify yourself. Night
and day, bathe in spiritual wisdom and the Glorious Virtues of the True Lord. Truth
cannot be polluted; doubt and fear run away from it. The flimsy thread breaks in an
instant. Know that the world is just like this thread. Your consciousness shall become
steady and stable, enjoying the Love of the True Lord. || 12 || The Eleventh Day:
Enshrine the One Lord within your heart. Eradicate cruelty, egotism and emotional
attachment. Earn the fruitful rewards, by observing the fast of knowing your own self.
One who is engrossed in hypocrisy, does not see the true essence. The Lord is
immaculate, self-sustaining and unattached. The Pure, True Lord cannot be polluted. ||
13 || Wherever I look, I see the One Lord there. He created the other beings, of many
and various kinds. Eating only fruits, one loses the fruits of life. Eating only delicacies of
various sorts, one loses the true taste. In fraud and greed, people are engrossed and
entangled. The Gurmukh is emancipated, practicing Truth. || 14 || The Twelfth Day:
One whose mind is not attached to the twelve signs, remains awake day and night, and
never sleeps. He remains awake and aware, lovingly centered on the Lord. With faith in
the Guru, he is not consumed by death. Those who become detached, and conquer the
five enemies — prays Nanak, they are lovingly absorbed in the Lord. || 15 || The
Twelfth Day: Know, and practice, compassion and charity. Bring your out-going mind
back home. Observe the fast of remaining free of desire. Chant the unchanted Chant of
the Naam with your mouth. Know that the One Lord is contained in the three worlds.
Purity and self-discipline are all contained in knowing the Truth. || 16 || The
Thirteenth Day: He is like a tree on the sea-shore. But his roots can become immortal,
if his mind is attuned to the Lord‟s Love. Then, he will not die of fear or anxiety, and he
will never drown. Without the Fear of God, he drowns and dies, and loses his honor.
With the Fear of God in his heart, and his heart in the Fear of God, he knows God. He
sits on the throne, and becomes pleasing to the Mind of the True Lord. || 17 || The
Fourteenth Day: One who enters into the fourth state, overcomes time, and the three
qualities of raajas, taamas and satva. Then the sun enters into the house of the moon,
and one knows the value of the technology of Yoga. He remains lovingly focused on
God, who is permeating the fourteen worlds, the nether regions of the underworld, the
galaxies and solar systems. || 18 || Amaavas — The Night of the New Moon: The
moon is hidden in the sky. O wise one, understand and contemplate the Word of the
Shabad. The moon in the sky illuminates the three worlds. Creating the creation, the
Creator beholds it. One who sees, through the Guru, merges into Him. The self-willed
manmukhs are deluded, coming and going in reincarnation. || 19 || One who
establishes his home within his own heart, obtains the most beautiful, permanent place.
One comes to understand his own self, when he finds the True Guru. Wherever there is
hope, there is destruction and desolation. The bowl of duality and selfishness breaks.
Prays Nanak, I am the slave of that one, who remains detached amidst the traps of
attachment. || 20 || 1 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 841 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL, THE SEVEN DAYS, TENTH HOUSE:

Sunday: He, the Lord, is the Primal Being. He Himself is the Pervading Lord; there is no
other at all. Through and through, He is woven into the fabric of the world. Whatever
the Creator Himself does, that alone happens. Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, one is forever in peace. But how rare is the one, who, as Gurmukh, understands
this. || 1 || Within my heart, I chant the Chant of the Lord, the treasure of virtue. The
Lord, my Lord and Master, is inaccessible, unfathomable and unlimited. Grasping the
feet of the Lord‟s humble servants, I meditate on Him, and become the slave of His
slaves. || 1 || Pause || Monday: The True Lord is permeating and pervading. His
value cannot be described. Talking and speaking about Him, all keep themselves
lovingly focused on Him. Devotion falls into the laps of those whom He so blesses. He is
inaccessible and unfathomable; He cannot be seen. Through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, the Lord is seen to be permeating and pervading everywhere. || 2 ||
Tuesday: The Lord created love and attachment to Maya. He Himself has enjoined each
and every being to their tasks. He alone understands, whom the Lord causes to
understand. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, one understands his heart and
home. He worships the Lord in loving devotion. His egotism and self-conceit are burnt
away by the Shabad. || 3 || Wednesday: He Himself bestows sublime understanding.
The Gurmukh does good deeds, and contemplates the Word of the Shabad. Imbued
with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the mind become pure and immaculate. He sings
the Glorious Glorious Praises of the Lord, and washes off the filth of egotism. In the
Court of the True Lord, he obtains lasting glory. Imbued with the Naam, he is
embellished with the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 4 || The profit of the Naam is
obtained through the Door of the Guru. The Great Giver Himself gives it. I am a
sacrifice to the One who gives it. By Guru‟s Grace, self-conceit is eradicated. O Nanak,
enshrine the Naam within your heart. I celebrate the victory of the Lord, the Great
Giver. || 5 || Thursday: The fifty-two warriors were deluded by doubt. All the goblins
and demons are attached to duality. God Himself created them, and sees each one
distinct. O Creator Lord, You are the Support of all. The beings and creatures are under
Your protection. He alone meets You, whom You Yourself meet. || 6 || Friday: God is
permeating and pervading everywhere. He Himself created all, and appraises the value
of all. One who become Gurmukh, contemplates the Lord. He practices truth and selfrestraint. Without genuine understanding, all fasts, religious rituals and daily worship
services lead only to the love of duality. || 7 || Saturday: Contemplating good omens
and the Shaastras, in egotism and self-conceit, the world wanders in delusion. The
blind, self-willed manmukh in engrossed in the love of duality. Bound and gagged at
death‟s door, he is beaten and punished. By Guru‟s Grace, one finds lasting peace. He
practices Truth, and lovingly focuses on the Truth. || 8 || Those who serve the True
Guru are very fortunate. Conquering their ego, they embrace love for the True Lord.
They are automatically imbued with Your Love, O Lord. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 842 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
You are the Giver of peace; You merge them into Yourself. Everything comes from the
One and only Lord; there is no other at all. The Gurmukh realizes this, and understands.
|| 9 || The fifteen lunar days, the seven days of the week, the months, seasons, days
and nights, come over and over again; so the world goes on. Coming and going were
created by the Creator Lord. The True Lord remains steady and stable, by His almighty
power. O Nanak, how rare is that Gurmukh who understands, and contemplates the
Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 10 || 1 || BILAAVAL, THIRD MEHL: The Primal Lord
Himself formed the Universe. The beings and creatures are engrossed in emotional
attachment to Maya. In the love of duality, they are attached to the illusory material
world. The unfortunate ones die, and continue to come and go. Meeting with the True
Guru, understanding is obtained. Then, the illusion of the material world is shattered,
and one merges in Truth. || 1 || One who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed
upon his forehead — the One God abides within his mind. || 1 || Pause || He
created the Universe, and He Himself beholds all. No one can erase Your record, Lord.
If someone calls himself a Siddha or a seeker, he is deluded by doubt, and will continue
coming and going. That humble being alone understands, who serves the True Guru.
Conquering his ego, he finds the Lord‟s Door. || 2 || From the One Lord, all others
were formed. The One Lord is pervading everywhere; there is no other at all.
Renouncing duality, one comes to know the One Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, one knows the Lord‟s Door, and His Banner. Meeting the True Guru, one finds
the One Lord. Duality is subdued within. || 3 || One who belongs to the All-powerful
Lord and Master — no one can destroy him. The Lord‟s servant remains under His
protection; The Lord Himself forgives him, and blesses him with glorious greatness.
There is none higher than Him. Why should he be afraid? What should he ever fear? ||
4 || Through the Guru‟s Teachings, peace and tranquility abide within the body.
Remember the Word of the Shabad, and you shall never suffer pain. You shall not have
to come or go, or suffer in sorrow. Imbued with the Naam, the Name of the Lord, you
shall merge in celestial peace. O Nanak, the Gurmukh beholds Him ever-present, close
at hand. My God is always fully pervading everywhere. || 5 || Some are selfless
servants, while others wander, deluded by doubt. The Lord Himself does, and causes
everything to be done. The One Lord is all-pervading; there is no other at all. The
mortal might complain, if there were any other. Serve the True Guru; this is the most
excellent action. In the Court of the True Lord, you shall be judged true. || 6 || All the
lunar days, and the days of the week are beautiful, when one contemplates the Shabad.
If one serves the True Guru, he obtains the fruits of his rewards. The omens and days
all come and go. But the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is eternal and unchanging.
Through it, one merges in the True Lord. The days are auspicious, when one is imbued
with Truth. Without the Name, all the false ones wander deluded. || 7 || The selfwilled manmukhs die, and dead, they fall into the most evil state. They do not
remember the One Lord; they are deluded by duality. The human body is unconscious,
ignorant and blind. Without the Word of the Shabad, how can anyone cross over? The
Creator Himself creates. He Himself contemplates the Guru‟s Word. || 8 || The
religious fanatics wear all sorts of religious robes. They roll around and wander around,
like the false dice on the board. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 843 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
They find no peace, here or hereafter. The self-willed manmukhs waste away their
lives, and die. Serving the True Guru, doubt is driven away. Deep within the home of
the heart, one finds the Mansion of the True Lord‟s Presence. || 9 || Whatever the
Perfect Lord does, that alone happens. Concern with these omens and days leads only
to duality. Without the True Guru, there is only pitch darkness. Only idiots and fools
worry about these omens and days. O Nanak, the Gurmukh obtains understanding and
realization; he remains forever merged in the Name of the One Lord. || 10 || 2 ||
BILAAVAL, FIRST MEHL, CHHANT, DAKHNEE:

The young, innocent soul-bride has come to the pasture lands of the world. Laying
aside her pitcher of worldly concern, she lovingly attunes herself to her Lord. She
remains lovingly absorbed in the pasture of the Lord, automatically embellished with the
Word of the Shabad. With her palms pressed together, she prays to the Guru, to unite
her with her True Beloved Lord. Seeing His bride‟s loving devotion, the Beloved Lord
eradicates unfulfilled sexual desire and unresolved anger. O Nanak, the young, innocent
bride is so beautiful; seeing her Husband Lord, she is comforted. || 1 || Truthfully, O
young soul-bride, your youth keeps you innocent. Do not come and go anywhere; stay
with your Husband Lord. I will stay with my Husband Lord; I am His hand-maiden.
Devotional worship to the Lord is pleasing to me. I know the unknowable, and speak
the unspoken; I sing the Glorious Praises of the Celestial Lord God. She who chants and
savors the taste of the Lord‟s Name is loved by the True Lord. The Guru grants her the
gift of the Shabad; O Nanak, she contemplates and reflects upon it. || 2 || She who is
fascinated by the Supreme Lord, sleeps with her Husband Lord. She walks in harmony
with the Guru‟s Will, attuned to the Lord. The soul-bride is attuned to the Truth, and
sleeps with the Lord, along with her companions and sister soul-brides. Loving the One
Lord, with one-pointed mind, the Naam dwells within; I am united with the True Guru.
Day and night, with each and every breath, I do not forget the Immaculate Lord, for a
moment, even for an instant. So light the lamp of the Shabad, O Nanak, and burn away
your fear. || 3 || O soul-bride, the Lord‟s Light pervades all the three worlds. He is
pervading each and every heart, the Invisible and Infinite Lord. He is Invisible and
Infinite, Infinite and True; subduing his self-conceit, one meets Him. So burn away your
egotistical pride, attachment and greed, with the Word of the Shabad; wash away your
filth. When you go to the Lord‟s Door, you shall receive the Blessed Vision of His
Darshan; by His Will, the Savior will carry you across and save you. Tasting the
Ambrosial Nectar of the Lord‟s Name, the soul-bride is satisfied; O Nanak, she enshrines
Him in her heart. || 4 || 1 || BILAAVAL, FIRST MEHL: My mind is filled with such a
great joy; I have blossomed forth in Truth. I am enticed by the love of my Husband
Lord, the Eternal, Imperishable Lord God. The Lord is everlasting, the Master of
masters. Whatever He wills, happens. O Great Giver, You are always kind and
compassionate. 

You infuse life into all living beings. I have no other spiritual wisdom, meditation or
worship; the Name of the Lord alone dwells deep within me. I know nothing about
religious robes, pilgrimages or stubborn fanaticism; O Nanak, I hold tight to the Truth.
|| 1 || The night is beautiful, drenched with dew, and the day is delightful, when her
Husband Lord wakes the sleeping soul-bride, in the home of the self. The young bride
has awakened to the Word of the Shabad; she is pleasing to her Husband Lord. So
renounce falsehood, fraud, love of duality and working for people. The Name of the
Lord is my necklace, and I am anointed with the True Shabad. With his palms pressed
together, Nanak begs for the gift of the True Name; please, bless me with Your Grace,
through the pleasure of Your Will. || 2 || Awake, O bride of splendored eyes, and
chant the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. Listen, and place your faith in the Unspoken Speech
of the Lord. The Unspoken Speech, the state of Nirvaanaa — how rare is the Gurmukh
who understands this. Merging in the Word of the Shabad, self-conceit is eradicated,
and the three worlds are revealed to her understanding. Remaining detached, with
infinity infusing, the true mind cherishes the virtues of the Lord. He is fully pervading
and permeating all places; Nanak has enshrined Him within his heart. || 3 || The Lord
is calling you to the Mansion of His Presence; O soul-bride, He is the Lover of His
devotees. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, your mind shall be delighted, and your body
shall be fulfilled. Conquer and subdue your mind, and love the Word of the Shabad;
reform yourself, and realize the Lord of the three worlds. Her mind shall not waver or
wander anywhere else, when she comes to know her Husband Lord. You are my only
Support, You are my Lord and Master. You are my strength and anchor. She is forever
truthful and pure, O Nanak; through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, conflicts are
resolved. || 4 || 2 ||
CHHANT, BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL, MANGAL ~ THE SONG OF JOY:

My Lord God has come to my bed, and my mind is merged with the Lord. As it pleases
the Guru, I have found the Lord God, and I revel and delight in His Love. Very fortunate
are those happy soul-brides, who have the jewel of the Naam upon their foreheads.
The Lord, the Lord God, is Nanak‟s Husband Lord, pleasing to his mind. || 1 || The
Lord is the honor of the dishonored. The Lord, the Lord God is Himself by Himself. The
Gurmukh eradicates self-conceit, and constantly chants the Name of the Lord. My Lord
God does whatever He pleases; the Lord imbues mortal beings with the color of His
Love. Servant Nanak is easily merged into the Celestial Lord. He is satisfied with the
sublime essence of the Lord. || 2 || The Lord is found only through this human
incarnation. This is the time to contemplate the Lord. As Gurmukhs, the happy soulbrides meet Him, and their love for Him is abundant. Those who have not attained
human incarnation, are cursed by evil destiny. O Lord, God, Har, Har, Har, Har, save
Nanak; he is Your humble servant. || 3 || The Guru has implanted within me the
Name of the Inaccessible Lord God; my mind and body are drenched with the Lord‟s
Love. 

The Name of the Lord is the Lover of His devotees; the Gurmukhs attain the Lord.
Without the Name of the Lord, they cannot even live, like the fish without water.
Finding the Lord, my life has become fruitful; O Nanak, the Lord God has fulfilled me.
|| 4 || 1 || 3 || BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL, SHALOK: Seek out the Lord God, your
only true Friend. He shall dwell in your mind, by great good fortune. The True Guru
shall reveal Him to you; O Nanak, lovingly focus yourself on the Lord. || 1 ||
CHHANT: The soul-bride has come to ravish and enjoy her Lord God, after eradicating
the poison of egotism. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, she has eliminated her selfconceit; she is lovingly attuned to her Lord, Har, Har. Her heart-lotus deep within has
blossomed forth, and through the Guru, spiritual wisdom has been awakened within
her. Servant Nanak has found the Lord God, by perfect, great good fortune. || 1 ||
The Lord, the Lord God, is pleasing to her mind; the Lord‟s Name resounds within her.
Through the Perfect Guru, God is obtained; she is lovingly focused on the Lord, Har,
Har. The darkness of ignorance is dispelled, and the Divine Light radiantly shines forth.
The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is Nanak‟s only Support; he merges into the Lord‟s
Name. || 2 || The soul-bride is ravished and enjoyed by her Beloved Lord God, when
the Lord God is pleased with her. My eyes are drawn to His Love, like the cat to the
mouse. The Perfect Guru has united me with the Lord; I am satisfied by the subtle
essence of the Lord. Servant Nanak blossoms forth in the Naam, the Name of the Lord;
he is lovingly attuned to the Lord, Har, Har. || 3 || I am a fool and an idiot, but the
Lord showered me with His Mercy, and united me with Himself. Blessed, blessed is the
most wonderful Guru, who has conquered egotism. Very fortunate, of blessed destiny
are those, who enshrine the Lord, Har, Har, in their hearts. O servant Nanak, praise the
Naam, and be a sacrifice to the Naam. || 4 || 2 || 4 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT:

The time of rejoicing has come; I sing of my Lord God. I have heard of my
Imperishable Husband Lord, and happiness fills my mind. My mind is in love with Him;
when shall I realize my great good fortune, and meet with my Perfect Husband? If only
I could meet the Lord of the Universe, and be automatically absorbed into Him; tell me
how, O my companions! Day and night, I stand and serve my God; how can I attain
Him? Prays Nanak, have mercy on me, and attach me to the hem of Your robe, O Lord.
|| 1 || Joy has come! I have purchased the jewel of the Lord. Searching, the seeker
has found the Lord with the Saints. I have met the Beloved Saints, and they have
blessed me with their kindness; I contemplate the Unspoken Speech of the Lord. With
my consciousness centered, and my mind one-pointed, I meditate on my Lord and
Master, with love and affection. With my palms pressed together, I pray unto God, to
bless me with the profit of the Lord‟s Praise. Prays Nanak, I am Your slave. 

My God is inaccessible and unfathomable. || 2 || The date for my wedding is set, and
cannot be changed; my union with the Lord is perfect. I am totally at peace, and my
separation from Him has ended. The Saints meet and come together, and meditate on
God; they form a wondrous wedding party. Gathering together, they arrive with poise
and grace, and love fills the minds of the bride‟s family. Her light blends with His Light,
through and through, and everyone enjoys the Nectar of the Lord‟s Name. Prays Nanak,
the Saints have totally united me with God, the All-powerful Cause of causes. || 3 ||
Beautiful is my home, and beauteous is the earth. God has entered the home of my
heart; I touch the Guru‟s feet. Grasping the Guru‟s feet, I awake in peace and poise. All
my desires are fulfilled. My hopes are fulfilled, through the dust of the feet of the
Saints. After such a long separation, I have met my Husband Lord. Night and day, the
sounds of ecstasy resound and resonate; I have forsaken my stubborn-minded intellect.
Prays Nanak, I seek the Sanctuary of my Lord and Master; in the Society of the Saints, I
am lovingly attuned to Him. || 4 || 1 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL: By blessed destiny,
I have found my Husband Lord. The unstruck sound current vibrates and resounds in
the Court of the Lord. Night and day, the sounds of ecstasy resound and resonate; day
and night, I am enraptured. Disease, sorrow and suffering do not afflict anyone there;
there is no birth or death there. There are treasures overflowing there — wealth,
miraculous powers, ambrosial nectar and devotional worship. Prays Nanak, I am a
sacrifice, devoted to the Supreme Lord God, the Support of the breath of life. || 1 ||
Listen, O my companions, and sister soul-brides, let‟s join together and sing the songs
of joy. Loving our God with mind and body, let‟s ravish and enjoy Him. Lovingly
enjoying Him, we become pleasing to Him; let‟s not reject Him, for a moment, even for
an instant. Let‟s hug Him close in our embrace, and not feel shy; let‟s bathe our minds
in the dust of His feet. With the intoxicating drug of devotional worship, let‟s entice
Him, and not wander anywhere else. Prays Nanak, meeting with our True Friend, we
attain the immortal status. || 2 || I am wonder-struck and amazed, gazing upon the
Glories of my Imperishable Lord. He took my hand, and held my arm, and cut away the
noose of Death. Holding me by the arm, He made me His slave; the branch has
sprouted in abundance. Pollution, attachment and corruption have run away; the
immaculate day has dawned. Casting His Glance of Grace, the Lord loves me with His
Mind; my immense evil-mindedness is dispelled. Prays Nanak, I have become
immaculate and pure; I have met the Imperishable Lord God. || 3 || The rays of light
merge with the sun, and water merges with water. One‟s light blends with the Light,
and one becomes totally perfect. I see God, hear God, and speak of the One and only
God. The soul is the Creator of the expanse of creation. Without God, I know no other
at all. He Himself is the Creator, and He Himself is the Enjoyer. He created the Creation.
Prays Nanak, they alone know this, who drink in the subtle essence of the Lord. || 4 ||
2 || 

BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT:

Come, O my sisters, come, O my companions, and let us remain under the Lord‟s
control. Let‟s sing the Songs of Bliss of our Husband Lord. Renounce your pride, O my
companions, renounce your egotistical pride, O my sisters, so that you may become
pleasing to your Beloved. Renounce pride, emotional attachment, corruption and
duality, and serve the One Immaculate Lord. Hold tight to the Sanctuary of the Feet of
the Merciful Lord, your Beloved, the Destroyer of all sins. Be the slave of His slaves,
forsake sorrow and sadness, and do not bother with other devices. Prays Nanak, O
Lord, please bless me with Your Mercy, that I may sing Your songs of bliss. || 1 ||
The Ambrosial Naam, the Name of my Beloved, is like a cane to a blind man. Maya
seduces in so many ways, like a beautiful enticing woman. This enticer is so incredibly
beautiful and clever; she entices with countless suggestive gestures. Maya is stubborn
and persistent; she seems so sweet to the mind, and then he does not chant the Naam.
At home, in the forest, on the banks of sacred rivers, fasting, worshipping, on the roads
and on the shore, she is spying. Prays Nanak, please bless me with Your Kindness,
Lord; I am blind, and Your Name is my cane. || 2 || I am helpless and masterless;
You, O my Beloved, are my Lord and Master. As it pleases You, so do You protect me. I
have no wisdom or cleverness; what face should I put on to please You? I am not
clever, skillful or wise; I am worthless, without any virtue at all. I have no beauty or
pleasing smell, no beautiful eyes. As it pleases You, please preserve me, O Lord. His
victory is celebrated by all; how can I know the state of the Lord of Mercy? Prays
Nanak, I am the servant of Your servants; as it pleases You, please preserve me. || 3
|| I am the fish, and You are the water; without You, what can I do? I am the
sparrow-hawk, and You are the rain-drop; when it falls into my mouth, I am satisfied.
When it falls into my mouth, my thirst is quenched; You are the Lord of my soul, my
heart, my breath of life. Touch me, and caress me, O Lord, You are in all; let me meet
You, so that I may be emancipated. In my consciousness I remember You, and the
darkness is dispelled, like the chakvi duck, which longs to see the dawn. Prays Nanak, O
my Beloved, please unite me with Yourself; the fish never forgets the water. || 4 ||
Blessed, blessed is my destiny; my Husband Lord has come into my home. The gate of
my mansion is so beautiful, and all my gardens are so green and alive. My peace-giving
Lord and Master has rejuvenated me, and blessed me with great joy, bliss and love. My
Young Husband Lord is eternally young, and His body is forever youthful; what tongue
can I use to chant His Glorious Praises? My bed is beautiful; gazing upon Him, I am
fascinated, and all my doubts and pains are dispelled. Prays Nanak, my hopes are
fulfilled; my Lord and Master is unlimited. || 5 || 1 || 3 ||
BILAAVAL, FIFTH MEHL, CHHANT, MANGAL ~ THE SONG OF JOY:

SHALOK: God is beautiful, tranquil and merciful; He is the treasure of absolute peace,
my Husband Lord. 

Meeting with God, the Ocean of Peace, O Nanak, this soul becomes happy. || 1 ||
CHHANT: One finds God, the Ocean of Peace, when destiny is activated. Abandoning
the distinctions of honor and dishonor, grasp the Feet of the Lord. Renounce cleverness
and trickery, and forsake your evil-minded intellect. O Nanak, seek the Sanctuary of the
Sovereign Lord, Your King, and your marriage will be permanent and stable. || 1 ||
Why forsake God, and attach yourself to another? Without the Lord, you cannot even
live. The ignorant fool does not feel any shame; the evil man wanders around deluded.
God is the Purifier of sinners; if he forsakes God, tell me, where he can find a place of
rest? O Nanak, by loving devotional worship of the Merciful Lord, he attains the state of
eternal life. || 2 || May that vicious tongue that does not chant the Name of the Great
Lord of the World, be burnt. One who does not serve God, the Lover of His devotees,
shall have his body eaten by crows. Enticed by doubt, he does not understand the pain
it brings; he wanders through millions of incarnations. O Nanak, if you desire anything
other than the Lord, you shall be consumed, like a maggot in manure. || 3 || Embrace
love for the Lord God, and in detachment, unite with Him. Give up your sandalwood oil,
expensive clothes, perfumes, tasty flavors and the poison of egotism. Do not waver this
way or that, but remain wakeful in the service of the Lord. O Nanak, she who has
obtained her God, is a happy soul-bride forever. || 4 || 1 || 4 || BILAAVAL, FIFTH
MEHL: Seek the Lord, O fortunate ones, and join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy. Sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe forever, imbued with the
Love of the Supreme Lord God. Serving God forever, you shall obtain the fruitful
rewards you desire. O Nanak, seek the Sanctuary of God; meditate on the Lord, and
ride the many waves of the mind. || 1 || I shall not forget God, even for an instant;
He has blessed me with everything. By great good fortune, I have met Him; as
Gurmukh, I contemplate my Husband Lord. Holding me by the arm, He has lifted me up
and pulled me out of the darkness, and made me His own. Chanting the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, Nanak lives; his mind and heart are cooled and soothed. || 2 ||
What virtues of Yours can I speak, O God, O Searcher of hearts? Meditating, meditating
in remembrance on the Lord, I have crossed over to the other shore. Singing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord of the Universe, all my desires are fulfilled. Nanak is saved,
meditating on the Lord, the Lord and Master of all. || 3 || Sublime are those eyes,
which are drenched with the Love of the Lord. Gazing upon God, my desires are
fulfilled; I have met the Lord, the Friend of my soul. I have obtained the Ambrosial
Nectar of the Lord‟s Love, and now the taste of corruption is insipid and tasteless to me.
O Nanak, as water mingles with water, my light has merged into the Light. || 4 || 2 ||
5 || 

VAAR OF BILAAVAL, FOURTH MEHL:

SHALOK, FOURTH MEHL: I sing of the sublime Lord, the Lord God, in the melody of
Raag Bilaaval. Hearing the Guru‟s Teachings, I obey them; this is the pre-ordained
destiny written upon my forehead. All day and night, I chant the Glorious Praises of the
Lord, Har, Har, Har; within my heart, I am lovingly attuned to Him. My body and mind
are totally rejuvenated, and the garden of my mind has blossomed forth in lush
abundance. The darkness of ignorance has been dispelled, with the light of the lamp of
the Guru‟s wisdom. Servant Nanak lives by beholding the Lord. Let me behold Your
face, for a moment, even an instant! || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Be happy and sing in
Bilaaval, when the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is in your mouth. The melody and
music, and the Word of the Shabad are beautiful, when one focuses his meditation on
the celestial Lord. So leave behind the melody and music, and serve the Lord; then, you
shall obtain honor in the Court of the Lord. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, contemplate God,
and rid your mind of egotistical pride. || 2 || PAUREE: O Lord God, You Yourself are
inaccessible; You formed everything. You Yourself are totally permeating and pervading
the entire universe. You Yourself are absorbed in the state of deep meditation; You
Yourself sing Your Glorious Praises. Meditate on the Lord, O devotees, day and night;
He shall deliver you in the end. Those who serve the Lord, find peace; they are
absorbed in the Name of the Lord. || 1 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: In the love of
duality, the happiness of Bilaaval does not come; the self-willed manmukh finds no
place of rest. Through hypocrisy, devotional worship does not come, and the Supreme
Lord God is not found. By stubborn-mindedly performing religious rituals, no one
obtains the approval of the Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh understands himself, and
eradicates self-conceit from within. He Himself is the Supreme Lord God; the Supreme
Lord God comes to dwell in his mind. Birth and death are erased, and his light blends
with the Light. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Be happy in Bilaaval, O my beloveds, and
embrace love for the One Lord. The pains of birth and death shall be eradicated, and
you shall remain absorbed in the True Lord. You shall be blissful forever in Bilaaval, if
you walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. Sitting in the Saints‟ Congregation,
sing with love the Glorious Praises of the Lord forever. O Nanak, beautiful are those
humble beings, who, as Gurmukh, are united in the Lord‟s Union. || 2 || PAUREE:
The Lord Himself is within all beings. The Lord is the friend of His devotees. Everyone is
under the Lord‟s control; in the home of the devotees there is bliss. The Lord is the
friend and companion of His devotees; all His humble servants stretch out and sleep in
peace. The Lord is the Lord and Master of all; O humble devotee, remember Him. No
one can equal You, Lord. 

Those who try, struggle and die in frustration. || 2 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: He
alone knows God, and he alone is a Brahmin, who walks in harmony with the Will of the
True Guru. One whose heart is filled with the Lord, is freed of egotism and disease. He
chants the Lord‟s Praises, gathers virtue, and his light merges into the Light. How rare
are those Brahmins who, in this age, come to know God, by lovingly focusing their
consciousness on Him. O Nanak, those who are blessed by the Lord‟s Glance of Grace,
remain lovingly attuned to the Name of the True Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: One who
does not serve the True Guru, and who does not love the Word of the Shabad, earns
the very painful disease of egotism; he is so very selfish. Acting stubborn-mindedly, he
is reincarnated over and over again. The birth of the Gurmukh is fruitful and auspicious.
The Lord unites him with Himself. O Nanak, when the Merciful Lord grants His Mercy,
one obtains the wealth of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: All
glorious greatness is in the Name of the Lord; as Gurmukh, meditate on the Lord. One
obtains all that he asks for, if he keeps his consciousness focused on the Lord. If he
tells the secrets of his soul to the True Guru, then he finds absolute peace. When the
Perfect Guru bestows the Lord‟s Teachings, then all hunger departs. One who is blessed
with such pre-ordained destiny, sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 3 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: No one goes away empty-handed from the True Guru; He
unites me in Union with my God. Fruitful is the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of the
True Guru; through it, one obtains whatever fruitful rewards he desires. The Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad is Ambrosial Nectar. It banishes all hunger and thirst. Drinking in the
sublime essence of the Lord brings contentment; the True Lord comes to dwell in the
mind. Meditating on the True Lord, the status of immortality is obtained; the Unstruck
Word of the Shabad vibrates and resounds. The True Lord is pervading in the ten
directions; through the Guru, this is intuitively known. O Nanak, those humble beings
who have the Truth deep within, are never hidden, even if others try to hide them. || 1
|| THIRD MEHL: Serving the Guru, one finds the Lord, when the Lord blesses him
with His Glance of Grace. Human beings become angels, when the Lord blesses them
with true devotional worship. Conquering egotism, they are blended with the Lord;
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, they are purified. O Nanak, they remain
merged with the Lord; they are blessed with the glorious greatness of the Naam. || 2
|| PAUREE: Within the Guru, the True Guru, is the glorious greatness of the Name.
The Creator Lord Himself has magnified it. All His servants and Sikhs live by gazing,
gazing upon it. It is pleasing to their hearts deep within. The slanderers and evil-doers
cannot see this glorious greatness; they do not appreciate the goodness of others.
What can be achieved by anyone babbling? The Guru is in love with the True Lord. That
which is pleasing to the Creator Lord, increases day by day, while all the people babble
uselessly. || 4 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Cursed are the hopes in the love of duality;
they tie the consciousness to love and attachment to Maya. 

One who forsakes the peace of the Lord in exchange for straw, and forgets the Naam,
suffers in pain. The ignorant self-willed manmukhs are blind. They are born, only to die
again, and continue coming and going. Their affairs are not resolved, and in the end,
they depart, regretting and repenting. One who is blessed with the Lord‟s Grace, meets
the True Guru; he alone meditates on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. Imbued with the
Naam, the humble servants of the Lord find a lasting peace; servant Nanak is a sacrifice
to them. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Hope and desire entice the world; they entice the
whole universe. Everyone, and all that has been created, is under the domination of
Death. By the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command, Death seizes the mortal; he alone is
saved, whom the Creator Lord forgives. O Nanak, by Guru‟s Grace, this mortal swims
across, if he abandons his ego. Conquer hope and desire, and remain unattached;
contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 2 || PAUREE: Wherever I go in this
world, I see the Lord there. In the world hereafter as well, the Lord, the True Judge
Himself, is pervading and permeating everywhere. The faces of the false are cursed,
while the true devotees are blessed with glorious greatness. True is the Lord and
Master, and true is His justice. The heads of the slanderers are covered with ashes.
Servant Nanak worships the True Lord in adoration; as Gurmukh, he finds peace. || 5
|| SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: By perfect destiny, one finds the True Guru, if the Lord
God grants forgiveness. Of all efforts, the best effort is to attain the Lord‟s Name. It
brings a cooling, soothing tranquility deep within the heart, and eternal peace. Then,
one eats and wears the Ambrosial Nectar; O Nanak, through the Name, comes glorious
greatness. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O mind, listening to the Guru‟s Teachings, you shall
obtain the treasure of virtue. The Giver of peace shall dwell in your mind; you shall be
rid of egotism and pride. O Nanak, by His Grace, one is blessed with the Ambrosial
Nectar of the treasure of virtue. || 2 || PAUREE: The kings, emperors, rulers, lords,
nobles and chiefs, are all created by the Lord. Whatever the Lord causes them to do,
they do; they are all beggars, dependent on the Lord. Such is God, the Lord of all; He is
on the True Guru‟s side. All castes and social classes, the four sources of creation, and
the whole universe are slaves of the True Guru; God makes them work for Him. See the
glorious greatness of serving the Lord, O Saints of the Lord; He has conquered and
driven all the enemies and evil-doers out of the body-village. The Lord, Har, Har, is
Merciful to His humble devotees; granting His Grace, the Lord Himself protects and
preserves them. || 6 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Fraud and hypocrisy within bring
constant pain; the self-willed manmukh does not practice meditation. Suffering in pain,
he does his deeds; he is immersed in pain, and he shall suffer in pain hereafter. By his
karma, he meets the True Guru, and then, he is lovingly attuned to the True Name. O
Nanak, he is naturally at peace; doubt and fear run away and leave him. || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: The Gurmukh is in love with the Lord forever. 

The Name of the Lord is pleasing to his mind. The Gurmukh beholds and speaks the
Naam, the Name of the Lord; chanting the Naam, he finds peace. O Nanak, the spiritual
wisdom of the Gurmukh shines forth; the black darkness of ignorance is dispelled. || 2
|| THIRD MEHL: The filthy, foolish, self-willed manmukhs die. The Gurmukhs are
immaculate and pure; they keep the Lord enshrined within their hearts. Prays Nanak,
listen, O Siblings of Destiny! Serve the True Guru, and the filth of your ego shall be
gone. Deep within, the pain of skepticism afflicts them; their heads are constantly
assaulted by worldly entanglements. Asleep in the love of duality, they never wake up;
they are attached to the love of Maya. They do not remember the Name, and they do
not contemplate the Word of the Shabad; this is the view of the self-willed manmukhs.
They do not love the Lord‟s Name, and they lose their life uselessly. O Nanak, the
Messenger of Death attacks them, and humiliates them. || 3 || PAUREE: He alone is
a true king, whom the Lord blesses with true devotion. People pledge their allegiance to
him; no other store stocks this merchandise, nor deals in this trade. That humble
devotee who turns his face towards the Guru and becomes sunmukh, receives the
Lord‟s wealth; the faithless baymukh, who turns his face away from the Guru, gathers
only ashes. The Lord‟s devotees are dealers in the Name of the Lord. The Messenger of
Death, the tax-collector, does not even approach them. Servant Nanak has loaded the
wealth of the Name of the Lord, who is forever independent and care-free. || 7 ||
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: In this age, the devotee earns the wealth of the Lord; all the
rest of the world wanders deluded in doubt. By Guru‟s Grace, the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, comes to dwell in his mind; night and day, he meditates on the Naam. In the
midst of corruption, he remains detached; through the Word of the Shabad, he burns
away his ego. He crosses over, and saves his relatives as well; blessed is the mother
who gave birth to him. Peace and poise fill his mind forever, and he embraces love for
the True Lord. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva wander in the three qualities, while their
egotism and desire increase. The Pandits, the religious scholars and the silent sages
read and debate in confusion; their consciousness is centered on the love of duality.
The Yogis, wandering pilgrims and Sanyaasees are deluded; without the Guru, they do
not find the essence of reality. The miserable self-willed manmukhs are forever deluded
by doubt; they waste away their lives uselessly. O Nanak, those who are imbued with
the Naam are balanced and poised; forgiving them, the Lord blends them with Himself.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: O Nanak, praise Him, who has control over everything.
Remember Him, O mortals — without Him, there is no other at all. He dwells deep
within those who are Gurmukh; forever and ever, they are at peace. || 2 || PAUREE:
Those who do not become Gurmukh and earn the wealth of the Lord‟s Name, are
bankrupt in this age. They wander around begging all over the world, but no one even
spits in their faces. They gossip about others, and lose their credit, and expose
themselves as well. That wealth, for which they slander others, does not come into their
hands, no matter where they go. 

Through loving service, the Gurmukhs receive the wealth of the Naam, but the
unfortunate ones cannot receive it. This wealth is not found anywhere else, in this
country or in any other. || 8 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The Gurmukh does not have
an iota of skepticism or doubt; worries depart from within him. Whatever he does, he
does with grace and poise. Nothing else can be said about him. O Nanak, the Lord
Himself hears the speech of those whom He makes His own. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: He
conquers death, and subdues the desires of his mind; the Immaculate Name abides
deep within him. Night and day, he remains awake and aware; he never sleeps, and he
intuitively drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. His speech is sweet, and his words are nectar;
night and day, he sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord. He dwells in the home of his
own self, and appears beautiful forever; meeting him, Nanak finds peace. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The wealth of the Lord is a jewel, a gem; the Guru has caused the Lord to
grant that wealth of the Lord. If someone sees something, he may ask for it; or,
someone may cause it to be given to him. But no one can take a share of this wealth of
the Lord by force. He alone obtains a share of the wealth of the Lord, who is blessed by
the Creator with faith and devotion to the True Guru, according to his pre-ordained
destiny. No one is a share-holder in this wealth of the Lord, and no one owns any of it.
It has no boundaries or borders to be disputed. If anyone speaks ill of the wealth of the
Lord, his face will be blackened in the four directions. No one‟s power or slander can
prevail against the gifts of the Lord; day by day they continually, continuously increase.
|| 9 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The world is going up in flames — shower it with Your
Mercy, and save it! Save it, and deliver it, by whatever method it takes. The True Guru
has shown the way to peace, contemplating the True Word of the Shabad. Nanak
knows no other than the Lord, the Forgiving Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Through
egotism, fascination with Maya has trapped them in duality. It cannot be killed, it does
not die, and it cannot be sold in a store. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, it is
burnt away, and then it departs from within. The body and mind become pure, and the
Naam, the Name of the Lord, comes to dwell within the mind. O Nanak, the Shabad is
the killer of Maya; the Gurmukh obtains it. || 2 || PAUREE: The glorious greatness of
the True Guru was bestowed by the True Guru; He understood this as the Insignia, the
Mark of the Primal Lord‟s Will. He tested His sons, nephews, sons-in-law and relatives,
and subdued the egotistical pride of them all. Wherever anyone looks, my True Guru is
there; the Lord blessed Him with the whole world. One who meets with, and believes in
the True Guru, is embellished here and hereafter. Whoever turns his back on the Guru
and becomes baymukh, shall wander in cursed and evil places. 

My Lord and Master is on the side of servant Nanak. The All-powerful and All-knowing
Lord God is my Best Friend. Seeing the food being distributed, everyone came and fell
at the feet of the True Guru, who cleansed the minds of all of their egotistical pride. ||
10 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: One plants the seed, another harvests the crop, and still
another beats the grain from the chaff. O Nanak, it is not known, who will ultimately eat
the grain. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: He alone is carried across, within whose mind the
Lord abides. O Nanak, that alone happens, which is pleasing to His Will. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The Merciful Supreme Lord God has carried me across the world-ocean. The
compassionate perfect Guru has eradicated my doubts and fears. Unsatisfied sexual
desire and unresolved anger, the horrible demons, have been totally destroyed. I have
enshrined the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam within my throat and heart. O Nanak, in
the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, my birth and death have been adorned
and redeemed. || 11 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Those who forget the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, are said to be false. The five thieves plunder their homes, and
egotism breaks in. The faithless cynics are defrauded by their own evil-mindedness;
they do not know the sublime essence of the Lord. Those who lose the Ambrosial
Nectar through doubt, remain engrossed and entangled in corruption. They make
friends with the wicked, and argue with the humble servants of the Lord. O Nanak, the
faithless cynics are bound and gagged by the Messenger of Death, and suffer agony in
hell. They act according to the karma of the actions they committed before; as the Lord
keeps them, so do they live. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Those who serve the True Guru,
are transformed from powerless into powerful. With every breath and morsel of food,
the Lord abides in their minds forever, and the Messenger of Death cannot even see
them. The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, fills their hearts, and Maya is their servant. One
who becomes the slave of the Lord‟s slaves, obtains the greatest treasure. O Nanak, I
am forever a sacrifice to that one, within whose mind and body God dwells. One who
has such pre-ordained destiny, he alone is in love with the humble Saints. || 2 ||
PAUREE: Whatever the Perfect True Guru says, the Transcendent Lord hears. It
pervades and permeates the whole world, and it is on the mouth of each and every
being. So numerous are the great glories of the Lord, they cannot even be counted.
Truth, poise and bliss rest in the True Guru; the Guru bestows the jewel of Truth. O
Nanak, the Supreme Lord God embellishes the Saints, who become like the True Lord.
|| 12 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: He does not understand himself; he believes the
Lord God to be far away. He forgets to serve the Guru; how can his mind remain in the
Lord‟s Presence? The self-willed manmukh wastes away his life in worthless greed and
falsehood. O Nanak, the Lord forgives, and blends them with Himself; through the True
Word of the Shabad, He is ever-present. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: True is the Praise of
the Lord God; the Gurmukh chants the Name of the Lord of the Universe. Praising the
Naam night and day, and meditating on the Lord, the mind becomes blissful. By great
good fortune, I have found the Lord, the perfect embodiment of supreme bliss. Servant
Nanak praises the Naam; his mind and body shall never again be shattered. || 2 || 

PAUREE: If someone slanders the True Guru, and then comes seeking the Guru‟s
Protection, the True Guru forgives him for his past sins, and unites him with the Saints‟
Congregation. When the rain falls, the water in the streams, rivers and ponds flows into
the Ganges; flowing into the Ganges, it is made sacred and pure. Such is the glorious
greatness of the True Guru, who has no vengeance; meeting with Him, thirst and
hunger are quenched, and instantly, one attains celestial peace. O Nanak, behold this
wonder of the Lord, my True King! Everyone is pleased with one who obeys and
believes in the True Guru.
