RAAG PARBHAATEE BIBHAAS, FIRST MEHL, CHAU-PADAS, FIRST HOUSE:

Your Name carries us across; Your Name brings respect and worship. Your Name
embellishes us; it is the object of the awakened mind. Your Name brings honor to
everyone‟s name. Without Your Name, no one is ever respected. || 1 || All other
clever tricks are just for show. Whoever the Lord blesses with forgiveness — his affairs
are perfectly resolved. || 1 || Pause || Your Name is my strength; Your Name is my
support. Your Name is my army; Your Name is my king. Your Name brings honor, glory
and approval. By Your Grace, one is blessed with the banner and the insignia of Your
Mercy. || 2 || Your Name brings intuitive peace and poise; Your Name brings praise.
Your Name is the Ambrosial Nectar which cleans out the poison. Through Your Name,
all peace and comfort comes to abide in the mind. Without the Name, they are bound
and gagged, and dragged off to the City of Death. || 3 || Man is involved with his
wife, hearth and home, land and country, the pleasures of the mind and fine clothes;
but when the call comes, he cannot delay. O Nanak, in the end, the false turn out to be
false. || 4 || 1 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: Your Name is the Jewel, and Your
Grace is the Light. In awareness, there is Your Light. Darkness fills the dark, and then
everything is lost. || 1 || This whole world is corrupt. Your Name is the only cure;
nothing else works, O Infinite Creator Lord. || 1 || Pause || One side of the scale
holds tens of thousands, millions of nether regions and realms. 


O my Beloved, Your Worth could only be estimated if something else could be placed on
the other side of the scale. || 2 || Out of pain, pleasure is produced, and out of
pleasure comes pain. That mouth which praises You — what hunger could that mouth
ever suffer? || 3 || O Nanak, you alone are foolish; all the rest of the world is good.
That body in which the Naam does not well up — that body becomes miserable.

|| 4 ||
2 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: For His sake, Brahma uttered the Vedas, and Shiva
renounced Maya. For His sake, the Siddhas became hermits and renunciates; even the
gods have not realized His Mystery. || 1 || O Baba, keep the True Lord in your mind,
and utter the Name of the True Lord with your mouth; the True Lord will carry you
across. Enemies and pain shall not even approach you; only a rare few realize the
Wisdom of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || Fire, water and air make up the world; these
three are the slaves of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. One who does not chant the
Naam is a thief, dwelling in the fortress of the five thieves. || 2 || If someone does a
good deed for someone else, he totally puffs himself up in his conscious mind. The Lord
bestows so many virtues and so much goodness; He does not ever regret it. || 3 ||
Those who praise You gather the wealth in their laps; this is Nanak‟s wealth. Whoever
shows respect to them is not summoned by the Messenger of Death. || 4 || 3 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: One who has no beauty, no social status, no mouth, no
flesh — meeting with the True Guru, he finds the Immaculate Lord, and dwells in Your
Name. || 1 || O detached Yogi, contemplate the essence of reality, and you shall
never again come to be born into the world. || 1 || Pause || One who does not have
good karma or Dharmic faith, sacred rosary or mala — through the Light of God,
wisdom is bestowed; the True Guru is our Protector. || 2 || One who does not
observe any fasts, make religious vows or chant — he does not have to worry about
good luck or bad, if he obeys the Command of the True Guru. || 3 || One who is not
hopeful, nor hopeless, who has trained his intuitive consciousness — his being blends
with the Supreme Being. O Nanak, his awareness is awakened. || 4 || 4 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: What he says is approved in the Court of the Lord. He
looks upon poison and nectar as one and the same. || 1 || What can I say? You are
permeating and pervading all. Whatever happens, is all by Your Will. || 1 || Pause ||
The Divine Light shines radiantly, and egotistical pride is dispelled. The True Guru
bestows the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 2 || In this Dark Age of Kali
Yuga, one‟s birth is approved, if one is honored in the True Court. || 3 || Speaking
and listening, one goes to the Celestial Home of the Indescribable Lord. Mere words of
mouth, O Nanak, are burnt away. || 4 || 5 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: One who
bathes in the Ambrosial Water of spiritual wisdom takes with him the virtues of the
sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage. The Guru‟s Teachings are the gems and jewels;
the Sikh who serves Him searches and finds them. || 1 || There is no sacred shrine
equal to the Guru. The Guru encompasses the ocean of contentment. 

|| 1 || Pause || The Guru is the River, from which the Pure Water is obtained
forever; it washes away the filth and pollution of evil-mindedness. Finding the True
Guru, the perfect cleansing bath is obtained, which transforms even beasts and ghosts
into gods. || 2 || He is said to be the Guru, with the scent of sandalwood, who is
imbued with the True Name to the bottom of His Heart. By His Fragrance, the world of
vegetation is perfumed. Lovingly focus yourself on His Feet. || 3 || The life of the soul
wells up for the Gurmukh; the Gurmukh goes to the House of God. The Gurmukh, O
Nanak, merges in the True One; the Gurmukh attains the exalted state of the self. 

|| 4
|| 6 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: By Guru‟s Grace, contemplate spiritual
knowledge; read it and study it, and you shall be honored. Within the self, the self is
revealed, when one is blessed with the Ambrosial Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 ||
O Creator Lord, You alone are my Benefactor. I beg for only one blessing from You:
please bless me with Your Name. || 1 || Pause || The five wandering thieves are
captured and held, and the egotistical pride of the mind is subdued. Visions of
corruption, vice and evil-mindedness run away. Such is the spiritual wisdom of God. ||
2 || Please bless me with the rice of truth and self-restraint, the wheat of compassion,
and the leaf-plate of meditation. Bless me with the milk of good karma, and the clarified
butter, the ghee, of compassion. Such are the gifts I beg of You, Lord. || 3 || Let
forgiveness and patience be my milk-cows, and let the calf of my mind intuitively drink
in this milk. I beg for the clothes of modesty and the Lord‟s Praise; Nanak chants the
Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 4 || 7 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: No one can
hold anyone back from coming; how could anyone hold anyone back from going? He
alone thoroughly understands this, from whom all beings come; all are merged and
immersed in Him. || 1 || Waaho! — You are Great, and Wondrous is Your Will.
Whatever You do, surely comes to pass. Nothing else can happen. || 1 || Pause ||
The buckets on the chain of the Persian wheel rotate; one empties out to fill another.
This is just like the Play of our Lord and Master; such is His Glorious Greatness. || 2 ||
Following the path of intuitive awareness, one turns away from the world, and one‟s
vision is enlightened. Contemplate this in your mind, and see, O spiritual teacher. Who
is the householder, and who is the renunciate? || 3 || Hope comes from the Lord;
surrendering to Him, we remain in the state of nirvaanaa. We come from Him;
surrendering to Him, O Nanak, one is approved as a householder, and a renunciate. ||
4 || 8 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: I am a sacrifice to that one who binds in
bondage his evil and corrupted gaze. One who does not know the difference between
vice and virtue wanders around uselessly. || 1 || Speak the True Name of the Creator
Lord. Then, you shall never again have to come into this world. || 1 || Pause || The
Creator transforms the high into the low, and makes the lowly into kings. Those who
know the All-knowing Lord are approved and certified as perfect in this world. || 2 ||
If anyone is mistaken and fooled, you should go to instruct him. 

The Creator Himself plays all the games; only a few understand this. || 3 || Meditate
on the Name, and the Word of the Shabad, in the early hours before dawn; leave your
worldly entanglements behind. Prays Nanak, the slave of God‟s slaves: the world loses,
and he wins. || 4 || 9|| PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: The mind is Maya, the mind is a
chaser; the mind is a bird flying across the sky. The thieves are overpowered by the
Shabad, and then the body-village prospers and celebrates. Lord, when You save
someone, he is saved; his capital is safe and sound. || 1 || Such is my Treasure, the
Jewel of the Naam; please bless me with the Guru‟s Teachings, so that I may fall at
Your Feet. || 1 || Pause || The mind is a Yogi, the mind is a pleasure-seeker; the
mind is foolish and ignorant. The mind is the giver, the mind is the beggar; the mind is
the Great Guru, the Creator. The five thieves are conquered, and peace is attained;
such is the contemplative wisdom of God. || 2 || The One Lord is said to be in each
and every heart, but no one can see Him. The false are cast upside-down into the
womb of reincarnation; without the Name, they lose their honor. Those whom You
unite, remain united, if it is Your Will. || 3 || God does not ask about social class or
birth; you must find your true home. That is your social class and that is your status —
the karma of what you have done. The pains of death and rebirth are eradicated; O
Nanak, salvation is in the Lord‟s Name. || 4 || 10 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: He
is awake, and even happy, but he is being plundered — he is blind! The noose is
around his neck, and yet, his head is busy with worldly affairs. In hope, he comes and
in desire, he leaves. The strings of his life are all tangled up; he is utterly helpless. || 1
|| The Lord of Awareness, the Lord of Life is awake and aware. He is the Ocean of
peace, the Treasure of Ambrosial Nectar. || 1 || Pause || He does not understand
what he is told; he is blind — he does not see, and so he does his evil deeds. The
Transcendent Lord Himself showers His Love and Affection; by His Grace, He bestows
glorious greatness. || 2 || With the coming of each and every day, his life is wearing
away, bit by bit; but still, his heart is attached to Maya. Without the Guru, he is
drowned, and finds no place of rest, as long as he is caught in duality. || 3 || Day and
night, God watches over and takes care of His living beings; they receive pleasure and
pain according to their past actions. Nanak, the unfortunate one, begs for the charity of
Truth; please bless him with this glory. || 4 || 11 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: If I
remain silent, the world calls me a fool. If I talk too much, I miss out on Your Love. My
mistakes and faults will be judged in Your Court. Without the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, how can I maintain good conduct? || 1 || Such is the falsehood which is
plundering the world. The slanderer slanders me, but even so, I love him. || 1 ||
Pause || He alone knows the way, who has been slandered. Through the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad, he is stamped with the Lord‟s Insignia in His Court. He realizes the
Naam, the Cause of causes, deep within himself. He alone knows the way, who is
blessed by the Lord‟s Glance of Grace. || 2 || I am filthy and polluted; the True Lord
is Immaculate and Sublime. Calling oneself sublime, one does not become exalted. The
self-willed manmukh openly eats the great poison. But one who becomes Gurmukh is
absorbed in the Name. || 3 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1331 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I am blind, deaf, foolish and ignorant, the lowest of the low, the worst of the worst. I
am poor, but I have the Wealth of Your Name, O my Beloved. This is the most excellent
wealth; all else is poison and ashes. || 4 || I pay no attention to slander and praise; I
contemplate the Word of the Shabad. I celebrate the One who blesses me with His
Bounty. Whomever You forgive, O Lord, is blessed with status and honor. Says Nanak, I
speak as He causes me to speak. || 5 || 12 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: Eating
too much, one‟s filth only increases; wearing fancy clothes, one‟s home is disgraced.
Talking too much, one only starts arguments. Without the Name, everything is poison
— know this well. || 1 || O Baba, such is the treacherous trap which has caught my
mind; riding out the waves of the storm, it will be enlightened by intuitive wisdom. || 1
|| Pause || They eat poison, speak poison and do poisonous deeds. Bound and
gagged at Death‟s door, they are punished; they can be saved only through the True
Name. || 2 || As they come, they go. Their actions are recorded, and go along with
them. The self-willed manmukh loses his capital, and is punished in the Court of the
Lord. || 3 || The world is false and polluted; only the True One is Pure. Contemplate
Him through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Those who have God‟s spiritual wisdom
within, are known to be very rare. || 4 || They endure the unendurable, and the
Nectar of the Lord, the Embodiment of Bliss, trickles into them continuously. O Nanak,
the fish is in love with the water; if it pleases You, Lord, please enshrine such love
within me. || 5 || 13 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: Songs, sounds, pleasures and
clever tricks; joy, love and the power to command; fine clothes and food — these have
no place in one‟s consciousness. True intuitive peace and poise rest in the Naam. || 1
|| What do I know about what God does? Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
nothing makes my body feel good. || 1 || Pause || Yoga, thrills, delicious flavors and
ecstasy; wisdom, truth and love all come from devotion to the Lord of the Universe. My
own occupation is to work to praise the Lord. Deep within, I dwell on the Lord of the
sun and the moon. || 2 || I have lovingly enshrined the love of my Beloved within my
heart. My Husband Lord, the Lord of the World, is the Master of the meek and the poor.
Night and day, the Naam is my giving in charity and fasting. The waves have subsided,
contemplating the essence of reality. || 3 || What power do I have to speak the
Unspoken? I worship You with devotion; You inspire me to do so. You dwell deep
within; my egotism is dispelled. So whom should I serve? There is no other than You.
|| 4 || The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is utterly sweet and sublime. Such is the
Ambrosial Nectar I see deep within. Those who taste this, attain the state of perfection.
O Nanak, they are satisfied, and their bodies are at peace. || 5 || 14 || PRABHAATEE,
FIRST MEHL: Deep within, I see the Shabad, the Word of God; my mind is pleased and
appeased. Nothing else can touch and imbue me. Day and night, God watches over and
cares for His beings and creatures; He is the Ruler of all. || 1 || My God is dyed in the
most beautiful and glorious color. Merciful to the meek and the poor, my Beloved is the
Enticer of the mind; He is so very sweet, imbued with the deep crimson color of His
Love. || 1 || Pause || The Well is high up in the Tenth Gate; the Ambrosial Nectar
flows, and I drink it in. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1332 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The creation is His; He alone knows its ways and means. The Gurmukh contemplates
spiritual wisdom. || 2 || The rays of light spread out, and the heart-lotus joyfully
blossoms forth; the sun enters into the house of the moon. I have conquered death;
the desires of the mind are destroyed. By Guru‟s Grace, I have found God. || 3 || I
am dyed in the deep crimson color of His Love. I am not colored by any other color. O
Nanak, my tongue is saturated with the taste of God, who is permeating and pervading
everywhere. || 4 || 15 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: The Yogis are divided into
twelve schools, the Sannyaasees into ten. The Yogis and those wearing religious robes,
and the Jains with their all hair plucked out — without the Word of the Shabad, the
noose is around their necks. || 1 || Those who are imbued with the Shabad are the
perfectly detached renunciates. They beg to receive charity in the hands of their hearts,
embracing love and affection for the One. || 1 || Pause || The Brahmins study and
argue about the scriptures; they perform ceremonial rituals, and lead others in these
rituals. Without true understanding, those self-willed manmukhs understand nothing.
Separated from God, they suffer in pain. || 2 || Those who receive the Shabad are
sanctified and pure; they are approved in the True Court. Night and day, they remain
lovingly attuned to the Naam; throughout the ages, they are merged in the True One.
|| 3 || Good deeds, righteousness and Dharmic faith, purification, austere selfdiscipline, chanting, intense meditation and pilgrimages to sacred shrines — all these
abide in the Shabad. O Nanak, united in union with the True Guru, suffering, sin and
death run away. || 4 || 16 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: The dust of the feet of the
Saints, the Company of the Holy, and the Praises of the Lord carry us across to the
other side. What can the wretched, terrified Messenger of Death do to the Gurmukhs?
The Lord abides in their hearts. || 1 || Without the Naam, the Name of the Lord, life
might just as well be burnt down. The Gurmukh chants and meditates on the Lord,
chanting the chant on the mala; the Flavor of the Lord comes into the mind. || 1 ||
Pause || Those who follow the Guru‟s Teachings find true peace — how can I even
describe the glory of such a person? The Gurmukh seeks and finds the gems and
jewels, diamonds, rubies and treasures. || 2 || So center yourself on the treasures of
spiritual wisdom and meditation; remain lovingly attuned to the One True Lord, and the
Word of His Shabad. Remain absorbed in the Primal State of the Fearless, Immaculate,
Independent, Self-sufficient Lord. || 3 || The seven seas are overflowing with the
Immaculate Water; the inverted boat floats across. The mind which wandered in
external distractions is restrained and held in check; the Gurmukh is intuitively absorbed
in God. || 4 || He is a householder, he is a renunciate and God‟s slave, who, as
Gurmukh, realizes his own self. Says Nanak, his mind is pleased and appeased by the
True Word of the Shabad; there is no other at all. || 5 || 17 ||
RAAG PRABHAATEE, THIRD MEHL, CHAU-PADAS:

Those who become Gurmukh and understand are very rare; God is permeating and
pervading through the Word of His Shabad. Those who are imbued with the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, find everlasting peace; they remain lovingly attuned to the True One. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1333 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
|| 1 || Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O Siblings of Destiny. By Guru‟s Grace,
the mind becomes steady and stable; night and day, it remains satisfied with the
Sublime Essence of the Lord. || 1 || Pause || Night and day, perform devotional
worship service to the Lord, day and night; this is the profit to be obtained in this Dark
Age of Kali Yuga, O Siblings of Destiny. The humble beings are forever immaculate; no
filth ever sticks to them. They focus their consciousness on the True Name. || 2 ||
The True Guru has revealed the ornamentation of peace; the Glorious Greatness of the
Naam is Great! The Inexhaustible Treasures are overflowing; they are never exhausted.
So serve the Lord forever, O Siblings of Destiny. || 3 || The Creator comes to abide in
the minds of those whom He Himself has blessed. O Nanak, meditate forever on the
Naam, which the True Guru has revealed. || 4 || 1 || PRABHAATEE, THIRD MEHL: I
am unworthy; please forgive me and bless me, O my Lord and Master, and unite me
with Yourself. You are Endless; no one can find Your limits. Through the Word of Your
Shabad, You bestow understanding. || 1 || O Dear Lord, I am a sacrifice to You. I
dedicate my mind and body and place them in offering before You; I shall remain in
Your Sanctuary forever. || 1 || Pause || Please keep me forever under Your Will, O
my Lord and Master; please bless me with the Glorious Greatness of Your Name.
Through the Perfect Guru, God‟s Will is revealed; night and day, remain absorbed in
peace and poise. || 2 || Those devotees who accept Your Will are pleasing to You,
Lord; You Yourself forgive them, and unite them with Yourself. Accepting Your Will, I
have found everlasting peace; the Guru has extinguished the fire of desire. || 3 ||
Whatever You do comes to pass, O Creator; nothing else can be done. O Nanak,
nothing is as great as the Blessing of the Name; it is obtained through the Perfect Guru.
|| 4 || 2 || PRABHAATEE, THIRD MEHL: The Gurmukhs praise the Lord; praising the
Lord, they know Him. Doubt and duality are gone from within; they realize the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad. || 1 || O Dear Lord, You are my One and Only. I meditate on You
and praise You; salvation and wisdom come from You. || 1 || Pause || The
Gurmukhs praise You; they receive the most excellent and sweet Ambrosial Nectar. This
Nectar is forever sweet; it never loses its taste. Contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. || 2 || He makes it seem so sweet to me; I am a sacrifice to Him. Through
the Shabad, I praise the Giver of peace forever. I have eradicated self-conceit from
within. || 3 || My True Guru is forever the Giver. I receive whatever fruits and
rewards I desire. O Nanak, through the Naam, glorious greatness is obtained; through
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the True One is found. || 4 || 3 || PRABHAATEE,
THIRD MEHL: Those who enter Your Sanctuary, Dear Lord, are saved by Your
Protective Power. I cannot even conceive of any other as Great as You. There never
was, and there never shall be. || 1 || O Dear Lord, I shall remain in Your Sanctuary
forever. As it pleases You, You save me, O my Lord and Master; this is Your Glorious
Greatness. || 1 || Pause || O Dear Lord, You cherish and sustain those who seek
Your Sanctuary. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1334 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Dear Lord, the Messenger of Death cannot even touch those whom You, in Your
Mercy, protect. || 2 || True Is Your Sanctuary, O Dear Lord; it never diminishes or
goes away. Those who abandon the Lord, and become attached to the love of duality,
shall continue to die and be reborn. || 3 || Those who seek Your Sanctuary, Dear
Lord, shall never suffer in pain or hunger for anything. O Nanak, praise the Naam, the
Name of the Lord forever, and merge in the True Word of the Shabad. || 4 || 4 ||
PRABHAATEE, THIRD MEHL: As Gurmukh, meditate on the Dear Lord forever, as long
as there is the breath of life. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the mind
becomes immaculate, and egotistical pride is expelled from the mind. Fruitful and
prosperous is the life of that mortal being, who is absorbed in the Name of the Lord. ||
1 || O my mind, listen to the Teachings of the Guru. The Name of the Lord is the Giver
of peace forever. With intuitive ease, drink in the Sublime Essence of the Lord. || 1 ||
Pause || Those who understand their own origin dwell within the home of their inner
being, in intuitive peace and poise. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the heartlotus blossoms forth, and egotism and evil-mindedness are eradicated. The One True
Lord is pervading amongst all; those who realize this are very rare. || 2 || Through
the Guru‟s Teachings, the mind becomes immaculate, speaking the Ambrosial Essence.
The Name of the Lord dwells in the mind forever; within the mind, the mind is pleased
and appeased. I am forever a sacrifice to my Guru, through whom I have realized the
Lord, the Supreme Soul. || 3 || Those human beings who do not serve the True Guru
— their lives are uselessly wasted. When God bestows His Glance of Grace, then we
meet the True Guru, merging in intuitive peace and poise. O Nanak, by great good
fortune, the Naam is bestowed; by perfect destiny, meditate. || 4 || 5 ||
PRABHAATEE, THIRD MEHL: God Himself fashioned the many forms and colors; He
created the Universe and staged the play. Creating the creation, He watches over it. He
acts, and causes all to act; He gives sustenance to all beings. || 1 || In this Dark Age
of Kali Yuga, the Lord is All-pervading. The One God is pervading and permeating each
and every heart; the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is revealed to the Gurmukh. || 1 ||
Pause || The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is hidden, but it is pervasive in the Dark
Age. The Lord is totally pervading and permeating each and every heart. The Jewel of
the Naam is revealed within the hearts of those who hurry to the Sanctuary of the
Guru. || 2 || Whoever overpowers the five sense organs, is blessed with forgiveness,
patience and contentment, through the Guru‟s Teachings. Blessed, blessed, perfect and
great is that humble servant of the Lord, who is inspired by the Fear of God and
detached love, to sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 3 || If someone turns his
face away from the Guru, and does not enshrine the Guru‟s Words in his consciousness
— he may perform all sorts of rituals and accumulate wealth, but in the end, he will fall
into hell. || 4 || The One Shabad, the Word of the One God, is prevailing everywhere.
All the creation came from the One Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh is united in union.
When the Gurmukh goes, he blends into the Lord, Har, Har. || 5 || 6 || PRABHAATEE,
THIRD MEHL: O my mind, praise your Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1335 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Perfect destiny is inscribed upon your forehead and face; sing the Praises of the Lord
forever. || 1 || Pause || The Lord bestows the Ambrosial Food of the Naam. Out of
millions, only a rare few receive it — only those who are blessed by God‟s Glance of
Grace. || 1 || Whoever enshrines the Guru‟s Feet within his mind, is rid of pain and
darkness from within. The True Lord unites him with Himself. || 2 || So embrace love
for the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. Here and hereafter, this is your only Support. The
Creator Lord Himself bestows it. || 3 || One whom the Lord inspires to accept His
Will, is a wise and knowing devotee. Nanak is forever a sacrifice to him. || 4 || 7 || 17
|| 7 || 24 ||
PRABHAATEE, FOURTH MEHL, BIBHAAS:

Through the Guru‟s Teachings, I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord with joyous love
and delight; I am enraptured, lovingly attuned to the Naam, the Name of the Lord.
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I drink in the Ambrosial Essence; I am a
sacrifice to the Naam. || 1 || The Lord, the Life of the World, is my Breath of Life. The
Lofty and Exalted Lord became pleasing to my heart and my inner being, when the
Guru breathed the Mantra of the Lord into my ears. || 1 || Pause || Come, O Saints:
let us join together, O Siblings of Destiny; let us meet and chant the Name of the Lord,
Har, Har. How am I to find my God? Please bless me with the Gift of the Lord‟s
Teachings. || 2 || The Lord, Har, Har, abides in the Society of the Saints; joining this
Sangat, the Lord‟s Glories are known. By great good fortune, the Society of the Saints is
found. Through the Guru, the True Guru, I receive the Touch of the Lord God. || 3 ||
I sing the Glorious Praises of God, my Inaccessible Lord and Master; singing His Praises,
I am enraptured. The Guru has showered His Mercy on servant Nanak; in an instant, He
blessed him with the Gift of the Lord‟s Name. || 4 || 1 || PRABHAATEE, FOURTH
MEHL: With the rising of the sun, the Gurmukh speaks of the Lord. All through the
night, he dwells upon the Sermon of the Lord. My God has infused this longing within
me; I seek my Lord God. || 1 || My mind is the dust of the feet of the Holy. The Guru
has implanted the Sweet Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within me. I dust the Guru‟s Feet
with my hair. || 1 || Pause || Dark are the days and nights of the faithless cynics;
they are caught in the trap of attachment to Maya. The Lord God does not dwell in their
hearts, even for an instant; every hair of their heads is totally tied up in debts. || 2 ||
Joining the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, wisdom and understanding are
obtained, and one is released from the traps of egotism and possessiveness. The Lord‟s
Name, and the Lord, seem sweet to me. Through the Word of His Shabad, the Guru has
made me happy. || 3 || I am just a child; the Guru is the Unfathomable Lord of the
World. In His Mercy, He cherishes and sustains me. I am drowning in the ocean of
poison; O God, Guru, Lord of the World, please save Your child, Nanak. || 4 || 2 ||
PRABHAATEE, FOURTH MEHL: The Lord God showered me with His Mercy for an
instant; 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1336 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
I sing His Glorious Praises with joyous love and delight. Both the singer and the listener
are liberated, when, as Gurmukh, they drink in the Lord‟s Name, even for an instant. ||
1 || The Sublime Essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is enshrined within my
mind. As Gurmukh, I have obtained the cooling, soothing Water of the Naam. I eagerly
drink in the sublime essence of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Pause ||
Those whose hearts are imbued with the Love of the Lord have the mark of radiant
purity upon their foreheads. The Glory of the Lord‟s humble servant is manifest
throughout the world, like the moon among the stars. || 2 || Those whose hearts are
not filled with the Lord‟s Name — all their affairs are worthless and insipid. They may
adorn and decorate their bodies, but without the Naam, they look like their noses have
been cut off. || 3 || The Sovereign Lord permeates each and every heart; the One
Lord is all-pervading everywhere. The Lord has showered His Mercy upon servant
Nanak; through the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings, I have meditated on the Lord in an
instant. || 4 || 3 || PRABHAATEE, FOURTH MEHL: God, the Inaccessible and
Merciful, has showered me with His Mercy; I chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, with
my mouth. I meditate on the Name of the Lord, the Purifier of sinners; I am rid of all
the residues of my sins and mistakes. || 1 || O mind, chant the Name of the Allpervading Lord. I sing the Praises of the Lord, Merciful to the meek, Destroyer of pain.
Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I gather in the Wealth of the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. || 1 || Pause || The Lord abides in the body-village; through the Wisdom of
the Guru‟s Teachings, the Lord, Har, Har, is revealed. In the lake of the body, the Lord‟s
Name has been revealed. Within my own home and mansion, I have obtained the Lord
God. || 2 || Those beings who wander in the wilderness of doubt — those faithless
cynics are foolish, and are plundered. They are like the deer: the scent of musk comes
from its own navel, but it wanders and roams around, searching for it in the bushes. ||
3 || You are Great and Unfathomable; Your Wisdom, God, is Profound and
Incomprehensible. Please bless me with that wisdom, by which I might attain You, O
Lord God. The Guru has placed His Hand upon servant Nanak; he chants the Name of
the Lord. || 4 || 4 || PRABHAATEE, FOURTH MEHL: My mind is in love with the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har; I meditate on the Great Lord God. The Word of the True
Guru has become pleasing to my heart. The Lord God has showered me with His Grace.
|| 1 || O my mind, vibrate and meditate on the Lord‟s Name every instant. The Perfect
Guru has blessed me with the gift of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The Lord‟s Name
abides in my mind and body. || 1 || Pause || The Lord abides in the body-village, in
my home and mansion. As Gurmukh, I meditate on His Glory. Here and hereafter, the
Lord‟s humble servants are embellished and exalted; their faces are radiant; as
Gurmukh, they are carried across. || 2 || I am lovingly attuned to the Fearless Lord,
Har, Har, Har; through the Guru, I have enshrined the Lord within my heart in an
instant. Millions upon millions of the faults and mistakes of the Lord‟s humble servant
are all taken away in an instant. || 3 || Your humble servants are known only through
You, God; knowing You, they becomes supreme. The Lord, Har, Har, has enshrined
Himself within His humble servant. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1337 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
O Nanak, the Lord God and His servant are one and the same. || 4 || 5 ||
PRABHAATEE, FOURTH MEHL: The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the Naam, the
Name of the Lord within me. I was dead, but chanting the Name of the Lord, Har, Har,
I have been brought back to life. Blessed, blessed is the Guru, the Guru, the Perfect
True Guru; He reached out to me with His Arm, and pulled me up and out of the ocean
of poison. || 1 || O mind, meditate and worship the Lord‟s Name. God is never found,
even by making all sorts of new efforts. The Lord God is obtained only through the
Perfect Guru. || 1 || Pause || The Sublime Essence of the Lord‟s Name is the source
of nectar and bliss; drinking in this Sublime Essence, following the Guru‟s Teachings, I
have become happy. Even iron slag is transformed into gold, joining the Lord‟s
Congregation. Through the Guru, the Lord‟s Light is enshrined within the heart. || 2 ||
Those who are continually lured by greed, egotism and corruption, who are lured away
by emotional attachment to their children and spouse — they never serve at the feet of
the Saints; those self-willed manmukhs are filled with ashes. || 3 || O God, You alone
know Your Glorious Virtues; I have grown weary — I seek Your Sanctuary. As You know
best, You preserve and protect me, O my Lord and Master; servant Nanak is Your slave.
|| 4 || 6 || FIRST SET OF SIX ||
PRABHAATEE, BIBHAAS, PARTAAL, FOURTH MEHL:

O mind, meditate on the Treasure of the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. You shall be
honored in the Court of the Lord. Those who chant and meditate shall be carried across
to the other shore. || 1 || Pause || Listen, O mind: meditate on the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. Listen, O mind: the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises is equal to bathing at the
sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage. Listen, O mind: as Gurmukh, you shall be
blessed with honor. || 1 || O mind, chant and meditate on the Supreme Transcendent
Lord God. Millions of sins shall be destroyed in an instant. O Nanak, you shall meet with
the Lord God. || 2 || 1 || 7 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL, BIBHAAS:

The Lord created the mind, and fashioned the entire body. From the five elements, He
formed it, and infused His Light within it. He made the earth its bed, and water for it to
use. Do not forget Him for an instant; serve the Lord of the World. || 1 || O mind,
serve the True Guru, and obtain the supreme status. If you remain unattached and
unaffected by sorrow and joy, then you shall find the Lord of Life. || 1 || Pause ||
He makes all the various pleasures, clothes and foods for you to enjoy. He made your
mother, father and all relatives. He provides sustenance to all, in the water and on the
land, O friend. So serve the Lord, forever and ever. || 2 || He shall be your Helper
and Support there, where no one else can help you. He washes away the residues of
millions of sins in an instant. He bestows His Gifts, and never regrets them. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1338 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
He forgives, once and for all, and never asks for one‟s account again. || 3 || By preordained destiny, I have searched and found God. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company
of the Holy, the Lord of the World abides. Meeting with the Guru, I have come to Your
Door. O Lord, please bless servant Nanak with the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. || 4
|| 1 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: Serving God, His humble servant is glorified.
Unfulfilled sexual desire, unresolved anger and unsatisfied greed are eradicated. Your
Name is the treasure of Your humble servant. Singing His Praises, I am in love with the
Blessed Vision of God‟s Darshan. || 1 || You are known, O God, by Your devotees.
Breaking their bonds, You emancipate them. || 1 || Pause || Those humble beings
who are imbued with God‟s Love find peace in God‟s Congregation. They alone
understand this, to whom this subtle essence comes. Beholding it, and gazing upon it,
in their minds they are wonderstruck. || 2 || They are at peace, the most exalted of
all, within whose hearts God dwells. They are stable and unchanging; they do not come
and go in reincarnation. Night and day, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord God.
|| 3 || All bow down in humble respect to those whose minds are filled with the
Formless Lord. Show mercy unto me, O my Divine Lord and Master. May Nanak be
saved, by serving these humble beings. || 4 || 2 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL:
Singing His Glorious Praises, the mind is in ecstasy. Twenty-four hours a day, I meditate
in remembrance on God. Remembering Him in meditation, the residues of sin go away.
I fall at the Feet of that Guru. || 1 || O beloved Saints, please bless me with wisdom;
let me meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and be emancipated. || 1 ||
Pause || The Guru has shown me the straight path; I have abandoned everything
else. I am enraptured with the Name of the Lord. I am forever a sacrifice to that Guru; I
meditate in remembrance on the Lord, through the Guru. || 2 || The Guru carries
those mortal beings across, and saves them from drowning. By His Grace, they are not
enticed by Maya; in this world and the next, they are embellished and exalted by the
Guru. I am forever a sacrifice to that Guru. || 3 || From the most ignorant, I have
been made spiritually wise, through the Unspoken Speech of the Perfect Guru. The
Divine Guru, O Nanak, is the Supreme Lord God. By great good fortune, I serve the
Lord. || 4 || 3 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: Eradicating all my pains, He has
blessed me with peace, and inspired me to chant His Name. In His Mercy, He has
enjoined me to His service, and has purged me of all my sins. || 1 || I am only a
child; I seek the Sanctuary of God the Merciful. Erasing my demerits and faults, God
has made me His Own. My Guru, the Lord of the World, protects me. || 1 || Pause ||
My sicknesses and sins were erased in an instant, when the Lord of the World became
merciful. With each and very breath, I worship and adore the Supreme Lord God; I am
a sacrifice to the True Guru. || 2 || My Lord and Master is Inaccessible, Unfathomable
and Infinite. His limits cannot be found. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1339 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
We earn the profit, and become wealthy, meditating on our God. || 3 || Twenty-four
hours a day, I meditate on the Supreme Lord God; I sing His Glorious Praises forever
and ever. Says Nanak, my desires have been fulfilled; I have found my Guru, the
Supreme Lord God. || 4 || 4 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: Meditating in
rememberance on the Naam, all the residues of my sinful mistakes have been erased.
The Guru has blessed me with the Capital of the True Name. God‟s servants are
embellished and exalted in His Court; serving Him, they look beauteous forever. || 1 ||
Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my Siblings of Destiny. All sickness and sin
shall be erased; your mind shall be rid of the darkness of ignorance. || 1 || Pause ||
The Guru has saved me from death and rebirth, O friend; I am in love with the Name of
the Lord. The suffering of millions of incarnations is gone; whatever pleases Him is
good. || 2 || I am forever a sacrifice to the Guru; by His Grace, I meditate on the
Lord‟s Name. By great good fortune, such a Guru is found; meeting Him, one is lovingly
attuned to the Lord. || 3 || Please be merciful, O Supreme Lord God, O Lord and
Master, Inner-knower, Searcher of Hearts. Twenty-four hours a day, I am lovingly
attuned to You. Servant Nanak has come to the Sanctuary of God. || 4 || 5 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: In His Mercy, God has made me His Own. He has blessed
me with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Twenty-four hours a day, I sing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord of the Universe. Fear is dispelled, and all anxiety has been
alleviated. || 1 || I have been saved, touching the Feet of the True Guru. Whatever
the Guru says is good and sweet to me. I have renounced the intellectual wisdom of my
mind. || 1 || Pause || That Lord God abides within my mind and body. There are no
conflicts, pains or obstacles. Forever and ever, God is with my soul. Filth and pollution
are washed away by the Love of the Name. || 2 || I am in love with the Lotus Feet of
the Lord; I am no longer consumed by sexual desire, anger and egotism. Now, I know
the way to meet God. Through loving devotional worship, my mind is pleased and
appeased with the Lord. || 3 || Listen, O friends, Saints, my exalted companions. The
Jewel of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is unfathomable and immeasurable. Forever
and ever, sing the Glories of God, the Treasure of Virtue. Says Nanak, by great good
fortune, He is found. || 4 || 6 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: They are wealthy, and
they are the true merchants, who have the credit of the Naam in the Court of the Lord.
|| 1 || So chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, in your mind, my friends. The Perfect
Guru is found by great good fortune, and then one‟s lifestyle becomes perfect and
immaculate. || 1 || Pause || They earn the profit, and the congratulations pour in;
by the Grace of the Saints, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 2 || Their
lives are fruitful and prosperous, and their birth is approved; by Guru‟s Grace, they
enjoy the Love of the Lord. || 3 || Sexuality, anger and egotism are wiped away; O
Nanak, as Gurmukh, they are carried across to the other shore. || 4 || 7 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Guru is Perfect, and Perfect is His Power. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1340 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is unchanging, forever and ever. All pains and afflictions
run away from those, whose minds are filled with the Word of the Guru‟s Bani. || 1 ||
Imbued with the Lord‟s Love, they sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. They are
liberated, bathing in the dust of the feet of the Holy. || 1 || Pause || By Guru‟s
Grace, they are carried across to the other shore; they are rid of fear, doubt and
corruption. The Guru‟s Feet abide deep within their minds and bodies. The Holy are
fearless; they take to the Sanctuary of the Lord. || 2 || They are blessed with
abundant bliss, happiness, pleasure and peace. Enemies and pains do not even
approach them. The Perfect Guru makes them His Own, and protects them. Chanting
the Lord‟s Name, they are rid of all the residues of their sinful mistakes. || 3 || The
Saints, spiritual companions and Sikhs are exalted and uplifted. The Perfect Guru leads
them to meet God. The painful noose of death and rebirth is snapped. Says Nanak, the
Guru covers their faults. || 4 || 8 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: The Perfect True
Guru has bestowed the Naam, the Name of the Lord. I am blessed with bliss and
happiness, emancipation and eternal peace. All my affairs have been resolved. || 1 ||
Pause || The Lotus Feet of the Guru abide within my mind. I am rid of pain, suffering,
doubt and fraud. || 1 || Rise early, and sing the Glorious Word of God‟s Bani. Twentyfour hours a day, meditate in remembrance on the Lord, O mortal. || 2 || Inwardly
and outwardly, God is everywhere. Wherever I go, He is always with me, my Helper
and Support. || 3 || With my palms pressed together, I offer this prayer. O Nanak, I
meditate forever on the Lord, the Treasure of Virtue. || 4 || 9 || PRABHAATEE,
FIFTH MEHL: The Supreme Lord God is All-wise and All-knowing. The Perfect Guru is
found by great good fortune. I am a sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. || 1
|| Pause || The sinful residues of past mistakes are cut away, through the Word of
the Shabad, and I have found contentment. I have become worthy of worshipping the
Naam in adoration. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, I have been
enlightened. The Lord‟s Lotus Feet abide within my mind. || 1 || The One who made
us, protects and preserves us. God is Perfect, the Master of the masterless. Those,
upon whom He showers His Mercy — they have perfect karma and conduct. || 2 ||
They sing the Glories of God, continually, continuously, forever fresh and new. They do
not wander in the 8.4 million incarnations. Here and hereafter, they worship the Lord‟s
Feet. Their faces are radiant, and they are honored in the Court of the Lord. || 3 ||
That person, upon whose forehead the Guru places His Hand — out of millions, how
rare is that slave. He sees God pervading and permeating the water, the land and the
sky. Nanak is saved by the dust of the feet of such a humble being. || 4 || 10 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: I am a sacrifice to my Perfect Guru. By His Grace, I chant
and meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. || 1 || Pause || Listening to the Ambrosial Word
of His Bani, I am exalted and enraptured. My corrupt and poisonous entanglements are
gone. || 1 || I am in love with the True Word of His Shabad. The Lord God has come
into my consciousness. || 2 || Chanting the Naam, I am enlightened. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1341 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad has come to dwell within my heart. || 3 || The Guru
is All-powerful and Merciful forever. Chanting and meditating on the Lord, Nanak is
exalted and enraptured. || 4 || 11 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: Chanting Guru,
Guru, I have found eternal peace. God, Merciful to the meek, has become kind and
compassionate; He has inspired me to chant His Name. || 1 || Pause || Joining the
Society of the Saints, I am illumined and enlightened. Chanting the Name of the Lord,
Har, Har, my hopes have been fulfilled. || 1 || I am blessed with total salvation, and
my mind is filled with peace. I sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; O Nanak, the Guru
has been gracious to me. || 2 || 12 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL, SECOND HOUSE, BIBHAAS:

There is no other place of rest, none at all, without the Lord‟s Name. There is total
success and salvation, and all affairs are perfectly resolved. || 1 || Constantly chant
the Name of the Lord. Sexuality, anger and egotism are wiped away; let yourself fall in
love with the One Lord. || 1 || Pause || Attached to the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, pain runs away. In His Sanctuary, He cherishes and sustains us. Whoever has
such pre-ordained destiny meets with the True Guru; the Messenger of Death cannot
grab him. || 2 || Night and day, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har; abandon the doubts
of your mind. One who has perfect karma joins the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, and meets the Lord. || 3 || The sinful residues of countless lifetimes are erased,
and one is protected by the Lord Himself. He is our Mother, Father, Friend and Sibling;
O servant Nanak, meditate on the Lord, Har, Har. || 4 || 1 || 13 ||
PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL, BIBHAAS, PARTAAL:

Chant the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam, Raam. Conflict, suffering, greed and
emotional attachment shall be dispelled, and the fever of egotism shall be relieved. || 1
|| Pause || Renounce your selfishness, and grasp the feet of the Saints; your mind
shall be sanctified, and your sins shall be taken away. || 1 || Nanak, the child, does
not know anything at all. O God, please protect me; You are my Mother and Father. ||
2 || 1 || 14 || PRABHAATEE, FIFTH MEHL: I have taken the Shelter and Support of
the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. You are Lofty and Exalted, Grand and Infinite, O my Lord and
Master; You alone are above all. || 1 || Pause || He is the Support of the breath of
life, the Destroyer of pain, the Giver of discriminating understanding. || 1 || So bow
down in respect to the Savior Lord; worship and adore the One God. Bathing in the dust
of the feet of the Saints, Nanak is blessed with countless comforts. || 2 || 2 || 15 || 

PRABHAATEE, ASHTAPADEES, FIRST MEHL, BIBHAAS:

The insanity of duality has driven the mind insane. In false greed, life is wasting away.
Duality clings to the mind; it cannot be restrained. The True Guru saves us, implanting
the Naam, the Name of the Lord within. || 1 || Without subduing the mind, Maya
cannot be subdued. The One who created this, He alone understands. Contemplating
the Word of the Shabad, one is carried across the terrifying world-ocean. || 1 || Pause
|| Gathering the wealth of Maya, kings become proud and arrogant. But this Maya that
they love so much shall not go along with them in the end. There are so many colors
and flavors of attachment to Maya. Except for the Name, no one has any friend or
companion. || 2 || According to one‟s own mind, one sees the minds of others.
According to one‟s desires, one‟s condition is determined. According to one‟s actions,
one is focused and tuned in. Seeking the advice of the True Guru, one finds the home
of peace and poise. || 3 || In music and song, the mind is caught by the love of
duality. Filled with deception deep within, one suffers in terrible pain. Meeting with the
True Guru, one is blessed with clear understanding, and remains lovingly attuned to the
True Name. || 4 || Through the True Word of the Shabad, one practices Truth. He
sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, through the True Word of His Bani. He dwells in
the home of his own heart deep within, and obtains the immortal status. Then, he is
blessed with honor in the Court of the True Lord. || 5 || Without serving the Guru,
there is no devotional worship, even though one may make all sorts of efforts. If one
eradicates egotism and selfishness through the Shabad, the Immaculate Naam comes
to abide in the mind. || || 6 || In this world, the practice of the Shabad is the most
excellent occupation. Without the Shabad, everything else is the darkness of emotional
attachment. Through the Shabad, the Naam is enshrined within the heart. Through the
Shabad, one obtains clear understanding and the door of salvation. || 7 || There is no
other Creator except the All-seeing Lord God. The True Lord Himself is Infinite and
Incomparably Beautiful. Through the Lord‟s Name, one obtains the most sublime and
exalted state. O Nanak, how rare are those humble beings, who seek and find the Lord.
|| 8 || 1 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: Emotional attachment to Maya is spread out
all over the world. Seeing a beautiful woman, the man is overcome with sexual desire.
His love for his children and gold steadily increases. He sees everything as his own, but
he does not own the One Lord. || 1 || I meditate as I chant on such a mala, that I
rise above pleasure and pain; I attain the most wondrous devotional worship of the
Lord. || 1 || Pause || O Treasure of Virtue, Your limits cannot be found. Through the
True Word of the Shabad, I am absorbed into You. You Yourself created the comings
and goings of reincarnation. They alone are devotees, who focus their consciousness on
You. || 2 || Spiritual wisdom and meditation on the Lord, the Lord of Nirvaanaa —
without meeting the True Guru, no one knows this. The Lord‟s Light fills the sacred
pools of all beings. I am a sacrifice to the Embodiment of Bliss. || 3 || Through the
Guru‟s Teachings, one achieves loving devotional worship. The Shabad burns away
egotism from within. 

The wandering mind is restrained and held in its place. The True Name is enshrined in
the mind. || 4 || The exciting and intoxicating worldly plays come to an end, for those
who accept the Guru‟s Teachings, and become lovingly attuned to the One Lord. Seeing
this, the fire in the water is extinguished. They alone realize this, who are blessed by
great good fortune. || 5 || Serving the True Guru, doubt is dispelled. Those who are
lovingly attuned to the True Lord remain awake and aware night and day. They know
the One Lord, and no other. Serving the Giver of peace, they become immaculate. || 6
|| Selfless service and intuitive awareness come by reflecting upon the Word of the
Shabad. Chanting, intensive meditation and austere self-discipline come by subduing
the ego. One becomes Jivan-mukta — liberated while yet alive, by listening to the
Shabad. Living a truthful way of life, one finds true peace. || 7 || The Giver of peace
is the Eradicator of pain. I cannot conceive of serving any other. I place my body, mind
and wealth in offering before Him. Says Nanak, I have tasted the supreme, sublime
Essence of the Lord. || 8 || 2 || PRABHAATEE, FIRST MEHL: You may perform
exercises of inner purification, and fire up the furnace of the Kundalini, inhaling and
exhaling and holding the breath. Without the True Guru, you will not understand;
deluded by doubt, you shall drown and die. The spiritually blind are filled with filth and
pollution; they may wash, but the filth within shall never depart. Without the Naam, the
Name of the Lord, all their actions are useless, like the magician who deceives through
illuions. || 1 || The merits of the six religious rituals are obtained through the
Immaculate Naam. You, O Lord, are the Ocean of virtue; I am so unworthy. || 1 ||
Pause || Running around chasing the entanglements of Maya is an evil-minded act of
corruption. The fool makes a show of his self-conceit; he does not know how to behave.
The self-willed manmukh is enticed by his desires for Maya; his words are useless and
empty. The ritual cleansings of the sinner are fradulent; his rituals and decorations are
useless and empty. || 2 || False is the wisdom of the mind; its actions inspire useless
disputes. The false are filled with egotism; they do not obtain the sublime taste of their
Lord and Master. Without the Name, whatever else they do is tasteless and insipid.
Associating with their enemies, they are plundered and ruined. Their speech is poison,
and their lives are useless. || 3 || Do not be deluded by doubt; do not invite your own
death. Serve the True Guru, and you shall be at peace forever. Without the True Guru,
no one is liberated. They come and go in reincarnation; they die, only to be reborn and
die again. || 4 || This body wanders, caught in the three dispositions. It is afflicted by
sorrow and suffering. So serve the One who has no mother or father. Desire and
selfishness shall depart from within. || 5 || Wherever I look, I see Him. Without
meeting the True Guru, no one is liberated. Enshrine the True One in your heart; this is
the most excellent action. All other hypocritical actions and devotions bring only ruin. ||
6 || When one is rid of duality, then he realizes the Word of the Shabad. Inside and
out, he knows the One Lord. This is the most Excellent Wisdom of the Shabad. Ashes
fall on the heads of those who are in duality. || 7 || To praise the Lord through the
Guru‟s Teachings is the most excellent action. In the Society of the Saints, contemplate
the Glories of God and His spiritual wisdom. Whoever subdues his mind, knows the
state of being dead while yet alive. O Nanak, by His Grace, the Gracious Lord is
realized.
