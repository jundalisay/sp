SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: 

With the body of saffron, and the
tongue a jewel, and the breath of the body pure fragrant incense; with the face
anointed at the sixty-eight holy places of pilgrimage, and the heart illuminated with
wisdom—with that wisdom, chant the Praises of the True Name, the Treasure of
Excellence. || 1 || 

O Baba, other wisdom is useless and irrelevant. If falsehood is
practiced a hundred times, it is still false in its effects. || 1 || Pause || You may be
worshipped and adored as a Pir (a spiritual teacher); you may be welcomed by all the
world; you may adopt a lofty name, and be known to have supernatural spiritual
powers—even so, if you are not accepted in the Court of the Lord, then all this
adoration is false. || 2 || 

No one can overthrow those who have been established by
the True Guru. The Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within them, and
through the Naam, they are radiant and famous. They worship the Naam, and they
believe in the Naam. The True One is forever Intact and Unbroken. || 3 || When the
body mingles with dust, what happens to the soul? All clever tricks are burnt away, and
you shall depart crying. O Nanak, those who forget the Naam—what will happen when
they go to the Court of the Lord? || 4 || 8 || 

SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: The
virtuous wife exudes virtue; the unvirtuous suffer in misery. If you long for your
Husband Lord, O soul-bride, you must know that He is not met by falsehood. No boat or
raft can take you to Him. Your Husband Lord is far away. || 1 || My Lord and Master
is Perfect; His Throne is Eternal and Immovable. One who attains perfection as
Gurmukh, obtains the Immeasurable True Lord. || 1 || Pause || 

The Palace of the Lord God is so beautiful. Within it, there are gems, rubies, pearls and flawless diamonds. A fortress of gold surrounds this Source of Nectar. How can I climb up to the Fortress without a ladder? By meditating on the Lord, through the Guru, I am blessed and exalted. || 2 ||

The Guru is the Ladder, the Guru is the Boat, and the Guru is the Raft to take me to the Lord‟s Name. The Guru is the Boat to carry me across the worldocean; the Guru is the Sacred Shrine of Pilgrimage, the Guru is the Holy River. If it pleases Him, I bathe in the Pool of Truth, and become radiant and pure. || 3 || He is called the Most Perfect of the Perfect. He sits upon His Perfect Throne. He looks so Beautiful in His Perfect Place. He fulfills the hopes of the hopeless. O Nanak, if one obtains the Perfect Lord, how can his virtues decrease? || 4 || 9 ||

SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: 

Come, my dear sisters and spiritual companions; hug me close in your embrace. Let‟s join together, and tell stories of our All-powerful Husband Lord. All Virtues are in our True Lord and Master; we are utterly without virtue. || 1 || O Creator Lord, all are in Your Power. I dwell upon the One Word of the Shabad. You are mine—what else do I need? || 1 || Pause || Go, and ask the happy soul-brides, “By what virtuous qualities do you enjoy your Husband Lord?” “We are adorned with intuitive ease, contentment and sweet words.

We meet with our Beloved, the Source of Joy, when we listen to the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad.” || 2 || You have so many Creative Powers, Lord; Your Bountiful Blessings are so Great. So many of Your beings and creatures praise You day and night. You have so many forms and colors, so many classes, high and low. || 3 || Meeting the True One, Truth wells up. The truthful are absorbed into the True Lord. Intuitive understanding is obtained and one is welcomed with honor, through the Guru‟s Word, filled with the Fear of God. O Nanak, the True King absorbs us into Himself. || 4 || 10 ||


### SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: 

It all worked out—I was saved, and the egotism within my heart was subdued. The evil energies have been made to serve me, since I placed my faith in the True Guru. I have renounced my useless schemes, by the Grace of the True, Carefree Lord. || 1 || O mind, meeting with the True One, fear departs. Without the Fear of God, how can anyone become fearless? Become Gurmukh, and immerse yourself in the Shabad. || 1 || Pause || How can we describe Him with words? There is no end to the descriptions of Him. There are so many beggars, but He is the only Giver. He is the Giver of the soul, and the praanaa, the breath of life; when He dwells within the mind, there is peace. || 2 ||

The world is a drama, staged in a dream. In a
moment, the play is played out. Some attain union with the Lord, while others depart in
separation. Whatever pleases Him comes to pass; nothing else can be done. || 3 ||
The Gurmukhs purchase the Genuine Article. The True Merchandise is purchased with
the True Capital. Those who purchase this True Merchandise through the Perfect Guru
are blessed. O Nanak, one who stocks this True Merchandise shall recognize and realize
the Genuine Article. || 4 || 11 || 



### SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: 

As metal merges with metal, those who chant the Praises of the Lord are absorbed into the Praiseworthy Lord. Like the poppies, they are dyed in the deep crimson color of Truthfulness. Those contented souls who meditate on the Lord with single-minded love, meet the True Lord. || 1 || O Siblings of Destiny, become the dust of the feet of the humble Saints. In the Society of the Saints, the Guru is found. He is the Treasure of Liberation, the Source of all good fortune. || 1 || Pause ||

Upon that Highest Plane of Sublime Beauty, stands the Mansion of the Lord. By true actions, this human body is obtained, and the door within ourselves which leads to the Mansion of the Beloved, is found. The Gurmukhs train their minds to contemplate the Lord, the Supreme Soul. || 2 || By actions committed under the influence of the three qualities, hope and anxiety are produced. Without the Guru, how can anyone be released from these three qualities? Through intuitive wisdom, we meet with Him and find peace. Within the home of the self, the Mansion of His Presence is realized when He bestows His Glance of Grace and washes away our pollution. || 3 ||

Without the Guru, this pollution is not removed. Without the Lord, how can there be any homecoming? Contemplate the One Word of the Shabad, and abandon other hopes. O Nanak, I am forever a sacrifice to the one who beholds, and inspires others to behold Him. || 4 || 12 ||

SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL:

The life of the discarded bride is cursed. She is deceived by the love of duality. Like a wall of sand, day and night, she crumbles, and eventually, she breaks down altogether. Without the Word of the Shabad, peace does not come. Without her Husband Lord, her suffering does not end. || 1 || O soul-bride, without your Husband Lord, what good are your decorations?

In this world, you shall not find any shelter; in the world hereafter, being false, you shall suffer. || 1 || Pause || The True Lord Himself knows all; He makes no mistakes. He is the Great Farmer of the Universe. First, He prepares the ground, and then He plants the Seed of the True Name. The nine treasures are produced from Name of the One Lord. By His Grace, we obtain His Banner and Insignia. || 2 || Some are very knowledgeable, but if they do not know the Guru, then what is the use of their lives? The blind have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The self-willed manmukhs are in utter darkness. Their comings and goings in reincarnation do not end; through death and rebirth, they are wasting away. || 3 ||

The bride may buy sandalwood oil and perfumes, and apply them in great quantities to her hair; she may sweeten her breath with betel leaf and camphor, but if this bride is not pleasing to her Husband Lord, then all these trappings are false. || 4 || Her enjoyment of all pleasures is futile, and all her decorations are corrupt. Until she has been pierced through with the Shabad, how can she look beautiful at Guru‟s Gate? O Nanak, blessed is that fortunate bride, who is in love with her Husband Lord. || 5 || 13 ||


SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: 

The empty body is dreadful, when the soul goes out from within.
The burning fire of life is extinguished, and the smoke of the breath no longer emerges.
The five relatives (the senses) weep and wail painfully, and waste away through the
love of duality. || 1 || 

You fool: chant the Name of the Lord, and preserve your virtue. Egotism and possessiveness are very enticing; egotistical pride has plundered everyone. || 1 || Pause || Those who have forgotten the Naam, the Name of the Lord, are
attached to affairs of duality. Attached to duality, they putrefy and die; they are filled
with the fire of desire within. Those who are protected by the Guru are saved; all others
are cheated and plundered by deceitful worldly affairs. || 2 || 

Love dies, and affection
vanishes. Hatred and alienation die. Entanglements end, and egotism dies, along with
attachment to Maya, possessiveness and anger. Those who receive His Mercy obtain
the True One. The Gurmukhs dwell forever in balanced restraint. || 3 ||

By true
actions, the True Lord is met, and the Guru‟s Teachings are found. Then, they are not
subject to birth and death; they do not come and go in reincarnation. O Nanak, they are
respected at the Lord‟s Gate; they are robed in honor in the Court of the Lord. || 4 ||
14 || 


## SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: 

The body is burnt to ashes; by its love of Maya, the
mind is rusted through. Demerits become one‟s enemies, and falsehood blows the bugle
of attack. Without the Word of the Shabad, people wander lost in reincarnation.
Through the love of duality, multitudes have been drowned. || 1 || 

O mind, swim
across, by focusing your consciousness on the Shabad. Those who do not become
Gurmukh do not understand the Naam; they die, and continue coming and going in
reincarnation. || 1 || Pause || That body is said to be pure, in which the True Name
abides. One whose body is imbued with the Fear of the True One, and whose tongue
savors Truthfulness, is brought to ecstasy by the True Lord‟s Glance of Grace. That
person does not have to go through the fire of the womb again. || 2 || 

From the True
Lord came the air, and from the air came water. From water, He created the three
worlds; in each and every heart He has infused His Light. The Immaculate Lord does
not become polluted. Attuned to the Shabad, honor is obtained. || 3 || One whose
mind is contented with Truthfulness, is blessed with the Lord‟s Glance of Grace. 

The body of the five elements is dyed in the Fear of the True One; the mind is filled
with the True Light. O Nanak, your demerits shall be forgotten; the Guru shall preserve
your honor. || 4 || 15 || 

SIREE RAAG, FIRST MEHL: O Nanak, the Boat of Truth will
ferry you across; contemplate the Guru. Some come, and some go; they are totally
filled with egotism. Through stubborn-mindedness, the intellect is drowned; one who
becomes Gurmukh and truthful is saved. || 1 || 

Without the Guru, how can anyone
swim across to find peace? As it pleases You, Lord, You save me. There is no other for
me at all. || 1 || Pause || In front of me, I see the jungle burning; behind me, I see
green plants sprouting. We shall merge into the One from whom we came. The True
One is pervading each and every heart. He Himself unites us in Union with Himself; the
True Mansion of His Presence is close at hand. || 2 || 

With each and every breath, I
dwell upon You; I shall never forget You. The more the Lord and Master dwells within
the mind, the more the Gurmukh drinks in the Ambrosial Nectar. Mind and body are
Yours; You are my Master. Please rid me of my pride, and let me merge with You. || 3
|| The One who formed this universe created the creation of the three worlds. The
Gurmukh knows the Divine Light, while the foolish self-willed manmukh gropes around
in the darkness. One who sees that Light within each and every heart understands the
Essence of the Guru‟s Teachings. || 4 || 

Those who understand are Gurmukh;
recognize and applaud them. They meet and merge with the True One. They become
the Radiant Manifestation of the Excellence of the True One. O Nanak, they are
contented with the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They offer their bodies and souls to
God. || 5 || 16 ||
