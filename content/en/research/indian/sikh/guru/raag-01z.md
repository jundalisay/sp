SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL, VANAJAARAA ~ THE MERCHANT:

The Name of the Lord, Har, Har, is Excellent and Sublime. He created everyone. The
Lord cherishes all beings. He permeates each and every heart. Meditate forever on that
Lord. Without Him, there is no other at all. Those who focus their consciousness on
emotional attachment to Maya must leave; they depart crying out in despair. Servant
Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, his only Companion in the end.
|| 1 || I have none other than You, O Lord. In the Guru‟s Sanctuary, the Lord is found,
O my merchant friend; by great good fortune, He is obtained. || 1 || Pause || 

Without the humble Saints, O Siblings of Destiny, no one has obtained the Lord‟s Name.
Those who do their deeds in ego are like the prostitute‟s son, who has no name. The
father‟s status is obtained only if the Guru is pleased and bestows His Favor. By great
good fortune, the Guru is found; embrace love for the Lord, day and night. Servant
Nanak has realized God; he sings the Lord‟s Praises through the actions he does. || 2
|| In my mind there is such a deep yearning for the Lord, Har, Har. The Perfect Guru
has implanted the Naam within me; I have found the Lord through the Lord God‟s
Name. || 1 || Pause || As long as there is youth and health, meditate on the Naam.
Along the way, the Lord shall go along with you, and in the end, He shall save you. I
am a sacrifice to those, within whose minds the Lord has come to dwell. Those who
have not remembered the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, shall leave with regret in the
end. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their foreheads, O
servant Nanak, meditate on the Naam. || 3 || O my mind, embrace love for the Lord,
Har, Har. By great good fortune, the Guru is found; through the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad, we are carried across to the other side. || 1 || Pause || The Lord Himself
creates, He Himself gives and takes away. The Lord Himself leads us astray in doubt;
the Lord Himself imparts understanding. The minds of the Gurmukhs are illuminated
and enlightened; they are so very rare. I am a sacrifice to those who find the Lord,
through the Guru‟s Teachings. Servant Nanak‟s heart-lotus has blossomed forth, and
the Lord, Har, Har, has come to dwell in the mind. || 4 || O mind, chant the Name of
the Lord, Har, Har. Hurry to the Sanctuary of the Lord, the Guru, O my soul; all the
painful residues of your past mistakes shall be taken away. || 1 || Pause || The Allpervading Lord dwells within each and every person‟s heart—how can He be obtained?
By meeting the Perfect Guru, the True Guru, the Lord comes to dwell within the
conscious mind. The Naam is my Support and Sustenance. From the Lord‟s Name, I
obtain salvation and understanding. My faith is in the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. The
Lord‟s Name is my status and honor. Servant Nanak meditates on the Naam, the Name
of the Lord; He is dyed in the deep crimson color of the Lord‟s Love. || 5 || Meditate
on the Lord, the True Lord God. Through the Guru‟s Word, you shall come to know the
Lord God. From the Lord God, everything was created. || 1 || Pause || Those who
have such pre-ordained destiny, come to the Guru and meet Him. They love to serve, O
my merchant friend, and through the Guru, they are illuminated by the Name of the
Lord, Har, Har. Blessed, blessed is the trade of those traders who have loaded the
merchandise of the Wealth of the Lord. The faces of the Gurmukhs are radiant in the
Court of the Lord; they come to the Lord and merge with Him. O servant Nanak, they
alone find the Guru, with whom the Lord, the Treasure of Excellence, is pleased. || 6 ||
Meditate on the Lord, with every breath and morsel of food. The Gurmukhs embrace
the Love of the Lord in their minds; they are continually occupied with the Lord‟s Name.
|| 1 || Pause || 1 || 


VAAR OF SIREE RAAG, FOURTH MEHL, WITH SHALOKS:
SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Among the ragas, Siree Raag is the best, if it inspires you to
enshrine love for the True Lord. The True Lord comes to abide forever in the mind, and
your understanding becomes steady and unequalled. The priceless jewel is obtained, by
contemplating the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The tongue becomes true, the mind
becomes true, and the body becomes true as well. O Nanak, forever true are the
dealings of those who serve the True Guru. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: All other loves are
transitory, as long as people do not love their Lord and Master. This mind is enticed by
Maya—it cannot see or hear. Without seeing her Husband Lord, love does not well up;
what can the blind person do? O Nanak, the True One who takes away the eyes of
spiritual wisdom—He alone can restore them. || 2 || PAUREE: The Lord alone is the
One Creator; there is only the One Court of the Lord. The One Lord‟s Command is the
One and Only—enshrine the One Lord in your consciousness. Without that Lord, there
is no other at all. Remove your fear, doubt and dread. Praise that Lord who protects
you, inside your home, and outside as well. When that Lord becomes merciful, and one
comes to chant the Lord‟s Name, one swims across the ocean of fear. || 1 || SHALOK,
FIRST MEHL: The gifts belong to our Lord and Master; how can we compete with Him?
Some remain awake and aware, and do not receive these gifts, while others are
awakened from their sleep to be blessed. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Faith, contentment
and tolerance are the food and provisions of the angels. They obtain the Perfect Vision
of the Lord, while those who gossip find no place of rest. || 2 || PAUREE: You
Yourself created all; You Yourself delegate the tasks. You Yourself are pleased,
beholding Your Own Glorious Greatness. O Lord, there is nothing at all beyond You. You
are the True Lord. You Yourself are contained in all places. Meditate on that Lord, O
Saints; He shall rescue and save you. || 2 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL: Pride in social
status is empty; pride in personal glory is useless. The One Lord gives shade to all
beings. You may call yourself good; O Nanak, this will only be known when your honor
is approved in God‟s Account. || 1 || SECOND MEHL: Die before the one whom you
love; to live after he dies is to live a worthless life in this world. || 2 || PAUREE: You
Yourself created the earth, and the two lamps of the sun and the moon. You created
the fourteen world-shops, in which Your Business is transacted. The Lord bestows His
Profits on those who become Gurmukh. The Messenger of Death does not touch those
who drink in the True Ambrosial Nectar. They themselves are saved, along with their
family, and all those who follow them are saved as well. || 3 || SHALOK, FIRST
MEHL: He created the Creative Power of the Universe, within which He dwells. 


One who reflects upon his allotted span of life, becomes the slave of God. The value of
the Creative Power of the Universe cannot be known. Even if its value were known, it
could not be described. Some think about religious rituals and regulations, but without
understanding, how can they cross over to the other side? Let sincere faith be your
bowing in prayer, and let the conquest of your mind be your objective in life. Wherever
I look, there I see God‟s Presence. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The Society of the Guru is
not obtained like this, by trying to be near or far away. O Nanak, you shall meet the
True Guru, if your mind remains in His Presence. || 2 || PAUREE: The seven islands,
seven seas, nine continents, four Vedas and eighteen Puraanas—O Lord, You pervade
and permeate all. Lord, everyone loves You. All beings and creatures meditate on You,
Lord. You hold the earth in Your Hands. I am a sacrifice to those Gurmukhs who
worship and adore the Lord. You Yourself are All-pervading; You stage this wondrous
drama! || 4 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Why ask for a pen, and why ask for ink?
Write within your heart. Remain immersed forever in the Love of your Lord and Master,
and your love for Him shall never break. Pen and ink shall pass away, along with what
has been written. O Nanak, the Love of your Husband Lord shall never perish. The True
Lord has bestowed it, as it was pre-ordained. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: That which is
seen, shall not go along with you. What does it take to make you see this? The True
Guru has implanted the True Name within; remain lovingly absorbed in the True One. O
Nanak, the Word of His Shabad is True. By His Grace, it is obtained. || 2 || PAUREE:
O Lord, You are inside and outside as well. You are the Knower of secrets. Whatever
anyone does, the Lord knows. O my mind, think of the Lord. The one who commits sins
lives in fear, while the one who lives righteously rejoices. O Lord, You Yourself are True,
and True is Your Justice. Why should anyone be afraid? O Nanak, those who recognize
the True Lord are blended with the True One. || 5 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Burn
the pen, and burn the ink; burn the paper as well. Burn the writer who writes in the
love of duality. O Nanak, people do what is pre-ordained; they cannot do anything else.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: False is other reading, and false is other speaking, in the love of
Maya. O Nanak, without the Name, nothing is permanent; those who read and read are
ruined. || 2 || PAUREE: Great is the Greatness of the Lord, and the Kirtan of the
Lord‟s Praises. Great is the Greatness of the Lord; His Justice is totally Righteous. Great
is the Greatness of the Lord; people receive the fruits of the soul. Great is the
Greatness of the Lord; He does not hear the words of the back-biters. Great is the
Greatness of the Lord; He gives His Gifts without being asked. || 6 || SHALOK,
THIRD MEHL: Those who act in ego shall all die. Their worldly possessions shall not go
along with them. Because of their love of duality, they suffer in pain. 

The Messenger of Death is watching all. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved, by
contemplating the True Name. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: We are good at talking, but our
actions are bad. Mentally, we are impure and black, but outwardly, we appear white.
We imitate those who stand and serve at the Lord‟s Door. They are attuned to the Love
of their Husband Lord, and they experience the pleasure of His Love. They remain
powerless, even while they have power; they remain humble and meek. O Nanak, our
lives become profitable if we associate with them. || 2 || PAUREE: You Yourself are
the water, You Yourself are the fish, and You Yourself are the net. You Yourself cast the
net, and You Yourself are the bait. You Yourself are the lotus, unaffected and still
brightly-colored in hundreds of feet of water. You Yourself liberate those who think of
You for even an instant. O Lord, nothing is beyond You. I am delighted to behold You,
through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. || 7 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: One who
does not know the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command cries out in terrible pain. She is filled
with deception, and she cannot sleep in peace. But if the soul-bride follows the Will of
her Lord and Master, she shall be honored in her own home, and called to the Mansion
of His Presence. O Nanak, by His Mercy, this understanding is obtained. By Guru‟s
Grace, she is absorbed into the True One. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: O self-willed
manmukh, devoid of the Naam, do not be misled upon beholding the color of the
safflower. Its color lasts for only a few days—it is worthless! Attached to duality, the
foolish, blind and stupid people waste away and die. Like worms, they live in manure,
and in it, they die over and over again. O Nanak, those who are attuned to the Naam
are dyed in the color of truth; they take on the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru.
The color of devotional worship does not fade away; they remain intuitively absorbed in
the Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: You created the entire universe, and You Yourself bring
sustenance to it. Some eat and survive by practicing fraud and deceit; from their
mouths they drop falsehood and lies. As it pleases You, You assign them their tasks.
Some understand Truthfulness; they are given the inexhaustible treasure. Those who
eat by remembering the Lord are prosperous, while those who do not remember Him
stretch out their hands in need. || 8 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The Pandits, the
religious scholars, constantly read and recite the Vedas, for the sake of the love of
Maya. In the love of duality, the foolish people have forgotten the Lord‟s Name; they
shall receive their punishment. They never think of the One who gave them body and
soul, who provides sustenance to all. The noose of death shall not be cut away from
their necks; they shall come and go in reincarnation over and over again. The blind,
self-willed manmukhs do not understand anything. They do what they are pre-ordained
to do. Through perfect destiny, they meet the True Guru, the Giver of peace, and the
Naam comes to abide in the mind. They enjoy peace, they wear peace, and they pass
their lives in the peace of peace. O Nanak, they do not forget the Naam from the mind;
they are honored in the Court of the Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Serving the True
Guru, peace is obtained. 

The True Name is the Treasure of Excellence. Follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and
recognize your own self; the Divine Light of the Lord‟s Name shall shine within. The
true ones practice Truth; greatness rests in the Great Lord. Body, soul and all things
belong to the Lord—praise Him, and offer your prayers to Him. Sing the Praises of the
True Lord through the Word of His Shabad, and you shall abide in the peace of peace.
You may practice chanting, penance and austere self-discipline within your mind, but
without the Name, life is useless. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, the Name is obtained,
while the self-willed manmukh wastes away in emotional attachment. Please protect
me, by the Pleasure of Your Will. Nanak is Your slave. || 2 || PAUREE: All are Yours,
and You belong to all. You are the wealth of all. Everyone begs from You, and all offer
prayers to You each day. Those, unto whom You give, receive everything. You are far
away from some, and You are close to others. Without You, there is not even a place to
stand begging. See this yourself and verify it in your mind. All praise You, O Lord; at
Your Door, the Gurmukhs are enlightened. || 9 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The
Pandits, the religious scholars, read and read, and shout out loud, but they are attached
to the love of Maya. They do not recognize God within themselves—they are so foolish
and ignorant! In the love of duality, they try to teach the world, but they do not
understand meditative contemplation. They lose their lives uselessly; they die, only to
be re-born, over and over again. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Those who serve the True
Guru obtain the Name. Reflect on this and understand. Eternal peace and joy abide in
their minds; they abandon their cries and complaints. Their identity consumes their
identical identity, and their minds become pure by contemplating the Word of the
Guru‟s Shabad. O Nanak, attuned to the Shabad, they are liberated. They love their
Beloved Lord. || 2 || PAUREE: Service to the Lord is fruitful; through it, the Gurmukh
is honored and approved. That person, with whom the Lord is pleased, meets with the
Guru, and meditates on the Name of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
the Lord is found. The Lord carries us across. Through stubborn-mindedness, none
have found Him; go and consult the Vedas on this. O Nanak, he alone serves the Lord,
whom the Lord attaches to Himself. || 10 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: O Nanak, he is
a brave warrior, who conquers and subdues his vicious inner ego. Praising the Naam,
the Name of the Lord, the Gurmukhs redeem their lives. They themselves are liberated
forever, and they save all their ancestors. Those who love the Naam look beauteous at
the Gate of Truth. The self-willed manmukhs die in egotism—even their death is
painfully ugly. Everything happens according to the Lord‟s Will; what can the poor
people do? Attached to self-conceit and duality, they have forgotten their Lord and
Master. O Nanak, without the Name, everything is painful, and happiness is forgotten.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: The Perfect Guru has implanted the Name of the Lord within
me. It has dispelled my doubts from within. I sing the Lord‟s Name and the Kirtan of
the Lord‟s Praises; the Divine Light shines, and now I see the Way. Conquering my ego,
I am lovingly focused on the One Lord; the Naam has come to dwell within me. 


Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I cannot be touched by the Messenger of Death. I am
absorbed in the True Name. The Creator Himself is All-pervading everywhere; He links
those with whom He is pleased to His Name. Servant Nanak chants the Naam, and so
he lives. Without the Name, he would die in an instant. || 2 || PAUREE: One who is
accepted at the Court of the Lord shall be accepted in courts everywhere. Wherever he
goes, he is recognized as honorable. Seeing his face, all sinners are saved. Within him
is the Treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Through the Naam, he is exalted.
He worships the Name, and believes in the Name; the Name erases all his sinful
mistakes. Those who meditate on the Name, with one-pointed mind and focused
consciousness, remain forever stable in the world. || 11 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL:
Worship the Divine, Supreme Soul, with the intuitive peace and poise of the Guru. If the
individual soul has faith in the Supreme Soul, then it shall obtain realization within its
own home. The soul becomes steady, and does not waver, by the natural inclination of
the Guru‟s Loving Will. Without the Guru, intuitive wisdom does not come, and the filth
of greed does not depart from within. If the Lord‟s Name abides within the mind, for a
moment, even for an instant, it is like bathing at all the sixty-eight sacred shrines of
pilgrimage. Filth does not stick to those who are true, but filth attaches itself to those
who love duality. This filth cannot be washed off, even by bathing at the sixty-eight
sacred shrines of pilgrimage. The self-willed manmukh does deeds in egotism; he earns
only pain and more pain. O Nanak, the filthy ones become clean only when they meet
and surrender to the True Guru. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The self-willed manmukhs may
be taught, but how can they really be taught? The manmukhs do not fit in at all.
Because of their past actions, they are condemned to the cycle of reincarnation. Loving
attention to the Lord and attachment to Maya are the two separate ways; all act
according to the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command. The Gurmukh has conquered his own
mind, by applying the Touchstone of the Shabad. He fights with his mind, he settles
with his mind, and he is at peace with his mind. All obtain the desires of their minds,
through the Love of the True Word of the Shabad. They drink in the Ambrosial Nectar
of the Naam forever; this is how the Gurmukhs act. Those who struggle with something
other than their own mind, shall depart having wasted their lives. The self-willed
manmukhs, through stubborn-mindedness and the practice of falsehood, lose the game
of life. Those who conquer their own mind, by Guru‟s Grace, lovingly focus their
attention on the Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs practice Truth, while the self-willed
manmukhs continue coming and going in reincarnation. || 2 || PAUREE: O Saints of
the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, listen, and hear the Lord‟s Teachings, through the True
Guru. Those who have good destiny pre-ordained and inscribed on their foreheads,
grasp it and keep it enshrined in the heart. Through the Guru‟s Teachings, they
intuitively taste the sublime, exquisite and ambrosial sermon of the Lord. The Divine
Light shines in their hearts, and like the sun which removes the darkness of night, it
dispels the darkness of ignorance. As Gurmukh, they behold with their eyes the Unseen,
Imperceptible, Unknowable, Immaculate Lord. || 12 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: 

Those who serve their True Guru are certified and accepted. They eradicate selfishness
and conceit from within; they remain lovingly absorbed in the True One. Those who do
not serve the True Guru waste away their lives in vain. O Nanak, the Lord does just as
He pleases. No one has any say in this. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: With the mind encircled
by wickedness and evil, people do evil deeds. The ignorant worship the love of duality;
in the Lord‟s Court they shall be punished. So worship the Lord, the Light of the soul;
without the True Guru, understanding is not obtained. Meditation, penance and austere
self-discipline are found by surrendering to the True Guru‟s Will. By His Grace this is
received. O Nanak, serve with this intuitive awareness; only that which is pleasing to
the Lord is approved. || 2 || PAUREE: Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my
mind; it will bring you eternal peace, day and night. Chant the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, O my mind; meditating on it, all sins and misdeeds shall be erased. Chant the
Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; through it, all poverty, pain and hunger shall
be removed. Chant the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O my mind; as Gurmukh, declare
your love. One who has such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon his forehead by the
True Lord, chants the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 13 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL:
Those who do not serve the True Guru, and who do not contemplate the Word of the
Shabad—spiritual wisdom does not enter into their hearts; they are like dead bodies in
the world. They go through the cycle of 8.4 million reincarnations, and they are ruined
through death and rebirth. He alone serves the True Guru, whom the Lord Himself
inspires to do so. The Treasure of the Naam is within the True Guru; by His Grace, it is
obtained. Those who are truly attuned to the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad—their love is
forever True. O Nanak, those who are united with Him shall not be separated again.
They merge imperceptibly into God. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: One who knows the
Benevolent Lord God is the true devotee of Bhagaautee. By Guru‟s Grace, he is selfrealized. He restrains his wandering mind, and brings it back to its own home within the
self. He remains dead while yet alive, and he chants the Name of the Lord. Such a
Bhagaautee is most exalted. O Nanak, he merges into the True One. || 2 || THIRD
MEHL: He is full of deceit, and yet he calls himself a devotee of Bhagaautee. Through
hypocrisy, he shall never attain the Supreme Lord God. He slanders others, and pollutes
himself with his own filth. Outwardly, he washes off the filth, but the impurity of his
mind does not go away. He argues with the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Night
and day, he suffers, engrossed in the love of duality. He does not remember the Name
of the Lord, but still, he performs all sorts of empty rituals. That which is pre-ordained
cannot be erased. O Nanak, without serving the True Guru, liberation is not obtained.
|| 3 || PAUREE: Those who meditate on the True Guru shall not be burnt to ashes.
Those who meditate on the True Guru are satisfied and fulfilled. Those who meditate
on the True Guru are not afraid of the Messenger of Death. 

Those upon whom the Lord showers His Mercy, fall at the Feet of the True Guru. Here
and hereafter, their faces are radiant; they go to the Lord‟s Court in robes of honor. ||
14 || SHALOK, SECOND MEHL: Chop off that head which does not bow to the Lord.
O Nanak, that human body, in which there is no pain of separation from the Lord—take
that body and burn it. || 1 || FIFTH MEHL: Forgetting the Primal Lord, O Nanak,
people are born and die, over and over again. Mistaking it for musk, they have fallen
into the stinking pit of filth. || 2 || PAUREE: Meditate on that Name of the Lord, O my
mind, whose Command rules over all. Chant that Name of the Lord, O my mind, which
will save you at the very last moment. Chant that Name of the Lord, O my mind, which
shall drive out all hunger and desire from your mind. Very fortunate and blessed is that
Gurmukh who chants the Naam; it shall bring all slanderers and wicked enemies to fall
at his feet. O Nanak, worship and adore the Naam, the Greatest Name of all, before
which all come and bow. || 15 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: She may wear good
clothes, but the bride is ugly and rude; her mind is false and impure. She does not walk
in harmony with the Will of her Husband Lord. Instead, she foolishly gives Him orders.
But she who walks in harmony with the Guru‟s Will, shall be spared all pain and
suffering. That destiny which was pre-ordained by the Creator cannot be erased. She
must dedicate her mind and body to her Husband Lord, and enshrine love for the Word
of the Shabad. Without His Name, no one has found Him; see this and reflect upon it in
your heart. O Nanak, she is beautiful and graceful; the Creator Lord ravishes and enjoys
her. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Attachment to Maya is an ocean of darkness; neither this
shore nor the one beyond can be seen. The ignorant, self-willed manmukhs suffer in
terrible pain; they forget the Lord‟s Name and drown. They arise in the morning and
perform all sorts of rituals, but they are caught in the love of duality. Those who serve
the True Guru cross over the terrifying world-ocean. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs keep the
True Name enshrined in their hearts; they are absorbed into the True One. || 2 ||
PAUREE: The Lord pervades and permeates the water, the land and the sky; there is
no other at all. The Lord Himself sits upon His Throne and administers justice. He beats
and drives out the false-hearted. The Lord bestows glorious greatness upon those who
are truthful. He administers righteous justice. So praise the Lord, everybody; He
protects the poor and the lost souls. He honors the righteous and punishes the sinners.
|| 16 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: The self-willed manmukh, the foolish bride, is a
filthy, rude and evil wife. Forsaking her Husband Lord and leaving her own home, she
gives her love to another. Her desires are never satisfied, and she burns and cries out
in pain. O Nanak, without the Name, she is ugly and ungraceful. 

She is abandoned and left behind by her Husband Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: The
happy soul-bride is attuned to the Word of the Shabad; she is in love with the True
Guru. She continually enjoys and ravishes her Beloved, with true love and affection. She
is such a loveable, beautiful and noble woman. O Nanak, through the Naam, the happy
soul-bride unites with the Lord of Union. || 2 || PAUREE: Lord, everyone sings Your
Praises. You have freed us from bondage. Lord, everyone bows in reverence to You.
You have saved us from our sinful ways. Lord, You are the Honor of the dishonored.
Lord, You are the Strongest of the strong. The Lord beats down the egocentrics and
corrects the foolish, self-willed manmukhs. The Lord bestows glorious greatness on His
devotees, the poor, and the lost souls. || 17 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: One who
walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru, obtains the greatest glory. The Exalted
Name of the Lord abides in his mind, and no one can take it away. That person, upon
whom the Lord bestows His Grace, receives His Mercy. O Nanak, creativity is under the
control of the Creator; how rare are those who, as Gurmukh, realize this! || 1 ||
THIRD MEHL: O Nanak, those who worship and adore the Lord‟s Name night and day,
vibrate the String of the Lord‟s Love. Maya, the maid-servant of our Lord and Master,
serves them. The Perfect One has made them perfect; by the Hukam of His Command,
they are embellished. By Guru‟s Grace, they understand Him, and they find the gate of
salvation. The self-willed manmukhs do not know the Lord‟s Command; they are beaten
down by the Messenger of Death. But the Gurmukhs, who worship and adore the Lord,
cross over the terrifying world-ocean. All their demerits are erased, and replaced with
merits. The Guru Himself is their Forgiver. || 2 || PAUREE: The Lord‟s devotees have
faith in Him. The Lord knows everything. No one is as great a Knower as the Lord; the
Lord administers righteous justice. Why should we feel any burning anxiety, since the
Lord does not punish without just cause? True is the Master, and True is His Justice;
only the sinners are defeated. O devotees, praise the Lord with your palms pressed
together; the Lord saves His humble devotees. || 18 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Oh,
if only I could meet my Beloved, and keep Him enshrined deep within my heart! I praise
that God forever and ever, through love and affection for the Guru. O Nanak, that one
upon whom He bestows His Glance of Grace is united with Him; such a person is the
true soul-bride of the Lord. || 1 || THIRD MEHL: Serving the Guru, the Lord is
obtained, when He bestows His Glance of Grace. They are transformed from humans
into angels, meditating on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. They conquer their egotism
and merge with the Lord; they are saved through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. O
Nanak, they merge imperceptibly into the Lord, who has bestowed His Favor upon
them. || 2 || PAUREE: The Lord Himself inspires us to worship Him; He reveals His
Glorious Greatness. He Himself inspires us to place our faith in Him. 

Thus He performs His Own Service. The Lord bestows bliss upon His devotees, and
gives them a seat in the eternal home. He does not give the sinners any stability or
place of rest; He consigns them to the depths of hell. The Lord blesses His devotees
with His Love; He sides with them and saves them. || 19 || SHALOK, FIRST MEHL:
False-mindedness is the drummer-woman; cruelty is the butcheress; slander of others
in one‟s heart is the cleaning-woman, and deceitful anger is the outcast-woman. What
good are the ceremonial lines drawn around your kitchen, when these four are seated
there with you? Make Truth your self-discipline, and make good deeds the lines you
draw; make chanting the Name your cleansing bath. O Nanak, those who do not walk in
the ways of sin, shall be exalted in the world hereafter. || 1 || FIRST MEHL: Which is
the swan, and which is the crane? It is only by His Glance of Grace. Whoever is pleasing
to Him, O Nanak, is transformed from a crow into a swan. || 2 || PAUREE: Whatever
work you wish to accomplish—tell it to the Lord. He will resolve your affairs; the True
Guru gives His Guarantee of Truth. In the Society of the Saints, you shall taste the
treasure of the Ambrosial Nectar. The Lord is the Merciful Destroyer of fear; He
preserves and protects His slaves. O Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and
see the Unseen Lord God. || 20 || SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: Body and soul, all belong
to Him. He gives His Support to all. O Nanak, become Gurmukh and serve Him, who is
forever and ever the Giver. I am a sacrifice to those who meditate on the Formless
Lord. Their faces are forever radiant, and the whole world bows in reverence to them.
|| 1 || THIRD MEHL: Meeting the True Guru, I am totally transformed; I have
obtained the nine treasures to use and consume. The Siddhis—the eighteen
supernatural spiritual powers—follow in my footsteps; I dwell in my own home, within
my own self. The Unstruck Melody constantly vibrates within; my mind is exalted and
uplifted—I am lovingly absorbed in the Lord. O Nanak, devotion to the Lord abides
within the minds of those who have such pre-ordained destiny written on their
foreheads. || 2 || PAUREE: I am a minstrel of the Lord God, my Lord and Master; I
have come to the Lord‟s Door. The Lord has heard my sad cries from within; He has
called me, His minstrel, into His Presence. The Lord called His minstrel in, and asked,
“Why have you come here?” “O Merciful God, please grant me the gift of continual
meditation on the Lord‟s Name.” And so the Lord, the Great Giver, inspired Nanak to
chant the Lord‟s Name, and blessed him with robes of honor. || 21 || 1 || SUDH ||

SIREE RAAG, KABEER JEE: TO BE SUNG TO THE TUNE OF “AYK SU-AAN” :
The mother thinks that her son is growing up; she does not understand that, day by
day, his life is diminishing. 

Calling him, “Mine, mine”, she fondles him lovingly, while the Messenger of Death looks
on and laughs. || 1 || You have misled the world so deeply in doubt. How can people
understand You, when they are entranced by Maya? || 1 || Pause || Says Kabeer,
give up the pleasures of corruption, or else you will surely die of them. Meditate on the
Lord, O mortal being, through the Word of His Bani; you shall be blessed with eternal
life. In this way, shall you cross over the terrifying world-ocean. || 2 || As it pleases
Him, people embrace love for the Lord, and doubt and delusion are dispelled from
within. Intuitive peace and poise well up within, and the intellect is awakened to
spiritual wisdom. By Guru‟s Grace, the inner being is touched by the Lord‟s Love. || 3 ||
In this association, there is no death. Recognizing the Hukam of His Command, you
shall meet with your Lord and Master. || 1 || Second Pause || SIREE RAAG,
TRILOCHAN: The mind is totally attached to Maya; the mortal has forgotten his fear of
old age and death. Gazing upon his family, he blossoms forth like the lotus flower; the
deceitful person watches and covets the homes of others. || 1 || When the powerful
Messenger of Death comes, no one can stand against his awesome power. Rare, very
rare, is that friend who comes and says, “O my Beloved, take me into Your Embrace! O
my Lord, please save me!” || 1 || Pause || Indulging in all sorts of princely
pleasures, O mortal, you have forgotten God; you have fallen into the world-ocean, and
you think that you have become immortal. Cheated and plundered by Maya, you do not
think of God, and you waste your life in laziness. || 2 || The path you must walk is
treacherous and terrifying, O mortal; neither the sun nor the moon shine there. Your
emotional attachment to Maya will be forgotten, when you have to leave this world. ||
3 || Today, it became clear to my mind that the Righteous Judge of Dharma is
watching us. His messengers, with their awesome power, crush people between their
hands; I cannot stand against them. || 4 || If someone is going to teach me
something, let it be that the Lord is pervading the forests and fields. O Dear Lord, You
Yourself know everything; so prays Trilochan, Lord. || 5 || 2 || SIREE RAAG,
DEVOTEE KABEER JEE: Listen, O religious scholar: the One Lord alone is Wondrous; no
one can describe Him. He fascinates the angels, the celestial singers and the heavenly
musicians; he has strung the three worlds upon His Thread. || 1 || The Unstruck
Melody of the Sovereign Lord‟s Harp vibrates; by His Glance of Grace, we are lovingly
attuned to the Sound-current of the Naad. || 1 || Pause || The Tenth Gate of my
crown chakra is the distilling fire, and the channels of the Ida and Pingala are the
funnels, to pour in and empty out the golden vat. Into that vat, there trickles a gentle
stream of the most sublime and pure essence of all distilled essences. || 2 ||
Something wonderful has happened—the breath has become the cup. In all the three
worlds, such a Yogi is unique. What king can compare to him? || 3 || This spiritual
wisdom of God, the Supreme Soul, has illuminated my being. Says Kabeer, I am
attuned to His Love. All the rest of the world is deluded by doubt, while my mind is
intoxicated with the Sublime Essence of the Lord. || 4 || 3 || 


SREE RAAG, THE WORD OF DEVOTEE BAYNEE JEE: TO BE SUNG TO THE
TUNE OF “PEHRAY”:

O man, when you were coiled in the cradle of the womb, upside-down, you were
absorbed in meditation. You took no pride in your perishable body; night and day were
all the same to you—you lived unknowing, in the silence of the void. Remember the
terrible pain and suffering of those days, now that you have spread out the net of your
consciousness far and wide. Leaving the womb, you entered this mortal world; you
have forgotten the Lord from your mind. || 1 || Later, you will regret and repent—you
fool! Why are you engrossed in evil-mindedness and skepticism? Think of the Lord, or
else you shall be led to the City of Death. Why are you wandering around, out of
control? || 1 || Pause || You play like a child, craving sweets; moment by moment,
you become more entangled in emotional attachment. Tasting good and bad, you eat
nectar and then poison, and then the five passions appear and torture you. Abandoning
meditation, penance and self-restraint, and the wisdom of good actions, you do not
worship and adore the Lord‟s Name. You are overflowing with sexual desire, and your
intellect is stained with darkness; you are held in the grip of Shakti‟s power. || 2 || In
the heat of youthful passion, you look with desire upon the faces of other men‟s wives;
you do not distinguish between good and evil. Drunk with sexual desire and other great
sins, you go astray, and do not distinguish between vice and virtue. Gazing upon your
children and your property, your mind is proud and arrogant; you cast out the Lord
from your heart. When others die, you measure your own wealth in your mind; you
waste your life in the pleasures of the mouth and sexual organs. || 3 || Your hair is
whiter than the jasmine flower, and your voice has grown feeble, as if it comes from
the seventh underworld. Your eyes water, and your intellect and strength have left you;
but still, your sexual desire churns and drives you on. And so, your intellect has dried
up through corruption, and the lotus flower of your body has wilted and withered. You
have forsaken the Bani, the Word of the Immortal Lord, in this mortal world; in the end,
you shall regret and repent. || 4 || Gazing upon the tiny bodies of your children, love
has welled up within your heart; you are proud of them, but you do not understand.
You long for the dignity of a long life, but your eyes can no longer see anything. Your
light has gone out, and the bird of your mind has flown away; you are no longer
welcome in your own home and courtyard. Says Baynee, listen, O devotee: who has
ever attained liberation after such a death? || 5 || SREE RAAG: You are me, and I am
You—what is the difference between us? We are like gold and the bracelet, or water
and the waves. || 1 || If I did not commit any sins, O Infinite Lord, how would You
have acquired the name, „Redeemer of sinners‟? || 1 || Pause || You are my Master,
the Inner-knower, Searcher of hearts. The servant is known by his God, and the Lord
and Master is known by His servant. || 2 || Grant me the wisdom to worship and
adore You with my body. O Ravi Daas, one who understands that the Lord is equally in
all, is very rare. || 3 ||
