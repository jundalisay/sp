RAAG JAIJAAVANTEE, NINTH MEHL:

Meditate in remembrance on the Lord — meditate on the Lord; this alone shall be of
use to you. Abandon your association with Maya, and take shelter in the Sanctuary of
God. Remember that the pleasures of the world are false; this whole show is just an
illusion. || 1 || Pause || You must understand that this wealth is just a dream. Why
are you so proud? The empires of the earth are like walls of sand. || 1 || Servant
Nanak speaks the Truth: your body shall perish and pass away. Moment by moment,
yesterday passed. Today is passing as well. || 2 || 1 || JAIJAAVANTEE, NINTH MEHL:
Meditate on the Lord — vibrate on the Lord; your life is slipping away. Why am I telling
you this again and again? You fool — why don‟t you understand? Your body is like a
hail-stone; it melts away in no time at all. || 1 || Pause || So give up all your doubts,
and utter the Naam, the Name of the Lord. At the very last moment, this alone shall go
along with you. || 1 || Forget the poisonous sins of corruption, and enshrine the
Praises of God in your heart. Servant Nanak proclaims that this opportunity is slipping
away. || 2 || 2 || JAIJAAVANTEE, NINTH MEHL: O mortal, what will your condition
be? In this world, you have not listened to the Lord‟s Name. You are totally engrossed
in corruption and sin; you have not turned your mind away from them at all. || 1 ||
Pause || You obtained this human life, but you have not remembered the Lord in
meditation, even for an instant. For the sake of pleasure, you have become subservient
to your woman, and now your feet are bound. || 1 || Servant Nanak proclaims that
the vast expanse of this world is just a dream. Why not meditate on the Lord? Even
Maya is His slave. || 2 || 3 || JAIJAAVANTEE, NINTH MEHL: Slipping away — your
life is uselessly slipping away. Night and day, you listen to the Puraanas, but you do not
understand them, you ignorant fool! 

Death has arrived; now where will you run? || 1 || Pause || You believed that this
body was permanent, but it shall turn to dust. Why don‟t you chant the Name of the
Lord, you shameless fool? || 1 || Let devotional worship of the Lord enter into your
heart, and abandon the intellectualism of your mind. O Servant Nanak, this is the way
to live in the world. || 2 || 4 ||

SHALOK SEHSKRITEE, FIRST MEHL:

You study the scriptures, say your prayers and argue; you worship stones and sit like a
crane, pretending to meditate. You speak lies and well-ornamented falsehood, and
recite your daily prayers three times a day. The mala is around your neck, and the
sacred tilak mark is on your forehead. You wear two loin cloths, and keep your head
covered. If you know God and the nature of karma, you know that all these rituals and
beliefs are useless. Says Nanak, meditate on the Lord with faith. Without the True Guru,
no one finds the Way. || 1 || The mortal‟s life is fruitless, as long as he does not
know God. Only a few, by Guru‟s Grace, cross over the world-ocean. The Creator, the
Cause of causes, is All-powerful. Thus speaks Nanak, after deep deliberation. The
Creation is under the control of the Creator. By His Power, He sustains and supports it.
|| 2 || The Shabad is Yoga, the Shabad is spiritual wisdom; the Shabad is the Vedas
for the Brahmin. The Shabad is heroic bravery for the Khshaatriya; the Shabad is
service to others for the Soodra. The Shabad for all is the Shabad, the Word of the One
God, for one who knows this secret. Nanak is the slave of the Divine, Immaculate Lord.
|| 3 || The One Lord is the Divinity of all divinities. He is the Divinity of the soul.
Nanak is the slave of that one who knows the Secrets of the soul and the Supreme Lord
God. He is the Divine Immaculate Lord Himself. 

|| 4 ||

SHALOK SEHSKRITEE, FIRST MEHL:

Who is the mother, and who is the father? Who is the son, and what is the pleasure of
marriage? Who is the brother, friend, companion and relative? Who is emotionally
attached to the family? Who is restlessly attached to beauty? It leaves, as soon as we
see it. Only the meditative remembrance of God remains with us. 

O Nanak, it brings the blessings of the Saints, the sons of the Imperishable Lord. || 1
|| Cursed is loving attachment to one‟s mother and father; cursed is loving attachment
to one‟s siblings and relatives. Cursed is attachment to the joys of family life with one‟s
spouse and children. Cursed is attachment to household affairs. Only loving attachment
to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is True. Nanak dwells there in peace. ||
2 || The body is false; its power is temporary. It grows old; its love for Maya increases
greatly. The human is only a temporary guest in the home of the body, but he has high
hopes. The Righteous Judge of Dharma is relentless; he counts each and every breath.
The human body, so difficult to obtain, has fallen into the deep dark pit of emotional
attachment. O Nanak, its only support is God, the Essence of Reality. O God, Lord of
the World, Lord of the Universe, Master of the Universe, please be kind to me. || 3 ||
This fragile body-fortress is made up of water, plastered with blood and wrapped in
skin. It has nine gates, but no doors; it is supported by pillars of wind, the channels of
the breath. The ignorant person does not meditate in remembrance on the Lord of the
Universe; he thinks that this body is permanent. This precious body is saved and
redeemed in the Sanctuary of the Holy, O Nanak, chanting the Name of the Lord, Har,
Har, Har, Har, Har, Haray. || 4 || O Glorious, Eternal and Imperishable, Perfect and
Abundantly Compassionate, Profound and Unfathomable, Lofty and Exalted, All-knowing
and Infinite Lord God. O Lover of Your devoted servants, Your Feet are a Sanctuary of
Peace. O Master of the masterless, Helper of the helpless, Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary.
|| 5 || Seeing the deer, the hunter aims his weapons. But if one is protected by the
Lord of the World, O Nanak, not a hair on his head will be touched. || 6 || He may be
surrounded on all four sides by servants and powerful warriors; he may dwell in a lofty
place, difficult to approach, and never even think of death. But when the Order comes
from the Primal Lord God, O Nanak, even an ant can take away his breath of life. || 7
|| To be imbued and attuned to the Word of the Shabad; to be kind and
compassionate; to sing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises — these are the most worthwhile
actions in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. In this way, one‟s inner doubts and emotional
attachments are dispelled. God is pervading and permeating all places. So obtain the
Blessed Vision of His Darshan; He dwells upon the tongues of the Holy. O Nanak,
meditate and chant the Name of the Beloved Lord, Har, Har, Har, Haray. || 8 ||
Beauty fades away, islands fade away, the sun, moon, stars and sky fade away. The
earth, mountains, forests and lands fade away. One‟s spouse, children, siblings and
loved friends fade away. Gold and jewels and the incomparable beauty of Maya fade
away. Only the Eternal, Unchanging Lord does not fade away. O Nanak, only the
humble Saints are steady and stable forever. || 9 || Do not delay in practicing
righteousness; delay in committing sins. Implant the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
within yourself, and abandon greed. In the Sanctuary of the Saints, the sinful residues
of past mistakes are erased. The character of righteousness is received by that person,
O Nanak, with whom the Lord is pleased and satisfied. || 10 || The person of shallow
understanding is dying in emotional attachment; he is engrossed in pursuits of pleasure
with his wife. With youthful beauty and golden earrings, wondrous mansions,
decorations and clothes — this is how Maya clings to him. O Eternal, Unchanging,
Benevolent Lord God, O Sanctuary of the Saints, Nanak humbly bows to You. || 11 ||
If there is birth, then there is death. If there is pleasure, then there is pain. If there is
enjoyment, then there is disease. If there is high, then there is low. 

If there is small, then there is great. If there is power, then there is pride. If there is
egotistical pride, then there will be a fall. Engrossed in worldly ways, one is ruined.
Meditating and vibrating on the Lord of the Universe in the Company of the Holy, you
shall become steady and stable. Nanak vibrates and meditates on the Lord God. || 12
|| By the Grace of God, genuine understanding comes to the mind. The intellect
blossoms forth, and one finds a place in the realm of celestial bliss. The senses are
brought under control, and pride is abandoned. The heart is cooled and soothed, and
the wisdom of the Saints is implanted within. Reincarnation is ended, and the Blessed
Vision of the Lord‟s Darshan is obtained. O Nanak, the musical instrument of the Word
of the Shabad vibrates and resounds within. || 13 || The Vedas preach and recount
God‟s Glories; people hear them by various ways and means. The Merciful Lord, Har,
Har, implants spiritual wisdom within. Nanak begs for the Gift of the Naam, the Name of
the Lord. The Guru is the Great Giver, the Lord of the World. || 14 || Do not worry so
much about your mother, father and siblings. Do not worry so much about other
people. Do not worry about your spouse, children and friends. You are obsessed with
your involvements in Maya. The One Lord God is Kind and Compassionate, O Nanak. He
is the Cherisher and Nurturer of all living beings. || 15 || Wealth is temporary;
conscious existence is temporary; hopes of all sorts are temporary. The bonds of love,
attachment, egotism, doubt, Maya and the pollution of corruption are temporary. The
mortal passes through the fire of the womb of reincarnation countless times. He does
not remember the Lord in meditation; his understanding is polluted. O Lord of the
Universe, when You grant Your Grace, even sinners are saved. Nanak dwells in the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. || 16 || You may drop down from the
mountains, and fall into the nether regions of the underworld, or be burnt in the blazing
fire, or swept away by the unfathomable waves of water; but the worst pain of all is
household anxiety, which is the source of the cycle of death and rebirth. No matter
what you do, you cannot break its bonds, O Nanak. Man‟s only Support, Anchor and
Mainstay is the Word of the Shabad, and the Holy, Friendly Saints. || 17 ||
Excruciating pain, countless killings, reincarnation, poverty and terrible misery are all
destroyed by meditating in remembrance on the Lord‟s Name, O Nanak, just as fire
reduces piles of wood to ashes. || 18 || Meditating in remembrance on the Lord, the
darkness is illuminated. Dwelling on His Glorious Praises, the ugly residues of sins are
destroyed. Enshrining the Lord deep within the heart, and with the immaculate karma
of doing good deeds, one strikes fear into the demons. The cycle of coming and going
in reincarnation is ended, absolute peace is obtained, and the Fruitful Vision of the
Lord‟s Darshan. He is Potent to give Protection, He is the Lover of His Saints. O Nanak,
the Lord God blesses all with bliss. || 19 || Those who were left behind — the Lord
brings them to the front. He fulfills the hopes of the hopeless. He makes the poor rich,
and cures the illnesses of the ill. He blesses His devotees with devotion. They sing the
Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord‟s Name. O Nanak, those who serve the Guru find the
Supreme Lord God, the Great Giver || 20 || He gives Support to the unsupported. The
Name of the Lord is the Wealth of the poor. The Lord of the Universe is the Master of
the masterless; the Beautiful-haired Lord is the Power of the weak. The Lord is Merciful
to all beings, Eternal and Unchanging, the Family of the meek and humble. The Allknowing, Perfect, Primal Lord God is the Lover of His devotees, the Embodiment of
Mercy. 

The Supreme Lord God, the Transcendent, Luminous Lord, dwells in each and every
heart. Nanak begs for this blessing from the Merciful Lord, that he may never forget
Him, never forget Him. || 21 || I have no power; I do not serve You, and I do not
love You, O Supreme Sublime Lord God. By Your Grace, Nanak meditates on the Naam,
the Name of the Merciful Lord, Har, Har. || 22 || The Lord feeds and sustains all living
beings; He blesses them gifts of restful peace and fine clothes. He created the jewel of
human life, with all its cleverness and intelligence. By His Grace, mortals abide in peace
and bliss. O Nanak, meditating in remembrance on the Lord, Har, Har, Haray, the
mortal is released from attachment to the world. || 23 || The kings of the earth are
eating up the blessings of the good karma of their past lives. Those cruel-minded rulers
who oppress the people, O Nanak, shall suffer in pain for a very long time. || 24 ||
Those who meditate in remembrance on the Lord in their hearts, look upon even pain
as God‟s Grace. The healthy person is very sick, if he does not remember the Lord, the
Embodiment of Mercy. || 25 || To sing the Kirtan of God‟s Praises is the righteous
duty incurred by taking birth in this human body. The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is
Ambrosial Nectar, O Nanak. The Saints drink it in, and never have enough of it. || 26 ||
The Saints are tolerant and good-natured; friends and enemies are the same to them.
O Nanak, it is all the same to them, whether someone offers them all sorts of foods, or
slanders them, or draws weapons to kill them. || 27 || They pay no attention to
dishonor or disrespect. They are not bothered by gossip; the miseries of the world do
not touch them. Those who join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, and chant
the Name of the Lord of the Universe — O Nanak, those mortals abide in peace. || 28
|| The Holy people are an invincible army of spiritual warriors; their bodies are
protected by the armor of humility. Their weapons are the Glorious Praises of the Lord
which they chant; their Shelter and Shield is the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The
horses, chariots and elephants they ride are their way to realize God‟s Path. They walk
fearlessly through the armies of their enemies; they attack them with the Kirtan of
God‟s Praises. They conquer the entire world, O Nanak, and overpower the five thieves.
|| 29 || Misled by evil-mindedness, mortals are engrossed in the mirage of the illusory
world, like the passing shade of a tree. Emotional attachment to family is false, so
Nanak meditates in remembrance on the Name of the Lord, Raam, Raam. || 30 || I
do not possess the treasure of the wisdom of the Vedas, nor do I possess the merits of
the Praises of the Naam. I do not have a beautiful voice to sing jewelled melodies; I am
not clever, wise or shrewd. By destiny and hard work, the wealth of Maya is obtained. O
Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, even fools become religious
scholars. || 31 || The mala around my neck is the chanting of the Lord‟s Name. The
Love of the Lord is my silent chanting. Chanting this most Sublime Word brings
salvation and joy to the eyes. || 32 || That mortal who lacks the Guru‟s Mantra —
cursed and contaminated is his life. That blockhead is just a dog, a pig, a jackass, a
crow, a snake. || 33 || 

Whoever contemplates the Lord‟s Lotus Feet, and enshrines His Name within the heart,
and sings the Kirtan of His Praises in the Saadh Sangat, O Nanak, shall never see the
Messenger of Death. || 34 || Wealth and beauty are not so difficult to obtain.
Paradise and royal power are not so difficult to obtain. Foods and delicacies are not so
difficult to obtain. Elegant clothes are not so difficuilt to obtain. Children, friends,
siblings and relatives are not so difficult to obtain. The pleasures of woman are not so
difficult to obtain. Knowledge and wisdom are not so difficult to obtain. Cleverness and
trickery are not so difficult to obtain. Only the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is difficult
to obtain. O Nanak, it is only obtained by God‟s Grace, in the Saadh Sangat, the
Company of the Holy. || 35 || Wherever I look, I see the Lord, whether in this world,
in paradise, or the nether regions of the underworld. The Lord of the Universe is Allpervading everywhere. O Nanak, no blame or stain sticks to Him. || 36 || Poison is transformed into nectar, and enemies into friends and companions. Pain is changed into
pleasure, and the fearful become fearless. Those who have no home or place find their
place of rest in the Naam, O Nanak, when the Guru, the Lord, becomes Merciful. || 37
|| He blesses all with humility; He has blessed me with humility as well. He purifies all,
and He has purified me as well. The Creator of all is the Creator of me as well. O
Nanak, no blame or stain sticks to Him. || 38 || The moon-god is not cool and calm,
nor is the white sandalwood tree. The winter season is not cool; O Nanak, only the Holy
friends, the Saints, are cool and calm. || 39 || Through the Mantra of the Name of the
Lord, Raam, Raam, one meditates on the All-pervading Lord. Those who have the
wisdom to look alike upon pleasure and pain, live the immaculate lifestyle, free of
vengeance. They are kind to all beings; they have overpowered the five thieves. They
take the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praise as their food; they remain untouched by Maya, like
the lotus in the water. They share the Teachings with friend and enemy alike; they love
the devotional worship of God. They do not listen to slander; renouncing self-conceit,
they become the dust of all. Whoever has these six qualities, O Nanak, is called a Holy
friend. || 40 || The goat enjoys eating fruits and roots, but if it lives near a tiger, it is
always anxious. This is the condition of the world, O Nanak; it is afflicted by pleasure
and pain. || 41 || Fraud, false accusations, millions of diseases, sins and the filthy
residues of evil mistakes; doubt, emotional attachment, pride, dishonor and intoxication
with Maya — these lead mortals to death and rebirth, wandering lost in hell. In spite of
all sorts of efforts, salvation is not found. Chanting and meditating on the Name of the
Lord in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, mortals become
immaculate and pure. They continually dwell upon the Glorious Praises of God. || 42 ||
In the Sanctuary of the Kind-hearted Lord, our Transcendent Lord and Master, we are
carried across. God is the Perfect, All-powerful Cause of causes; He is the Giver of gifts.
He gives hope to the hopeless. He is the Source of all riches. Nanak meditates in
remembrance on the Treasure of Virtue; we are all beggars, begging at His Door. || 43
|| The most difficult place becomes easy, and the worst pain turns into pleasure. Evil
words, differences and doubts are obliterated, and even faithless cynics and malicious
gossips become good people. They become steady and stable, whether happy or sad;
their fears are taken away, and they are fearless. 


The dreadful woods become a well-populated city; such are the merits of the righteous
life of Dharma, given by God‟s Grace. Chanting the Lord‟s Name in the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, the Lotus Feet of the Merciful Lord are found. || 44
|| O emotional attachment, you are the invincible warrior of the battlefield of life; you
totally crush and destroy even the most powerful. You entice and fascinate even the
heavenly heralds, celestial singers, gods, mortals, beasts and birds. Nanak bows in
humble surrender to the Lord; he seeks the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe. ||
45 || O sexual desire, you lead the mortals to hell; you make them wander in
reincarnation through countless species. You cheat the consciousness, and pervade the
three worlds. You destroy meditation, penance and virtue. But you give only shallow
pleasure, while you make the mortals weak and unsteady; you pervade the high and
the low. Your fear is dispelled in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak,
through the Protection and Support of the Lord. || 46 || O anger, you are the root of
conflict; compassion never rises up in you. You take the corrupt, sinful beings in your
power, and make them dance like monkeys. Associating with you, mortals are debased
and punished by the Messenger of Death in so many ways. O Destroyer of the pains of
the poor, O Merciful God, Nanak prays for You to protect all begins from such anger. ||
47 || O greed, you cling to even the great, assaulting them with countless waves. You
cause them to run around wildly in all directions, wobbling and wavering unsteadily.
You have no respect for friends, ideals, relations, mother or father. You make them do
what they should not do. You make them eat what they should not eat. You make them
accomplish what they should not accomplish. Save me, save me — I have come to Your
Sanctuary, O my Lord and Master; Nanak prays to the Lord. || 48 || O egotism, you
are the root of birth and death and the cycle of reincarnation; you are the very soul of
sin. You forsake friends, and hold tight to enemies. You spread out countless illusions of
Maya. You cause the living beings to come and go until they are exhausted. You lead
them to experience pain and pleasure. You lead them to wander lost in the terrible
wilderness of doubt; you lead them to contract the most horrible, incurable diseases.
The only Physician is the Supreme Lord, the Transcendent Lord God. Nanak worships
and adores the Lord, Har, Har, Haray. || 49 || O Lord of the Universe, Master of the
Breath of life, Treasure of Mercy, Guru of the World. O Destroyer of the fever of the
world, Embodiment of Compassion, please take away all my pain. O Merciful Lord,
Potent to give Sanctuary, Master of the meek and humble, please be kind to me.
Whether his body is healthy or sick, let Nanak meditate in remembrance on You, Lord.
|| 50 || I have come to the Sanctuary of the Lord‟s Lotus Feet, where I sing the Kirtan
of His Praises. In the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, Nanak is carried across
the utterly terrifying, difficult world-ocean. || 51 || The Supreme Lord God has
procted my head and forehead; the Transcendent Lord has protected my hands and
body. God, my Lord and Master, has saved my soul; the Lord of the Universe has saved
my wealth and feet. The Merciful Guru has protected everything, and destroyed my fear
and suffering. God is the Lover of His devotees, the Master of the masterless. Nanak
has entered the Sanctuary of the Imperishable Primal Lord God. || 52 || His Power
supports the sky, and locks fire within wood. 


His Power supports the moon, the sun and the stars, and infuses light and breath into
the body. His Power provides nourishment in the womb of the mother, and does not let
disease strike. His Power holds back the ocean, O Nanak, and does not allow the waves
of water to destroy the land. || 53 || The Lord of the World is Supremely Beautiful;
His Meditation is the Life of all. In the Society of the Saints, O Nanak, He is found on
the path of devotional worship of the Lord. || 54 || The mosquito pierces the stone,
the ant crosses the swamp, the cripple crosses the ocean, and the blind sees in the
darkness, meditating on the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat. Nanak seeks the
Sanctuary of the Lord, Har, Har, Haray. || 55 || Like a Brahmin without a sacred mark
on his forehead, or a king without the power of command, or a warrior without
weapons, so is the devotee of God without Dharmic Faith. || 56 || God has no conchshell, no religious mark, no paraphernalia; he does not have blue skin. His Form is Wondrous and Amazing. He is beyond incarnation. The Vedas say that He is not this,
and not that. The Lord of the Universe is Lofty and High, Great and Infinite. The
Imperishable Lord abides in the hearts of the Holy. He is understood, O Nanak, by
those who are very fortunate. || 57 || Living in the world, it is like a wild jungle. One‟s
relatives are like dogs, jackals and donkeys. In this difficult place, the mind is
intoxicated with the wine of emotional attachment; the five unconquered thieves lurk
there. The mortals wander lost in love and emotional attachment, fear and doubt; they
are caught in the sharp, strong noose of egotism. The ocean of fire is terrifying and
impassable. The distant shore is so far away; it cannot be reached. Vibrate and
meditate on the Lord of the World, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy; O
Nanak, by His Grace, we are saved at the Lotus Feet of the Lord. || 58 || When the
Lord of the Universe grants His Grace, all illnesses are cured. Nanak chants His Glorious
Praises in the Saadh Sangat, in the Sanctuary of the Perfect Transcendent Lord God. ||
59 || The mortal is beautiful and speaks sweet words, but in the farm of his heart, he
harbors cruel vengeance. He pretends to bow in worship, but he is false. Beware of
him, O friendly Saints. || 60 || The thoughtless fool does not know that each day, his
breaths are being used up. His most beautiful body is wearing away; old age, the
daughter of death, has seized it. He is engrossed in family play; placing his hopes in
transitory things, he indulges in corrupt pleasures. Wandering lost in countless
incarnations, he is exhausted. Nanak seeks the Sanctuary of the Embodiment of Mercy.
|| 61 || O tongue, you love to enjoy the sweet delicacies. You are dead to the Truth,
and involved in great disputes, whether to call God Gobind, or Daamodar, or Maadhav.
|| 62 || Those who are proud, and intoxicated with the pleasures of sex, and asserting
their power over others, never contemplate the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. Their lives are
cursed, and as worthless as straw. You are as tiny and insignificant as an ant, but you
shall become great, by the Wealth of the Lord‟s Meditation. Nanak bows in humble
worship, countless times, over and over again. || 63 || The blade of grass becomes a
mountain, and the barren land becomes green. The drowning one swims across, and
the empty is filled to overflowing. Millions of suns illuminate the darkness, prays Nanak,
when the Guru, the Lord, becomes Merciful. || 64 || 


Associating with the Brahmin, one is saved, if his actions are perfect and God-like.
Those whose souls are imbued with the world — O Nanak, their lives are fruitless. ||
65 || The mortal steals the wealth of others, and makes all sorts of problems; his
preaching is only for his own livelihood. His desire for this and that is not satisfied; his
mind is caught in Maya, and he is acting like a pig. || 66 || Those who are intoxicated
and absorbed in the Lord‟s Lotus Feet are saved from the terrifying world-ocean.
Countless sins are destroyed, O Nanak, in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy;
there is no doubt about this. || 67 || 4 ||
FIFTH MEHL, GAAT‟HAA:

Camphor, flowers and perfume become contaminated, by coming into contact with the
human body. O Nanak, the ignorant one is proud of his foul-smelling marrow, blood and
bones. || 1 || Even if the mortal could reduce himself to the size of an atom, and
shoot through the ethers, worlds and realms in the blink of an eye, O Nanak, without
the Holy Saint, he shall not be saved. || 2 || Know for sure that death will come;
whatever is seen is false. So chant the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises in the Saadh Sangat,
the Company of the Holy; this alone shall go along with you in the end. || 3 || The
consciousness wanders lost in Maya, attached to friends and relatives. Vibrating and
meditating on the Lord of the Universe in the Saadh Sangat, O Nanak, the eternal place
of rest is found. || 4 || The lowly nim tree, growing near the sandalwood tree,
becomes just like the sandalwood tree. But the bamboo tree, also growing near it, does
not pick up its fragrance; it is too tall and proud. || 5 || In this Gaat‟haa, the Lord‟s
Sermon is woven; listening to it, pride is crushed. The five enemies are killed, O Nanak,
by shooting the Arrow of the Lord. || 6 || The Words of the Holy are the path of
peace. They are obtained by good karma. The cycle of birth and death is ended, O
Nanak, singing the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises. || 7 || When the leaves wither and
fall, they cannot be attached to the branch again. Without the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, O Nanak, there is misery and suffering. The mortal wanders in reincarnation day
and night. || 8 || One is blessed with love for the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy, by great good fortune. Whoever sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord‟s Name, O
Nanak, is not affected by the world-ocean. || 9 || This Gaat‟haa is profound and
infinite; how rare are those who understand it. They forsake sexual desire and worldly
love, O Nanak, and praise the Lord in the Saadh Sangat. || 10 || The Words of the
Holy are the most sublime Mantra. They eradicate millions of sinful mistakes. Meditating
on the Lotus Feet of the Lord, O Nanak, all one‟s generations are saved. || 11 || That
palace is beautiful, in which the Kirtan of the Lord‟s Praises are sung. Those who dwell
on the Lord of the Universe are liberated. O Nanak, only the most fortunate are so
blessed. || 12 || I have found the Lord, my Friend, my very Best Friend. He shall
never break my heart. His dwelling is eternal; His weight cannot be weighed. Nanak has
made Him the Friend of his soul. || 13 || One‟s bad reputation is erased by a true
son, who meditates in his heart on the Guru‟s Mantra. 

The Beloved Eternal Lord God, O Nanak, carries us across the world-ocean. || 14 || It
is death to forget the Lord of the Universe. It is life to meditate on the Name of the
Lord. The Lord is found in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, O Nanak, by
pre-ordained destiny. || 15 || The snake-charmer, by his spell, neutralizes the poison
and leaves the snake without fangs. Just so, the Saints remove suffering; O Nanak,
they are found by good karma. || 16 || The Lord is All-pervading everywhere; He
gives Sanctuary to all living beings. The mind is touched by His Love, O Nanak, by
Guru‟s Grace, and the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. || 17 || My mind is pierced
through by the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. I am blessed with total happiness. Holy people have
been singing this Gaat‟haa, O Nanak, since the very beginning of time. || 18 ||
Chanting and singing the Sublime Word of God in the Saadh Sangat, mortals are saved
from the world-ocean. O Nanak, they shall never again be consigned to reincarnation.
|| 19 || People contemplate the Vedas, Puraanas and Shaastras. But by enshrining in
their hearts the Naam, the Name of the One and Only Creator of the Universe,
everyone can be saved. By great good fortune, O Nanak, a few cross over like this. ||
20 || Meditating in remembrance on the Naam, the Name of Lord of the Universe, all
one‟s generations are saved. It is obtained in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy. O Nanak, by great good fortune, the Blessed Vision of His Darshan is seen. || 21
|| Abandon all your evil habits, and implant all Dharmic faith within. The Saadh
Sangat, the Company of the Holy, is obtained, O Nanak, by those who have such
destiny written upon their foreheads. || 22 || God was, is, and shall always be. He
sustains and destroys all. Know that these Holy people are true, O Nanak; they are in
love with the Lord. || 23 || The mortal is engrossed in sweet words and transitory
pleasures which shall soon fade away. Disease, sorrow and separation afflict him; O
Nanak, he never finds peace, even in dreams. || 24 ||
PHUNHAY, FIFTH MEHL:

With Pen in Hand, the Unfathomable Lord writes the mortal‟s destiny upon his forehead.
The Incomparably Beautiful Lord is involved with all. I cannot utter Your Praises with
my mouth. Nanak is fascinated, gazing upon the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. I am a
sacrifice to You. || 1 || Seated in the Society of the Saints, I chant the Lord‟s Praises.
I dedicate all my adornments to Him, and give all this soul to Him. With hopeful
yearning for Him, I have made the bed for my Husband. O Lord! If such good destiny is
inscribed upon my forehead, then I shall find my Friend. || 2 || O my companion, I
have prepared everything: make-up, garlands and betel-leaves. I have embellished
myself with the sixteen decorations, and applied the mascara to my eyes. If my
Husband Lord comes to my home, then I obtain everything. 


O Lord! Without my Husband, all these adornments are useless. || 3 || Very fortunate
is she, within whose home the Husband Lord abides. She is totally adorned and
decorated; she is a happy soul-bride. I sleep in peace, without anxiety; the hopes of my
mind have been fulfilled. O Lord! When my Husband came into the home of my heart, I
obtained everything. || 4 || My hope is so intense, that this hope alone should fulfill
my hopes. When the True Guru becomes merciful, then I attain the Perfect Lord. My
body is filled with so many demerits; I am covered with faults and demerits. O Lord!
When the True Guru becomes Merciful, then the mind is held in place. || 5 || Says
Nanak, I have meditated on the Lord, Infinite and Endless. This world-ocean is so
difficult to cross; the True Guru has carried me across. My comings and goings in
reincarnation ended, when I met the Perfect Lord. O Lord! I have obtained the
Ambrosial Nectar of the Name of the Lord from the True Guru. || 6 || The lotus is in
my hand; in the courtyard of my heart I abide in peace. O my companion, the Jewel is
around my neck; beholding it, sorrow is taken away. I abide with the Lord of the World,
the Treasury of Total Peace. O Lord! All wealth, spiritual perfection and the nine
treasures are in His Hand. || 7 || Those men who go out to enjoy other men‟s women
shall suffer in shame. Those who steal the wealth of others — how can their guilt be
concealed? Those who chant the Sacred Praises of the Lord save and redeem all their
generations. O Lord! Those who listen and contemplate the Supreme Lord God become
pure and holy. || 8 || The sky above looks lovely, and the earth below is beautiful.
Lightning flashes in the ten directions; I behold the Face of my Beloved. If I go
searching in foreign lands, how can I find my Beloved? O Lord! If such destiny is
inscribed upon my forehead, I am absorbed in the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. || 9
|| I have seen all places, but none can compare to You. The Primal Lord, the Architect
of Destiny, has established You; thus You are adorned and embellished. Ramdaspur is
prosperous and thickly populated, and incomparably beautiful. O Lord! Bathing in the
Sacred Pool of Raam Daas, the residues of sins are washed away, O Nanak. || 10 ||
The sparrow-hawk is very smart; in its consciousness, it longs for the friendly rain. It
longs for that, to which its breath of life is attached. It wanders depressed, from forest
to forest, for the sake of a drop of water. O Lord! In just the same way, the humble
servant of the Lord begs for the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Nanak is a sacrifice to
him. || 11 || The Consciousness of my Friend is incomparably beautiful. Its mystery
cannot be known. One who purchases the priceless virtues realizes the essence of
reality. When the consciousness is absorbed in the supreme consciousness, great joy
and bliss are found. O Lord! When the fickle thieves are overcome, the true wealth is
obtained. || 12 || In a dream, I was lifted up; why didn‟t I grasp the hem of His
Robe? Gazing upon the Beautiful Lord relaxing there, my mind was charmed and
fascinated. I am searching for His Feet — tell me, where can I find Him? O Lord! Tell
me how I can find my Beloved, O my companion. || 13 || The eyes which do not see
the Holy — those eyes are miserable. The ears which do not hear the Sound-current of
the Naad — those ears might just as well be plugged. The tongue which does not chant
the Naam ought to be cut out, bit by bit. O Lord! When the mortal forgets the Lord of
the Universe, the Sovereign Lord King, he grows weaker day by day. || 14 || The
wings of the bumble bee are caught in the intoxicating fragrant petals of the lotus. With
its limbs entangled in the petals, it loses its senses. 

Is there any such friend, who can untie this difficult knot? O Nanak, the One Supreme
Lord and Master of the earth reunites the separated ones. || 15 || I run around in all
directions, searching for the love of God. The five evil enemies are tormenting me; how
can I destroy them? Shoot them with the sharp arrows of meditation on the Name of
God. O Lord! The way to slaughter these terrible sadistic enemies is obtained from the
Perfect Guru. || 16 || The True Guru has blessed me with the bounty which shall
never be exhausted. Eating and consuming it, all the Gurmukhs are emancipated. The
Lord, in His Mercy, has blessed me with the treasure of the Ambrosial Naam. O Nanak,
worship and adore the Lord, who never dies. || 17 || Wherever the Lord‟s devotee
goes is a blessed, beautiful place. All comforts are obtained, meditating on the Lord‟s
Name. People praise and congratulate the devotee of the Lord, while the slanderers rot
and die. Says Nanak, O friend, chant the Naam, and your mind shall be filled with bliss.
|| 18 || The mortal never serves the Immaculate Lord, the Purifier of sinners. The
mortal wastes away in false pleasures. How long can this go on? Why do you take such
pleasure, looking at this mirage? O Lord! I am a sacrifice to those who are known and
approved in the Court of the Lord. || 19 || The fool commits countless foolish actions
and so many sinful mistakes. The fool‟s body smells rotten, and turns to dust. He
wanders lost in the darkness of pride, and never thinks of dying. O Lord! The mortal
gazes upon the mirage; why does he think it is true? || 20 || When someone‟s days
are over, who can save him? How long can the physicians go on, suggesting various
therapies? You fool, remember the One Lord; only He shall be of use to you in the end.
O Lord! Without the Name, the body turns to dust, and everything goes to waste. || 21
|| Drink in the medicine of the Incomparable, Priceless Name. Meeting and joining
together, the Saints drink it in, and give it to everyone. He alone is blessed with it, who
is destined to receive it. O Lord! I am a sacrifice to those who enjoy the Love of the
Lord. || 22 || The physicians meet together in their assembly. The medicines are
effective, when the Lord Himself stands in their midst. Their good deeds and karma
become apparent. O Lord! Pains, diseases and sins all vanish from their bodies. || 23 ||
CHAUBOLAS, FIFTH MEHL:

O Samman, if one could buy this love with money, then consider Raawan the king. He
was not poor, but he could not buy it, even though he offered his head to Shiva. || 1 ||
My body is drenched in love and affection for the Lord; there is no distance at all
between us. My mind is pierced through by the Lotus Feet of the Lord. He is realized
when one‟s intuitive consciousness is attuned to Him. || 2 || 


I would cross the oceans, mountains, wilderness, forests and the nine regions of the
earth in a single step, O Musan, for the Love of my Beloved. || 3 || O Musan, the
Light of the Lord‟s Love has spread across the sky; I cling to my Lord, like the bumble
bee caught in the lotus flower. || 4 || Chanting and intense meditation, austere selfdiscipline, pleasure and peace, honor, greatness and pride — O Musan, I would dedicate and sacrifice all these for a moment of my Lord‟s Love. || 5 || O Musan, the
world does not understand the Mystery of the Lord; it is dying and being plundered. It
is not pierced through by the Love of the Beloved Lord; it is entangled in false pursuits.
|| 6 || When someone‟s home and property are burnt, because of his attachment to
them, he suffers in the sorrow of separation. O Musan, when mortals forget the Merciful
Lord God, then they are truly plundered. || 7 || Whoever enjoys the taste of the
Lord‟s Love, remembers His Lotus Feet in his mind. O Nanak, the lovers of God do not
go anywhere else. || 8 || Climbing thousands of steep hillsides, the fickle mind
becomes miserable. Look at the humble, lowly mud, O Jamaal: the beautiful lotus grows
in it. || 9 || My Lord has lotus-eyes; His Face is so beautifully adorned. O Musan, I am
intoxicated with His Mystery. I break the necklace of pride into bits. || 10 || I am
intoxicated with the Love of my Husband Lord; remembering Him in meditation, I am
not conscious of my own body. He is revealed in all His Glory, all throughout the world.
Nanak is a lowly moth at His Flame. || 11 ||
SHALOKS OF DEVOTEE KABEER JEE:

Kabeer, my rosary is my tongue, upon which the Lord‟s Name is strung. From the very
beginning, and throughout the ages, all the devotees abide in tranquil peace. || 1 ||
Kabeer, everyone laughs at my social class. I am a sacrifice to this social class, in which
I chant and meditate on the Creator. || 2 || Kabeer, why do you stumble? Why does
your soul waver? He is the Lord of all comforts and peace; drink in the Sublime Essence
of the Lord‟s Name. || 3 || Kabeer, earrings made of gold and studded with jewels,
look like burnt twigs, if the Name is not in the mind. || 4 || Kabeer, rare is such a
person, who remains dead while yet alive. Singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, he
is fearless. Wherever I look, the Lord is there. || 5 || Kabeer, on the day when I die,
afterwards there shall be bliss. I shall meet with my Lord God. Those with me shall
meditate and vibrate on the Lord of the Universe. || 6 || Kabeer, I am the worst of
all. Everyone else is good. Whoever understands this is a friend of mine. || 7 ||
Kabeer, she came to me in various forms and disguises. My Guru saved me, and now
she bows humbly to me. || 8 || Kabeer, kill only that, which, when killed, shall bring
peace. Everyone shall call you good, very good, and no one shall think you are bad. ||
9 || Kabeer, the night is dark, and men go about doing their dark deeds. 

They take the noose and run around; but rest assured that God shall destroy them. ||
10 || Kabeer, the sandalwood tree is good, even though it is surrounded by weeds.
Those who dwell near the sandalwood tree, become just like the sandalwood tree. ||
11 || Kabeer, the bamboo is drowned in its egotistical pride. No one should drown like
this. Bamboo also dwells near the sandalwood tree, but it does not take up its
fragrance. || 12 || Kabeer, the mortal loses his faith, for the sake of the world, but
the world shall not go along with him in the end. The idiot strikes his own foot with the
axe by his own hand. || 13 || Kabeer, wherever I go, I see wonders everywhere. But
without the devotees of the One Lord, it is all wilderness to me. || 14 || Kabeer, the
dwelling of the Saints is good; the dwelling of the unrighteous burns like an oven.
Those mansions in which the Lord‟s Name is not chanted might just as well burn down.
|| 15 || Kabeer, why cry at the death of a Saint? He is just going back to his home.
Cry for the wretched, faithless cynic, who is sold from store to store. || 16 || Kabeer,
the faithless cynic is like a piece of garlic. Even if you eat it sitting in a corner, it
becomes obvious to everyone. || 17 || Kabeer, Maya is the butter-churn, and the
breath is the churning-stick. The Saints eat the butter, while the world drinks the whey.
|| 18 || Kabeer, Maya is the butter-churn; the breath flows like ice water. Whoever
does the churning eats the butter; the others are just churning-sticks. || 19 || Kabeer,
Maya is the thief, which breaks in and plunders the store. Only Kabeer is not plundered;
he has cut her into twelve pieces. || 20 || Kabeer, peace does not come in this world
by making lots of friends. Those who keep their consciousness focused on the One Lord
shall find eternal peace. || 21 || Kabeer, the world is afraid of death — that death fills
my mind with bliss. It is only by death that perfect, supreme bliss is obtained. || 22 ||
The Treasure of the Lord is obtained, O Kabeer, but do not undo its knot. There is no
market to sell it, no appraiser, no customer, and no price. || 23 || Kabeer, be in love
with only that one, whose Master is the Lord. The Pandits, the religious scholars, kings
and landlords — what good is love for them? || 24 || Kabeer, when you are in love
with the One Lord, duality and alienation depart. You may have long hair, or you may
shave your head bald. || 25 || Kabeer, the world is a room filled with black soot; the
blind fall into its trap. I am a sacrifice to those who are thrown in, and still escape. ||
26 || Kabeer, this body shall perish; save it, if you can. Even those who have tens of
thousands and millions, must depart bare-footed in the end. || 27 || Kabeer, this
body shall perish; place it on the path. Either join the Saadh Sangat, the Company of
the Holy, or sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 28 || Kabeer, dying, dying, the
whole world has to die, and yet, none know how to die. 

Let those who die, die such a death, that they shall never have to die again. || 29 ||
Kabeer, it is so difficult to obtain this human body; it does not just come over and over
again. It is like the ripe fruit on the tree; when it falls to the ground, it cannot be reattached to the branch. || 30 || Kabeer, you are Kabeer; your name means great. O

Lord, You are Kabeer. The Jewel of the Lord is obtained, when the mortal first gives up
his body. || 31 || Kabeer, do not struggle in stubborn pride; nothing happens just
because you say so. No one can erase the actions of the Merciful Lord. || 32 ||
Kabeer, no one who is false can withstand the Touchstone of the Lord. He alone can
pass the test of the Lord‟s Touchstone, who remains dead while yet alive. || 33 ||
Kabeer, some wear gaudy robes, and chew betel leaves and betel nuts. Without the
Name of the One Lord, they are bound and gagged and taken to the City of Death. ||
34 || Kabeer, the boat is old, and it has thousands of holes. Those who are light get
across, while those who carry the weight of their sins on their heads are drowned. ||
35 || Kabeer, the bones burn like wood, and the hair burns like straw. Seeing the
world burning like this, Kabeer has become sad. || 36 || Kabeer, do not be so proud
of your bones wrapped up in skin. Those who were on their horses and under their
canopies, were eventually buried under the ground. || 37 || Kabeer, do not be so
proud of your tall mansions. Today or tomorrow, you shall lie beneath the ground, and
the grass shall grow above you. || 38 || Kabeer, do not be so proud, and do not laugh
at the poor. Your boat is still out at sea; who knows what will happen? || 39 ||
Kabeer, do not be so proud, looking at your beautiful body. Today or tomorrow, you will
have to leave it behind, like the snake shedding its skin. || 40 || Kabeer, if you must
rob and plunder, then plunder the plunder of the Lord‟s Name. Otherwise, in the world
hereafter, you will regret and repent, when the breath of life leaves the body. || 41 ||
Kabeer, there is no one born, who burns his own home, and burning his five sons,
remains lovingly attuned to the Lord. || 42 || Kabeer, how rare are those who sell
their son and sell their daughter and, entering into partnership with Kabeer, deal with
the Lord. || 43 || Kabeer, let me remind you of this. Do not be skeptical or cynical.
Those pleasures which you enjoyed so much in the past — now you must eat their
fruits. || 44 || Kabeer, at first, I thought learning was good; then I thought Yoga was
better. I shall never abandon devotional worship of the Lord, even though people may
slander me. || 45 || Kabeer, how can the wretched people slander me? They have no
wisdom or intelligence. Kabeer continues to dwell upon the Lord‟s Name; I have
abandoned all other affairs. || 46 || Kabeer, the robe of the stranger-soul has caught
fire on all four sides. The cloth of the body has been burnt and reduced to charcoal, but
the fire did not touch the thread of the soul. || 47 || Kabeer, the cloth has been burnt
and reduced to charcoal, and the begging bowl is shattered into pieces. 


The poor Yogi has played out his game; only ashes remain on his seat. || 48 ||
Kabeer, the fish is in the shallow water; the fisherman has cast his net. You shall not
escape this little pool; think about returning to the ocean. || 49 || Kabeer, do not
leave the ocean, even if it is very salty. If you poke around searching from puddle to
puddle, no one will call you smart. || 50 || Kabeer, those who have no guru are
washed away. No one can help them. Be meek and humble; whatever happens is what
the Creator Lord does. || 51 || Kabeer, even the dog of a devotee is good, while the
mother of the faithless cynic is bad. The dog hears the Praises of the Lord‟s Name,
while the other is engaged in sin. || 52 || Kabeer, the deer is weak, and the pool is
lush with green vegetation. Thousands of hunters are chasing after the soul; how long
can it escape death? || 53 || Kabeer, some make their homes on the banks of the
Ganges, and drink pure water. Without devotional worship of the Lord, they are not
liberated. Kabeer proclaims this. || 54 || Kabeer, my mind has become immaculate,
like the waters of the Ganges. The Lord follows after me, calling, “Kabeer! Kabeer!” ||
55 || Kabeer, tumeric is yelow, and lime is white. You shall meet the Beloved Lord,
only when both colors are lost. || 56 || Kabeer, tumeric has lost its yellow color, and
no trace of lime‟s whiteness remains. I am a sacrifice to this love, by which social class
and status, color and ancestry are taken away. || 57 || Kabeer, the door of liberation
is very narrow, less than the width of a mustard seed. Your mind is larger than an
elephant; how will it pass through? || 58 || Kabeer, if I meet such a True Guru, who
mercifully blesses me with the gift, then the door of liberation will open wide for me,
and I will easily pass through. || 59 || Kabeer, I have no hut or hovel, no house or
village. I hope that the Lord will not ask who I am. I have no social status or name. ||
60 || Kabeer, I long to die; let me die at the Lord‟s Door. I hope that the Lord does
not ask, “Who is this, lying at my door?” || 61 || Kabeer, I have not done anything; I
shall not do anything; my body cannot do anything. I do not know what the Lord has
done, but the call has gone out: “Kabeer, Kabeer.” || 62 || Kabeer, if someone utters
the Name of the Lord even in dreams, I would make my skin into shoes for his feet. ||
63 || Kabeer, we are puppets of clay, but we take the name of mankind. We are
guests here for only a few days, but we take up so much space. || 64 || Kabeer, I
have made myself into henna, and I grind myself into powder. But You, O my Husband
Lord, have not asked about me; You have never applied me to Your Feet. || 65 ||
Kabeer, that door, through which people never stop coming and going — how can I
leave such a door as that? || 66 || 

Kabeer, I was drowning, but the waves of virtue saved me in an instant. When I saw
that my boat was rotten, then I immediately got out. || 67 || Kabeer, the sinner does
not like devotion to the Lord; he does not appreciate worship. The fly abandons the
sandalwood tree, and goes after the rotten smell. || 68 || Kabeer, the physician is
dead, and the patient is dead; the whole world is dead. Only Kabeer is not dead; there
is no one to mourn for him. || 69 || Kabeer, I have not meditated on the Lord; such is
the bad habit I have developed. The body is a wooden pot; it cannot be put back on the
fire. || 70 || Kabeer, it came to pass, that I did whatever I pleased. Why should I be
afraid of death? I have invited death for myself. || 71 || Kabeer, the mortals suck at
the sugar cane, for the sake of the sweet juice. They should work just as hard for
virtue. The person who lacks virtue — no one calls him good. || 72 || Kabeer, the
pitcher is full of water; it will break, today or tomorrow. Those who do not remember
their Guru, shall be plundered on the way. || 73 || Kabeer, I am the Lord‟s dog; Moti
is my name. There is a chain around my neck; wherever I am pulled, I go. || 74 ||
Kabeer, why do you show other people your rosary beads? You do not remember the
Lord in your heart, so what use is this rosary to you? || 75 || Kabeer, the snake of
separation from the Lord abides within my mind; it does not respond to any mantra.
One who is separated from the Lord does not live; if he does live, he goes insane. || 76
|| Kabeer, the philosopher‟s stone and sandalwood oil have the same good quality.
Whatever comes into contact with them is uplifted. Iron is transformed into gold, and
ordinary wood becomes fragrant. || 77 || Kabeer, Death‟s club is terrible; it cannot be
endured. I have met with the holy man; he has attached me to the hem of his robe. ||
78 || Kabeer, the physician says that he alone is good, and all the medicine is under
his control. But these things belong to the Lord; He takes them away whenever He
wishes. || 79 || Kabeer, take your drum and beat it for ten days. Life is like people
meeting on a boat on a river; they shall not meet again. || 80 || Kabeer, if I could
change the seven seas into ink and make all the vegetation my pen, and the earth my
paper, even then, I could not write the Praises of the Lord. || 81 || Kabeer, what can
my lowly status as a weaver do to me? The Lord dwells in my heart. Kabeer, the Lord
hugs me close in His Embrace; I have forsaken all my entanglements. || 82 || Kabeer,
will anyone set fire to his home and kill his five sons (the five thieves) to remain
lovingly attached to the Lord? || 83 || Kabeer, will anyone burn his own body? The
people are blind — they do not know, although Kabeer continues to shout at them. ||
84 || Kabeer, the widow mounts the funeral pyre and cries out, “Listen, O brother
funeral pyre. All people must depart in the end; it is only you and I.” 

|| 85 || Kabeer, the mind has become a bird; it soars and flies in the ten directions.
According to the company it keeps, so are the fruits it eats. || 86 || Kabeer, you have
found that place which you were seeking. You have become that which you thought
was separate from yourself. || 87 || Kabeer, I have been ruined and destroyed by
bad company, like the banana plant near the thorn bush. The thorn bush waves in the
wind, and pierces the banana plant; see this, and do not associate with the faithless
cynics. || 88 || Kabeer, the mortal wants to walk on the path, carrying the load of
others‟ sins on his head. He is not afraid of his own load of sins; the road ahead shall be
difficult and treacherous. || 89 || Kabeer, the forest is burning; the tree standing in it
is crying out, “Do not let me fall into the hands of the blacksmith, who would burn me a
second time.” || 90 || Kabeer, when one died, two were dead. When two died, four
were dead. When four died, six were dead, four males and two females. || 91 ||
Kabeer, I have seen and observed, and searched all over the world, but I have found
no place of rest anywhere. Those who do not remember the Lord‟s Name — why do
they delude themselves in other pursuits? || 92 || Kabeer, associate with the Holy
people, who will take you to Nirvaanaa in the end. Do not associate with the faithless
cynics; they would bring you to ruin. || 93 || Kabeer, I contemplate the Lord in the
world; I know that He is permeating the world. Those who do not contemplate the
Name of the Lord — their birth into this world is useless. || 94 || Kabeer, place your
hopes in the Lord; other hopes lead to despair. Those who dissociate themselves from
the Lord‟s Name — when they fall into hell, then they will appreciate its value. || 95 ||
Kabeer has made many students and disciples, but he has not made God his friend. He
set out on a journey to meet the Lord, but his consciousness failed him half-way. || 96
|| Kabeer, what can the poor creature do, if the Lord does not give him assistance?
Whatever branch he steps on breaks and collapses. || 97 || Kabeer, those who only
preach to others — sand falls into their mouths. They keep their eyes on the property of
others, while their own farm is being eaten up. || 98 || Kabeer, I will remain in the
Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, even if I have only coarse bread to eat.
Whatever will be, will be. I will not associate with the faithless cynics. || 99 || Kabeer,
in the Saadh Sangat, love for the Lord doubles day by day. The faithless cynic is like a
black blanket, which does not become white by being washed. || 100 || Kabeer, you
have not shaved your mind, so why do you shave your head? Whatever is done, is done
by the mind; it is useless to shave your head. || 101 || Kabeer, do not abandon the
Lord; your body and wealth shall go, so let them go. My consciousness is pierced by the
Lord‟s Lotus Feet; I am absorbed in the Name of the Lord. || 102 || Kabeer, all the
strings of the instrument I played are broken. What can the poor instrument do, when
the player has departed as well. || 103 || Kabeer, shave the mother of that guru, who
does not take away one‟s doubt. 

He himself is drowning in the four Vedas; he drowns his disciples as well. || 104 ||
Kabeer, whatever sins the mortal has committed, he tries to keep hidden under cover.
But in the end, they shall all be revealed, when the Righteous Judge of Dharma
investigates. || 105 || Kabeer, you have given up meditating on the Lord, and you
have raised a large family. You continue to involve yourself in worldly affairs, but none
of your brothers and relatives remain. || 106 || Kabeer, those who give up meditation
on the Lord, and get up at night to wake the spirits of the dead, shall be reincarnated
as snakes, and eat their own offspring. || 107 || Kabeer, the woman who gives up
meditation on the Lord, and observes the ritual fast of Ahoi, shall be reincarnated as a
donkey, to carry heavy burdens. || 108 || Kabeer, it is the most clever wisdom, to
chant and meditate on the Lord in the heart. It is like playing on a pig; if you fall off,
you will find no place of rest. || 109 || Kabeer, blessed is that mouth, which utters
the Lord‟s Name. It purifies the body, and the whole village as well. || 110 || Kabeer,
that family is good, in which the Lord‟s slave is born. But that family in which the Lord‟s
slave is not born is as useless as weeds. || 111 || Kabeer, some have lots of horses,
elephants and carriages, and thousands of banners waving. But begging is better than
these comforts, if one spends his days meditating in remembrance on the Lord. || 112
|| Kabeer, I have wandered all over the world, carrying the drum on my shoulder. No
one belongs to anyone else; I have looked and carefully studied it. || 113 || The
pearls are scattered on the road; the blind man comes along. Without the Light of the
Lord of the Universe, the world just passes them by. || 114 || My family is drowned,
O Kabeer, since the birth of my son Kamaal. He has given up meditating on the Lord, in
order to bring home wealth. || 115 || Kabeer, go out to meet the holy man; do not
take anyone else with you. Do not turn back — keep on going. Whatever will be, will
be. || 116 || Kabeer, do not bind yourself with that chain, which binds the whole
world. As the salt is lost in the flour, so shall your golden body be lost. || 117 ||
Kabeer, the soul-swan is flying away, and the body is being buried, and still he makes
gestures. Even then, the mortal does not give up the cruel look in his eyes. || 118 ||
Kabeer: with my eyes, I see You, Lord; with my ears, I hear Your Name. With my
tongue I chant Your Name; I enshrine Your Lotus Feet within my heart. || 119 ||
Kabeer, I have been spared from heaven and hell, by the Grace of the True Guru. From
beginning to end, I abide in the joy of the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. || 120 || Kabeer, how
can I even describe the extent of the joy of the Lord‟s Lotus Feet? I cannot describe its
sublime glory; it has to be seen to be appreciated. || 121 || Kabeer, how can I
describe what I have seen? No one will bellieve my words. 

The Lord is just as He is. I dwell in delight, singing His Glorious Praises. || 122 ||
Kabeer, the flamingo pecks and feeds, and remembers her chicks. She pecks and pecks
and feeds, and remembers them always. Her chicks are very dear to her, just like the
love of wealth and Maya is dear to the mortal‟s mind. || 123 || Kabeer, the sky is
overcast and cloudy; the ponds and lakes are overflowing with water. Like the sparrowhawk, some remain thirsty — what is their condition? || 124 || Kabeer, the chakvi
duck is separated from her love through the night, but in the morning, she meets him
again. Those who are separated from the Lord do not meet Him in the day, or in the
night. || 125 || Kabeer: O conch shell, remain in the ocean. If you are separated from
it, you shall scream at sunrise from temple to temple. || 126 || Kabeer, what are you
doing sleeping? Wake up and cry in fear and pain. Those who live in the grave — how
can they sleep in peace? || 127 || Kabeer, what are you doing sleeping? Why not rise
up and meditate on the Lord? One day you shall sleep with your legs outstretched. ||
128 || Kabeer, what are you doing sleeping? Wake up, and sit up. Attach yourself to
the One, from whom you have been separated. || 129 || Kabeer, do not leave the
Society of the Saints; walk upon this Path. See them, and be sanctified; meet them, and
chant the Name. || 130 || Kabeer, do not associate with the faithless cynics; run far
away from them. If you touch a vessel stained with soot, some of the soot will stick to
you. || 131 || Kabeer, you have not contemplated the Lord, and now old age has
overtaken you. Now that the door of your mansion is on fire, what can you take out? ||
132 || Kabeer, the Creator does whatever He pleases. There is none other than Him;
He alone is the Creator of all. || 133 || Kabeer, the fruit trees are bearing fruit, and
the mangoes are becoming ripe. They will reach the owner, only if the crows do not eat
them first. || 134 || Kabeer, some buy idols and worship them; in their stubbornmindedness, they make pilgrimages to sacred shrines. They look at one another, and wear religious robes, but they are deluded and lost. || 135 || Kabeer, someone sets
up a stone idol and all the world worships it as the Lord. Those who hold to this belief
will be drowned in the river of darkness. || 136 || Kabeer, the paper is the prison,
and the ink of rituals are the bars on the windows. The stone idols have drowned the
world, and the Pandits, the religious scholars, have plundered it on the way. || 137 ||
Kabeer, that which you have to do tomorrow — do it today instead; and that which you
have to do now — do it immediately! Later on, you will not be able to do anything,
when death hangs over your head. || 138 || Kabeer, I have seen a person, who is as
shiny as washed wax. He seems very clever and very virtuous, but in reality, he is
without understanding, and corrupt. || 139 || Kabeer, the Messenger of Death shall
not compromise my understanding. I have meditated on the Lord, the Cherisher, who
created this Messenger of Death. || 140 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1372 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Kabeer, the Lord is like musk; all His slaves are like bumble bees. The more Kabeer
worships Him, the more the Lord abides within his mind. || 141 || Kabeer, the mortal
has fallen into the grip of family life, and the Lord has been set aside. The messengers
of the Righteous Judge of Dharma descend upon the mortal, in the midst of all his
pomp and ceremony. || 142 || Kabeer, even a pig is better than the faithless cynic; at
least the pig keeps the village clean. When the wretched, faithless cynic dies, no one
even mentions his name. || 143 || Kabeer, the mortal gathers wealth, shell by shell,
accumulating thousands and millions. But when the time of his departure comes, he
takes nothing at all with him. He is even stripped of his loin-cloth. || 144 || Kabeer,
what good is it to become a devotee of Vishnu, and wear four malas? On the outside,
he may look like pure gold, but on the inside, he is stuffed with dust. || 145 ||
Kabeer, let yourself be a pebble on the path; abandon your egotistical pride. Such a
humble slave shall meet the Lord God. || 146 || Kabeer, what good would it be, to be
a pebble? It would only hurt the traveller on the path. Your slave, O Lord, is like the
dust of the earth. || 147 || Kabeer, what then, if one could become dust? It is blown
up by the wind, and sticks to the body. The humble servant of the Lord should be like
water, which cleans everything. || 148 || Kabeer, what then, if one could become
water? It becomes cold, then hot. The humble servant of the Lord should be just like
the Lord. || 149 || The banners wave above the lofty mansions, filled with gold and
beautiful women. But better than these is dry bread, if one sings the Glorious Praises of
the Lord in the Society of the Saints. || 150 || Kabeer, the wilderness is better than a
city, if the Lord‟s devotees live there. Without my Beloved Lord, it is like the City of
Death for me. || 151 || Kabeer, between the Ganges and Jamunaa Rivers, on the
shore of Celestial Silence, there, Kabeer has made his home. The silent sages and the
humble servants of the Lord search for the way to get there. || 152 || Kabeer, if the
mortal continues to love the Lord in the end, as he pledged in the beginning, no poor
diamond, not even millions of jewels, can equal him. || 153 || Kabeer, I saw a
strange and wonderful thing. A jewel was being sold in a store. Because there was no
buyer, it was going in exchange for a shell. || 154 || Kabeer, where there is spiritual
wisdom, there is righteousness and Dharma. Where there is falsehood, there is sin.
Where there is greed, there is death. Where there is forgiveness, there is God Himself.
|| 155 || Kabeer, what good is it to give up Maya, if the mortal does not give up his
pride? Even the silent sages and seers are destroyed by pride; pride eats up everything.
|| 156 || Kabeer, the True Guru has met me; He aimed the Arrow of the Shabad at
me. As soon as it struck me, I fell to the ground with a hole in my heart. || 157 ||
Kabeer, what can the True Guru do, when His Sikhs are at fault? The blind do not take
in any of His Teachings; it is as useless as blowing into bamboo. || 158 || 

Kabeer, the wife of the king has all sorts of horses, elephants and carriages. But she is
not equal to the water-carrier of the Lord‟s humble servant. || 159 || Kabeer, why do
you slander the wife of the king? Why do you honor the slave of the Lord? Because one
combs her hair for corruption, while the other remembers the Name of the Lord. || 160
|| Kabeer, with the Support of the Lord‟s Pillar, I have become steady and stable. The
True Guru has given me courage. Kabeer, I have purchased the diamond, on the banks
of the Mansarovar Lake. || 161 || Kabeer, the Lord is the Diamond, and the Lord‟s
humble servant is the jeweller who has set up his shop. As soon as an appraiser is
found, the price of the jewel is set. || 162 || Kabeer, you remember the Lord in
meditation, only when the need arises. You should remember Him all the time. You
shall dwell in the city of immortality, and the Lord shall restore the wealth you lost. ||
163 || Kabeer, it is good to perform selfless service for two — the Saints and the Lord.
The Lord is the Giver of liberation, and the Saint inspires us to chant the Naam. || 164
|| Kabeer, the crowds follow the path which the Pandits, the religious scholars, have
taken. There is a difficult and treacherous cliff on that path to the Lord; Kabeer is
climbing that cliff. || 165 || Kabeer, the mortal dies of his worldly troubles and pain,
after worrying about his family. Whose family is dishonored, when he is placed on the
funeral pyre? || 166 || Kabeer, you shall drown, you wretched being, from worrying
about what other people think. You know that whatever happens to your neighbors, will
also happen to you. || 167 || Kabeer, even dry bread, made of various grains, is
good. No one brags about it, throughout the vast country and great empire. || 168 ||
Kabeer, those who brag, shall burn. Those who do not brag remain carefree. That
humble being who does not brag, looks upon the gods and the poor alike. || 169 ||
Kabeer, the pool is filled to overflowing, but no one can drink the water from it. By
great good fortune, you have found it; drink it in handfuls, O Kabeer. || 170 ||
Kabeer, just as the stars disappear at dawn, so shall this body disappear. Only the
letters of God‟s Name do not disappear; Kabeer holds these tight. || 171 || Kabeer,
the wooden house is burning on all sides. The Pandits, the religious scholars, have been
burnt to death, while the illiterate ones run to safety. || 172 || Kabeer, give up your
skepticism; let your papers float away. Find the essence of the letters of the alphabet,
and focus your consciousness on the Lord. || 173 || Kabeer, the Saint does not
forsake his Saintly nature, even though he meets with millions of evil-doers. Even when
sandalwood is surrounded by snakes, it does not give up its cooling fragrance. || 174 ||
Kabeer, my mind is cooled and soothed; I have become God-conscious. The fire which
has burnt the world is like water to the Lord‟s humble servant. || 175 || Kabeer, no
one knows the Play of the Creator Lord. Only the Lord Himself and the slaves at His
Court understand it. || 176 || 

Kabeer, it is good that I feel the Fear of God; I have forgotten everything else. The hailstone has melted into water, and flowed into the ocean. || 177 || Kabeer, the body is
a pile of dust, collected and packed together. It is a show which lasts for only a few
days, and then dust returns to dust. || 178 || Kabeer, bodies are like the rising and
setting of the sun and the moon. Without meeting the Guru, the Lord of the Universe,
they are all reduced to dust again. || 179 || Where the Fearless Lord is, there is no
fear; where there is fear, the Lord is not there. Kabeer speaks after careful
consideration; hear this, O Saints, in your minds. || 180 || Kabeer, those who do not
know anything, pass their lives in peaceful sleep. But I have understood the riddle; I am
faced with all sorts of troubles. || 181 || Kabeer, those who are beaten cry a lot; but
the cries of the pain of separation are different. Struck by the Mystery of God, Kabeer
remains silent. || 182 || Kabeer, the stroke of a lance is easy to bear; it takes away
the breath. But one who endures the stroke of the Word of the Shabad is the Guru, and
I am his slave. || 183 || Kabeer: O Mullah, why do you climb to the top of the
minaret? The Lord is not hard of hearing. Look within your own heart for the One, for
whose sake you shout your prayers. || 184 || Why does the Shaykh bother to go on
pilgrimage to Mecca, if he is not content with himself? Kabeer, one whose heart is not
healthy and whole — how can he attain his Lord? || 185 || Kabeer, worship the Lord
Allah; meditating in remembrance on Him, troubles and pains depart. The Lord shall be
revealed within your own heart, and the burning fire within shall be extinguished by His
Name. || 186 || Kabeer, to use force is tyranny, even if you call it legal. When your
account is called for in the Court of the Lord, what will your condition be then? || 187
|| Kabeer, the dinner of beans and rice is excellent, if it is flavored with salt. Who
would cut his throat, to have meat with his bread? || 188 || Kabeer, one is known to
have been touched by the Guru, only when his emotional attachment and physical
illnesses are eradicated. He is not burned by pleasure or pain, and so he becomes the
Lord Himself. || 189 || Kabeer, it does make a difference, how you chant the Lord‟s
Name, „Raam‟. This is something to consider. Everyone uses the same word for the son
of Dasrath and the Wondrous Lord. || 190 || Kabeer, use the word „Raam‟, only to
speak of the All-pervading Lord. You must make that distinction. One „Raam‟ is
pervading everywhere, while the other is contained only in himself. || 191 || Kabeer,
those houses in which neither the Holy nor the Lord are served — those houses are like
cremation grounds; demons dwell within them. || 192 || Kabeer, I have become
mute, insane and deaf. I am crippled — the True Guru has pierced me with His Arrow.
|| 193 || Kabeer, the True Guru, the Spiritual Warrior, has shot me with His Arrow. As
soon as it struck me, I fell to the ground, with a hole in my heart. || 194 || 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1375 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Kabeer, the pure drop of water falls from the sky, onto the dirty ground. You must
acknowledge this, that without the Sangat, the Holy Congregation, it turns into burnt
ashes. || 195 || Kabeer, the pure drop of water falls from the sky, and mixes with the
dust. Millions of clever people may try, but they will fail — it cannot be made separate
again. || 196 || Kabeer, I was going on a pilgrimage to Mecca, and God met me on
the way. He scolded me and asked, “Who told you that I am only there?” || 197 ||
Kabeer, I went to Mecca — how many times, Kabeer? O Lord, what is the problem with
me? You have not spoken to me with Your Mouth. || 198 || Kabeer, they oppress
living beings and kill them, and call it proper. When the Lord calls for their account,
what will their condition be? || 199 || Kabeer, it is tyranny to use force; the Lord shall
call you to account. When your account is called for, your face and mouth shall be
beaten. || 200 || Kabeer, it is easy to render your account, if your heart is pure. In
the True Court of the Lord, no one will seize you. || 201 || Kabeer: O duality, you are
mighty and powerful in the earth and the sky. The six Shaastras and the eighty-four
Siddhas are entrenched in skepticism. || 202 || Kabeer, nothing is mine within myself.
Whatever there is, is Yours, O Lord. If I surrender to You what is already Yours, what
does it cost me? || 203 || Kabeer, repeating, “You, You”, I have become like You.
Nothing of me remains in myself. When the difference between myself and others is
removed, then wherever I look, I see only You. || 204 || Kabeer, those who think of
evil and entertain false hopes — none of their desires shall be fulfilled; they shall depart
in despair. || 205 || Kabeer, whoever meditates in remembrance on the Lord, he
alone is happy in this world. One who is protected and saved by the Creator Lord, shall
never waver, here or hereafter. || 206 || Kabeer, I was being crushed like sesame
seeds in the oil-press, but the True Guru saved me. My pre-ordained primal destiny has
now been revealed. || 207 || Kabeer, my days have passed, and I have postponed
my payments; the interest on my account continues to increase. I have not meditated
on the Lord and my account is still pending, and now, the moment of my death has
come! || 208 || FIFTH MEHL: Kabeer, the mortal is a barking dog, chasing after a
carcass. By the Grace of good karma, I have found the True Guru, who has saved me.
|| 209 || FIFTH MEHL: Kabeer, the earth belongs to the Holy, but it is being occupied
by thieves. They are not a burden to the earth; they receive its blessings. || 210 ||
FIFTH MEHL: Kabeer, the rice is beaten with a mallet to get rid of the husk. When
people sit in evil company, the Righteous Judge of Dharma calls them to account. ||
211 || Trilochan says, O Naam Dayv, Maya has enticed you, my friend. Why are you
printing designs on these sheets, and not focusing your consciousness on the Lord? ||
212 || 

Naam Dayv answers, O Trilochan, chant the Lord‟s Name with your mouth. With your
hands and feet, do all your work, but let your consciousness remain with the
Immaculate Lord. || 213 || FIFTH MEHL: Kabeer, no one belongs to me, and I
belong to no one else. The One who created the creation — into Him I shall be
absorbed. || 214 || Kabeer, the flour has fallen into the mud; nothing has come into
my hands. That which was eaten while it was being ground — that alone is of any use.
|| 215 || Kabeer, the mortal knows everything, and knowing, he still makes mistakes.
What good is a lamp in one‟s hand, if he falls into the well? || 216 || Kabeer, I am in
love with the All-knowing Lord; the ignorant ones try to hold me back. How could I ever
break with the One, who owns our soul and breath of life. || 217 || Kabeer, why kill
yourself for your love of decorations of your home and mansion? In the end, only six
feet, or a little more, shall be your lot. || 218 || Kabeer, whatever I wish for does not
happen. What can I accomplish by merely thinking? The Lord does whatever He wishes;
it is not up to me at all. || 219 || THIRD MEHL: God Himself makes the mortals
anxious, and He Himself takes the anxiety away. O Nanak, praise the One, who takes
care of all. || 220 || FIFTH MEHL: Kabeer, the mortal does not remember the Lord;
he wanders around, engrossed in greed. Committing sins, he dies, and his life ends in
an instant. || 221 || Kabeer, the body is like a clay vessel or a brittle metal pot. If you
wish to keep it safe and sound, then vibrate and meditate on the Lord; otherwise, the
thing shall break. || 222 || Kabeer, chant the Name of the Beautifully-haired Lord; do
not sleep unaware. Chanting His Name night and day, the Lord will eventually hear your
call. || 223 || Kabeer, the body is a banana forest, and the mind is an intoxicated
elephant. The jewel of spiritual wisdom is the prod, and the rare Saint is the rider. ||
224 || Kabeer, the Lord‟s Name is the jewel, and the mouth is the purse; open this
purse to the Appraiser. If a buyer can be found, it will go for a high price. || 225 ||
Kabeer, the mortal does not know the Lord‟s Name, but he has raised a very large
family. He dies in the midst of his worldly affairs, and then he is not heard in the
external world. || 226 || Kabeer, in the blink of an eye, moment by moment, life is
passing by. The mortal does not give up his worldly entanglements; the Messenger of
Death walks in and beats the drum. || 227 || Kabeer, the Lord is the tree, and
disillusionment with the world is the fruit. The Holy man, who has abandoned useless
arguments, is the shade of the tree. || 228 || Kabeer, plant the seeds of such a plant,
which shall bear fruit throughout the twelve months, with cooling shade and abundant
fruit, upon which birds joyously play. || 229 || Kabeer, the Great Giver is the tree,
which blesses all with the fruit of compassion. When the birds migrate to other lands, O
Tree, you bear the fruits. || 230 || 

Kabeer, the mortal finds the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, if he has such
destiny written upon his forehead. He obtains the treasure of liberation, and the difficult
road to the Lord is not blocked. || 231 || Kabeer, whether is is for an hour, half an
hour, or half of that, whatever it is, it is worthwhile to speak with the Holy. || 232 ||
Kabeer, those mortals who consume marijuana, fish and wine — no matter what
pilgrimages, fasts and rituals they follow, they will all go to hell. || 233 || Kabeer, I
keep my eyes lowered, and enshrine my Friend within my heart. I enjoy all pleasures
with my Beloved, but I do not let anyone else know. || 234 || Twenty-four hours a
day, every hour, my soul continues to look to You, O Lord. Why should I keep my eyes
lowered? I see my Beloved in every heart. || 235 || Listen, O my companions: my
soul dwells in my Beloved, and my Beloved dwells in my soul. I realize that there is no
difference between my soul and my Beloved; I cannot tell whether my soul or my
Beloved dwells in my heart. || 236 || Kabeer, the Brahmin may be the guru of the
world, but he is not the Guru of the devotees. He rots and dies in the perplexities of the
four Vedas. || 237 || The Lord is like sugar, scattered in the sand; the elephant
cannot pick it up. Says Kabeer, the Guru has given me this sublime understanding:
become an ant, and feed on it. || 238 || Kabeer, if you desire to play the game of
love with the Lord, then cut off your head, and make it into a ball. Lose yourself in the
play of it, and then whatever will be, will be. || 239 || Kabeer, if you desire to play
the game of love with the Lord, play it with someone with committment. Pressing the
unripe mustard seeds produces neither oil nor flour. || 240 || Searching, the mortal
stumbles like a blind person, and does not recognize the Saint. Says Naam Dayv, how
can one obtain the Lord God, without His devotee? || 241 || Forsaking the Diamond
of the Lord, the mortals put their hopes in another. Those people shall go to hell; Ravi
Daas speaks the Truth. || 242 || Kabeer, if you live the householder‟s life, then
practice righteousness; otherwise, you might as well retire from the world. If someone
renounces the world, and then gets involved in worldly entanglements, he shall suffer
terrible misfortune. || 243 ||

SHALOKS OF SHAYKH FAREED JEE:

The day of the bride‟s wedding is pre-ordained. On that day, the Messenger of Death,
of whom she had only heard, comes and shows its face. It breaks the bones of the
body and pulls the helpless soul out. That pre-ordained time of marriage cannot be
avoided. Explain this to your soul. The soul is the bride, and death is the groom. He will
marry her and take her away. After the body sends her away with its own hands, whose
neck will it embrace? The bridge to hell is narrower than a hair; haven‟t you heard of it
with your ears? Fareed, the call has come; be careful now — don‟t let yourself be
robbed. || 1 || Fareed, it is so difficult to become a humble Saint at the Lord‟s Door. I
am so accustomed to walking in the ways of the world. 

I have tied and picked up the bundle; where can I go to throw it away? || 2 || I know
nothing; I understand nothing. The world is a smouldering fire. My Lord did well to
warn me about it; otherwise, I would have been burnt as well. || 3 || Fareed, if I had
known that I had so few sesame seeds, I would have been more careful with them in
my hands. If I had known that my Husband Lord was so young and innocent, I would
not have been so arrogant. || 4 || If I had known that my robe would come loose, I
would have tied a tighter knot. I have found none as great as You, Lord; I have looked
and searched throughout the world. || 5 || Fareed, if you have a keen understanding,
then do not write black marks against anyone else. Look underneath your own collar
instead. || 6 || Fareed, do not turn around and strike those who strike you with their
fists. Kiss their feet, and return to your own home. || 7 || Fareed, when there was
time for you to earn good karma, you were in love with the world instead. Now, death
has a strong foothold; when the load is full, it is taken away. || 8 || See, Fareed, what
has happened: your beard has become grey. That which is coming is near, and the past
is left far behind. || 9 || See, Fareed, what has happened: sugar has become poison.
Without my Lord, who can I tell of my sorrow? || 10 || Fareed, my eyes have become
weak, and my ears have become hard of hearing. The body‟s crop has become ripe and
turned color. || 11 || Fareed, those who did not enjoy their Spouse when their hair
was black — hardly any of them enjoy Him when their hair turns grey. So be in love
with the Lord, so that your color may ever be new. || 12 || THIRD MEHL: Fareed,
whether one‟s hair is black or grey, our Lord and Master is always here if one
remembers Him. This loving devotion to the Lord does not come by one‟s own efforts,
even though all may long for it. This cup of loving devotion belongs to our Lord and
Master; He gives it to whomever He likes. || 13 || Fareed, those eyes which have
enticed the world — I have seen those eyes. Once, they could not endure even a bit of
mascara; now, the birds hatch their young in them! || 14 || Fareed, they shouted and
yelled, and constantly gave good advice. But those whom the devil has spoiled — how
can they turn their consciousness towards God? || 15 || Fareed, become the grass on
the path, if you long for the Lord of all. One will cut you down, and another will trample
you underfoot; then, you shall enter the Court of the Lord. || 16 || Fareed, do not
slander the dust; noting is as great as dust. When we are alive, it is under our feet, and
when we are dead, it is above us. || 17 || Fareed, when there is greed, what love can
there be? When there is greed, love is false. How long can one remain in a thatched hut
which leaks when it rains? || 18 || Fareed, why do you wander from jungle to jungle,
crashing through the thorny trees? The Lord abides in the heart; why are you looking
for Him in the jungle? || 19 || Fareed, with these small legs, I crossed deserts and
mountains. But today, Fareed, my water jug seems hundreds of miles away. || 20 || 

Fareed, the nights are long, and my sides are aching in pain. Cursed are the lives of
those who place their hopes in others. || 21 || Fareed, if I had been there when my
friend came, I would have made myself a sacrifice to him. Now my flesh is burning red
on the hot coals. || 22 || Fareed, the farmer plants acacia trees, and wishes for
grapes. He is spinning wool, but he wishes to wear silk. || 23 || Fareed, the path is
muddy, and the house of my Beloved is so far away. If I go out, my blanket will get
soaked, but if I remain at home, then my heart will be broken. || 24 || My blanket is
soaked, drenched with the downpour of the Lord‟s Rain. I am going out to meet my
Friend, so that my heart will not be broken. || 25 || Fareed, I was worried that my
turban might become dirty. My thoughtless self did not realize that one day, dust will
consume my head as well. || 26 || Fareed: sugar cane, candy, sugar, molasses,
honey and buffalo‟s milk — all these things are sweet, but they are not equal to You. ||
27 || Fareed, my bread is made of wood, and hunger is my appetizer. Those who eat
buttered bread, will suffer in terrible pain. || 28 || Eat dry bread, and drink cold
water. Fareed, if you see someone else‟s buttered bread, do not envy him for it. || 29
|| This night, I did not sleep with my Husband Lord, and now my body is suffering in
pain. Go and ask the deserted bride, how she passes her night. || 30 || She finds no
place of rest in her father-in-law‟s home, and no place in her parents‟ home either. Her
Husband Lord does not care for her; what sort of a blessed, happy soul-bride is she? ||
31 || In her father-in-law‟s home hereafter, and in her parents‟ home in this world,
she belongs to her Husband Lord. Her Husband is Inaccessible and Unfathomable. O
Nanak, she is the happy soul-bride, who is pleasing to her Carefree Lord. || 32 ||
Bathing, washing and decorating herself, she comes and sleeps without anxiety. Fareed,
she still smells like asafoetida; the fragrance of musk is gone. || 33 || I am not afraid
of losing my youth, as long as I do not lose the Love of my Husband Lord. Fareed, so
many youths, without His Love, have dried up and withered away. || 34 || Fareed,
anxiety is my bed, pain is my mattress, and the pain of separation is my blanket and
quilt. Behold, this is my life, O my True Lord and Master. || 35 || Many talk of the
pain and suffering of separation; O pain, you are the ruler of all. Fareed, that body,
within which love of the Lord does not well up — look upon that body as a cremation
ground. || 36 || Fareed, these are poisonous sprouts coated with sugar. Some die
planting them, and some are ruined, harvesting and enjoying them. || 37 || Fareed,
the hours of the day are lost wandering around, and the hours of the night are lost in
sleep. God will call for your account, and ask you why you came into this world. || 38
|| Fareed, you have gone to the Lord‟s Door. Have you seen the gong there? This
blameless object is being beaten — imagine what is in store for us sinners! || 39 ||
Each and every hour, it is beaten; it is punished every day. This beautiful body is like
the gong; it passes the night in pain. || 40 || 

Shaykh Fareed has grown old, and his body has begun to tremble. Even if he could live
for hundreds of years, his body will eventually turn to dust. || 41 || Fareed begs, O
Lord, do not make me sit at another‟s door. If this is the way you are going to keep me,
then go ahead and take the life out of my body. || 42 || With the axe on his shoulder,
and a bucket on his head, the blacksmith is ready to cut down the tree. Fareed, I long
for my Lord; you long only for the charcoal. || 43 || Fareed, some have lots of flour,
while others do not even have salt. When they go beyond this world, it shall be seen,
who will be punished. || 44 || Drums were beaten in their honor, there were canopies
above their heads, and bugles announced their coming. They have gone to sleep in the
cemetary, buried like poor orphans. || 45 || Fareed, those who built houses,
mansions and lofty buildings, are also gone. They made false deals, and were dropped
into their graves. || 46 || Fareed, there are many seams on the patched coat, but
there are no seams on the soul. The shaykhs and their disciples have all departed, each
in his own turn. || 47 || Fareed, the two lamps are lit, but death has come anyway. It
has captured the fortress of the body, and plundered the home of the heart; it
extinguishes the lamps and departs. || 48 || Fareed, look at what has happened to
the cotton and the sesame seed, the sugar cane and paper, the clay pots and the
charcoal. This is the punishment for those who do evil deeds. || 49 || Fareed, you
wear your prayer shawl on your shoulders and the robes of a Sufi; your words are
sweet, but there is a dagger in your heart. Outwardly, you look bright, but your heart is
dark as night. || 50 || Fareed, not even a drop of blood would issue forth, if someone
cut my body. Those bodies which are imbued with the Lord — those bodies contain no
blood. || 51 || THIRD MEHL: This body is all blood; without blood, this body could
not exist. Those who are imbued with their Lord, do not have the blood of greed in their
bodies. When the Fear of God fills the body, it becomes thin; the blood of greed departs
from within. Just as metal is purified by fire, the Fear of God removes the filthy residues
of evil-mindedness. O Nanak, those humble beings are beautiful, who are imbued with
the Lord‟s Love. || 52 || Fareed, seek that sacred pool, in which the genuine article is
found. Why do you bother to search in the pond? Your hand will only sink into the mud.
|| 53 || Fareed, when she is young, she does not enjoy her Husband. When she grows
up, she dies. Lying in the grave, the soul-bride cries, “I did not meet You, my Lord.” ||
54 || Fareed, your hair has turned grey, your beard has turned grey, and your
moustache has turned grey. O my thoughtless and insane mind, why are you indulging
in pleasures? || 55 || Fareed, how long can you run on the rooftop? You are asleep to
your Husband Lord — give it up! The days which were allotted to you are numbered,
and they are passing, passing away. || 56 || Fareed, houses, mansions and balconies
— do not attach your consciousness to these. When these collapse into heaps of dust,
none of them will be your friend. || 57 || 

Fareed, do not focus on mansions and wealth; center your consciousness on death,
your powerful enemy. Remember that place where you must go. || 58 || Fareed,
those deeds which do not bring merit — forget about those deeds. Otherwise, you shall
be put to shame, in the Court of the Lord. || 59 || Fareed, work for your Lord and
Master; dispel the doubts of your heart. The dervishes, the humble devotees, have the
patient endurance of trees. || 60 || Fareed, my clothes are black, and my outfit is
black. I wander around full of sins, and yet people call me a dervish — a holy man. ||
61 || The crop which is burnt will not bloom, even if it is soaked in water. Fareed, she
who is forsaken by her Husband Lord, grieves and laments. || 62 || When she is a
virgin, she is full of desire; but when she is married, then her troubles begin. Fareed,
she has this one regret, that she cannot be a virgin again. || 63 || The swans have
landed in a small pond of salt water. They dip in their bills, but do not drink; they fly
away, still thirsty. || 64 || The swans fly away, and land in the fields of grain. The
people go to chase them away. The thoughtless people do not know, that the swans do
not eat the grain. || 65 || The birds which lived in the pools have flown away and left.
Fareed, the overflowing pool shall also pass away, and only the lotus flowers shall
remain. || 66 || Fareed, a stone will be your pillow, and the earth will be your bed.
The worms shall eat into your flesh. Countless ages will pass, and you will still be lying
on one side. || 67 || Fareed, your beautiful body shall break apart, and the subtle
thread of the breath shall be snapped. In which house will the Messenger of Death be a
guest today? || 68 || Fareed, your beautiful body shall break apart, and the subtle
thread of the breath shall be snapped. Those friends who were a burden on the earth
— how can they come today? || 69 || Fareed: O faithless dog, this is not a good way
of life. You never come to the mosque for your five daily prayers. || 70 || Rise up,
Fareed, and cleanse yourself; chant your morning prayer. The head which does not bow
to the Lord — chop off and remove that head. || 71 || That head which does not bow
to the Lord — what is to be done with that head? Put it in the fireplace, instead of
firewood. || 72 || Fareed, where are your mother and father, who gave birth to you?
They have left you, but even so, you are not convinced that you shall also have to go.
|| 73 || Fareed, flatten out your mind; smooth out the hills and valleys. Hereafter, the
fires of hell shall not even approach you. || 74 || FIFTH MEHL: Fareed, the Creator is
in the Creation, and the Creation abides in God. Whom can we call bad? There is none
without Him. || 75 || Fareed, if on that day when my umbilical cord was cut, my
throat had been cut instead, I would not have fallen into so many troubles, or
undergone so many hardships. || 76 || My teeth, feet, eyes and ears have stopped
working. My body cries out, “Those whom I knew have left me!” || 77 || 

Fareed, answer evil with goodness; do not fill your mind with anger. Your body shall not
suffer from any disease, and you shall obtain everything. || 78 || Fareed, the bird is a
guest in this beautiful world-garden. The morning drums are beating — get ready to
leave! || 79 || Fareed, musk is released at night. Those who are sleeping do not
receive their share. Those whose eyes are heavy with sleep — how can they receive it?
|| 80 || Fareed, I thought that I was in trouble; the whole world is in trouble! When I
climbed the hill and looked around, I saw this fire in each and every home. || 81 ||
FIFTH MEHL: Fareed, in the midst of this beautiful earth, there is a garden of thorns.
Those humble beings who are blessed by their spiritual teacher, do not suffer even a
scratch. || 82 || FIFTH MEHL: Fareed, life is blessed and beautiful, along with the
beautiful body. Only a rare few are found, who love their Beloved Lord. || 83 || O
river, do not destroy your banks; you too will be asked to give your account. The river
flows in whatever direction the Lord orders. || 84 || Fareed, the day passes painfully;
the night is spent in anguish. The boatman stands up and shouts, “The boat is caught
in the whirlpool!” || 85 || The river flows on and on; it loves to eat into its banks.
What can the whirlpool do to the boat, if the boatman remains alert? || 86 || Fareed,
there are dozens who say they are friends; I search, but I cannot find even one. I yearn
for my beloved like a smouldering fire. || 87 || Fareed, this body is always barking.
Who can stand this constant suffering? I have put plugs in my ears; I don‟t care how
much the wind is blowing. || 88 || Fareed, God‟s dates have ripened, and rivers of
honey flow. With each passing day, your life is being stolen away. || 89 || Fareed, my
withered body has become a skeleton; the crows are pecking at my palms. Even now,
God has not come to help me; behold, this is the fate of all mortal beings. || 90 ||
The crows have searched my skeleton, and eaten all my flesh. But please do not touch
these eyes; I hope to see my Lord. || 91 || O crow, do not peck at my skeleton; if
you have landed on it, fly away. Do not eat the flesh from that skeleton, within which
my Husband Lord abides. || 92 || Fareed, the poor grave calls out, “O homeless one,
come back to your home. You shall surely have to come to me; do not be afraid of
death.” || 93 || These eyes have seen a great many leave. Fareed, the people have
their fate, and I have mine. || 94 || God says, “If you reform yourself, you shall meet
me, and meeting me, you shall be at peace. O Fareed, if you will be mine, the whole
world will be yours.” || 95 || How long can the tree remain implanted on the riverbank? Fareed, how long can water be kept in a soft clay pot? || 96 || Fareed, the
mansions are vacant; those who lived in them have gone to live underground. 

They remain there, in those unhonored graves. O Shaykh, dedicate yourself to God; you
will have to depart, today or tomorrow. || 97 || Fareed, the shore of death looks like
the river-bank, being eroded away. Beyond is the burning hell, from which cries and
shrieks are heard. Some understand this completely, while others wander around
carelessly. Those actions which are done in this world, shall be examined in the Court of
the Lord. || 98 || Fareed, the crane perches on the river bank, playing joyfully. While
it is playing, a hawk suddenly pounces on it. When the Hawk of God attacks, playful
sport is forgotten. God does what is not expected or even considered. || 99 || The
body is nourished by water and grain. The mortal comes into the world with high hopes.
But when the Messenger of Death comes, it breaks down all the doors. It binds and
gags the mortal, before the eyes of his beloved brothers. Behold, the mortal being is
going away, carried on the shoulders of four men. Fareed, only those good deeds done
in the world will be of any use in the Court of the Lord. || 100 || Fareed, I am a
sacrifice to those birds which live in the jungle. They peck at the roots and live on the
ground, but they do not leave the Lord‟s side. || 101 || Fareed, the seasons change,
the woods shake and the leaves drop from the trees. I have searched in the four
directions, but I have not found any resting place anywhere. || 102 || Fareed, I have
torn my clothes to tatters; now I wear only a rough blanket. I wear only those clothes
which will lead me to meet my Lord. || 103 || THIRD MEHL: Who do you tear apart
your fine clothes, and take to wearing a rough blanket? O Nanak, even sitting in your
own home, you can meet the Lord, if your mind is in the right place. || 104 || FIFTH
MEHL: Fareed, those who are very proud of their greatness, wealth and youth, shall
return empty-handed from their Lord, like sandhills after the rain. || 105 || Fareed,
the faces of those who forget the Lord‟s Name are dreadful. They suffer terrible pain
here, and hereafter they find no place of rest or refuge. || 106 || Fareed, if you do
not awaken in the early hours before dawn, you are dead while yet alive. Although you
have forgotten God, God has not forgotten you. || 107 || FIFTH MEHL: Fareed, my
Husband Lord is full of joy; He is Great and Self-sufficient. To be imbued with the Lord
God — this is the most beautiful decoration. || 108 || FIFTH MEHL: Fareed, look
upon pleasure and pain as the same; eradicate corruption from your heart. Whatever
pleases the Lord God is good; understand this, and you will reach His Court. || 109 ||
FIFTH MEHL: Fareed, the world dances as it dances, and you dance with it as well.
That soul alone does not dance with it, who is under the care of the Lord God. || 110
|| FIFTH MEHL: Fareed, the heart is imbued with this world, but the world is of no
use to it at all. 

It is so difficult to be like the fakeers — the Holy Saints; it is only achieved by perfect
karma. || 111 || The first watch of the night brings flowers, and the later watches of
the night bring fruit. Those who remain awake and aware, receive the gifts from the
Lord. || 112 || The gifts are from our Lord and Master; who can force Him to bestow
them? Some are awake, and do not receive them, while He awakens others from sleep
to bless them. || 113 || You search for your Husband Lord; you must have some fault
in your body. Those who are known as happy soul-brides, do not look to others. || 114
|| Within yourself, make patience the bow, make patience the bowstring, and make
patience the arrow. The Creator will not let you miss the target. || 115 || Those who
are patient abide in patience; in this way, they burn their bodies. They are close to the
Lord, but they do not reveal their secret to anyone. || 116 || Let patience be your
purpose in life; implant this within your being. In this way, you will grow into a great
river; you will not break off into a tiny stream. || 117 || Fareed, it is difficult to be a
dervish — a Holy Saint; it is easier to love bread when it is buttered. Only a rare few
follow the way of the Saints. || 118 || My body is cooking like an oven; my bones are
burning like firewood. If my feet become tired, I will walk on my head, if I can meet my
Beloved. || 119 || Do not heat up your body like an oven, and do not burn your
bones like firewood. What harm have your feet and head done to you? Behold your
Beloved within yourself. || 120 || I search for my Friend, but my Friend is already
with me. O Nanak, the Unseen Lord cannot be seen; He is revealed only to the
Gurmukh. || 121 || Seeing the swans swimming, the cranes became excited. The
poor cranes were drowned to death, with their heads below the water and their feet
sticking out above. || 122 || I knew him as a great swan, so I associated with him. If
I had known that he was a only wretched crane, I would never in my life have crossed
paths with him. || 123 || Who is a swan, and who is a crane, if God blesses him with
His Glance of Grace? || 124 || There is only one bird in the lake, but there are fifty
trappers. This body is caught in the waves of desire. O my True Lord, You are my only
hope! || 125 || What is that word, what is that virtue, and what is that magic mantra?
What are those clothes, which I can wear to captivate my Husband Lord? || 126 ||
Humility is the word, forgiveness is the virtue, and sweet speech is the magic mantra.
Wear these three robes, O sister, and you will captivate your Husband Lord. || 127 ||
If you are wise, be simple; if you are powerful, be weak; and when there is nothing to
share, then share with others. How rare is one who known as such a devotee. || 128 ||
Do not utter even a single harsh word; your True Lord and Master abides in all. Do not
break anyone‟s heart; these are all priceless jewels. || 129 || The minds of all are like
precious jewels; to harm them is not good at all. If you desire your Beloved, then do
not break anyone‟s heart. || 130 || 

ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.
TRUTH IS THE NAME.
CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED. NO FEAR. NO HATRED.
IMAGE OF THE UNDYING. BEYOND BIRTH. SELF-EXISTENT.
BY GURU‟S GRACE:

SWAIYAS FROM THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT FIFTH MEHL:

O Primal Lord God, You Yourself are the Creator, the Cause of all causes. You are Allpervading everywhere, totally filling all hearts. You are seen pervading the world; who
can know Your State? You protect all; You are our Lord and Master. O my Imperishable
and Formless Lord, You formed Yourself. You are the One and Only; no one else is like
You. O Lord, You have no end or limitation. Who can contemplate You? You are the
Father of the world, the Support of all life. Your devotees are at Your Door, O God —
they are just like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue? I
am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. || 1 ||
Streams of Ambrosial Nectar flow; Your Treasures are unweighable and overflowing in
abundance. You are the Farthest of the far, Infinite and Incomparably Beautiful. You do
whatever You please; You do not take advice from anyone else. In Your Home, creation
and destruction happen in an instant. No one else is equal to You; Your Light is
Immaculate and Pure. Millions of sins are washed away, chanting Your Name, Har, Har.
Your devotees are at Your Door, God — they are just like You. How can servant Nanak
describe them with only one tongue? I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice,
forever a sacrifice to them. || 2 || You established all the worlds from within Yourself,
and extended them outward. You are All-pervading amongst all, and yet You Yourself
remain detached. O Lord, there is no end or limit to Your Glorious Virtues; all beings
and creatures are Yours. You are the Giver of all, the One Invisible Lord. 

He Himself supports the Universe, revealing His All-powerful Creative Potency. He has
no color, form, mouth or beard. Your devotees are at Your Door, O God — they are just
like You. How can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue? I am a sacrifice,
a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. || 3 || You are the
Treasure of all virtue; who can know the value of Your spiritual wisdom and meditation?
O God, Your Place is known as the highest of the high. Mind, wealth and the breath of
life belong to You alone, Lord. The world is strung upon Your Thread. What praises can
I give to You? You are the Greatest of the great. Who can know Your Mystery? O
Unfathomable, Infinite, Divine Lord, Your Power is unstoppable. O God, You are the
Support of all. Your devotees are at Your Door, O God — they are just like You. How
can servant Nanak describe them with only one tongue? I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, a
sacrifice, a sacrifice, forever a sacrifice to them. || 4 || O Formless, Formed,
Undeceivable, Perfect, Imperishable, Unchanging, Blissful, Unlimited, Beautiful,
Immaculate, Blossoming Lord: Countless are those who sing Your Glorious Praises, but
they do not know even a tiny bit of Your extent. That humble being upon whom You
shower Your Mercy meets with You, O God. Blessed, blessed, blessed are those humble
beings, upon whom the Lord, Har, Har, showers His Mercy. Whoever meets with the
Lord through Guru Nanak is rid of both birth and death. || 5 || The Lord is said to be
True, True, True, True, the Truest of the True. There is no other like Him. He is the
Primal Being, the Primal Soul. Chanting the Ambrosial Name of the Lord, the mortal is
blessed with all comforts. Those who taste it with their tongues, those humble beings
are satisfied and fulfilled. That person who becomes pleasing to his Lord and Master,
loves the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Whoever meets with the Lord through
Guru Nanak, saves all his generations. || 6 || True is His Congregation and His Court.
The True Lord has established Truth. Sitting upon His Throne of Truth, He administers
True Justice. The True Lord Himself fashioned the Universe. He is Infallible, and does
not make mistakes. The Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord, is the jewel. Its value
cannot be appraised — it is priceless. That person, upon whom the Lord of the Universe
showers His Mercy obtains all comforts. Those who touch the Feet of the Lord through
Guru Nanak, do not have to enter the cycle of reincarnation ever again. || 7 || What
is the Yoga, what is the spiritual wisdom and meditation, and what is the way, to praise
the Lord? The Siddhas and seekers and the thirty-three million gods cannot find even a
tiny bit of the Lord‟s Value. Neither Brahma, nor Sanak, nor the thousand-headed
serpent king can find the limits of His Glorious Virtues. The Inapprehensible Lord cannot
be apprehended. He is pervading and permeating amongst all. Those whom God has
mercifully freed from their nooses — those humble beings are attached to His
devotional worship. Those who meet with the Lord through Guru Nanak are liberated
forever, here and hereafter. || 8 || I am a beggar; I seek the Sanctuary of God, the
Giver of givers. Please bless me with the gift of the dust of the feet of the Saints;
grasping them, I cross over the terrifying world-ocean. 


Please listen to my prayer, if it pleases You, O my Lord and Master. My mind yearns for
the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. This mind abides in devotional worship. The lamp is
lit in the darkness; all are saved in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, through the One Name
and faith in the Dharma. The Lord is revealed in all the worlds. O servant Nanak, the
Guru is the Supreme Lord God. || 9 ||
SWAIYAS FROM THE MOUTH OF THE GREAT FIFTH MEHL:

This body is frail and transitory, and bound to emotional attachment. I am foolish,
stone-hearted, filthy and unwise. My mind wanders and wobbles, and will not hold
steady. It does not know the state of the Supreme Lord God. I am intoxicated with the
wine of youth, beauty and the riches of Maya. I wander around perplexed, in excessive
egotistical pride. The wealth and women of others, arguments and slander, are sweet
and dear to my soul. I try to hide my deception, but God, the Inner-knower, the
Searcher of Hearts, sees and hears all. I have no humility, faith, compassion or purity,
but I seek Your Sanctuary, O Giver of life. The All-powerful Lord is the Cause of causes.
O Lord and Master of Nanak, please save me! || 1 || The Praises of the Creator, the
Enticer of the mind, are potent to destroy sins. The All-powerful Lord is the boat, to
carry us across; He saves all our generations. O my unconscious mind, contemplate and
remember Him in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. Why are you wandering
around, enticed by the darkness of doubt? Remember Him in meditation, for an hour,
for a moment, even for an instant. Chant the Name of the Lord with your tongue. You
are bound to worthless deeds and shallow pleasures; why do you spend millions of
lifetimes wandering in such pain? Chant and vibrate the Name of the Lord, O Nanak,
through the Teachings of the Saints. Meditate on the Lord with love in your soul. || 2 ||
The little sperm is planted in the body-field of the mother, and the human body, so
difficult to obtain, is formed. He eats and drinks, and enjoys pleasures; his pains are
taken away, and his suffering is gone. He is given the understanding to recognize
mother, father, siblings and relatives. He grows day by day, as the horrible specter of
old age comes closer and closer. You worthless, petty worm of Maya — remember your
Lord and Master, at least for an instant! Please take Nanak‟s hand, O Merciful Ocean of
Mercy, and take away this heavy load of doubt. || 3 || O mind, you are a mouse,
living in the mousehole of the body; you are so proud of yourself, but you act like an
absolute fool. You swing in the swing of wealth, intoxicated with Maya, and you wander
around like an owl. You take pleasure in your children, spouse, friends and relatives;
your emotional attachment to them is increasing. You have planted the seeds of
egotism, and the sprout of possessiveness has come up. You pass your life making
sinful mistakes. The cat of death, with his mouth wide-open, is watching you. You eat
food, but you are still hungry. Meditate in remembrance on the Merciful Lord of the
World, O Nanak, in the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. 

The world is just a dream. || 4 || Neither body, nor house, nor love last
forever. You are intoxicated with Maya; how long will you be proud of them? Neither
crown, nor canopy, nor servants last forever. You do not consider in your heart that
your life is passing away. Neither chariots, nor horses, nor elephants or royal thrones
shall last forever. In an instant, you will have to leave them, and depart naked. Neither
warrior, nor hero, nor king or ruler last forever; see this with your eyes. Neither
fortress, nor shelter, nor treasure will save you; doing evil deeds, you shall depart
empty-handed. Friends, children, spouses and friends — none of them last forever; they
change like the shade of a tree. God is the Perfect Primal Being, Merciful to the meek;
each and every instant, meditate in remembrance on Him, the Inaccessible and Infinite.
O Great Lord and Master, servant Nanak seeks Your Sanctuary; please shower him with
Your Mercy, and carry him across. || 5 || I have used up my breath of life, sold my
self-respect, begged for charity, committed highway robbery, and dedicated my
consciousness to the love and pursuit of acquiring wealth. I have kept it secretly hidden
from my friends, relatives, companions, children and siblings. I ran around practicing
falsehood, burning up my body and growing old. I gave up good deeds, righteousness
and Dharma, self-discipline, purity, religious vows and all good ways; I associated with
the fickle Maya. Beasts and birds, trees and mountains — in so many ways, I wandered
lost in reincarnation. I did not remember the Naam, the Name of the Lord, for a
moment, or even an instant. He is the Master of the meek, the Lord of all life. The food
and drink, and the sweet and tasty dishes became totally bitter at the last moment. O
Nanak, I was saved in the Society of the Saints, at their feet; the others, intoxicated
with Maya, have gone, leaving everything behind. || 6 || Brahma, Shiva, the Vedas
and the silent sages sing the Glorious Praises of their Lord and Master with love and
delight. Indra, Vishnu and Gorakh, who come to earth and then go to heaven again,
seek the Lord. The Siddhas, human beings, gods and demons cannot find even a tiny
bit of His Mystery. The Lord‟s humble servants are imbued with love and affection for
God their Beloved; in the delight of devotional worship, they are absorbed in the
Blessed Vision of His Darshan. But those who forsake Him, and beg from another, shall
see their mouths, teeth and tongues wear away. O my foolish mind, meditate in
remembrance on the Lord, the Giver of peace. Slave Nanak imparts these teachings. ||
7 || The pleasures of Maya shall fade away. In doubt, the mortal falls into the deep
dark pit of emotional attachment. He is so proud, even the sky cannot contain him. His
belly is filled with manure, bones and worms. He runs around in the ten directions, for
the sake of the great poison of corruption. He steals the wealth of others, and in the
end, he is destroyed by his own ignorance. His youth passes away, the illnesses of old
age seize him, and the Messenger of Death punishes him; such is the death he dies. He
suffers the agony of hell in countless incarnations; he rots away in the pit of pain and
condemnation. O Nanak, those whom the Saint mercifully takes as his own, are carried
across by their loving devotional worship. || 8 || All virtues are obtained, all fruits and
rewards, and the desires of the mind; my hopes have been totally fulfilled. 

The Medicine, the Mantra, the Magic Charm, will cure all illnesses and totally take away
all pain. Lust, anger, egotism, jealousy and desire are eliminated by chanting the Name
of the Lord. The merits of cleansing baths, charity, penance, purity and good deeds, are
obtained by enshrining the Lotus Feet of God within the heart. The Lord is my Friend,
my Very Best Friend, Companion and Relative. God is the Sustenance of the soul, the
Support of the breath of life. I have grasped the Shelter and Support of my All-powerful
Lord and Master; slave Nanak is forever a sacrifice to Him. || 9 || Weapons cannot
cut that person who delights in the love of the Lord‟s Lotus Feet. Ropes cannot bind
that person whose mind is pierced through by the Vision of the Lord‟s Way. Fire cannot
burn that person who is attached to the dust of the feet of the Lord‟s humble servant.
Water cannot drown that person whose feet walk on the Lord‟s Path. O Nanak,
diseases, faults, sinful mistakes and emotional attachment are pierced by the Arrow of
the Name. || 1 || 10 || People are engaged in making all sorts of efforts; they
contemplate the various aspects of the six Shaastras. Rubbing ashes all over their
bodies, they wander around at the various sacred shrines of pilgrimage; they fast until
their bodies are emaciated, and braid their hair into tangled messes. Without devotional
worship of the Lord, they all suffer in pain, caught in the tangled web of their love.
They perform worship ceremonies, draw ritual marks on their bodies, cook their own
food fanatically, and make pompous shows of themselves in all sorts of ways. ||2 || 11
|| 20 ||
SWAIYAS IN PRAISE OF THE FIRST MEHL:

Meditate single-mindedly on the Primal Lord God, the Bestower of blessings. He is the
Helper and Support of the Saints, manifest forever. Grasp His Feet and enshrine them
in your heart. Then, let us sing the Glorious Praises of the most exalted Guru Nanak. ||
1 || I sing the Glorious Praises of the most exalted Guru Nanak, the Ocean of peace,
the Eradicator of sins, the sacred pool of the Shabad, the Word of God. The beings of
deep and profound understanding, oceans of wisdom, sing of Him; the Yogis and
wandering hermits meditate on Him. Indra and devotees like Prahlaad, who know the
joy of the soul, sing of Him. Kal the poet sings the Sublime Praises of Guru Nanak, who
enjoys mastery of Raja Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success. || 2 || King Janak
and the great Yogic heroes of the Lord‟s Way, sing the Praises of the All-powerful Primal
Being, filled with the sublime essence of the Lord. Sanak and Brahma‟s sons, the
Saadhus and Siddhas, the silent sages and humble servants of the Lord sing the Praises
of Guru Nanak, who cannot be deceived by the great deceiver. Dhoma the seer and
Dhroo, whose realm is unmoving, sing the Glorious Praises of Guru Nanak, who knows
the ecstasy of loving devotional worship. Kal the poet sings the Sublime Praises of Guru
Nanak, who enjoys mastery of Raja Yoga. || 3 || Kapila and the other Yogis sing of
Guru Nanak. He is the Avataar, the Incarnation of the Infinite Lord. Parasraam the son
of Jamdagan, whose axe and powers were taken away by Raghuvira, sing of Him.
Udho, Akrur and Bidur sing the Glorious Praises of Guru Nanak, who knows the Lord,
the Soul of All. 

Kal the poet sings the Sublime Praises of Guru Nanak, who enjoys mastery of Raja
Yoga. || 4 || The four castes and the six Shaastras sing His Glorious Praises; Brahma
and the others contemplate His Virtues. The thousand-tongued serpent king sings His
Praises with delight, remaining lovingly attached to Him. Shiva, detached and beyond
desire, sings the Glorious Praises of Guru Nanak, who knows the Lord‟s endless
meditation. Kal the poet sings the Sublime Praises of Guru Nanak, who enjoys mastery
of Raja Yoga. || 5 || He mastered Raja Yoga, and enjoys sovereignty over both
worlds; the Lord, beyond hate and revenge, is enshrined within His Heart. The whole
world is saved, and carried across, chanting the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Sanak
and Janak and the others sing His Praises, age after age. Blessed, blessed, blessed and
fruitful is the sublime birth of the Guru into the world. Even in the nether regions, His
Victory is celebrated; so says Kal the poet. You are blessed with the Nectar of the Lord‟s
Name, O Guru Nanak; You have mastered Raja Yoga, and enjoy sovereignty over both
worlds. || 6 || In the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, You deceived Baal the king. In the
Silver Age of Traytaa Yuga, You were called Raam of the Raghu dynasty. In the Brass
Age of Dwaapur Yuga, You were Krishna; You killed Mur the demon and saved Kans.
You blessed Ugrasain with a kingdom, and You blessed Your humble devotees with
fearlessness. In the Iron Age, the Dark Age of Kali Yuga, You are known and accepted
as Guru Nanak, Guru Angad and Guru Amar Das. The sovereign rule of the Great Guru
is unchanging and permanent, according the Command of the Primal Lord God. || 7 ||
His Glorious Praises are sung by the devotees Ravi Daas, Jai Dayv and Trilochan. The
devotees Naam Dayv and Kabeer praise Him continually, knowing Him to be even-eyed.
The devotee Baynee sings His Praises; He intuitively enjoys the ecstasy of the soul. He
is the Master of Yoga and meditation, and the spiritual wisdom of the Guru; He knows
none other except God. Sukh Dayv and Preekhyat sing His Praises, and Gautam the
rishi sings His Praise. Says Kal the poet, the ever-fresh praises of Guru Nanak are
spread throughout the world. || 8 || In the nether worlds, His Praises are sung by the
devotees like Shaysh-naag in serpent form. Shiva, the Yogis and the wandering hermits
sing His Praises forever. Vyaas the silent sage sings His Praise, contemplating the
subtleties of the Vedas. His Praises are sung by Brahma, who created the entire
universe by God‟s Command. God fills the galaxies and realms of the universe; He is
known to be the same, manifest and unmanifest. Kal chants the Sublime Praises of
Guru Nanak, who enjoys mastery of Yoga. || 9 || The nine masters of Yoga sing His
Praises; blessed is the Guru, who is merged into the True Lord. Maandhaataa, who
called himself ruler of all the world, sings His Praises. Bal the king, dwelling in the
seventh underworld, sings His Praises. Bhart‟har, abiding forever with Gorakh, his guru,
sings His Praises. Doorbaasaa, King Puro and Angra sing the Praises of Guru Nanak.
Says Kal the poet, the Sublime Praises of Guru Nanak intuitively permeate each and
every heart. || 10 || 

SWAIYAS IN PRAISE OF THE SECOND MEHL:

Blessed is the Primal Lord God, the Creator, the All-powerful Cause of causes. Blessed is
the True Guru Nanak, who placed His hand upon Your forehead. When He placed His
hand upon Your forehead, then the celestial nectar began to rain down in torrents; the
gods and human beings, heavenly heralds and sages were drenched in its fragrance.
You challenged and subdued the cruel demon of death; You restrained Your wandering
mind; You overpowered the five demons and You keep them in one home. Through the
Guru‟s Door, the Gurdwara, You have conquered the world; You play the game evenhandedly. You keep the flow of your love steady for the Formless Lord. O Kal, chant the Praises of Lehnaa throughout the seven continents; He met with the Lord, and became
Guru of the World. || 1 || The Stream of Ambrosial Nectar from His eyes washes
away the slime and filth of sins; the sight of His door dispels the darkness of ignorance.
Whoever accomplishes this most difficult task of contemplating the most sublime Word
of the Shabad — those people cross over the terrifying world-ocean, and cast off their
loads of sin. The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation, is celestial and sublime; whoever
remains awake and aware, contemplating the Guru, embodies humility, and is imbued
forever with the Supreme Love of the Lord. O Kal, chant the Praises of Lehnaa
throughout the seven continents; He met with the Lord, and became Guru of the World.
|| 2 || You hold tight to the Naam, the Name of the Infinite Lord; Your expanse is
immaculate. You are the Support of the Siddhas and seekers, and the good and humble
beings. You are the incarnation of King Janak; the contemplation of Your Shabad is
sublime throughout the universe. You abide in the world like the lotus on the water.
Like the Elyisan Tree, You cure all illnesses and take away the sufferings of the world.
The three-phased soul is lovingly attuned to You alone. O Kal, chant the Praises of
Lehnaa throughout the seven continents; He met with the Lord, and became Guru of
the World. || 3 || You were blessed with glory by the Prophet; You serve the Guru,
certified by the Lord, who has subdued the snake of the mind, and who abides in the
state of sublime bliss. Your Vision is like that of the Lord, Your soul is a fount of spiritual
wisdom; You know the unfathomable state of the certified Guru. Your Gaze is focused
upon the unmoving, unchanging place. Your Intellect is immaculate; it is focused upon
the most sublime place. Wearing the armor of humility, you have overcome Maya. O
Kal, chant the Praises of Lehnaa throughout the seven continents; He met with the
Lord, and became Guru of the World. || 4 || Casting Your Glance of Grace, you dispel
the darkness, burn away evil, and destroy sin. You are the Heroic Warrior of the
Shabad, the Word of God. Your Power destroys sexual desire and anger. You have
overpowered greed and emotional attachment; You nurture and cherish those who seek
Your Sanctuary. You gather in the joyful love of the soul; Your Words have the Potency
to bring forth Ambrosial Nectar. You are appointed the True Guru, the True Guru in this
Dark Age of Kali Yuga; whoever is truly attached to You is carried across. 

The lion, the son of Pheru, is Guru Angad, the Guru of the World; Lehnaa practices Raja
Yoga, the Yoga of meditation and success. || 5 || Your mind remains lovingly attuned
to the Lord forever; You do whatever you desire. Like the tree heavy with fruit, You
bow in humility, and endure the pain of it; You are pure of thought. You realize this
reality, that the Lord is All-pervading, Unseen and Amazing. With intuitive ease, You
send forth the rays of the Ambrosial Word of power. You have risen to the state of the
certified Guru; you grasp truth and contentment. Kal proclaims, that whoever attains
the Blessed Vision of the Darshan of Lehnaa, meets with the Lord. || 6 || My mind
has faith, that the Prophet has given You access to the Profound Lord. Your body has
been purged of the deadly poison; You drink the Ambrosial Nectar deep within. Your
Heart has blossomed forth in awareness of the Unseen Lord, who has infused His Power
throughout the ages. O True Guru, You are intuitively absorbed in Samaadhi, with
continuity and equality. You are open-minded and large-hearted, the Destroyer of
poverty; seeing You, sins are afraid. Says Kal, I lovingly, continually, intuitively chant
the Praises of Lehnaa with my tongue. || 7 || The Naam, the Name of the Lord, is our
medicine; the Naam is our support; the Naam is the peace of Samaadhi. The Naam is
the insignia which embellishes us forever. Kal is imbued with the Love of the Naam, the
Naam which is the fragrance of gods and human beings. Whoever obtains the Naam,
the Philosopher‟s Stone, becomes the embodiment of Truth, manifest and radiant
throughout the world. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan, it is as if
one has bathed at the sixty-eight sacred shrines of pilgrimage. || 8 || The True Name
is the sacred shrine, the True Name is the cleansing bath of purification and food. The
True Name is eternal love; chant the True Name, and be embellished. The True Name
is obtained through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad; the Sangat, the Holy Congregation,
is fragrant with the True Name. Kal the poet utters the Praises of the one whose selfdiscipline is the True Name, and whose fast is the True Name. Gazing upon the Blessed
Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan, one‟s life is approved and certified in the True Name. || 9
|| When You bestow Your Ambrosial Glance of Grace, You eradicate all wickedness,
sin and filth. Sexual desire, anger, greed and emotional attachment — You have
overcome all these powerful passions. Your mind is filled with peace forever; You
banish the sufferings of the world. The Guru is the river of the nine treasures, washing
off the dirt of our lives. So speaks Tal the poet: serve the Guru, day and night, with
intuitive love and affection. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of the Guru, the pains of
death and rebirth are taken away. 

|| 10 || SWAIYAS IN PRAISE OF THE THIRD MEHL:

Dwell upon that Primal Being, the True Lord God; in this world, His One Name is
Undeceivable. He carries His devotees across the terrifying world-ocean; meditate in
remembrance on His Naam, Supreme and Sublime. Nanak delighted in the Naam; He
established Lehnaa as Guru, who was imbued with all supernatural spiritual powers. So
speaks Kal the poet: the glory of the wise, sublime and humble Amar Daas is spread
throughout the world. His Praises radiate throughout the world, like the rays of the sun,
and the branches of the tree. 

In the north, south, east and west, people proclaim Your Victory. The Guru spoke the
Lord‟s Name with His mouth and broadcast it throughout the world, to turn the tide of
the hearts of men. That Undeceivable Naam, which carries the devotees across the
world-ocean, came into Guru Amar Daas. || 1 || The gods and heavenly heralds, the
Siddhas and seekers and Shiva in Samaadhi meditate in remembrance on the Naam,
the Name of the Lord. The stars and the realms of Dhroo, and devotees like Naaraad
and Prahlaad meditate on the Naam. The moon and the sun long for the Naam; it has
saved even mountain ranges. That Undeceivable Naam, which carries the devotees
across the world-ocean, came into Guru Amar Daas. || 2 || Dwelling upon that
Immaculate Naam, the nine Yogic masters, Shiva and Sanak and many others have
been emancipated. The eighty-four Siddhas, the beings of supernatural spiritual
powers, and the Buddhas are imbued with the Naam; it carried Ambreek across the
terrifying world-ocean. It has erased the sinful residues of past mistakes of Oodho,
Akroor, Trilochan, Naam Dayv and Kabeer, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga. That
Undeceivable Naam, which carries the devotees across the world-ocean, came into Guru
Amar Daas. || 3 || The thirty-three million angels meditate, attached to the Naam; it
is enshrined within the minds of the celibates and ascetics. Bhisham Pitama, the son of
the Ganges, meditated on that Naam; his consciousness delighted in the Ambrosial
Nectar of the Lord‟s Feet. The great and profound Guru has brought forth the Naam;
accepting the teachings as true, the Holy Congregation has been saved. That
Undeceivable Naam, which carries the devotees across the world-ocean, came into Guru
Amar Daas. || 4 || The Glory of the Naam shines forth, like the rays of the sun, and
the branches of the Elysian Tree. In the countries of the north, south, east and west,
the Praises of the Naam are chanted. Life is fruitful, when the Name of the Lord abides
in the heart. The angelic beings, heavenly heralds, celestial singers and the six
Shaastras yearn for the Naam. The son of Tayj Bhaan of the Bhalla dynasty is noble and
famous; with his palms pressed together, Kal meditates on Him. The Naam takes away
the fears of the devotees about the word-ocean; Guru Amar Daas has obtained it. || 5
|| The thirty-one million gods meditate on the Naam, along with the Siddhas and
seekers; the Naam supports solar systems and galaxies. One who meditates on the
Naam in Samaadhi, endures sorrow and joy as one and the same. The Naam is the
most sublime of all; the devotees remain lovingly attuned to it. Guru Amar Daas was
blessed with the treasure of the Naam, by the Creator Lord, in His Pleasure. || 6 || He
is the Warrior Hero of Truth, humility is His Power. His Loving Nature inspires the
Congregation with deep and profound understanding; He is absorbed in the Lord, free
of hate and vengeance. Patience has been His white banner since the beginning of
time, planted on the bridge to heaven. The Saints meet their Beloved Guru, who is
united with the Creator Lord. Serving the True Guru, they find peace; Guru Amar Daas
has given them this ability. || 7 || The Naam is His cleansing bath; the Naam is the
food He eats; the Naam is the taste He enjoys. With deep yearning, He chants the
Sweet Bani of the Guru‟s Word forever. Blessed is service to the True Guru; by His
Grace, the State of the Unfathomable Lord is known. All Your generations are totally
saved; You dwell in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. 

So speaks Kal: fruitful is the life of one who meets with Guru Amar Daas, radiant with
the Light of God. || 8 || On His right hand is the sign of the lotus; the Siddhis, the
supernatural spiritual powers, await His Command. On His left are worldly powers,
which fascinate the three worlds. The Inexpressible Lord abides in His Heart; He alone
knows this joy. Guru Amar Daas utters the words of devotion, imbued with the Love of
the Lord. On His forehead is the true insignia of the Lord‟s Mercy; with his palms
pressed together, Kal meditates on Him. Whoever meets with the Guru, the certified
True Guru, has all his desires fulfilled. || 9 || Supremely fruitful are the feet which
walk upon the path of Guru Amar Daas. Supremely fruitful are the hands which touch
the feet of Guru Amar Daas. Supremely fruitful is the tongue which utters the praises of
Guru Amar Daas. Supremely fruitful are the eyes which behold Guru Amar Daas.
Supremely fruitful are the ears which hear the Praises of Guru Amar Daas. Fruitful is the
heart in which Guru Amar Daas, the Father of the world, Himself abides. Fruitful is the
head, says Jaalap, which bows forever before Guru Amar Daas. || 1 || 10 || They do
not suffer pain or hunger, and they cannot be called poor. They do not grieve, and their
limits cannot be found. They do not serve anyone else, but they give gifts to hundreds
and thousands. They sit on beautiful carpets; they establish and disestablish at will.
They find peace in this world, and live fearlessly amidst their enemies. They are fruitful
and prosperous, says Jaalap. Guru Amar Daas is pleased with them. || 2 || 11 || You
read about the One Lord, and enshrine Him in Your mind; You realize the One and Only
Lord. With Your eyes and the words You speak, You dwell upon the One Lord; You do
not know any other place of rest. You know the One Lord while dreaming, and the One
Lord while awake. You are absorbed in the One. At the age of seventy-one, You began
to march towards the Indestructible Lord. The One Lord, who takes hundreds of
thousands of forms, cannot be seen. He can only be described as One. So speaks
Jaalap: O Guru Amar Daas, You long for the One Lord, and believe in the One Lord
alone. || 3 || 12 || The understanding which Jai Dayv grasped, the understanding
which permeated Naam Dayv, the understanding which was in the consciousness of
Trilochan and known by the devotee Kabeer, by which Rukmaangad constantly
meditated on the Lord, O Siblings of Destiny, which brought Ambreek and Prahlaad to
seek the Sanctuary of the Lord of the Universe, and which brought them to salvation —
that sublime understanding has brought You to renounce greed, anger and desire, and
to know the way. Guru Amar Daas is the Lord‟s own devotee; gazing upon the Blessed
Vision of His Darshan, one is liberated. || 4 || 13 || Meeting with Guru Amar Daas,
the earth is purged of its sin. The Siddhas and seekers long to meet with Guru Amar
Daas. Meeting with Guru Amar Daas, the mortal meditates on the Lord, and his journey
comes to its end. 

Meeting with Guru Amar Daas, the Fearless Lord is obtained, and the cycle of
reincarnation is brought to an end. Realizing the One Lord, love of duality ceases, and
one comes to accept the Sublime Mantra of the Guru. So speaks Jaalap: countless
treasures are obtained, by the sight of Guru Amar Daas. || 5 || 14 || Guru Nanak
gathered up the True Name of the Creator Lord, and implanted it within. Through Him,
Lehnaa became manifest in the form of Guru Angad, who remained lovingly attuned to
His Feet. Guru Amar Daas of that dynasty is the home of hope. How can I express His
Glorious Virtues? His Virtues are unknowable and unfathomable. I do not know the
limits of His Virtues. The Creator, the Architect of Destiny, has made Him a boat to
carry all His generations across, along with the Sangat, the Holy Congregation. So
speaks Keerat: O Guru Amar Daas, please protect me and save me; I seek the
Sanctuary of Your Feet. || 1 || 15 || The Lord Himself wielded His Power and entered
the world. The Formless Lord took form, and with His Light He illuminated the realms of
the world. He is All-pervading everywhere; the Lamp of the Shabad, the Word, has
been lit. Whoever gathers in the essence of the teachings shall be absorbed in the Feet
of the Lord. Lehnaa, who became Guru Angad, and Guru Amar Daas, have been
reincarnated into the pure house of Guru Nanak. Guru Amar Daas is our Saving Grace,
who carries us across; in lifetime after lifetime, I seek the Sanctuary of Your Feet. || 2
|| 16 || Gazing upon the Blessed Vision of His Darshan, the Gursikh is blessed with
chanting and deep meditation, truth and contentment. Whoever seeks His Sanctuary is
saved; his account is cleared in the City of Death. His heart is totally filled with loving
devotion; he chants to the Creator Lord. The Guru is the river of pearls; in an instant,
he carries the drowning ones across. He was reincarnated into the House of Guru
Nanak; He chants the Glorious Praises of the Creator Lord. Those who serve Guru Amar
Daas — their pains and poverty are taken away, far away. || 3 || 17 || I consciously
pray within my consciousness, but I cannot express it in words. I place all my worries
and anxieties before You; I look to the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy, for
help. By the Hukam of Your Command, I am blessed with Your Insignia; I serve my
Lord and Master. When You, O Guru, gaze at me with Your Glance of Grace, the fruit of
the Naam, the Name of the Creator, is placed within my mouth. The Unfathomable and
Unseen Primal Lord God, the Cause of causes — as He orders, so do I speak. O Guru
Amar Daas, Doer of deeds, Cause of causes, as You keep me, I remain; as You protect
me, I survive. || 4 || 18 || OF BHIKHAA: In deep meditation, and the spiritual
wisdom of the Guru, one‟s essence merges with the essence of reality. In truth, the
True Lord is recognized and realized, when one is lovingly attuned to Him, with onepointed consciousness. Lust and anger are brought under control, when the breath
does not fly around, wandering restlessly. Dwelling in the land of the Formless Lord,
realizing the Hukam of His Command, His contemplative wisdom is attained. In this
Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Guru is the Form of the Creator, the Primal Lord God; he
alone knows, who has tried it. So speaks Bhikhaa: I have met the Guru. With love and
intuitive affection, He has bestowed the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. || 1 || 19 || I
have been searching for the Saints; I have seen so many Holy and spiritual people. The
hermits, Sannyaasees, ascetics, penitents, fanatics and Pandits all speak sweetly. 

I wandered around lost for a year, but no one touched my soul. I listened to preachers
and teachers, but I could not be happy with their lifestyles. Those who have abandoned
the Lord‟s Name, and become attached to duality — why should I speak in praise of
them? So speaks Bhikhaa: the Lord has led me to meet the Guru. As You keep me, I
remain; as You protect me, I survive. || 2 || 20 || Wearing the armor of Samaadhi,
the Guru has mounted the saddled horse of spiritual wisdom. Holding the bow of
Dharma in His Hands, He has shot the arrows of devotion and humility. He is fearless in
the Fear of the Eternal Lord God; He has thrust the spear of the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad into the mind. He has cut down the five demons of unfulfilled sexual desire,
unresolved anger, unsatisfied greed, emotional attachment and self-conceit. Guru Amar
Daas, the son of Tayj Bhaan, of the noble Bhalla dynasty, blessed by Guru Nanak, is the
Master of kings. Sall speaks the truth; O Guru Amar Daas, you have conquered the
army of evil, fighting the battle this way. || 1 || 21 || The raindrops of the clouds, the
plants of the earth, and the flowers of the spring cannot be counted. Who can know the
limits of the rays of the sun and the moon, the waves of the ocean and the Ganges?
With Shiva‟s meditation and the spiritual wisdom of the True Guru, says Bhall the poet,
these may be counted. O Guru Amar Daas, Your Glorious Virtues are so sublime; Your
Praises belong only to You. || 1 || 22 ||
SWAIYAS IN PRAISE OF THE FOURTH MEHL:

Meditate single-mindedly on the Immaculate Primal Lord God. By Guru‟s Grace, sing the
Glorious Praises of the Lord forever. Singing His Praises, the mind blossoms forth in
ecstasy. The True Guru fulfills the hopes of His humble servant. Serving the True Guru,
the supreme status is obtained. Meditate on the Imperishable, Formless Lord God.
Meeting with Him, one escapes poverty. Kalsahaar chants His Glorious Praises. I chant
the pure praises of that humble being who has been blessed with the Ambrosial Nectar
of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. He served the True Guru and was blessed with the
sublime essence of the Shabad, the Word of God. The Immaculate Naam has been
enshrined in his heart. He enjoys and savors the Lord‟s Name, and purchases the
Glorious Virtues of the Lord of the Universe. He seeks the essence of reality; he is the
Fountain of even-handed justice. So speaks Kal the poet: Guru Raam Daas, the son of
Har Daas, fills the empty pools to overflowing. || 1 || The stream of ambrosial nectar
flows and the immortal status is obtained; the pool is forever overflowing with
Ambrosial Nectar. Those Saints who have served the Lord in the past drink in this
Nectar, and bathe their minds in it. God takes their fears away, and blesses them with
the state of fearless dignity. Through the Word of His Shabad, He has saved them. So
speaks Kal the poet: Guru Raam Daas, the son of Har Daas, fills the empty pools to
overflowing. || 2 || The True Guru‟s understanding is deep and profound. The Sat
Sangat is His Pure Congregation. His Soul is drenched in the deep crimson color of the
Lord‟s Love. The Lotus of His mind remains awake and aware, illuminated with intuitive
wisdom. In His own home, He has obtained the Fearless, Immaculate Lord. 

The Merciful True Guru has implanted the Lord‟s Name within me, and by His Grace, I
have overpowered the five thieves. So speaks Kal the poet: Guru Raam Daas, the son
of Har Daas, fills the empty pools to overflowing. || 3 || With intuitive detachment, He
is lovingly attuned to the Fearless, Unmanifest Lord; He met with Guru Amar Daas, the
Philosopher‟s Stone, within his own home. By the Grace of the True Guru, He attained
the supreme status; He is overflowing with the treasures of loving devotion. He was
released from reincarnation, and the fear of death was taken away. His consciousness is
attached to the Lord, the Ocean of contentment. So speaks Kal the poet: Guru Raam
Daas, the son of Har Daas, fills the empty pools to overflowing. || 4 || He fills the
empty to overflowing; He has enshrined the Infinite within His heart. Within His mind,
He contemplates the essence of reality. the Destroyer of pain, the Enlightener of the
soul. He yearns for the Lord‟s Love forever; He Himself knows the sublime essence of
this Love. By the Grace of the True Guru, He intuitively enjoys this Love. By the Grace
of Guru Nanak, and the sublime teachings of Guru Angad, Guru Amar Daas broadcast
the Lord‟s Command. So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam Daas, You have attained the status
of eternal and imperishable dignity. || 5 || You abide in the pool of contentment; Your
tongue reveals the Ambrosial Essence. Meeting with You, a tranquil peace wells up, and
sins run far away. You have attained the Ocean of peace, and You never grow tired on
the Lord‟s path. The armor of self-restraint, truth, contentment and humility can never
be pierced. The Creator Lord certified the True Guru, and now the world blows the
trumpet of His Praises. So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam Daas, You have attained the state
of fearless immortality. || 6 || O certified True Guru, You have conquered the world;
You meditate single-mindedly on the One Lord. Blessed, blessed is Guru Amar Daas, the
True Guru, who implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, deep within. The Naam is
the wealth of the nine treasures; prosperity and supernatural spiritual powers are His
slaves. He is blessed with the ocean of intuitive wisdom; He has met with the
Imperishable Lord God. The Guru has implanted the Naam deep within; attached to the
Naam, the devotees have been carried across since ancient times. So speaks Kal: O
Guru Raam Daas, You have obtained the wealth of the Lord‟s Love. || 7 || The flow of
loving devotion and primal love does not stop. The True Guru drinks in the stream of
nectar, the sublime essence of the Shabad, the Infinite Word of God. Wisdom is His
mother, and contentment is His father; He is absorbed in the ocean of intuitive peace
and poise. The Guru is the Embodiment of the Unborn, Self-illumined Lord; by the Word
of His Teachings, the Guru carries the world across. Within His mind, the Guru has
enshrined the Shabad, the Word of the Unseen, Unfathomable, Infinite Lord. So speaks
Kal: O Guru Raam Daas, You have attained the Lord, the Saving Grace of the world. ||
8 || The Saving Grace of the world, the nine treasures, carries the devotees across the
world-ocean. The Drop of Ambrosial Nectar, the Lord‟s Name, is the antidote to the
poison of sin. The tree of intuitive peace and poise blossoms and bears the ambrosial
fruit of spiritual wisdom. Blessed are those fortunate people who receive it, by Guru‟s
Grace. They are liberated through the Shabad, the Word of the True Guru; their minds
are filled with the Guru‟s Wisdom. 

So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam Daas, You beat the drum of the Shabad. || 9 || On the
bed of faith, with the blankets of intuitive peace and poise and the canopy of
contentment, You are embellished forever with the armor of humility. Through the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, you practice the Naam; You lean on its Support, and give
Your Fragrance to Your companions. You abide with the Unborn Lord, the Good and
Pure True Guru. So speaks Kal: O Guru Raam Daas, You abide in the sacred pool of
intuitive peace and poise. || 10 || The Lord‟s Name abides in the hearts of those who
are pleasing to the Guru. Sins run far away from those who are pleasing to the Guru.
Those who are pleasing to the Guru eradicate pride and egotism from within. Those
who are pleasing to the Guru are attached to the Shadad, the Word of God; they are
carried across the terrifying world-ocean. Those who are blessed with the wisdom of
the certified Guru — blessed and fruitful is their birth into the world. Kal the poet runs
to the Sanctuary of the Great Guru; attached to the Guru, they are blessed with worldly
enjoyments, liberation and everything. || 11 || The Guru has pitched the tent; under
it, all the ages are gathered. He carries the spear of intuition, and takes the Support of
Naam, the Name of the Lord, through which the devotees are fulfilled. Guru Nanak,
Guru Angad and Guru Amar Daas, through devotional worship, have merged into the
Lord. O Guru Raam Daas, You alone know the taste of this Raja Yoga. || 12 || He
alone is enlightened like Janaka, who links the chariot of his mind to the state of
ecstatic realization. He gathers in truth and contentment, and fills up the empty pool
within. He speaks the Unspoken Speech of the eternal city. He alone obtains it, unto
whom God gives it. O Guru Raam Daas, Your sovereign rule, like that of Janak, is Yours
alone. || 13 || Tell me, how can sin and suffering cling to that humble being who
chants the Naam, given by the Guru, with single-minded love and firm faith? When the
Lord, the Boat to carry us across, bestows His Glance of Grace, even for an instant, the
mortal contemplates the Shabad within his heart; unfulfilled sexual desire and
unresolved anger are eradicated. The Guru is the Giver to all beings; He speaks the
spiritual wisdom of the Unfathomable Lord, and meditates on Him day and night. He
never sleeps, even for an instant. Seeing Him, poverty vanishes, and one is blessed
with the treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord. The spiritual wisdom of the
Guru‟s Word washes away the filth of evil-mindedness. Tell me, how can sin and
suffering cling to that humble being who chants the Naam, given by the Guru, with
single-minded love and firm faith? || 1 || Dharmic faith and the karma of good deeds
are obtained from the Perfect True Guru. The Siddhas and Holy Saadhus, the silent
sages and angelic beings, yearn to serve Him; through the most excellent Word of the
Shabad, they are lovingly attuned to the One Lord. Who can know Your limits? You are
the Embodiment of the Fearless, Formless Lord. You are the Speaker of the Unspoken
Speech; You alone understand this. O foolish worldly mortal, you are deluded by doubt;
give up birth and death, and you shall not be punished by the Messenger of Death.
Meditate on the Guru‟s Teachings. You foolish mortal being, reflect on this in your mind;
chant and meditate day and night. Dharmic faith and the karma of good deeds are
obtained from the Perfect True Guru. || 2 || I am a sacrifice, a sacrifice, to the True
Name, O my True Guru. What Praises can I offer to You? What service can I do for
You? I have only one mouth and tongue; with my palms pressed together, I chant to
You with joy and delight. 

In thought, word and deed, I know the Lord; I do not worship any other. The Guru has
enshrined the most excellent Name of the Infinite Lord within my heart. So speaks Nall
the poet: touching the Philosopher‟s Stone, glass is transformed into gold, and the
sandalwood tree imparts its fragrance to other trees; meditating in remembrance on the
Lord, I am transformed. Seeing His Door, I am rid of sexual desire and anger. I am a
sacrifice, a sacrifice, to the True Name, O my True Guru. || 3 || Guru Raam Daas was
blessed with the Throne of Raja Yoga. First, Guru Nanak illuminated the world, like the
full moon, and filled it with bliss. To carry humanity across, He bestowed His Radiance.
He blessed Guru Angad with the treasure of spiritual wisdom, and the Unspoken
Speech; He overcame the five demons and the fear of the Messenger of Death. The
Great and True Guru, Guru Amar Daas, has preserved honor in this Dark Age of Kali
Yuga. Seeing His Lotus Feet, sin and evil are destroyed. When His mind was totally
satisfied in every way, when He was totally pleased, He bestowed upon Guru Raam
Daas the Throne of Raja Yoga. || 4 || RADD: He established the earth, the sky and
the air, the water of the oceans, fire and food. He created the moon, the starts and the
sun, night and day and mountains; he blessed the trees with flowers and fruits. He
created the gods, human beings and the seven seas; He established the three worlds.
Guru Amar Daas was blessed with the Light of the One Name, the True Name of the
Lord. || 1 || 5 || Glass is transformed into gold, listening to the Word of the Guru‟s
Shabad. Poison is transformed into ambrosial nectar, speaking the Name of the True
Guru. Iron is transformed into jewels, when the True Guru bestows His Glance of Grace.
Stones are transformed into emeralds, when the mortal chants and contemplates the
spiritual wisdom of the Guru. The True Guru transforms ordinary wood into sandalwood,
eradicating the pains of poverty. Whoever touches the Feet of the True Guru, is
transformed from a beast and a ghost into an angelic being. || 2 || 6 || One who has
the Guru on his side — how could he be proud of his wealth? One who has the Guru on
his side — what would hundreds of thousands of supporters do for him? One who has
the Guru on his side, does not depend on anyone else for spiritual wisdom and
meditation. One who has the Guru on his side contemplates the Shabad and the
Teachings, and abides in the Home of Truth. The Lord‟s humble slave and poet utters
this prayer: whoever chants to the Guru night and day, whoever enshrines the Name of
the Guru within his heart, is rid of both birth and death. || 3 || 7 || Without the Guru,
there is utter darkness; without the Guru, understanding does not come. Without the
Guru, there is no intuitive awareness or success; without the Guru, there is no
liberation. So make Him your Guru, and contemplate the Truth; make Him your Guru, O
my mind. Make Him your Guru, who is embellished and exalted in the Word of the
Shabad; all your sins shall be washed away. So speaks Nall the poet: with your eyes,
make Him your Guru; with the words you speak, make Him your Guru, your True Guru.
Those who have not seen the Guru, who have not made Him their Guru, are useless in
this world. || 4 || 8 || Dwell upon the Guru, the Guru, the Guru, O my mind. 

The All-powerful Guru is the Boat to carry us across in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga.
Hearing the Word of His Shabad, we are transported into Samaadhi. He is the Spiritual
Hero who destroys pain and brings peace. Whoever meditates on Him, dwells near Him.
He is the Perfect Primal Being, who meditates in remembrance on the Lord within his
heart; seeing His Face, sins run away. If you long for wisdom, wealth, spiritual
perfection and properity, O my mind, dwell upon the Guru, the Guru, the Guru. || 5 ||
9 || Gazing upon the Face of the Guru, I find peace. I was thirsty, yearning to drink in
the Nectar; to fulfill that wish, the Guru laid out the way. My mind has become perfect;
it dwells in the Lord‟s Place; it had been wandering in all directions, in its desire for
tastes and pleasures. Goindwal is the City of God, built on the bank of the Beas River.
The pains of so many years have been taken away; gazing upon the Face of the Guru, I
find peace. || 6 || 10 || The All-powerful Guru placed His hand upon my head. The
Guru was kind, and blessed me with the Lord‟s Name. Gazing upon His Feet, my sins
were dispelled. Night and day, the Guru meditates on the One Lord; hearing His Name,
the Messenger of Death is scared away. So speaks the Lord‟s slave: Guru Raam Daas
placed His Faith in Guru Amar Daas, the Guru of the World; touching the Philosopher‟s
Stone, He was transformed into the Philosopher‟s Stone. Guru Raam Daas recognized
the Lord as True; the All-powerful Guru placed His hand upon His head. || 7 || 11 ||
Now, please preserve the honor of Your humble slave. God saved the honor of the
devotee Prahlaad, when Harnaakhash tore him apart with his claws. And the Dear Lord
God saved the honor of Dropadi; when her clothes were stripped from her, she was
blessed with even more. Sudaamaa was saved from misfortune; and Ganikaa the
prostitute — when she chanted Your Name, her affairs were perfectly resolved. O Great
True Guru, if it pleases You, please save the honor of Your slave in this Dark Age of kali
Yuga. || 8 || 12 || JHOLNAA: Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O mortal beings.
Chant the Shabad, the Word of the Lord, Har, Har; the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
brings the nine treasures. With your tongue, taste it, day and night, and know it as
true. Then, you shall obtain His Love and Affection; become Gurmukh, and meditate on
Him. Give up all other ways; vibrate and meditate on Him, O spiritual people. Enshrine
the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings within your heart, and overpower the five passions.
Your life, and your generations, shall be saved, and you shall be honored at the Lord‟s
Door. If you desire all the peace and comforts of this world and the next, then chant
Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O mortal beings. || 1 || 13 || Chant Guru, Guru, Guru,
Guru, Guru, and know Him as true. Know that the Lord is the Treasure of Excellence.
Enshrine Him in your mind, and meditate on Him. Enshrine the Word of the Guru‟s
Teachings within your heart. Then, cleanse yourself in the Immaculate and
Unfathomable Water of the Guru; O Gursikhs and Saints, cross over the Ocean of Love
of the True Name. Meditate lovingly forever on the Lord, free of hate and vengeance,
Formless and Fearless; lovingly savor the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, and implant
devotional worship of the Lord deep within. O foolish mind, give up your doubts; as
Gurmukh, vibrate and meditate on the Naam. 

|| 2 || 14 || Chant Guru, Gur through the Guru, the Lord is obtained. The Guru is an Ocean, deep and profound, infinite and unfathomable. Lovingly attuned to the Lord‟s Name, you shall be blessed with jewels, diamonds and emeralds. And, the Guru makes us fragrant and
fruitful, and His Touch transforms us into gold. The filth of evil-mindedness is washed
away, meditating on the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The Stream of Ambrosial Nectar
flows constantly from His Door. The Saints and Sikhs bathe in the immaculate pool of
the Guru‟s spiritual wisdom. Enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within your
heart, and dwell in Nirvaanaa. Chant Guru, Guru, Guru; through the Guru, the Lord is
obtained. || 3 || 15 || Chant Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O my mind. Serving Him,
Shiva and the Siddhas, the angels and demons and servants of the gods, and the thritythree million gods cross over, listening to the Word of the Guru‟s Teachings. And, the
Saints and loving devotees are carried across, chanting Guru, Guru. Prahlaad and the
silent sages met the Guru, and were carried across. Naarad and Sanak and those men
of God who became Gurmukh were carried across; attached to the One Name, they
abandoned other tastes and pleasures, and were carried across. This is the prayer of
the Lord‟s humble slave: the Gurmukh obtains the Naam, the Name of the Lord,
chanting Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, Guru, O my mind. || 4 || 16 || 29 || The Great,
Supreme Guru showered His Mercy upon all; in the Golden Age of Sat Yuga, He blessed
Dhroo. He saved the devotee Prahlaad, placing the Lotus of His Hand upon his
forehead. The Unseen Form of the Lord cannot be seen. The Siddhas and seekers all
seek His Sanctuary. True are the Words of the Guru‟s teachings. Enshrine them in your
soul. Emancipate your body, and redeem this human incarnation. The Guru is the Boat,
and the Guru is the Boatman. Without the Guru, no one can cross over. By Guru‟s
Grace, God is obtained. Without the Guru, no one is liberated. Guru Nanak dwells near
the Creator Lord. He established Lehnaa as Guru, and enshrined His Light in the world.
Lehnaa established the path of righteousness and Dharma, which He passed on to Guru
Amar Daas, of the Bhalla dynasty. Then, He firmly established the Great Raam Daas of
the Sodhi dynasty. He was blessed with the inexhaustible treasure of the Lord‟s Name.
He was blessed with the treasure of the Lord‟s Name; throughout the four ages, it is
inexhaustible. Serving the Guru, He received His reward. Those who bow at His Feet
and seek His Sanctuary, are blessed with peace; those Gurmukhs are blessed with
supreme bliss. The Guru‟s Body is the Embodiment of the Supreme Lord God, our Lord
and Master, the Form of the Primal Being, who nourishes and cherishes all. So serve the
Guru, the True Guru; His ways and means are inscrutable. The Great Guru Raam Daas
is the Boat to carry us across. || 1 || The Holy people chant the Ambrosial Words of
His Bani with delight in their minds. The Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan is fruitful
and rewarding in this world; it brings lasting bliss and joy. The Guru‟s Darshan is fruitful
and rewarding in this world, like the Ganges. Meeting Him, the supreme sacred status is
obtained. Even sinful people conquer the realm of Death, if they become the Lord‟s
humble servants, and are imbued with the Guru‟s spiritual wisdom. He is certified, like
the handsome Ram Chander in the house of Dasrath of the Raghwa dynasty. 

Even the silent sages seek His Sanctuary. So serve the Guru, the True Guru; His ways
and means are inscrutable. The Great Guru Raam Daas is the Boat to carry us across.
|| 2 || The Name of the Lord, from the Mouth of the Guru, is the Raft to cross over the
unfathomable world-ocean. The cycle of birth and death in this world is ended for those
who have this faith in their hearts. Those humble beings who have this faith in their
hearts, are awarded the highest status. They forsake Maya, emotional attachment and
greed; they are rid of the frustrations of possessiveness, sexual desire and anger. They
are blessed with the Inner Vision to see God, the Cause of causes, and all their doubts
are dispelled. So serve the Guru, the True Guru; His ways and means are inscrutable.
The Great Guru Raam Daas is the Boat to carry us across. || 3 || The Glorious
Greatness of the Guru is manifest forever in each and every heart. His humble servants
sing His Praises. Some read and listen and sing of Him, taking their cleansing bath in
the early hours of the morning before the dawn. After their cleansing bath in the hours
before the dawn, they worship the Guru with their minds pure and clear. Touching the
Philosopher‟s Stone, their bodies are transformed into gold. They focus their meditation
on the Embodiment of Divine Light. So serve the Guru, the True Guru; His ways and
means are inscrutable. The Great Guru Raam Daas is the Boat to carry us across. || 4
|| Those who realize the Eternal, Unchanging Word of God, like Dhroo, are immune to
death. They cross over the terrifying world-ocean in an instant; the Lord created the
world like a bubble of water. The Kundalini rises in the Sat Sangat, the True
Congregation; through the Word of the Guru, they enjoy the Lord of Supreme Bliss. The
Supreme Guru is the Lord and Master over all; so serve the True Guru, in thought, word
and deed. || 5 || Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay Jee-o. You are
lotus-eyed, with sweet speech, exalted and embellished with millions of companions.
Mother Yashoda invited You as Krishna to eat the sweet rice. Gazing upon Your
supremely beautiful form, and hearing the musical sounds of Your silver bells tinkling,
she was intoxicated with delight. Death‟s pen and command are in Your hands. Tell me,
who can erase it? Shiva and Brahma yearn to enshrine Your spiritual wisdom in their
hearts. You are forever True, the Home of Excellence, the Primal Supreme Being.
Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay Jee-o. || 1 || 6 || You are
blessed with the Lord‟s Name, the supreme mansion, and clear understanding. You are
the Formless, Infinite Lord; who can compare to You? For the sake of the pure-hearted
devotee Prahlaad, You took the form of the man-lion, to tear apart and destroy
Harnaakhash with your claws. You are the Infinite Supreme Lord God; with your
symbols of power, You deceived Baliraja; who can know You? You are forever True, the
Home of Excellence, the Primal Supreme Being. Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay
Guru, Waahay Jee-o. || 2 || 7 || As Krishna, You wear yellow robes, with teeth like
jasmine flowers; You dwell with Your lovers, with Your mala around Your neck, and You
joyfully adorn Your head with the crow of peacock feathers. 

You have no advisors, You are so very patient; You are the Upholder of the Dharma,
unseen and unfathomable. You have staged the play of the Universe with joy and
delight. No one can speak Your Unspoken Speech. You are pervading the three worlds.
You assume the form of spiritual perfection, O King of kings. You are forever True, the
Home of Excellence, the Primal Supreme Being. Waahay Guru, Waahay Guru, Waahay
Guru, Waahay Jee-o. || 3 || 8 || The True Guru, the True Guru, the True Guru is the
Lord of the Universe Himself. Enticer of Baliraja, who smothers the mighty, and fulfills
the devotees; the Prince Krishna, and Kalki; the thunder of His army and the beat of His
drum echoes across the Universe. The Lord of contemplation, Destroyer of sin, who
brings pleasure to the beings of all realms, He Himself is the God of gods, Divinity of
the divine, the thousand-headed king cobra. He took birth in the Incarnations of the
Fish, Tortoise and Wild Boar, and played His part. He played games on the banks of the
Jamunaa River. Enshrine this most excellent Name within your heart, and renounce the
wickedness of the mind, O Gayand. the True Guru, the True Guru, the True Guru is the
Lord of the Universe Himself. || 4 || 9 || The Supreme Guru, the Supreme Guru, the
Supreme Guru, the True, Dear Lord. Respect and obey the Guru‟s Word; this is your
own personal treasure — know this mantra as true. Night and day, you shall be saved,
and blessed with the supreme status. Renounce sexual desire, anger, greed and
attachment; give up your games of deception. Snap the noose of egotism, and let
yourself be at home in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the Holy. Free your
consciousness of attachment to your body, your home, your spouse, and the pleasures
of this world. Serve forever at His Lotus Feet, and firmly implant these teachings within.
Enshrine this most excellent Name within your heart, and renounce the wickedness of
the mind, O Gayand. the Supreme Guru, the Supreme Guru, the Supreme Guru, the
True, Dear Lord. || 5 || 10 || Your servants are totally fulfilled, throughout the ages;
O Waahay Guru, it is all You, forever. O Formless Lord God, You are eternally intact; no
one can say how You came into being. You created countless Brahmas and Vishnus;
their minds were intoxicated with emotional attachment. You created the 8.4 million
species of beings, and provide for their sustanance. Your servants are totally fulfilled,
throughout the ages; O Waahay Guru, it is all You, forever. || 1 || 11 || Waaho!
Waaho! Great! Great is the Play of God! He Himself laughs, and He Himself thinks; He
Himself illumines the sun and the moon. He Himself is the water, He Himself is the
earth and its support. He Himself abides in each and every heart. He Himself is male,
and He Himself is female; He Himself is the chessman, and He Himself is the board. As
Gurmukh, join the Sangat, and consider all this: Waaho! Waaho! Great! Great is the
Play of God! || 2 || 12 || You have formed and created this play, this great game. O
Waahay Guru, this is all You, forever. You are pervading and permeating the water,
land, skies and nether regions; Your Words are sweeter than Ambrosial Nectar. 

Brahmas and Shivas respect and obey You. O Death of death, Formless Lord, I beg of
You. By Guru‟s Grace, the greatest thing is obtained, and the mind is involved with the
Sat Sangat, the True Congregation. You have formed and created this play, this great
game. O Waahay Guru, this is all Your making. || 3 || 13 || 42 || The Lord is
Inaccessible, Infinite, Eternal and Primordial; no one knows His beginning. Shiva and
Brahma meditate on Him; the Vedas describe Him again and again. The Lord is
Formless, beyond hate and vengeance; there is no one else like Him. He creates and
destroys — He is All-powerful; God is the Boat to carry all across. He created the world
in its various aspects; His humble servant Mat‟huraa delights in His Praises. Sat Naam,
the Great and Supreme True Name of God, the Personification of Creativity, dwells in
the Consciousness of Guru Raam Daas. || 1 || I have grasped hold of the All-powerful
Guru; He has made my mind steady and stable, and embellished me with clear
consciousness. And, His Banner of Righteousness waves proudly forever, to defend
against the waves of sin. His humble servant Mat‟huraa knows this as true, and speaks
it from his soul; there is nothing else to consider. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the
Lord‟s Name is the Great Ship, to carry us all across the terrifying world-ocean, safely to
the other side. || 2 || The Saints dwell in the Saadh Sangat, the Company of the
Holy; imbued with pure celestial love, they sing the Lord‟s Praises. The Support of the
Earth has established this Path of Dharma; He Himself remains lovingly attuned to the
Lord, and does not wander in distraction. So speaks Mat‟huraa: those blessed with good
fortune receive the fruits of their minds‟ desires. Those who focus their consciousness
on the Guru‟s Feet — why should they fear death? || 3 || The Immaculate, Sacred
Pool of the Guru is overflowing with the waves of the Shabad, radiantly revealed in the
early hours before the dawn. He is Deep and Profound, Unfathomable and utterly Great,
eternally overflowing with all sorts of jewels. The Saint-swans celebrate; their fear of
death is erased, along with the accounts of their pain. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the
residues of sins are taken away; the Blessed Vision of the Guru‟s Darshan is the Ocean
of all peace and comfort. || 4 || For His Sake, the silent sages meditated and focused
their consciousness, wandering all the ages through; rarely, if ever, their souls were
enlightened. In the Hymns of the Vedas, Brahma sang His Praises; for His Sake, Shiva
the silent sage held his place on the Kailaash Mountain. For His Sake, the Yogis,
celibates, Siddhas and seekers, the countless sects of fanatics with matted hair wear
religious robes, wandering as detached renunciates. That True Guru, by the Pleasure of
His Will, showered His Mercy upon all beings, and blessed Guru Raam Daas with the
Glorious Greatness of the Naam. || 5 || He focuses His Meditation deep within; the
Embodiment of Light, He illuminates the three worlds. Gazing upon the Blessed Vision
of His Darshan, doubt runs away, pain is eradicated, and celestial peace spontaneously
wells up. The selfless servants and Sikhs are always totally captivated by it, like bumble
bees lured by the fragrance of the flower. The Guru Himself established the Eternal
Throne of Truth, in Guru Raam Daas. 

|| 6 || The Universe is intoxicated with the wine of Maya, but it has been saved; the
All-powerful Guru has blessed it with the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam. And, the
Praiseworthy Guru is blessed with eternal peace, wealth and prosperity; the
supernatural spiritual powers of the Siddhis never leave him. His Gifts are vast and
great; His awesome Power is supreme. Your humble servant and slave speaks this
truth. One, upon whose head the Guru has placed His Hand — with whom should he
be concerned? || 7 || 49 || He is totally pervading and permeating the three realms;
in all the world, He has not created another like Himself. He Himself created Himself.
The angels, human beings and demons have not found His limits. The angels, demons
and human beings have not found His limits; the heavenly heralds and celestial singers
wander around, searching for Him. The Eternal, Imperishable, Unmoving and
Unchanging, Unborn, Self-Existent, Primal Being of the Soul, the Infinity of the Infinite,
the Eternal All-powerful Cause of causes — all beings meditate on Him in their minds.
O Great and Supreme Guru Raam Daas, Your Victory resounds across the universe. You
have attained the supreme status of the Lord. || 1 || Nanak, the True Guru, worships
God single-mindedly; He surrenders His body, mind and wealth to the Lord of the
Universe. The Infinite Lord enshrined His Own Image in Guru Angad. In His heart, He
delights in the spiritual wisdom of the Unfathomable Lord. Guru Amar Daas brought the
Creator Lord under His control. Waaho! Waaho! Meditate on Him! O Great and Supreme
Guru Raam Daas, Your Victory resounds across the universe. You have attained the
supreme status of the Lord. || 2 || Naarad, Dhroo, Prahlaad and Sudaamaa are
accounted among the Lord‟s devotees of the past. Ambreek, Jai Dayv, Trilochan, Naam
Dayv and Kabeer are also remembered. They were incarnated in this Dark Age of Kali
Yuga; their praises have spread over all the world. O Great and Supreme Guru Raam
Daas, Your Victory resounds across the universe. You have attained the supreme status
of the Lord. || 3 || Those who meditate in remembrance on You within their minds
— their sexual desire and anger are taken away. Those who remember You in
meditation with their words, are rid of their poverty and pain in an instant. Those who
obtain the Blessed Vision of Your Darshan, by the karma of their good deeds, touch the
Philosopher‟s Stone, and like Ball the poet, sing Your Praises. O Great and Supreme
Guru Raam Daas, Your Victory resounds across the universe. You have attained the
supreme status of the Lord. || 4 || Those who meditate in remembrance on the True
Guru — the darkness of their eyes is removed in an instant. Those who meditate in
remembrance on the True Guru within their hearts, are blessed with the Lord‟s Name,
day by day. Those who meditate in remembrance on the True Guru within their souls —
the fire of desire is extinguished for them. Those who meditate in remembrance on the
True Guru, are blessed with wealth and prosperity, supernatural spiritual powers and
the nine treasures. So speaks Ball the poet: Blessed is Guru Raam Daas; joining the
Sangat, the Congregation, call Him blessed and great. || 5 || 54 || Living the Word of
the Shabad, He attained the supreme status; while performing selfless service, He did
not leave the side of Guru Amar Daas. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1406 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
From that service, the light from the jewel of spiritual wisdom shines forth, radiant and
bright; it has destroyed pain, poverty and darkness. So speaks Keerat the poet: those
who grasp hold of the feet of the Saints, are not afraid of death, sexual desire or anger.
Just as Guru Nanak was part and parcel, life and limb with Guru Angad, so is Guru Amar
Daas one with Guru Raam Daas. || 1 || Whoever serves the True Guru obtains the
treasure; night and day, he dwells at the Lord‟s Feet. And so, the entire Sangat loves,
fears and respects You. You are the sandalwood tree; Your fragrance spreads gloriously
far and wide. Dhroo, Prahlaad, Kabeer and Trilochan chanted the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, and His Illumination radiantly shines forth. Seeing Him, the mind is totally
delighted; Guru Raam Daas is the Helper and Support of the Saints. || 2 || Guru
Nanak realized the Immaculate Naam, the Name of the Lord. He was lovingly attuned to
loving devotional worship of the Lord. Gur Angad was with Him, life and limb, like the
ocean; He showered His consciousness with the Word of the Shabad. The Unspoken
Speech of Guru Amar Daas cannot be expressed with only one tongue. Guru Raam
Daas of the Sodhi dynasty has now been blessed with Glorious Greatness, to carry the
whole world across. || 3 || I am overflowing with sins and demerits; I have no merits
or virtues at all. I abandoned the Ambrosial Nectar, and I drank poison instead. I am
attached to Maya, and deluded by doubt; I have fallen in love with my children and
spouse. I have heard that the most exalted Path of all is the Sangat, the Guru‟s
Congregation. Joining it, the fear of death is taken away. Keerat the poet offers this one
prayer: O Guru Raam Daas, save me! Take me into Your Sanctuary! || 4 || 58 || He
has crushed and overpowered emotional attachment. He seized sexual desire by the
hair, and threw it down. With His Power, He cut anger into pieces, and sent greed away
in disgrace. Life and death, with palms pressed together, respect and obey the Hukam
of His Command. He brought the terrifying world-ocean under His Control; by His
Pleasure, He carried His Sikhs across. He is seated upon the Throne of Truth, with the
canopy above His Head; He is embellished with the powers of Yoga and the enjoyment
of pleasures. So speaks Sall the poet: O Guru Raam Daas, Your sovereign power is
eternal and unbreakable; Your army is invincible. || 1 || You are the True Guru,
throughout the four ages; You Yourself are the Transcendent Lord. The angelic beings,
seekers, Siddhas and Sikhs have served You, since the very beginning of time. You are
the Primal Lord God, from the very beginning, and throughout the ages; Your Power
supports the three worlds. You are Inaccessible; You are the Saving Grace of the
Vedas. You have conquered old age and death. Guru Amar Daas has permanently
established You; You are the Emancipator, to carry all across to the other side. So
speaks Sall the poet: O Guru Raam Daas, You are the Destroyer of sins; I seek Your
Sanctuary. || 2 || 60 ||
SWAIYAS IN PRAISE OF THE FIFTH MEHL:

Meditate in remembrance on the Primal Lord God, Eternal and Imperishable.
Remembering Him in meditation, the filth of evil-mindedness is eradicated. I enshrine
the Lotus Feet of the True Guru within my heart. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1407 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
With intuitive peace and poise, I contemplate the Glorious Virtues of Guru Arjun. He
was revealed in the House of Guru Raam Daas, and all hopes and desires were fulfilled.
From birth, He realized God through the Guru‟s Teachings. With palms pressed
together, Kall the poet speaks His praises. The Lord brought Him into the world, to
practice the Yoga of devotional worship. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad has been
revealed, and the Lord dwells on His tongue. Attached to Guru Nanak, Guru Angad and
Guru Amar Daas, He attained the supreme status. In the House of Guru Raam Daas,
the devotee of the Lord, Guru Arjun was born. || 1 || By great good fortune, the mind
is uplifted and exalted, and the Word of the Shabad dwells in the heart. The jewel of
the mind is contented; the Guru has implanted the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within.
The Inaccessible and Unfathomable, Supreme Lord God is revealed through the True
Guru. In the House of Guru Raam Daas, Guru Arjun has appeared as the Embodiment
of the Fearless Lord. || 2 || The benign rule of Raja Janak has been established, and
the Golden Age of Sat Yuga has begun. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, the
mind is pleased and appeased; the unsatisfied mind is satisfied. Guru Nanak laid the
foundation of Truth; He is blended with the True Guru. In the House of Guru Raam
Daas, Guru Arjun has appeared as the Embodiment of the Infinite Lord. || 3 || The
Sovereign Lord King has staged this wondrous play; contentment was gathered
together, and pure understanding was infused in the True Guru. Kall the poet utters the
Praises of the Unborn, Self-existent Lord. Guru Nanak blessed Guru Angad, and Guru
Angad blessed Guru Amar Daas with the treasure. Guru Raam Daas blessed Guru Arjun,
who touched the Philosopher‟s Stone, and was certified. || 4 || O Guru Arjun, You are
Eternal, Invaluable, Unborn, Self-existent, the Destroyer of fear, the Dispeller of pain,
Infinite and Fearless. You have grasped the Ungraspable, and burnt away doubt and
skepticism. You bestow cooling and soothing peace. The Self-existent, Perfect Primal
Lord God Creator has taken birth. First, Guru Nanak, then Guru Angad and Guru Amar
Daas, the True Guru, haave been absorbed into the Word of the Shabad. Blessed,
blessed is Guru Raam Daas, the Philosopher‟s Stone, who transformed Guru Arjun unto
Himself. || 5 || His victory is proclaimed all over the world; His Home is blessed with
good fortune; He remains united with the Lord. By great good fortune, He has found
the Perfect Guru; He remains lovingly attuned to Him, and endures the load of the
earth. He is the Destroyer of fear, the Eradicator of the pains of others. Kall the poet
utters Your Praise, O Guru. || 6 || The Support of the Dharma, immersed in the deep
and profound Teachings of the Guru, the Remover of the pains of others. The Shabad is
excellent and sublime, kind and generous like the Lord, the Destroyer of egotism. The
Great Giver, the spiritual wisdom of the True Guru, His mind does not grow weary of its
yearning for the Lord. The Embodiment of Truth, the Mantra of the Lord‟s Name, the
nine treasures are never exhausted. O Son of Guru Raam Daas, You are contained
amidst all; the canopy of intuitive wisdom is spread above You. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1408 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
So speaks Kall the poet: O Guru Arjun, You know the sublime essence of Raja Yoga, the
Yoga of meditation and success. || 7 || In the Fear of God, You enjoy the Fearless
Lord; among the thousands of beings, You see the Unseen Lord. Through the True
Guru, You have realized the state of the Inaccessible, Unfathomable, Profound Lord.
Meeting with the Guru, You are certified and approved; You practice Yoga in the midst
of wealth and power. Blessed, blessed, blessed is the Guru, who has filled to
overflowing the pools which were empty. Reaching up to the certified Guru, You endure
the unendurable; You are immersed in the pool of contentment. So speaks Kall: O Guru
Arjun, You have intuitively attained the state of Yoga within Yourself. || 8 || Nectar
drips from Your tongue, and Your mouth gives Blessings, O Incomprehensible and
Infinite Spiritual Hero. O Guru, the Word of Your Shabad eradicates egotism. You have
overpowered the five enticers, and established with intuitive ease the Absolute Lord
within Your own being. Attached to the Lord‟s Name, the world is saved; enshrine the
True Guru within your heart. So speaks Kall: O Guru Arjun, You have illliminated the
highest pinnacle of wisdom. || 9 || SORAT‟H: Guru Arjun is the certified Primal
Person; like Arjuna, He never leaves the field of battle. The Naam, the Name of the
Lord, is His spear and insignia. He is embellished with the Shabad, the Word of the True
Guru. || 1 || The Lord‟s Name is the Boat, the Bridge to cross over the terrifying
world-ocean. You are in love with the True Guru; attached to the Naam, You have
saved the world. || 2 || The Naam is the Saving Grace of the world; by the Pleasure
of the True Guru, it is obtained. Now, I am not concerned with anything else; at Your
Door, I am fulfilled. || 3 || 12 || The Embodiment of Light, the Lord Himself is called
Guru Nanak. From Him, came Guru Angad; His essence was absorbed into the essence.
Guru Angad showed His Mercy, and established Amar Daas as the True Guru. Guru
Amar Daas blessed Guru Raam Daas with the umbrella of immortality. So speaks
Mat‟huraa: gazing upon the Blessed Vision, the Darshan of Guru Raam Daas, His speech
became as sweet as nectar. With your eyes, see the certified Primal Person, Guru Arjun,
the Fifth Manifestation of the Guru. || 1 || He is the Embodiment of Truth; He has
enshrined the True Name, Sat Naam, Truth and contentment within His heart. From the
very beginning, the Primal Being has written this destiny upon His forehead. His Divine
Light shines forth, dazzling and radiant; His Glorious Grandeur pervades the realms of
the world. Meeting the Guru, touching the Philosopher‟s Stone, He was acclaimed as
Guru. So speaks Mat‟huraa: I constantly focus my consciousness on Him; as sunmukh, I
look to Him. In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, Guru Arjun is the Boat; attached to him, the
entire universe is safely carried across. || 2 || I beg from that humble being who is
known all over the world, who lives in, and loves the Name, night and day. He is
supremely unattached, and imbued with the Love of the Transcendent Lord; he is free
of desire, but he lives as a family man. He is dedicated to the Love of the Infinite,
Limitless Primal Lord God; he has no concerns for any other pleasure, except for the
Lord God. Guru Arjun is the All-pervading Lord God of Mat‟huraa. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1409 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
Devoted to His Worship, he remains attached to the Lord‟s Feet. || 3 || All the gods,
silent sages, Indra, Shiva and Yogis have not found the Lord‟s limits — not even
Brahma who contemplates the Vedas. I shall not give up meditating on the Lord, even
for an instant. The God of Mat‟huraa is Merciful to the meek; He blesses and uplifts the
Sangats throughout the Universe. Guru Raam Daas, to save the world, enshrined the
Guru‟s Light into Guru Arjun. || 4 || In this world, there is no other Great Soul; the
Lord revealed Himself, incarnated as Guru Arjun. Millions of pains are taken away, from
those who drink in the Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, says Mat‟huraa. O mortal being,
do not leave this path; do not think that there is any difference between God and Guru.
The Perfect Lord God has manifested Himself; He dwells in the heart of Guru Arjun. ||
5 || As long as the destiny written upon my forehead was not activated, I wandered
around lost, running in all directions. I was drowning in the horrible world-ocean of this
Dark Age of Kali Yuga, and my remorse would never have ended. O Mat‟huraa, consider
this essential truth: to save the world, the Lord incarnated Himself. Whoever meditates
on Guru Arjun Dayv, shall not have to pass through the painful womb of reincarnation
ever again. || 6 || In the ocean of this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, the Lord‟s Name has
been revealed in the Form of Guru Arjun, to save the world. Pain and poverty are taken
away from that person, within whose heart the Saint abides. He is the Pure,
Immaculate Form of the Infinite Lord; except for Him, there is no other at all. Whoever
knows Him in thought, word and deed, becomes just like Him. He is totally pervading
the earth, the sky and the nine regions of the planet. He is the Embodiment of the Light
of God. So speaks Mat‟huraa: there is no difference between God and Guru; Guru Arjun
is the Personification of the Lord Himself. || 7 || 19 || The Water of the Guru is like
the Ganges, invincible and unstoppable. The Sikhs of the Sangat all bathe in it. The
Puraanaas dwell continually upon the Guru; Brahma sings His Praises in the Vedas. The
invincible chauri, the fly-brush, waves over His head; with His mouth, He drinks in the
Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam. The Transcendent Lord Himself has placed the royal
canopy over the head of Guru Arjun. Guru Nanak, Guru Angad, Guru Amar Daas and
Guru Raam Daas met together before the Lord. So speaks Harbans: Their Praises echo
and resound all over the world; who can possibly say that the Great Gurus are dead? ||
1 || When it was the Will of the Transcendent Lord Himself, Guru Raam Daas went to
the City of God. The Lord offered Him His Royal Throne, and seated the Guru upon it.
The angels and gods were delighted; they proclaimed and celebrated Your victory, O
Guru. The demons ran away; their sins made them shake and tremble inside. Those
people who found Guru Raam daas were rid of their sins. He gave the Royal Canopy
and Throne to Guru Arjun, and came home. || 2 || 21 || 9 || 11 || 10 || 10 || 22 || 60

ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1410 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
ONE UNIVERSAL CREATOR GOD.
TRUTH IS THE NAME.
CREATIVE BEING PERSONIFIED. NO FEAR. NO HATRED.
IMAGE OF THE UNDYING. BEYOND BIRTH. SELF-EXISTENT.
BY GURU‟S GRACE:
SHALOKS IN ADDITION TO THE VAARS. FIRST MEHL:
O you with swollen breasts, let your consciousness become deep and profound. O
mother-in-law, how can I bow? Because of my stiff nipples, I cannot bow. O sister,
those mansions built as high as mountains — I have seen them come crumbling down.
O bride, do not be so proud of your nipples. || 1 || O bride with deer-like eyes, listen
to the words of deep and infinite wisdom. First, examine the merchandise, and then,
make the deal. Proclaim that you will not associate with evil people; celebrate victory
with your friends. This proclamation, to meet with your friends, O bride — give it some
thought. Surrender mind and body to the Lord your Friend; this is the most excellent
pleasure. Do not fall in love with one who is destined to leave. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice
to those who understand this. || 2 || If you wish to swim across the water, then
consult those who know how to swim. Those who have survived these treacherous
waves are very wise. || 3 || The storm rages and the rain floods the land; thousands
of waves rise and surge. If you cry out for help from the True Guru, you have nothing
to fear — your boat will not sink. || 4 || O Nanak, what has happened to the world?
There is no guide or friend. There is no love, even among brothers and relatives. For
the sake of the world, people have lost their faith. || 5 || They cry and weep and wail.
They slap their faces and pull their hair out. But if they chant the Naam, the Name of
the Lord, they shall be absorbed into it. O Nanak, I am a sacrifice to them. || 6 || O
my mind, do not waver or walk on the crooked path; take the straight and true path.
The terrible tiger is behind you, and the pool of fire is ahead. My soul is skeptical and
doubtful, but I cannot see any other way to go. O Nanak, as Gurmukh, dwell with your
Beloved Lord, and you shall be saved. || 7 || The tiger is killed, and the mind is killed,
through the Teachings of the True Guru. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1411 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
One who understands himself, meets with the Lord, and never dies again. One who
sees the One and Only Lord with his eyes — his hands shall not get muddy and dirty. O
Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved; the Guru has surrounded the ocean with the
embankment of Truth. || 8 || If you wish to put out the fire, then look for water;
without the Guru, the ocean of water is not found. You shall continue to wander lost in
reincarnation through birth and death, even if you do thousands of other deeds. But
you shall not be taxed by the Messenger of Death, if you walk in harmony with the Will
of the True Guru. O Nanak, the immaculate, immortal status is obtained, and the Guru
will unite you in the Lord‟s Union. || 9 || The crow rubs and washes itself in the mud
puddle. Its mind and body are polluted with its own mistakes and demerits, and its beak
is filled with dirt. The swan in the pool associated with the crow, not knowing that it
was evil. Such is the love of the faithless cynic; understand this, O spiritually wise ones,
through love and devotion. So proclaim the victory of the Society of the Saints, and act
as Gurmukh. Immaculate and pure is that cleansing bath, O Nanak, at the sacred shrine
of the Guru‟s river. || 10 || What should I account as the rewards of this human life,
if one does not feel love and devotion to the Lord? Wearing clothes and eating food is
useless, if the mind is filled with the love of duality. Seeing and hearing is false, if one
speaks lies. O Nanak, praise the Naam, the Name of the Lord; everything else is coming
and going in egotism. || 11 || The Saints are few and far between; everything else in
the world is just a pompous show. || 12 || O Nanak, one who is struck by the Lord
dies instantaneously; the power to live is lost. If someone dies by such a stroke, then
he is accepted. He alone is struck, who is struck by the Lord; after such a stroke, he is
approved. The arrow of love, shot by the All-knowing Lord, cannot be pulled out. || 13
|| Who can wash the unbaked clay pot? Joining the five elements together, the Lord
made a false cover. When it pleases Him, He makes it right. The supreme light shines
forth, and the celestial song vibrates and resounds. || 14 || Those who are totally
blind in their minds, do not have the integrity to keep their word. With their blind
minds, and their upside-down heart-lotus, they look totally ugly. Some know how to
speak and understand what they are told. Those people are wise and good-looking.
Some do not know the Sound-current of the Naad, spiritual wisdom or the joy of song.
They do not even understand good and bad. Some have no idea of perfection, wisdom
or understanding; they know nothing about the mystery of the Word. O Nanak, those
people are really donkeys; they have no virtue or merit, but still, they are very proud.
|| 15 || He alone is a Brahmin, who knows God. He chants and meditates, and
practices austerity and good deeds. He keeps to the Dharma, with faith, humility and
contentment. Breaking his bonds, he is liberated. Such a Brahmin is worthy of being
worshipped. || 16 || He alone is a Kh‟shaatriyaa, who is a hero in good deeds. He
uses his body to give in charity; he understands his farm, and plants the seeds of
generosity. Such a Kh‟shaatriyaa is accepted in the Court of the Lord. Whoever practices
greed, possessiveness and falsehood, shall receive the fruits of his own labors. || 17 ||
Do not heat your body like a furnace, or burn your bones like firewood. 
ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ 1412 ÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓÓ
What have your head and feet done wrong? See your Husband Lord within yourself. ||
18 || God the Cosmic Husband dwells within all hearts; without Him, there is no heart
at all. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are the happy, virtuous soul-brides; the Lord is revealed
to them. || 19 || If you desire to play this game of love with Me, then step onto My
Path with your head in hand. When you place your feet on this Path, give Me your
head, and do not pay any attention to public opinion. || 20 || False is friendship with
the false and gredy. False is its foundation. O Mullah, no one knows where death shall
strike. || 21 || Without spiritual wisdom, the people worship ignorance. They grope in
the darkness, in the love of duality. || 22 || Without the Guru, there is no spiritual
wisdom; without Dharma, there is no meditation. Without Truth, there is no credit;
without capital, there is no balance. || 23 || The mortals are sent into the world;
then, they arise and depart. There is no joy in this. || 24 || Raam Chand, sad at
heart, assembled his army and forces. The army of monkeys was at his service; his
mind and body became eager for war. Raawan captured his wife Sita, and Lachhman
was cursed to die. O Nanak, the Creator Lord is the Doer of all; He watches over all,
and destroys what He has created. || 25 || In his mind, Raam Chand mourned for
Sita and Lachhman. Then, he remembered Hanuman the monkey-god, who came to
him. The misguided demon did not understand that God is the Doer of deeds. O Nanak,
the actions of the Self-existent Lord cannot be erased. || 26 || The city of Lahore
suffered terrible destruction for four hours. || 27 || THIRD MEHL: The city of Lahore
is a pool of ambrosial nectar, the home of praise. || 28 || FIRST MEHL: What are the
signs of a prosperous person? His stores of food never run out. Prosperity dwells in his
home, with the sounds of girls and women. All the women of his home shout and cry
and over useless things. Whatever he takes, he does not give back. Seeking to earn
more and more, he is troubled and uneasy. || 29 || O lotus, your leaves were green,
and your blossoms were gold. What pain has burnt you, and made your body black? O
Nanak, my body is battered. I have not received that water which I love. Seeing it, my
body blossomed forth, and I was blessed with a deep and beautiful color. || 30 || No
one lives long enough to accomplish all he wishes. Only the spiritually wise live forever;
they are honored for their intuitive awareness. Bit by bit, life passes away, even though
the mortal tries to hold it back. O Nanak, unto whom should we complain? Death takes
one‟s life away without anyone‟s consent. || 31 || Do not blame the Sovereign Lord;
when someone grows old, his intellect leaves him. The blind man talks and babbles,
and then falls into the ditch. || 32 || All that the Perfect Lord does is perfect; there is
not too little, or too much. O Nanak, knowing this as Gurmukh, the mortal merges into
the Perfect Lord God. || 33 || 

SHALOK, THIRD MEHL: 
Do not call the wandering beggars holy men, if their minds are filled with doubt.
Whoever gives to them, O Nanak, earns the same sort of merit. || 1 || One who begs
for the supreme status of the Fearless and Immaculate Lord — how rare are those who
have the opportunity, O Nanak, to give food to such a person. || 2 || If I were a
religious scholar, an astrologer, or one who could recite the four Vedas, I could be
famous throughout the nine regions of the earth, for my wisdom and thoughtful
contemplation. || 3 || If a Brahmin kills a cow or a female infant, and accepts the
offerings of an evil person, he is cursed with the leprosy of curses and criticism; he is
forever and ever filled with egotistical pride. One who forgets the Naam, O Nanak, is
covered by countless sins. Let all wisdom be burnt away, except for the essence of
spiritual wisdom. || 4 || No one can erase that primal destiny written upon one‟s
forehead. O Nanak, whatever is written there, comes to pass. He alone understands,
who is blessed by God‟s Grace. || 5 || Those who forget the Naam, the Name of the
Lord, and become attached to greed and fraud, are engrossed in the entanglements of
Maya the enticer, with the fire of desire within them. Those who, like the pumpkin vine,
are too stubborn climb the trellis, are cheated by Maya the cheater. The self-willed
manmukhs are bound and gagged and led away; the dogs do not join the herd of cows.
The Lord Himself misleads the misguided ones, and He Himself unites them in His
Union. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are saved; they walk in harmony with the Will of the
True Guru. || 6 || I praise the Praiseworthy Lord, and sing the Praises of the True
Lord. O Nanak, the One Lord alone is True; stay away from all other doors. || 7 || O
Nanak, wherever I go, I find the True Lord. Wherever I look, I see the One Lord. He
reveals Himself to the Gurmukh. || 8 || The Word of the Shabad is the Dispeller of
sorrow, if one enshrines it in the mind. By Guru‟s Grace, it dwells in the mind; by God‟s
Mercy, it is obtained. || 9 || O Nanak, acting in egotism, countless thousands have
wasted away to death. Those who meet with the True Guru are saved, through the
Shabad, the True Word of the Inscrutable Lord. || 10 || Those who serve the True
Guru single-mindedly — I fall at the feet of those humble beings. Through the Word of
the Guru‟s Shabad, the Lord abides in the mind, and the hunger for Maya departs.
Immaculate and pure are those humble beings, who, as Gurmukh, merge in the Naam.
O Nanak, other empires are false; they alone are true emperors, who are imbued with
the Naam. || 11 || The devoted wife in her husband‟s home has a great longing to
perform loving devotional service to him; she prepares and offers to him all sorts of
sweet delicacies and dishes of all flavors. In the same way, the devotees praise the
Word of the Guru‟s Bani, and focus their consciousness on the Lord‟s Name. They place
mind, body and wealth in offering before the Guru, and sell their heads to Him. 

In the Fear of God, His devotees yearn for His devotional worship; God fulfills their
desires, and merges them with Himself. My Lord God is Self-existent and Independent.
What does He need to eat to be satisfied? Whoever walks in harmony with the Will of
the True Guru, and sings the Glorious Praises of the Lord, is pleasing to Him. Blessed,
blessed are they, in this Dark Age of Kali Yuga, O Nanak, who walk in harmony with the
Will of the True Guru. || 12 || Those who do not serve the True Guru, and do not
keep the Shabad enshrined in their hearts — cursed are their lives. Why did they even
come into the world? If one follows the Guru‟s Teachings, and keeps the Fear of God in
his mind, then he is lovingly attuned to the sublime essence of the Lord. By his primal
destiny, he obtains the Name; O Nanak, he is carried across. || 13 || The world
wanders lost in emotional attachment to Maya; it does not realize that its own home is
being plundered. The self-willed manmukh is blind in the world; his mind is lured away
by sexual desire and anger. With the sword of spiritual wisdom, kill the five demons.
Remain awake and aware to the Guru‟s Teachings. The Jewel of the Naam is revealed,
and the mind and body are purified. Those who lack the Naam wander around lost, with
their noses cut off; without the Name, they sit and cry. O Nanak, no one can erase that
which is pre-ordained by the Creator Lord. || 14 || The Gurmukhs earn the wealth of
the Lord, contemplating the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. They receive the wealth of the
Naam; their treasures are overflowing. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Bani, they utter
the Glorious Praises of the Lord, whose end and limitations cannot be found. O Nanak,
the Creator is the Doer of all; the Creator Lord beholds all. || 15 || Within the
Gurmukh is intuitive peace and poise; his mind ascends to the Tenth Plane of the
Akaashic Ethers. No one is sleepy or hungry there; they dwell in the peace of the
Ambrosial Name of the Lord. O Nanak, pain and pleasure do not afflict anyone, where
the Light of the Lord, the Supreme Soul, illuminates. || 16 || All have come, wearing
the robes of sexual desire and anger. Some are born, and some pass away. They come
and go according to the Hukam of the Lord‟s Command. Their comings and goings in
reincarnation do not end; they are imbued with the love of duality. Bound in bondage,
they are made to wander, and they cannot do anything about it. || 17 || Those, upon
whom the Lord showers His Mercy, come and meet the True Guru. Meeting with the
True Guru, they turn away from the world; they remain dead while still alive, with
intuitive peace and poise. O Nanak, the devotees are imbued with the Lord; they are
absorbed in the Name of the Lord. || 18 || The intellect of the self-willed manmukh is
fickle; he is very tricky and clever within. Whatever he has done, and all that he does, is
useless. Not even an iota of it is acceptable. The charity and generosity he pretends to
give will be judged by the Righteous Judge of Dharma. Without the True Guru, the
Messenger of Death does not leave the mortal alone; he is ruined by the love of duality.
Youth slips away imperceptibly, old age comes, and then he dies. The mortal is caught
in love and emotional attachment to children and spouse, but none of them will be his
helper and support in the end. Whoever serves the True Guru finds peace; the Name
comes to abide in the mind. O Nanak, great and very fortunate are those who, as
Gurmukh, are absorbed in the Naam. || 19 || The self-willed manmukhs do not even
think of the Name; without the Name, they cry in pain. 

They do not worship the Lord, the Supreme Soul; how can they find peace in duality?
They are filled with the filth of egotism; they do not wash it away with the Word of the
Shabad. O Nanak, without the Name, they die in their filth; they waste the priceless
opportunity of this human life. || 20 || The self-willed manmukhs are deaf and blind;
they are filled with the fire of desire. They have no intuitive understanding of the Guru‟s
Bani; they are not illumined with the Shabad. They do not know their own inner being,
and they have no faith in the Guru‟s Word. The Word of the Guru‟s Shabad is within the
being of the spiritually wise ones. I am forever a sacrifice to them. Servant Nanak is the
slave of those Gurmukhs who serve the Lord. || 21 || The poisonous snake, the
serpent of Maya, has surrounded the world with its coils, O mother! The antidote to this
poisonous venom is the Name of the Lord; the Guru places the magic spell of the
Shabad into the mouth. Those who are blessed with such pre-ordained destiny come
and meet the True Guru. Meeting with the True Guru, they become immaculate, and
the poison of egotism is eradicated. Radiant and bright are the faces of the Gurmukhs;
they are honored in the Court of the Lord. Servant Nanak is forever a sacrifice to those
who walk in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. || 22 || The True Guru, the
Primal Being, has no hatred or vengeance. His heart is constantly attuned to the Lord.
Whoever directs hatred against the Guru, who has no hatred at all, only sets his own
home on fire. Anger and egotism are within him night and day; he burns, and suffers
constant pain. They babble and tell lies, and keep on barking, eating the poison of the
love of duality. For the sake of the poison of Maya, they wander from house to house,
and lose their honor. They are like the son of a prostitute, who does not know the name
of his father. They do not remember the Name of the Lord, Har, Har; the Creator
Himself brings them to ruin. The Lord showers His Mercy upon the Gurmukhs, and
reunites the separated ones with Himself. Servant Nanak is a sacrifice to those who fall
at the Feet of the True Guru. || 23 || Those who are attached to the Naam, the Name
of the Lord, are saved; without the Name, they must go to the City of Death. O Nanak,
without the Name, they find no peace; they come and go in reincarnation with regrets.
|| 24 || When anxiety and wanderings come to an end, the mind becomes happy. By
Guru‟s Grace, the soul-bride understands, and then she sleeps without worry. Those
who have such pre-ordained destiny meet with the Guru, the Lord of the Universe. O
Nanak, they merge intuitively into the Lord, the Embodiment of Supreme Bliss. || 25 ||
Those who serve their True Guru, who contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad,
who honor and obey the Will of the True Guru, who keep the Lord‟s Name enshrined
within their hearts, are honored, here and hereafter; they are dedicated to the business
of the Lord‟s Name. Through the Word of the Shabad, the Gurmukhs gain recognition in
that Court of the True Lord. The True Name is their merchandise, the True Name is
their expenditure; the Love of their Beloved fills their inner beings. 

The Messenger of Death does not even approach them; the Creator Lord Himself
forgives them. O Nanak, they alone are wealthy, who are imbued with the Naam; the
rest of the world is poor. || 26 || The Lord‟s Name is the Support of the Lord‟s
humble servants. Without the Lord‟s Name, the there is no other place, no place of rest.
Following the Guru‟s Teachings, the Name abides in the mind, and one is intuitively,
automatically absorbed in the Lord. Those with great good fortune meditate on the
Naam; night and day, they embrace love for the Name. Servant Nanak begs for the
dust of their feet; I am forever a sacrifice to them. || 27 || The 8.4 million species of
beings burn in desire and cry in pain. All this show of emotional attachment to Maya
shall not go with you at that very last instant. Without the Lord, peace and tranquility
do not come; unto whom should we go and complain? By great good fortune, one
meets the True Guru, and comes to understand the contemplation of God. The fire of
desire is totally extinguished, O servant Nanak, enshrining the Lord within the heart. ||
28 || I make so many mistakes, there is no end or limit to them. O Lord, please be
merciful and forgive me; I am a sinner, a great offender. O Dear Lord, if You made an
account of my mistakes, my turn to be forgiven would not even come. Please forgive
me, and unite me with Yourself. The Guru, in His Pleasure, has united me with the Lord
God; He has cut away all my sinful mistakes. Servant Nanak celebrates the victory of
those who meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har. || 29 || Those who have
been separated and alienated from the Lord are united with Him again, through the
Fear and the Love of the True Guru. They escape the cycle of birth and death, and, as
Gurmukh, they meditate on the Naam, the Name of the Lord. Joining the Saadh Sangat,
the Guru‟s Congregation, the diamonds and jewels are obtained. O Nanak, the jewel is
priceless; the Gurmukhs seek and find it. || 30 || The self-willed manmukhs do not
even think of the Naam. Cursed are their lives, and cursed are their homes. That Lord
who gives them so much to eat and wear — they do not enshrine that Lord, the
Treasure of Virtue, in their minds. This mind is not pierced by the Word of the Shabad;
how can it come to dwell in its true home? The self-willed manmukhs are like discarded
brides, ruined by coming and going in the cycle of reincarnation. The Gurmukhs are
embellished and exalted by the Naam, the Name of the Lord; the jewel of destiny is
engraved upon their foreheads. they enshrine the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, within
their hearts; the Lord illumines their heart-lotus. I am forever a sacrifice to those who
serve their True Guru. O Nanak, radiant and bright are the faces of those whose inner
beings are illuminated with the Light of the Naam. || 31 || Those who die in the Word
of the Shabad are saved. Without the Shabad, no one is liberated. They wear religious
robes and perform all sorts of rituals, but they are ruined; in the love of duality, their
world is ruined. O Nanak, without the True Guru, the Name is not obtained, even
though one may long for it hundreds of times. || 32 || The Name of the Lord is
utterly great, lofty and high, the highest of the high. No one can climb up to it, even
though one may long for it, hundreds of times. Speaking about self-discipline, no one
become pure; everyone walks around wearing religious robes. Those blessed by the
karma of good deeds go and climb the ladder of the Guru. The Lord comes and dwells
within that one who contemplates the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. 

O Nanak, when someone dies in the Word of the Shabad, the mind is pleased and
appeased. True is the reputation of those who are true. || 33 || Emotional attachment
to Maya is a treacherous ocean of pain and poison, which cannot be crossed.
Screaming, “Mine, mine!”, they rot and die; they pass their lives in egotism. The selfwilled manmukhs are in limbo, neither on this side, nor the other; they are stuck in the
middle. They act as they are pre-destined; they cannot do anything else. Following the
Guru‟s Teachings, the jewel of spiritual wisdom abides in the mind, and then God is
easily seen in all. O Nanak, the very fortunate ones embark on the Boat of the True
Guru; they are carried across the terrifying world-ocean. || 34 || Without the True
Guru, there is no giver who can bestow the Support of the Lord‟s Name. By Guru‟s
Grace, the Name comes to dwell in the mind; keep it enshrined in your heart. The fire
of desire is extinguished, and one finds satisfaction, through the Love of the Name of
the Lord. O Nanak, the Gurmukh finds the Lord, when He showers His Mercy. || 35 ||
Without the Shabad, the world is so insane, that it cannot even be described. Those
who are protected by the Lord are saved; they remain lovingly attuned to the Word of
the Shabad. O Nanak, the Creator who made this making knows everything. || 36 ||
The Pandits, the religious scholars, have grown weary of making fire-offerings and
sacrifices, making pilgrimages to all the sacred shrines, and reading the Puraanas. But
they cannot get rid of the poison of emotional attachment to Maya; they continue to
come and go in egotism. Meeting with the True Guru, one‟s filth is washed off,
meditating on the Lord, the Primal Being, the All-knowing One. Servant Nanak is forever
a sacrifice to those who serve their Lord God. || 37 || Mortals give great thought to
Maya and emotional attachment; they harbor great hopes, in greed and corruption. The
self-willed manmukhs do not become steady and stable; they die and are gone in an
instant. Only those who are blessed with great good fortune meet the True Guru, and
leave behind their egotism and corruption. Chanting the Name of the Lord, they find
peace; servant Nanak contemplates the Word of the Shabad. || 38 || Without the
True Guru, there is no devotional worship, and no love of the Naam, the Name of the
Lord. Servant Nanak worships and adores the Naam, with love and affection for the
Guru. || 39 || Do not trust greedy people, if you can avoid doing so. At the very last
moment, they will deceive you there, where no one will be able to lend a helping hand.
Whoever associates with the self-willed manmukhs, will have his face blackened and
dirtied. Black are the faces of those greedy people; they lose their lives, and leave in
disgrace. O Lord, let me join the Sat Sangat, the True Congregation; may the Name of
the Lord God abide in my mind. The filth and pollution of birth and death is washed
away, O servant Nanak, singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord. || 40 || Whatever is
pre-destined by the Lord God Creator, cannot be erased. Body and soul are all His. The
Sovereign Lord King cherishes all. The gossipers and slanderers shall remain hungry
and die, rolling in the dust; their hands cannot reach anywhere. Outwardly, they do all
the proper deeds, but they are hypocrites; in their minds and hearts, they practice
deception and fraud. 

Whatever is planted in the farm of the body, shall come and stand before them in the
end. Nanak offers this prayer: O Lord God, please forgive me, and unite me with
Yourself. || 41 || The mortal being does not understand the comings and goings of
reincarnation; he does not see the Court of the Lord. He is wrapped up in emotional
attachment and Maya, and within his being is the darkness of ignorance. The sleeping
person wakes, only when he is hit on the head by a heavy club. The Gurmukhs dwell
upon the Lord; they find the door of salvation. O Nanak, they themselves are saved,
and all their relatives are carried across as well. || 42 || Whoever dies in the Word of
the Shabad, is known to be truly dead. By Guru‟s Grace, the mortal is satisfied by the
sublime essence of the Lord. Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, he is recognized
in the Court of the Lord. Without the Shabad, everyone is dead. The self-willed
manmukh dies; his life is wasted. Those who do not remember the Name of the Lord,
shall cry in pain in the end. O Nanak, whatever the Creator Lord does, comes to pass.
|| 43 || The Gurmukhs never grow old; within them is intuitive understanding and
spiritual wisdom. They chant the Praises of the Lord, forever and ever; deep within,
they intuitively meditate on the Lord. They dwell forever in blissful knowledge of the
Lord; they look upon pain and pleasure as one and the same. They see the One Lord in
all, and realize the Lord, the Supreme Soul of all. || 44 || The self-willed manmukhs
are like stupid children; they do not keep the Lord in their thoughts. They do all their
deeds in egotism, and they must answer to the Righteous Judge of Dharma. The
Gurmukhs are good and immaculately pure; they are embellished and exalted with the
Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. Not even a tiny bit of filth sticks to them; they walk in
harmony with the Will of the True Guru. The filth of the manmukhs is not washed away,
even if they wash hundreds of times. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are united with the Lord;
they merge into the Guru‟s Being. || 45 || How can someone do bad things, and still
live with himself? By his own anger, he only burns himself. The self-willed manmukh
drives himself crazy with worries and stubborn struggles. But those who become
Gurmukh understand everything. O Nanak, the Gurmukh struggles with his own mind.
|| 46 || Those who do not serve the True Guru, the Primal Being, and do not reflect
upon the Word of the Shabad — do not call them human beings; they are just animals
and stupid beasts. They have no spiritual wisdom or meditation within their beings;
they are not in love with the Lord. The self-willed manmukhs die in evil and corruption;
they die and are reborn, again and again. They alone live, who join with the living;
enshrine the Lord, the Lord of Life, within your heart. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs look
beautiful in that Court of the True Lord. || 47 || The Lord built the Harimandir, the
Temple of the Lord; the Lord dwells within it. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, I have
found the Lord; my emotional attachment to Maya has been burnt away. Countless
things are in the Harimandir, the Temple of the Lord; contemplate the Naam, and the
nine treasures will be yours. Blessed is that happy soul-bride, O Nanak, who, as
Gurmukh, seeks and finds the Lord. By great good fortune, one searches the temple of
the body-fortress, and finds the Lord within the heart. || 48 || The self-willed
manmukhs wander lost in the ten directions, led by intense desire, greed and
corruption. 

Their attachment to Maya does not cease; they die, only to be reborn, over and over
again. Serving the True Guru, peace is found; intense desire and corruption are
discarded. The pains of death and birth are taken away; servant Nanak reflects upon
the Word of the Shabad. || 49 || Meditate on the Name of the Lord, Har, Har, O
mortal being, and you shall be honored in the Court of the Lord. All your sins and
terrible mistakes shall be taken away, and you shall be rid of your pride and egotism.
The heart-lotus of the Gurmukh blossoms forth, realizing God, the Soul of all. O Lord
God, please shower Your Mercy upon servant Nanak, that he may chant the Name of
the Lord. || 50 || In Dhanaasaree, the soul-bride is known to be wealthy, O Siblings
of Destiny, when she works for the True Guru. She surrenders her body, mind and soul,
O Siblings of Destiny, and lives according to the Hukam of His Command. I sit where He
wishes me to sit, O Siblings of Destiny; wherever He sends me, I go. There is no other
wealth as great, O Siblings of Destiny; such is the greatness of the True Name. I sing
forever the Glorious Praises of the True Lord; I shall remain with the True One forever.
So wear the clothes of His Glorious Virtues and goodness, O Siblings of Destiny; eat and
enjoy the flavor of your own honor. How can I praise Him, O Siblings of Destiny? I am a
sacrifice to the Blessed Vision of His Darshan. Great is the Glorious Greatness of the
True Guru, O Siblings of Destiny; if one is blessed with good karma, He is found. Some
do not know how to submit to the Hukam of His Command, O Siblings of Destiny; they
wander around lost in the love of duality. They find no place of rest in the Sangat, O
Siblings of Destiny; they find no place to sit. Nanak: they alone submit to His
Command, O Siblings of Destiny, who are pre-destined to live the Name. I am a
sacrifice to them, O Siblings of Destiny, I am forever a sacrifice to them. || 51 ||
Those beards are true, which brush the feet of the True Guru. Those who serve their
Guru night and day, live in bliss, night and day. O Nanak, their faces appear beautiful in
the Court of the True Lord. || 52 || True are the faces and true are the beards, of
those who speak the Truth and live the Truth. The True Word of the Shabad abides in
their minds; they are absorbed in the True Guru. True is their capital, and true is their
wealth; they are blessed with the ultimate status. They hear the Truth, they believe in
the Truth; they act and work in the Truth. They are given a place in the Court of the
True Lord; they are absorbed in the True Lord. O Nanak, without the True Guru, the
True Lord is not found. The self-willed manmukhs leave, wandering around lost. || 53
|| The sparrow-hawk cries, “Pri-o! Pri-o! Beloved! Beloved!” She is in love with the
treasure, the water. Meeting with the Guru, the cooling, soothing water is obtained, and
all pain is taken away. My thirst has been quenched, and intuitive peace and poise have
welled up; my cries and screams of anguish are past. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs are
peaceful and tranquil; they enshrine the Naam, the Name of the Lord, within their
hearts. || 54 || O sparrow-hawk, chirp the True Name, and let yourself be attuned to
the True Lord. Your word shall be accepted and approved, if you speak as Gurmukh.
Remember the Shabad, and your thirst shall be relieved; surrender to the Will of the
Lord. 

The clouds are heavy, hanging low, and the rain is pouring down on all sides; the raindrop is received, with natural ease. From water, everything is produced; without water,
thirst is not quenched. O Nanak, whoever drinks in the Water of the Lord, shall never
feel hunger again. || 55 || O sparrow-hawk, speak the Shabad, the True Word of
God, with natural peace and poise. Everything is with you; the True Guru will show you
this. So understand your own self, and meet your Beloved; His Grace shall rain down in
torrents. Drop by drop, the Ambrosial Nectar rains down softly and gently; thirst and
hunger are completely gone. Your cries and screams of anguish have ceased; your light
shall merge into the Light. O Nanak, the happy soul-brides sleep in peace; they are
absorbed in the True Name. || 56 || The Primal Lord and Master has sent out the
True Hukam of His Command. Indra mercifully sends forth the rain, which falls in
torrents. The body and mind of the sparrow-hawk are happy. only when the rain-drop
falls into its mouth. The corn grows high, wealth increases, and the earth is embellished
with beauty. Night and day, people worship the Lord with devotion, and are absorbed in
the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad. The True Lord Himself forgives them, and showering
them with His Mercy, He leads them to walk in His Will. O brides, sing the Glorious
Praises of the Lord, and be absorbed in the True Word of His Shabad. Let the Fear of
God be your decoration, and remain lovingly attuned to the True Lord. O Nanak, the
Naam abides in the mind, and the mortal is saved in the Court of the Lord. || 57 ||
The sparrow-hawk wanders all over the earth, soaring high through the skies. But it
obtains the drop of water, only when it meets the True Guru, and then, its hunger and
thirst are relieved. Soul and body and all belong to Him; everything is His. He knows
everything, without being told; unto whom should we offer our prayers? O Nanak, the
One Lord is prevading and permeating each and every heart; the Word of the Shabad
brings illumination. || 58 || O Nanak, the season of spring comes to one who serves
the True Guru. The Lord rains His Mercy down upon him, and his mind and body totally
blossom forth; the entire world becomes green and rejuvenated. || 59 || The Word of
the Shabad brings eternal spring; it rejuvenates the mind and body. O Nanak, do not
forget the Naam, the Name of the Lord, which has created everyone. || 60 || O
Nanak, it is the spring season, for those Gurmukhs, within whose minds the Lord
abides. When the Lord showers His Mercy, the mind and body blossom forth, and all
the world turns green and lush. || 61 || In the early hours of the morning, whose
name should we chant? Chant the Name of the Transcendent Lord, who is All-powerful
to create and destroy. || 62 || The Persian wheel also cries out, “Too! Too! You!
You!”, with sweet and sublime sounds. Our Lord and Master is always present; why do
you cry out to Him in such a loud voice? I am a sacrifice to that Lord who created the
world, and who loves it. Give up your selfishness, and then you shall meet your
Husband Lord. Consider this Truth. Speaking in shallow egotism, no one understands
the Ways of God. The forests and fields, and all the three worlds meditate on You, O
Lord; this is the way they pass their days and nights forever. 

Without the True Guru, no one finds the Lord. People have grown weary of thinking
about it. But if the Lord casts His Glance of Grace, then He Himself embellishes us. O
Nanak, the Gurmukhs meditate on the Lord; blessed and approved is their coming into
the world. || 63 || Yoga is not obtained by wearing saffron robes; Yoga is not
obtained by wearing dirty robes. O Nanak, Yoga is obtained even while sitting in your
own home, by following the Teachings of the True Guru. || 64 || You may wander in
all four directions, and read the Vedas throughout the four ages. O Nanak, if you meet
with the True Guru, the Lord shall come to dwell within your mind, and you shall find
the door of salvation. || 65 || O Nanak, the Hukam, the Command of your Lord and
Master, is prevailing. The intellectually confused person wanders around lost, misled by
his fickle consciousness. If you make friends with the self-willed manmukhs, O friend,
who can you ask for peace? Make friends with the Gurmukhs, and focus your
consciousness on the True Guru. The root of birth and death will be cut away, and then,
you shall find peace, O friend. || 66 || The Lord Himself instructs those who are
misguided, when He casts His Glance of Grace. O Nanak, those who are not blessed by
His Glance of Grace, cry and weep and wail. || 67 ||
SHALOK, FOURTH MEHL:

Blessed and very fortunate are those happy soul-brides who, as Gurmukh, meet their
Sovereign Lord King. The Light of God shines within them; O Nanak, they are absorbed
in the Naam, the Name of the Lord. || 1 || Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the
True Guru, the Primal Being, who has realized the True Lord. Meeting Him, thirst is
quenched, and the body and mind are cooled and soothed. Waaho! Waaho! Blessed
and Great is the True Guru, the True Primal Being, who looks upon all alike. Waaho!
Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True Guru, who has no hatred; slander and praise are
all the same to Him. Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the All-knowing True Guru,
who has realized God within. Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the Formless True
Guru, who has no end or limitation. Waaho! Waaho! Blessed and Great is the True
Guru, who implants the Truth within. O Nanak, Blessed and Great is the True Guru,
through whom the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is received. || 2 || For the Gurmukh,
the true Song of Praise is to chant the Name of the Lord God. Chanting the Praises of
the Lord, their minds are in ecstasy. By great good fortune, they find the Lord, the
Embodiment of perfect, supreme bliss. Servant Nanak praises the Naam, the Name of
the Lord; no obstacle will block his mind or body. || 3 || I am in love with my
Beloved; how can I meet my Dear Friend? I seek that friend, who is embellished with
Truth. The True Guru is my Friend; if I meet Him, I will offer this mind as a sacrifice to
Him. He has shown me my Beloved Lord, my Friend, the Creator. O Nanak, I was
searching for my Beloved; the True Guru has shown me that He has been with me all
the time. || 4 || I stand by the side of the road, waiting for You; O my Friend, I hope
that You will come. If only someone would come today and unite me in Union with my
Beloved. 


I would cut my living body into four pieces for anyone who shows me my Beloved. O
Nanak, when the Lord becomes merciful, then He leads us to meet the Perfect Guru. ||
5 || The power of egotism prevails within, and the body is controlled by Maya; the
false ones come and go in reincarnation. If someone does not obey the Command of
the True Guru, he cannot cross over the treacherous world-ocean. Whoever is blessed
with the Lord‟s Glance of Grace, walks in harmony with the Will of the True Guru. The
Blessed Vision of the True Guru‟s Darshan is fruitful; through it, one obtains the fruits of
his desires. I touch the feet of those who believe in and obey the True Guru. Nanak is
the slave of those who, night and day, remain lovingly attuned to the Lord. || 6 ||
Those who are in love with their Beloved — how can they find satisfaction without His
Darshan? O Nanak, the Gurmukhs meet Him with ease, and this mind blossoms forth in
joy. || 7 || Those who are in love with their Beloved — how can they live without
Him? When they see their Husband Lord, O Nanak, they are rejuvenated. || 8 ||
Those Gurmukhs who are filled with love for You, my True Beloved, O Nanak, remain
immersed in the Lord‟s Love, night and day. || 9 || The love of the Gurmukh is true;
through it, the True Beloved is attained. Night and day, remain in bliss, O Nanak,
immersed in intuitive peace and poise. || 10 || True love and affection are obtained
from the Perfect Guru. They never break, O Nanak, if one sings the Glorious Praises of
the Lord. || 11 || How can those who have true love within them live without their
Husband Lord? The Lord unites the Gurmukhs with Himself, O Nanak; they were
separated from Him for such a long time. || 12 || You grant Your Grace to those
whom You Yourself bless with love and affection. O Lord, please let Nanak meet with
You; please bless this beggar with Your Name. || 13 || The Gurmukh laughs, and the
Gurmukh cries. Whatever the Gurmukh does, is devotional worship. Whoever becomes
Gurmukh contemplates the Lord. The Gurmukh, O Nanak, crosses over to the other
shore. || 14 || Those who have the Naam within, contemplate the Word of the Guru‟s
Bani. Their faces are always radiant in the Court of the True Lord. Sitting down and
standing up, they never forget the Creator, who forgives them. O Nanak, the Gurmukhs
are united with the Lord. Those united by the Creator Lord, shall never be separated
again. || 15 || To work for the Guru, or a spiritual teacher, is terribly difficult, but it
brings the most excellent peace. The Lord casts His Glance of Grace, and inspires love
and affection. Joined to the service of the True Guru, the mortal being crosses over the
terrifying world-ocean. The fruits of the mind‟s desires are obtained, with clear
contemplation and discriminating understanding within. O Nanak, meeting the True
Guru, God is found; He is the Eradicator of all sorrow. || 16 || The self-willed
manmukh may perform service, but his consciousness is attached to the love of duality.
Through Maya, his emotional attachment to children, spouse and relatives increases. 

He shall be called to account in the Court of the Lord, and in the end, no one will be
able to save him. Without the Lord‟s Name, all is pain. Attachment to Maya is
agonizingly painful. O Nanak, the Gurmukh comes to see, that attachment to Maya
separates all from the Lord. || 17 || The Gurmukh obeys the Order of her Husband
Lord God; through the Hukam of His Command, she finds peace. In His Will, she
serves; in His Will, she worship and adores Him. In His Will, she merges in absorption.
His Will is her fast, vow, purity and self-discipline; through it, she obtains the fruits of
her mind‟s desires. She is always and forever the happy, pure soul-bride, who realizes
His Will; she serves the True Guru, inspired by loving absorption. O Nanak, those upon
whom the Lord showers His Mercy, are merged and immersed in His Will. || 18 || The
wretched, self-willed manmukhs do not realize His Will; they continually act in ego. By
ritualistic fasts, vows, purities, self-disciplines and worship ceremonies, they still cannot
get rid of their hypocrisy and doubt. Inwardly, they are impure, pierced through by
attachment to Maya; they are like elephants, who throw dirt all over themselves right
after their bath. They do not even think of the One who created them. Without thinking
of Him, they cannot find peace. O Nanak, the Primal Creator has made the drama of the
Universe; all act as they are pre-ordained. || 19 || The Gurmukh has faith; his mind is
contented and satisfied. Night and day, he serves the Lord, absorbed in Him. The Guru,
the True Guru, is within; all worship and adore Him. Everyone comes to see the Blessed
Vision of His Darshan. So believe in the True Guru, the supreme sublime Contemplator.
Meeting with Him, hunger and thirst are completely relieved. I am forever a sacrifice to
my Guru, who leads me to meet the True Lord God. O Nanak, those who come and fall
at the Feet of the Guru are blessed with the karma of Truth. || 20 || That Beloved,
with whom I am in love, that Friend of mine is with me. I wander around inside and
outside, but I always keep Him enshrined within my heart. || 21 || Those who
meditate on the Lord single-mindedly, with one-pointed concentration, link their
consciousness to the True Guru. They are rid of pain, hunger, and the great illness of
egotism; lovingly attuned to the Lord, they become free of pain. They sing His Praises,
and chant His Praises; in His Glorious Praises, they sleep in absorption. O Nanak,
through the Perfect Guru, they come to meet God with intuitive peace and poise. || 22
|| The self-willed manmukhs are emotionally attached to Maya; they are not in love
with the Naam. They practice falsehood, gather falsehood, and eat the food of
falsehood. Gathering the poisonous wealth and property of Maya, they die; in the end,
they are all reduced to ashes. They perform religious rituals of purity and self-discipline,
but they are filled with greed, evil and corruption. O Nanak, the actions of the selfwilled manmukhs are not accepted; in the Court of the Lord, they are miserable. 

23 || Among all Ragas, that one is sublime, O Siblings of Destiny, by which the Lord
comes to abide in the mind. Those Ragas which are in the Sound-current of the Naad
are totally true; their value cannot be expressed. Those Ragas which are not in the
Sound-current of the Naad — by these, the Lord‟s Will cannot be understood. O Nanak,
they alone are right, who understand the Will of the True Guru. 

Everything happens as He wills. || 24 || The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name
of the Lord, is within the True Guru. Following the Guru‟s Teachings, one meditates on
the Immaculate Naam, the Pure and Holy Naam. The Ambrosial Word of His Bani is the
true essence. It comes to abide in the mind of the Gurmukh. The heart-lotus blossoms
forth, and one‟s light merges in the Light. O Nanak, they alone meet with the True
Guru, who have such pre-ordained destiny inscribed upon their foreheads. || 25 ||
Within the self-willed manmukhs is the fire of desire; their hunger does not depart.
Emotional attachments to relatives are totally false; they remain engrossed in
falsehood. Night and day, they are troubled by anxiety; bound to anxiety, they depart.
Their comings and goings in reincarnation never end; they do their deeds in egotism.
But in the Guru‟s Sanctuary, they are saved, O Nanak, and set free. || 26 || The True
Guru meditates on the Lord, the Primal Being. The Sat Sangat, the True Congregation,
loves the True Guru. Those who join the Sat Sangat, and serve the True Guru — the
Guru unites them in the Lord‟s Union. This world, this universe, is a terrifying ocean. On
the Boat of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, the Guru carries us across. The Sikhs of
the Guru accept and obey the Lord‟s Will; the Perfect Guru carries them across. O Lord,
please bless me with the dust of the feet of the Guru‟s Sikhs. I am a sinner — please
save me. Those who have such pre-ordained destiny written upon their foreheads by
the Lord God, come to meet Guru Nanak. The Messenger of Death is beaten and driven
away; we are saved in the Court of the Lord. Blessed and celebrated are the Sikhs of
the Guru; in His Pleasure, the Lord unites them in His Union. || 27 || The Perfect
Guru has implanted the Lord‟s Name within me; it has dispelled my doubts from within.
Singing the Kirtan of the Praises of the Lord‟s Name, the Lord‟s path is illuminated and
shown to His Sikhs. Conquering my egotism, I remain lovingly attuned to the One Lord;
the Naam, the Name of the Lord, dwells within me. I follow the Guru‟s Teachings, and
so the Messenger of Death cannot even see me; I am immersed in the True Name. The
Creator Himself is All-pervading; as He pleases, He links us to His Name. Servant Nanak
lives, chanting the Name. Without the Name, he dies in an instant. || 28 || Within the
minds of the faithless cynics is the disease of egotism; these evil people wander around
lost, deluded by doubt. O Nanak, this disease is eradicated only by meeting with the
True Guru, the Holy Friend. || 29 || Following the Guru‟s Teachings, chant the Name
of the Lord, Har, Har. Attracted by the Lord‟s Love, day and night, the body-robe is
imbued with the Lord‟s Love. I have not found any being like the Lord, although I have
searched and looked all over the world. The Guru, the True Guru, has implanted the
Naam within; now, my mind does not waver or wander anywhere else. Servant Nanak
is the slave of the Lord, the slave of the slaves of the Guru, the True Guru. || 30 || 

SHALOK, FIFTH MEHL:

They alone are imbued with the Lord, who do not turn their faces away from Him —
they realize Him. The false, immature lovers do not know the way of love, and so they
fall. || 1 || Without my Master, I will burn my silk and satin clothes in the fire. Even
rolling in the dust, I look beautiful, O Nanak, if my Husband Lord is with me. || 2 ||
Through the Word of the Guru‟s Shabad, I worship and adore the Naam, with love and
balanced detachment. When the five enemies are overcome, O Nanak, this musical
measure of Raga Maru becomes frtuiful. || 3 || When I have the One Lord, I have
tens of thousands. Otherwise, people like me beg from door to door. O Brahmin, your
life has passed away uselessly; you have forgotten the One who created you. || 4 ||
In Raga Sorat‟h, drink in this sublime essence, which never loses its taste. O Nanak,
singing the Glorious Praises of the Lord‟s Name, one‟s reputation is immaculate in the
Court of the Lord. || 5 || No one can kill those whom God Himself protects. The
treasure of the Naam, the Name of the Lord, is within them. They cherish His Glorious
Virtues forever. They take the Support of the One, the Inaccessible Lord; they enshrine
God in their mind and body. They are imbued with the Love of the Infinite Lord, and no
one can wipe it away. The Gurmukhs sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord; they obtain
the most excellent celestial peace and poise. O Nanak, they enshrine the treasure of the
Naam in their hearts. || 6 || Whatever God does, accept that as good; leave behind
all other judgements. He shall cast His Glance of Grace, and attach you to Himself.
Instruct yourself with the Teachings, and doubt will depart from within. Everyone does
that which is pre-ordained by destiny. Everything is under His control; there is no other
place at all. Nanak is in peace and bliss, accepting the Will of God. || 7 || Those who
meditate in remembrance on the Perfect Guru, are exalted and uplifted. O Nanak,
dwelling on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, all affairs are resolved. || 8 || The
sinners act, and generate bad karma, and then they weep and wail. O Nanak, just as
the churning stick churns the butter, so does the Righteous Judge of Dharma churn
them. || 9 || Meditating on the Naam, O friend, the treasure of life is won. O Nanak,
speaking in Righteousness, one‟s world becomes sanctified. || 10 || I am stuck in an
evil place, trusting the sweet words of an evil advisor. O Nanak, they alone are saved,
who have such good destiny inscribed upon their foreheads. || 11 || They alone sleep
and dream in peace, who are imbued with the Love of their Husband Lord. Those who
have been separated from the Love of their Master, scream and cry twenty-four hours a
day. || 12 || Millions are asleep, in the false illusion of Maya. O Nanak, they alone are
awake and aware, who chant the Naam with their tongues. || 13 || Seeing the
mirage, the optical illusion, the people are confused and deluded. Those who worship
and adore the True Lord, O Nanak, their minds and bodies are beautiful. || 14 || 

The All-powerful Supreme Lord God, the Infinite Primal Being, is the Saving Grace of
sinners. Those whom He saves, meditate in remembrance on the Creator Lord. || 15 ||
Forsake duality and the ways of evil; focus your consciousness on the One Lord. In the
love of duality, O Nanak, the mortals are being washed downstream. || 16 || In the
markets and bazaars of the three qualities, the merchants make their deals. Those who
load the true merchandise are the true traders. || 17 || Those who do not know the
way of love are foolish; they wander lost and confused. O Nanak, forgetting the Lord,
they fall into the deep, dark pit of hell. || 18 || In his mind, the mortal does not forget
Maya; he begs for more and more wealth. That God does not even come into his
consciousness; O Nanak, it is not in his karma. || 19 || The mortal does not run out of
capital, as long as the Lord Himself is merciful. The Word of the Shabad is Guru Nanak‟s
inexhaustible treasure; this wealth and capital never runs out, no matter how much it is
spent and consumed. || 20 || If I could find wings for sale, I would buy them with an
equal weight of my flesh. I would attach them to my body, and seek out and find my
Friend. || 21 || My Friend is the True Supreme King, the King over the heads of kings.
Sitting by His side, we are exalted and beautified; He is the Support of all. || 22 ||

SHALOK, NINTH MEHL:
If you do not sing the Praises of the Lord, your life is rendered useless. Says Nanak,
meditate, vibrate upon the Lord; immerse your mind in Him, like the fish in the water.
|| 1 || Why are you engrossed in sin and corruption? You are not detached, even for a
moment! Says Nanak, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord, and you shall not be caught in
the noose of death. || 2 || Your youth has passed away like this, and old age has
overtaken your body. Says Nanak, meditate, vibrate upon the Lord; your life is fleeting
away! || 3 || You have become old, and you do not understand that death is
overtaking you. Says Nanak, you are insane! Why do you not remember and meditate
on God? || 4 || Your wealth, spouse, and all the possessions which you claim as your
own — none of these shall go along with you in the end. O Nanak, know this as true. ||
5 || He is the Saving Grace of sinners, the Destroyer of fear, the Master of the
masterless. Says Nanak, realize and know Him, who is always with you. || 6 || He has
given you your body and wealth, but you are not in love with Him. Says Nanak, you are
insane! Why do you now shake and tremble so helplessly? || 7 || He has given you
your body, wealth, property, peace and beautiful mansions. Says Nanak, listen, mind:
why don‟t you remember the Lord in meditation? || 8 || The Lord is the Giver of all
peace and comfort. There is no other at all. 

Says Nanak, listen, mind: meditating in remembrance on Him, salvation is attained. ||
9 || Remembering Him in meditation, salvation is attained; vibrate and meditate on
Him, O my friend. Says Nanak, listen, mind: your life is passing away! || 10 || Your
body is made up of the five elements; you are clever and wise — know this well.
Believe it — you shall merge once again into the One, O Nanak, from whom you
originated. || 11 || The Dear Lord abides in each and every heart; the Saints proclaim
this as true. Says Nanak, meditate and vibrate upon Him, and you shall cross over the
terrifying world-ocean. || 12 || One who is not touched by pleasure or pain, greed,
emotional attachment and egotistical pride — says Nanak, listen, mind: he is the very
image of God. || 13 || One who is beyond praise and slander, who looks upon gold
and iron alike — says Nanak, listen, mind: know that such a person is liberated. || 14
|| One who is not affected by pleasure or pain, who looks upon friend and enemy alike
— says Nanak, listen, mind: know that such a person is liberated. || 15 || One who
does not frighten anyone, and who is not afraid of anyone else — says Nanak, listen,
mind: call him spiritually wise. || 16 || One who has forsaken all sin and corruption,
who wears the robes of neutral detachment — says Nanak, listen, mind: good destiny is
written on his forehead. || 17 || One who renounces Maya and possessiveness and is
detached from everything — says Nanak, listen, mind: God abides in his heart. || 18 ||
That mortal, who forsakes egotism, and realizes the Creator Lord — says Nanak, that
person is liberated; O mind, know this as true. || 19 || In this Dark Age of Kali Yuga,
the Name of the Lord is the Destroyer of fear, the Eradicator of evil-mindedness. Night
and day, O Nanak, whoever vibrates and meditates on the Lord‟s Name, sees all of his
works brought to fruition. || 20 || Vibrate with your tongue the Glorious Praises of the
Lord of the Universe; with your ears, hear the Lord‟s Name. Says Nanak, listen, man:
you shall not have to go to the house of Death. || 21 || That mortal who renounces
possessiveness, greed, emotional attachment and egotism — says Nanak, he himself is
saved, and he saves many others as well. || 22 || Like a dream and a show, so is this
world, you must know. None of this is true, O Nanak, without God. || 23 || Night and
day, for the sake of Maya, the mortal wanders constantly. Among millions, O Nanak,
there is scarcely anyone, who keeps the Lord in his consciousness. || 24 || As the
bubbles in the water well up and disappear again, so is the universe created; says
Nanak, listen, O my friend! || 25 || The mortal does not remember the Lord, even for
a moment; he is blinded by the wine of Maya. Says Nanak, without meditating on the
Lord, he is caught by the noose of Death. || 26 || If you yearn for eternal peace, then
seek the Sanctuary of the Lord. Says Nanak, listen, mind: this human body is difficult to
obtain. || 27 || For the sake of Maya, the fools and ignorant people run all around.
Says Nanak, without meditating on the Lord, life passes away uselessly. || 28 || 


That mortal who meditates and vibrates upon the Lord night and day — know him to be
the embodiment of the Lord. There is no difference between the Lord and the humble
servant of the Lord; O Nanak, know this as true. || 29 || The mortal is entangled in
Maya; he has forgotten the Name of the Lord of the Universe. Says Nanak, without
meditating on the Lord, what is the use of this human life? || 30 || The mortal does
not think of the Lord; he is blinded by the wine of Maya. Says Nanak, without
meditating on the Lord, he is caught in the noose of Death. || 31 || In good times,
there are many companions around, but in bad times, there is no one at all. Says
Nanak, vibrate, and meditate on the Lord; He shall be your only Help and Support in
the end. || 32 || Mortals wander lost and confused through countless lifetimes; their
fear of death is never removed. Says Nanak, vibrate and meditate on the Lord, and you
shall dwell in the Fearless Lord. || 33 || I have tried so many things, but the pride of
my mind has not been dispelled. I am engrossed in evil-mindedness, Nanak. O God,
please save me! || 34 || Childhood, youth and old age — know these as the three
stages of life. Says Nanak, without meditating on the Lord, everything is useless; you
must appreciate this. || 35 || You have not done what you should have done; you are
entangled in the web of greed. Nanak, your time is past and gone; why are you crying
now, you blind fool? || 36 || The mind is absorbed in Maya — it cannot escape it, my
friend. Nanak, it is like a picture painted on the wall — it cannot leave it. || 37 || The
man wishes for something, but something different happens. He plots to deceive
others, O Nanak, but he places the noose around his own neck instead. || 38 ||
People make all sorts of efforts to find peace and pleasure, but no one tries to earn
pain. Says Nanak, listen, mind: whatever pleases God comes to pass. || 39 || The
world wanders around begging, but the Lord is the Giver of all. Says Nanak, meditate in
remembrance on Him, and all your works will be successful. || 40 || Why do you take
such false pride in yourself? You must know that the world is just a dream. None of this
is yours; Nanak proclaims this truth. || 41 || You are so proud of your body; it shall
perish in an instant, my friend. That mortal who chants the Praises of the Lord, O
Nanak, conquers the world. || 42 || That person, who meditates in remembrance on
the Lord in his heart, is liberated — know this well. There is no difference between that
person and the Lord: O Nanak, accept this as the Truth. || 43 || That person, who
does not feel devotion to God in his mind — O Nanak, know that his body is like that of
a pig, or a dog. || 44 || A dog never abandons the home of his master. O Nanak, in
just the same way, vibrate, and meditate on the Lord, single-mindedly, with onepointed consciousness. || 45 || Those who make pilgrimages to sacred shrines,
observe ritualistic fasts and make donations to charity while still taking pride in their
minds — O Nanak, their actions are useless, like the elephant, who takes a bath, and
then rolls in the dust. || 46 || The head shakes, the feet stagger, and the eyes
become dull and weak. Says Nanak, this is your condition. 

Even now, you have not savored the sublime essence of the Lord. || 47 || I had
looked upon the world as my own, but no one belongs to anyone else. O Nanak, only
devotional worship of the Lord is permanent; enshrine this in your mind. || 48 || The
world and its affairs are totally false; know this well, my friend. Says Nanak, it is like a
wall of sand; it shall not endure. || 49 || Raam Chand passed away, as did Raawan,
even though he had lots of relatives. Says Nanak, nothing lasts forever; the world is like
a dream. || 50 || People become anxious, when something unexpected happens. This
is the way of the world, O Nanak; nothing is stable or permanent. || 51 || Whatever
has been created shall be destroyed; everyone shall perish, today or tomorrow. O
Nanak, sing the Glorious Praises of the Lord, and give up all other entanglements. || 52
|| DOHRAA: My strength is exhausted, and I am in bondage; I cannot do anything at
all. Says Nanak, now, the Lord is my Support; He will help me, as He did the elephant.
|| 53 || My strength has been restored, and my bonds have been broken; now, I can
do everything. Nanak: everything is in Your hands, Lord; You are my Helper and
Support. || 54 || My associates and companions have all deserted me; no one
remains with me. Says Nanak, in this tragedy, the Lord alone is my Support. || 55 ||
The Naam remains; the Holy Saints remain; the Guru, the Lord of the Universe,
remains. Says Nanak, how rare are those who chant the Guru‟s Mantra in this world. ||
56 || I have enshrined the Lord‟s Name within my heart; there is nothing equal to it.
Meditating in remembrance on it, my troubles are taken away; I have received the
Blessed Vision of Your Darshan. || 57 || 1 ||
MUNDAAVANEE, FIFTH MEHL:
Upon this Plate, three things have been placed: Truth, Contentment and Contemplation.
The Ambrosial Nectar of the Naam, the Name of our Lord and Master, has been placed
upon it as well; it is the Support of all. One who eats it and enjoys it shall be saved.
This thing can never be forsaken; keep this always and forever in your mind. The dark
world-ocean is crossed over, by grasping the Feet of the Lord; O Nanak, it is all the
extension of God. || 1 || SHALOK, FIFTH MEHL: I have not appreciated what You
have done for me, Lord; only You can make me worthy. I am unworthy — I have no
worth or virtues at all. You have taken pity on me. You took pity on me, and blessed me
with Your Mercy, and I have met the True Guru, my Friend. O Nanak, if I am blessed
with the Naam, I live, and my body and mind blossom forth. || 1 ||



RAAG MAALAA: Each Raga has five wives, and eight sons, who emit distinctive notes.
In the first place is Raag Bhairao. 

It is accompanied by the voices of its five Raaginis: First is Bhairavee, then Bilaavalee;
then the songs of Punni-aakee and Bangalee; and then comes Asalaykhee. Then, there
are the eight sons of Bhairao: the sounds of Pancham, Harakh and Disaakh; the songs
of Bangaalam, Madh and Maadhav. Lalat and Bilaaval — each gives out its own melody,
in the hands of those who make music. || 1 || In the second family is Maalakausak,
who brings his five Raaginis: Gondakaree and Dayv Gandhaaree, the voices of
Gandhaaree and Seehutee, and the fifth song of Dhanaasaree. This chain of
Maalakausak brings along Maaroo, Masta-ang and Mayvaaraa, Prabal, Chandakausak,
Khau, Khat and Bauraanad singing. These are the eight sons of Maalakausak. || 1 ||
Then comes Hindol with his five wives and eight sons; it rises in waves when the sweetvoiced chorus sings. || 1 || There come Taylangee and Darvakaree; Basantee and
Sandoor follow; then Aheeree, the finest of women. She is also embellished with sons:
Surmaanand and Bhaaskar come, Chandrabinb and Mangalan follow. Sarasbaan and
Binodaa then come, and the thrilling songs of Basant and Kamodaa. These are the eight
sons I have listed. Then comes the turn of Deepak. || 1 || Kachhaylee, Patamanjaree
and Todee are there; Kaamodee and Goojaree accompany Deepak. || 1 || Kaalankaa,
Kuntal and Raamaa, Kamalakusam and Champak are their names; Gauraa, Kaanaraa
and Kaylaanaa; these are the eight sons of Deepak. || 1 || All join together and sing
Siree Raag, which also has five women: Bairaaree and Karnaatee, the songs of Gawree
and Aasaavaree; then follows Sindhavee. These are the five wives of Siree Raag. || 1
|| Saaloo, Saarang, Saagaraa, Gond and Gambheer — the eight sons of Siree Raag —
Gund, Kumb and Hameer. || 1 || In the sixth place, Maygh Raag is sung, with his five
wives in accompaniment: Sorat‟h, Gond, and the melody of Malaaree; then the
harmonies of Aasaa are sung. And finally comes Soohau. These are the five with Maygh
Raag. || 1 || Bairaadhar, Gajadhar, Kaydaaraa, Jabaleedhar, Nat and Jaladhaaraa.
Then come the songs of Shankar and Shi-aamaa. These are the names of the sons of
Maygh Raag. So all together, they sing the six Raagas and the thirty Raaginis, and all
the forty-eight sons of the Raagas. || 1 || 1 ||
