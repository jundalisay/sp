I
The city of the Unborn, whose knowledge is unchanging, has eleven gates. Thinking on
Him, man grieves no more; and being freed (from ignorance), he attains liberation. This
verily is That.
This human body is called a city with eleven gates, where the eternal unborn Spirit dwells.
These gates are the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, the mouth, the navel, the two lower
apertures, and the imperceptible opening at the top of the head. The Self or Atman holds
the position of ruler in this city; and being above the modifications of birth, death and all
human imperfections, It is not affected by the changes of the physical organism. As the
intelligent man through constant thought and meditation realizes the splendour of this
Supreme Spirit, he becomes free from that part of his nature which grieves and suffers,
and thus he attains liberation.
II
He is the sun dwelling in the bright heaven; He is the air dwelling in space; He is the fire
burning on the altar; He is the guest dwelling in the house. He dwells in man. He dwells in
those greater than man. He dwells in sacrifice. He dwells in the ether. He is (all that is)
born in water, (all that) is born in earth, (all that) is born in sacrifice, (all that) is born on
mountains. He is the True and the Great.
III
He it is who sends the (in–coming) Prana (life–breath) upward and throws the (out–going)
breath downward. Him all the senses worship, the adorable Atman, seated in the centre
(the heart).
IV
When this Atman, which is seated in the body, goes out (from the body), what remains
then? This verily is That.
V
No mortal lives by the in–coming breath (Prana) or by the out–going breath (Apana), but
he lives by another on which these two depend.
VI
O Gautama (Nachiketas), I shall declare unto thee the secret of the eternal Brahman and
what happens to the Self after death.
VII
Some Jivas (individual Souls) enter wombs to be embodied; others go into immovable
forms, according to their deeds and knowledge.
This text shows the application of the law of cause and effect to all forms of life. The
thoughts and actions of the present life determine the future birth and environment.
VIII
The Being who remains awake while all sleep, who grants all desires, That is pure, That is
Brahman, That alone is said to be immortal. On That all the worlds rest. None goes
beyond That. This verily is That.
IX
As fire, though one, having entered the world, becomes various according to what it burns,
so does the Atman (Self) within all living beings, though one, become various according to
what it enters. It also exists outside.
X
As air, though one, having entered the world, becomes various according to what it enters,
so does the Atman within all living beings, though one, become various according to what
it enters. It also exists outside.
By using these similies of fire and air, the teacher tries to show Nachiketas the subtle
quality of the great Self, who, although one and formless like air and fire, yet assumes
different shapes according to the form in which It dwells. But, being all–pervading and
unlimited, It cannot be confined to these forms; therefore it is said that It also exists outside
all forms.
XI
As the sun, the eye of the whole world, is not defiled by external impurities seen by the
eyes, thus the one inner Self of all living beings is not defiled by the misery of the world,
being outside it.
The sun is called the eye of the world because it reveals all objects. As the sun may shine
on the most impure object, yet remain uncontaminated by it, so the Divine Self within is not
touched by the impurity or suffering of the physical form in which it dwells, the Self being
beyond all bodily limitations.
XII
There is one ruler, the Self of all living beings, who makes the one form manifold; the wise
who perceive Him seated within their Self, to them belongs eternal bliss, not to others.
XIII
Eternal among the changing, consciousness of the conscious, who, though one, fulfils the
desires of many: the wise who perceive Him seated within their Self, to them belongs
eternal peace, not to others.
XIV
They (the wise) perceive that indescribable highest bliss, saying, This is That. How am I to
know It? Does It shine (by Its own light) or does It shine (by reflected light)?
XV
The sun does not shine there, nor the moon, nor the stars; nor do these lightnings shine
there, much less this fire. When He shines, everything shines after Him; by His light all is
lighted.
