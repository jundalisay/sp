I

There are two who enjoy the fruits of their good deeds in the world, having entered into the
cave of the heart, seated (there) on the highest summit. The knowers of Brahman call
them shadow and light. So also (they are called) by householders who perform five fire–
sacrifices or three Nachiketa fire–sacrifices.

Here the two signify the Higher Self and the lower self, dwelling in the innermost cave of
the heart. The Seers of Truth, as well as householders who follow the path of rituals and
outer forms with the hope of enjoying the fruits of their good deeds, both proclaim that the
Higher Self is like a light and the lower self like a shadow. When the Truth shines clearly in
the heart of the knower, then he surmounts the apparent duality of his nature and
becomes convinced that there is but One, and that all outer manifestations are nothing but
reflections or projections of that One.

II
May we be able to learn that Nachiketa fire–sacrifice, which is a bridge for those who
perform sacrifice. May we also know the One, who is the highest imperishable Brahman
for those who desire to cross over to the other shore which is beyond fear.
The significance of this text is May we acquire the knowledge of Brahman, the Supreme, in
both manifested and unmanifested form. He is manifested as the Lord of sacrifice for those
who follow the path of ritual He is the unmanifested, eternal, universal Supreme Being for
those who follow the path of wisdom. The “other shore,” being the realm of immortality, is
said to be beyond fear; because disease, death, and all that which mortals fear, cease to
exist there. It is believed by many that these two opening verses were a later interpolation.

<sup>3</sup> The Atman (Self) is the lord of the chariot.

The body is the chariot.

The intellect is the driver.

The mind is the reins.


<sup>4</sup> The senses are the horses.

The sense objects are the roads.

When the Atman is united with body, senses and mind, then the wise call Him the enjoyer.

In chapter 3 Yama defines what part of our being dies and what part is deathless,
what is mortal and what is immortal. 

But the Atman, the Higher Self, is so entirely beyond human conception that it is impossible to give a direct definition of It. 

Only through similies can some idea of It be conveyed. 

That is why all the great Teachers of the world have so often taught in the form of parables. So here the Ruler of Death represents the Self as the lord of this chariot of the body. 

The intellect or discriminative faculty is the driver, who controls these wild horses of the senses by holding firmly the reins of the mind. 

The roads over which these horses travel are made up of all the external objects which attract or repel the senses:–the sense of smelling follows the path of sweet odours, the sense of seeing the way of beautiful sights. 

Thus each sense, unless restrained by the discriminative faculty, seeks to go out towards its special objects. When the Self is joined with body, mind and senses, It is called the intelligent enjoyer; because It is the one who
wills, feels, perceives and does everything.


<sup>5</sup> He who is without discrimination and whose mind is always uncontrolled, his senses are
unmanageable, like the vicious horses of a driver.

<sup>6</sup> But he who is full of discrimination and whose mind is always controlled, his senses are
manageable, like the good horses of a driver.

The man whose intellect is not discriminative and who fails to distinguish right from wrong,
the real from the unreal, is carried away by his sense passions and desires, just as a driver
is carried away by vicious horses over which he has lost control. But he who clearly
distinguishes what is good from what is merely pleasant, and controls all his out–going
forces from running after apparent momentary pleasures, his senses obey and serve him
as good horses obey their driver.

VII
He who does not possess discrimination, whose mind is uncontrolled and always impure,
he does not reach that goal, but falls again into Samsara (realm of birth and death).

VIII
But he who possesses right discrimination, whose mind is under control and always pure,
he reaches that goal, from which he is not born again.

IX
The man who has a discriminative intellect for the driver, and a controlled mind for the
reins, reaches the end of the journey, the highest place of Vishnu (the All–pervading and
Unchangeable One).

A driver must possess first a thorough knowledge of the road; next he must understand
how to handle the reins and control his horses. Then will he drive safely to his destination.
Similarly in this journey of life, our mind and senses must be wholly under the control of
our higher discriminative faculty; for only when all our forces work in unison can we hope
to reach the goal–the abode of Absolute Truth.

<sup>10</sup> Beyond the senses are the objects, beyond the objects is the mind, beyond the mind is the
intellect, beyond the intellect is the great Atman.

<sup>11</sup> Beyond the great Atman is the Unmanifested; beyond the Unmanifested is the Purusha
(the Cosmic Soul); beyond the Purusha there is nothing. That is the end, that is the final
goal.

In these two verses the Teacher shows the process of discrimination, by which one attains
knowledge of the subtle Self. Beginning with the sense–organs, he leads up to the less
and less gross, until he reaches that which is subtlest of all, the true Self of man. The
senses are dependent on sense–objects, because without these the senses would have
no utility. Superior to sense–objects is the mind, because unless these objects affect the
mind, they cannot influence the senses. Over the mind the determinative faculty exercises
power; this determinative faculty is governed by the individual Self; beyond this Self is the
undifferentiated creative energy known as Avyaktam; and above this is the Purusha or
Supreme Self. Than this there is nothing higher. That is the goal, the Highest Abode of
Peace and Bliss.

<sup>12</sup> This Atman (Self), hidden in all beings, does not shine forth; but It is seen by subtle seers
through keen and subtle understanding.

If It dwells in all living beings, why do we not see It? Because the ordinary man’s vision is
too dull and distracted. It is visible to those alone whose intellect has been purified by
constant thought on the Supreme, and whose sight therefore has become refined and
sharpened. This keenness of vision comes only when all our forces have been made one–
pointed through steadfast practice of concentration and meditation.

XIII
A wise man should control speech by mind, mind by intellect, intellect by the great Atman,
and that by the Peaceful One (the Paramatman or Supreme Self).

Here Yama gives the practical method to be followed if one wishes to realize the Supreme.
The word “speech” stands for all the senses. First, therefore, a man must control his
outgoing senses by the mind. Then the mind must be brought under the control of the
discriminative faculty; that is, it must be withdrawn from all sense–objects and cease to
waste its energies on nonessential things. The discriminative faculty in turn must be
controlled by the higher individual intelligence and this must be governed wholly by the
Supreme Intelligence.

XIV

A rise! Awake! Having reached the Great Ones (illumined Teachers), gain understanding.
The path is as sharp as a razor, impassable and difficult to travel, so the wise declare.
This is the eternal call of the wise: Awake from the slumber of ignorance! Arise and seek
out those who know the Truth, because only those who have direct vision of Truth are
capable of teaching It. Invoke their blessing with a humble spirit and seek to be instructed
by them. The path is very difficult to tread. No thoughtless or lethargic person can safely
travel on it. One must be strong, wakeful and persevering.

XV
Knowing That which is soundless, touchless, formless, undecaying; also tasteless,
odorless, and eternal; beginningless, endless and immutable; beyond the Unmanifested:
(knowing That) man escapes from the mouth of death.
The Ruler of Death defines here the innermost essence of our being. Because of its
extreme subtlety, it cannot be heard or felt or smelled or tasted like any ordinary object. It
never dies. It has no beginning or end. It is unchangeable. Realizing this Supreme Reality,
man escapes from death and attains everlasting life. Thus the Teacher has gradually led
Nachiketas to a point where he can reveal to him the secret of death. The boy had thought
that there was a place where he could stay and become immortal. But Yama shows him
that immortality is a state of consciousness and is not gained so long as man clings to
name and form, or to perishable objects. What dies? Form. Therefore the formful man
dies; but not that which dwells within. Although inconceivably subtle, the Sages have
always made an effort through similies and analogies to give some idea of this inner Self
or the God within. They have described It as beyond mind and speech; too subtle for
ordinary perception, but not beyond the range of purified vision.
XVI
The intelligent man, who has heard and repeated the ancient story of Nachiketas, told by
the Ruler of Death, is glorified in the world of Brahman.
XVII
He who with devotion recites this highest secret of immortality before an assembly of
Brahmanas (pious men) or at the time of Shraddha (funeral ceremonies), gains everlasting
reward, he gains everlasting reward.
