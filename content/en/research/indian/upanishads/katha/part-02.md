<sup>1</sup>  Yama said: The good is one thing and the pleasant another. These two, having different
ends, bind a man. It is well with him who chooses the good. He who chooses the pleasant
misses the true end.


<sup>2</sup> The good and the pleasant approach man; the wise examines both and discriminates
between them; the wise prefers the good to the pleasant, but the foolish man chooses the
pleasant through love of bodily pleasure.


<sup>3</sup> O Nachiketas after wise reflection thou hast renounced the pleasant and all pleasing
forms. Thou hast not accepted this garland of great value for which many mortals perish.


<sup>4</sup> Wide apart are these two,–ignorance and what is known as wisdom, leading in opposite
directions. I believe Nachiketas to be one who longs for wisdom, since many tempting
objects have not turned thee aside.

With this second part, the Ruler of Death begins his instructions regarding the great
Hereafter. There are two paths,–one leading Godward, the other leading to worldly
pleasure. He who follows one inevitably goes away from the other; because, like light and
darkness they conflict. One leads to the imperishable spiritual realm; the other to the
perishable physical realm. Both confront a man at every step of life. The discerning man
distinguishing between the two, chooses the Real and Eternal, and he alone attains the
highest, while the ignorant man, preferring that which brings him immediate and tangible
results, misses the true purpose of his existence. Although Yama put before Nachiketas
many temptations to test his sincerity and earnestness, he judging them at their real value,
refused them all, saying “I have come from the mortal realm, shall I ask for what is mortal?
I desire only that which is eternal.” Then Death said to him: “I now see that thou art a
sincere desirer of Truth. I offered thee vast wealth, long life and every form of pleasure
which tempts and deludes men; but thou hast proved thy worthiness by rejecting them all.”


<sup>5</sup> Fools dwelling in ignorance, yet imagining themselves wise and learned, go round and
round in crooked ways, like the blind led by the blind.

<sup>6</sup> The Hereafter never rises before the thoughtless child (the ignorant), deluded by the
glamour of wealth. “This world alone is, there is none other”: thinking thus, he falls under
my sway again and again.

There are many in the world, who, puffed up with intellectual conceit, believe that they are
capable of guiding others. But although they may possess a certain amount of worldly
wisdom, they are devoid of deeper understanding; therefore all that they say merely
increases doubt and confusion in the minds of those who hear them. Hence they are
likened to blind men leading the blind.

The Hereafter does not shine before those who are lacking in the power of discrimination
and are easily carried away therefore by the charm of fleeting objects. As children are
tempted by toys, so they are tempted by pleasure, power, name and fame. To them these
seem the only realities. Being thus attached to perishable things, they come many times
under the dominion of death. There is one part of us which must die; there is another part
which never dies. When a man can identify himself with his undying nature, which is one
with God, then he overcomes death.
VII
He about whom many are not even able to hear, whom many cannot comprehend even
after hearing: wonderful is the teacher, wonderful is he who can receive when taught by an
able teacher.
Throughout the Vedic Scriptures it is declared that no one can impart spiritual knowledge
unless he has realization. What is meant by realization? It means knowledge based on
direct perception. In India often the best teachers have no learning, but their character is
so shining that every one learns merely by coming in contact with them. In one of the
Scriptures we read: Under a banyan tree sat a youthful teacher and beside him an aged
disciple. The mind of the disciple was full of doubts and questions, but although the
teacher continued silent, gradually every doubt vanished from the disciple’s mind. This
signifies that the conveying of spiritual teaching does not depend upon words only. It is the
life, the illumination, which counts. Such God–enlightened men, however, cannot easily be
found; but even with such a teacher, the knowledge of the Self cannot be gained unless
the heart of the disciple is open and ready for the Truth. Hence Yama says both teacher
and taught must be wonderful.
VIII
When taught by a man of inferior understanding, this Atman cannot be truly known, even
though frequently thought upon. There is no way (to know It) unless it is taught by another
(an illumined teacher), for it is subtler than the subtle and beyond argument.


<sup>9</sup> O Dearest, this Atman cannot be attained by argument; It is truly known only when taught
by another (a wise teacher). O Nachiketas, thou hast attained It. Thou art fixed in Truth.
May we ever, find a questioner like thee.

Knowledge of the Atman or Self cannot be attained when it is taught by those who
themselves lack in real understanding of It; and who therefore, having no definite
conviction of their own, differ among themselves as to its nature and existence. Only he
who has been able to perceive the Self directly, through the unfoldment of his higher
nature, can proclaim what It actually is; and his words alone carry weight and bring
illumination. It is too subtle to be reached by argument. This secret regarding the Hereafter
cannot be known through reasoning or mere intellectual gymnastics. It is to be attained
only in a state of consciousness which transcends the boundary line of reason.
X
I know that (earthly) treasure is transitory, for the eternal can never be attained by things
which are non–eternal. Hence the Nachiketa fire (sacrifice) has been performed by me
with perishable things and yet I have attained the eternal.
XI
O Nachiketas, thou hast seen the fulfillment of all desires, the basis of the universe, the
endless fruit of sacrificial rites, the other shore where there is no fear, that which is
praiseworthy, the great and wide support; yet, being wise, thou hast rejected all with firm
resolve.
The teacher, saying that the imperishable cannot be attained by the perishable, shows that
no amount of observance of rituals and ceremonies can earn the imperishable and eternal.
Although the Nachiketa fire–sacrifice may bring results which seem eternal to mortals
because of their long duration, yet they too must come to an end; therefore this sacrifice
cannot lead to the final goal. Yama praises Nachiketas because, when all heavenly and
earthly pleasures, as well as knowledge of all realms and their enjoyments were offered
him, yet he cast them aside and remained firm in his desire for Truth alone.
XII
The wise, who by means of the highest meditation on the Self knows the Ancient One,
difficult to perceive, seated in the innermost recess, hidden in the cave of the heart,
dwelling in the depth of inner being, (he who knows that One) as God, is liberated from the
fetters of joy and sorrow.
XIII
A mortal, having heard and fully grasped this, and having realized through discrimination
the subtle Self, rejoices, because he has obtained that which is the source of all joy. I think
the abode (of Truth) is open to Nachiketas.
The Scriptures give three stages in all spiritual attainment. The aspirant must first hear
about the Truth from an enlightened teacher; next he must reflect upon what he has heard;
then by constant practice of discrimination and meditation he realizes it; and with
realization comes the fulfilment of every desire, because it unites him with the source of
all. Having beheld this, a man learns that all sense pleasures are but fragmentary
reflections of that one supreme joy, which can be found in the true Self alone. Yama
assures Nachiketas that there is no doubt of his realizing the Truth, because he has shown
the highest discrimination as well as fixity of purpose.
XIV
Nachiketas said: That which thou seest, which is neither virtue nor vice, neither cause nor
effect, neither past nor future (but beyond these), tell me That.
XV
Yama replied: That goal which all the Vedas glorify, which all austerities proclaim, desiring
which (people) practice Brahmacharya (a life of continence and service), that goal I tell
thee briefly–it is Aum.
What name can man give to God? How can the Infinite be bound by any finite word? All
that language can express must be finite, since it is itself finite. Yet it is very difficult for
mortals to think or speak of anything without calling it by a definite name. Knowing this, the
Sages gave to the Supreme the name A–U–M which stands as the root of all language.
The first letter “A” is the mother–sound, being the natural sound uttered by every creature
when the throat is opened, and no sound can be made without opening the throat. The last
letter “M,” spoken by closing the lips, terminates all articulation. As one carries the sound
from the throat to the lips, it passes through the sound “U.” These three sounds therefore
cover the whole field of possible articulate sound. Their combination is called the Akshara
or the imperishable word, the Sound–Brahman or the Word
God, because it is the most universal name which can be given to the Supreme. Hence it
must be the word which was “in the beginning” and corresponds to the Logos of Christian
theology. It is because of the all–embracing significance of this name that it is used so
universally in the Vedic Scriptures to designate the Absolute.
XVI
This Word is indeed Brahman. This Word is indeed the Supreme. He who knows this Word
obtains whatever he desires.
XVII
This is the best Support, This is the highest Support; he who knows this Support is
glorified in the world of Brahman.
This sacred Word is the highest symbol of the Absolute. He who through meditating on It
grasps Its full significance, realizes the glory of God and at once has all his desires
satisfied, because God is the fulfilment of all desires.
XVIII
This Self is never born, nor does It die. It did not spring from anything, nor did anything
spring from It. This Ancient One is unborn, eternal, everlasting. It is not slain even though
the body is slain.
XIX
If the slayer thinks that he slays, or if the slain thinks that he is slain, both of these know
not. For It neither slays nor is It slain.
XX
The Self is subtler than the subtle, greater than the great; It dwells in the heart of each
living being. He who is free from desire and free from grief, with mind and senses tranquil,
beholds the glory of the Atman.
Although this Atman dwells in the heart of every living being, yet It is not perceived by
ordinary mortals because of Its subtlety. It cannot be perceived by the senses; a finer
spiritual sight is required. The heart must be pure and freed from every unworthy selfish
desire; the thought must be indrawn from all external objects; mind and body must be
under control; when the whole being thus becomes calm and serene, then it is possible to
perceive that effulgent Atman. It is subtler than the subtle, because It is the invisible
essence of every thing; and It is greater than the great because It is the boundless,
sustaining power of the whole universe; that upon which all existence rests.

XXI

Though sitting, It travels far; though lying, It goes everywhere. Who else save me is fit to
know that God, who is (both) joyful and joyless?
The Self is all–pervading, hence It is that which sits still and that which travels, that which
is active and that which is inactive. It is both stationary and moving, and It is the basis of all
forms of existence; therefore whatever exists in the universe, whether joy or joylessness,
pleasure or pain, must spring from It. Who is better able to know God than I myself, since
He resides in my heart and is the very essence of my being? Such should be the attitude
of one who is seeking.

XXII
The wise who know the Self, bodiless, seated within perishable bodies, great and all–
pervading, grieve not.
Then a wise man through the practice of discrimination has seen clearly the distinction
between body and Soul, he knows that his true Self is not the body, though It dwells in the
body. Thus realizing the indestructible, all–pervading nature of his real Self, he surmounts
all fear of death or loss, and is not moved even by the greatest sorrow.

XXIII
This Self cannot be attained by study of the Scriptures, nor by intellectual perception, nor
by frequent hearing (of It); He whom the Self chooses, by him alone is It attained. To him
the Self reveals Its true nature.
We may imagine that by much study we can find out God; but merely hearing about a
thing and gaining an intellectual comprehension of it does not mean attaining true
knowledge of it. Knowledge only comes through direct perception, and direct perception of
God is possible for those alone who are pure in heart and spiritually awakened. Although
He is alike to all beings and His mercy is on all, yet the impure and worldy–minded do not
get the blessing, because they do not know how to open their hearts to it. He who longs for
God, him the Lord chooses; because to him alone can He reveal His true nature.

XXIV
He who has not turned away from evil conduct, whose senses are uncontrolled, who is not
tranquil, whose mind is not at rest, he can never attain this Atman even by knowledge.
Yama having first described what the Atman is, now tells us how to attain It. man must try
to subdue his lower nature and gain control over the body and senses. e must conquer the
impure selfish desires which now disturb the serenity of his mind, that it may grow calm
and peaceful. In other words, he must live the life and develop all spiritual qualities in order
to perceive the Atman.

XXV
Who then can know where is this mighty Self? He (that Self) to whom the Brahmanas and
Kshatriyas are but food and death itself a condiment.
This text proclaims the glory and majesty of the Supreme. The Brahmanas stand for
spiritual strength, the Kshatriyas for physical strength, yet both are overpowered by His
mightiness. Life and death alike are food for Him. As the light of the great sun swallows up
all the lesser lights of the universe, similarly all worlds are lost in the effulgence of the
Eternal Omnipresent Being.
