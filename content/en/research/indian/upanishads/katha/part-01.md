Part First
I
Vahasrava, being desirous of heavenly rewards (at the Viswajit sacrifice), made a gift of all
that he possessed. He had a son by the name of Nachiketas.
II

When the offerings were being distributed, faith (Shraddha) entered (the heart
of)Nachiketas, who, though young, yet resected:

III
These cows have drunk water, eaten grass and given milk for the last time, and their
senses have lost all vigour. He who gives these undoubtedly goes to joyless realms.
In India the idea of sacrifice has always been to give freely for the joy of giving, without
asking anything in return; and the whole purpose and merit of the sacrifice is lost, if the
giver entertains the least thought of name, fame or individual benefit. The special Viswajit
sacrifice which Vajasrava was making required of him to give away all that he possessed.
When, however, the gifts were brought forward to be offered, his son Nachiketas, although
probably a lad about twelve years of age, observed how worthless were the animals which
his father was offering. His heart at once became filled with Shraddha. There is no one
English word which can convey the meaning of this Sanskrit term. It is more than mere
faith. It also implies self–reliance, an independent sense of right and wrong, and the
courage of one’s own conviction. As a boy of tender age, Nachiketas had no right to
question his father’s action; yet, impelled by the sudden awakening of his higher nature, he
could not but reflect: “By merely giving these useless cows, my father cannot gain any
merit. If he has vowed to give all his possessions, then he must also give me. Otherwise
his sacrifice will not be complete and fruitful.” Therefore, anxious for his father’s welfare,
he approached him gently and reverently.

IV
He said to his father: Dear father, to whom wilt thou give me? He said it a second time,
then a third time. The father replied: I shall give thee unto Death.
Nachiketas, being a dutiful son and eager to atone for his father’s inadequate sacrifice,
tried to remind him thus indirectly that he had not fulfilled his promise to give away all his
possessions, since he had not yet offered his own son, who would be a worthier gift than
useless cattle. His father, conscious that he was not making a true sacrifice, tried to ignore
the boy’s questions; but irritated by his persistence, he at last impatiently made answer: “I
give thee to Yama, the Lord of Death.” The fact that anger could so quickly rise in his heart
proved that he had not the proper attitude of a sacrificer, who must always be tranquil,
uplifted and free from egoism.
V
Nachiketas thought: Among many (of my father’s pupils) I stand first; among many (others)
I stand in the middle (but never last). What will be accomplished for my father by my going
this day to Yama?
It was not conceit which led Nachiketas to consider his own standing and importance. He
was weighing his value as a son and pupil in order to be able to judge whether or not he
had merit enough to prove a worthy gift. Although he realized that his father’s harsh reply
was only the expression of a momentary outburst of anger; yet he believed that greater
harm might befall his father, if his word was not kept. Therefore he sought to strengthen
his father’s resolution by reminding him of the transitory condition of life. He said:
VI
Look back to those who lived before and look to those who live now. Like grain the mortal
decays and like grain again springs up (is reborn).
All things perish, Truth alone remains. Why then fear to sacrifice me also; Thus Nachiketas
convinced his father that he should remain true to his word and send him to Yama, the
Ruler of Death. Then Nachiketas went to the abode of Death, but Yama was absent and
the boy waited without food or drink for three days. On Yama’s return one of his household
said to him:

VII
Like fire a Brahmana guest enters into houses. That fire is quenched by an offering.
(Therefore) O Vaivaswata, bring water.

VIII
The foolish man in whose house a Brahmana guest remains without food, all his hopes
and expectations, all the merit gained by his association with the holy, by his good words
and deeds, all his sons and cattle, are destroyed.

According to the ancient Vedic ideal a guest is the representative of God and should be
received with due reverence and honor. Especially is this the case with a Brahmana or a
Sannyasin whose life is wholly consecrated to God. Any one who fails to give proper care
to a holy guest brings misfortune on himself and his household. When Yama returned,
therefore, one of the members of his household anxiously informed him of Nachiketas’
presence and begged him to bring water to wash his feet, this being always the first
service to an arriving guest.

IX
Yama said: O Brahmana! Revered guest! My salutations to thee. As thou hast remained
three nights in my house without food, therefore choose three boons, O Brahmana.

X
Nachiketas said: May Gautama, my father, be free from anxious thought (about me). May
he lose all anger (towards me) and be pacified in heart. May he know and welcome me
when I am sent back by thee. This, O Death, is the first of the three boons I choose.

XI
Yama replied: Through my will Auddalaki Aruni (thy father) will know thee, and be again
towards thee as before. He will sleep in peace at night. He will be free from wrath when he
sees thee released from the mouth of death.
XII
Nachiketas said: In the realm of heaven there is no fear, thou (Death) art not there; nor is
there fear of old age. Having crossed beyond both hunger and thirst and being above grief,
(they) rejoice in heaven.
XIII
Thou knowest, O Death, the fire–sacrifice that leads to heaven. Tell this to me, who am full
of Shraddha (faith and yearning). They who live in the realm of heaven enjoy freedom from
death. This I beg as my second boon.
XIV
Yama replied: I know well that fire which leads to the realm of heaven. I shall tell it to thee.
Listen to me. Know, O Nachiketas, that this is the means of attaining endless worlds and
their support. It is hidden in the heart of all beings.
XV
Yama then told him that fire–sacrifice, the beginning of all the worlds; what bricks, how
many and how laid for the altar. Nachiketas repeated all as it was told to him. Then Death,
being pleased with him, again said:
XVI
The great–soured Yama, being well pleased, said to him (Nachiketas): I give thee now
another boon. This fire (sacrifice) shall be named after thee. Take also this garland of
many colours.
XVII
He who performs this Nachiketa fire–sacrifice three times, being united with the three
(mother, father and teacher), and who fulfills the three–fold duty (study of the Vedas,
sacrifice and alms–giving) crosses over birth and death. Knowing this worshipful shining
fire, born of Brahman, and realizing Him, he attains eternal peace.
XVIII
He who knows the three–fold Nachiketa fire and performs the Nachiketa fire–sacrifice with
three–fold knowledge, having cast off the fetters of death and being beyond grief, he
rejoices in the realm of heaven.

XIX
O Nachiketas, this is thy fire that leads to heaven, which thou hast chosen as thy second
boon. People will call this fire after thy name. Ask the third boon, Nachiketas.
Fire is regarded as “the foundation of all the worlds,” because it is the revealer of creation.
If there were no fire or light, no manifested form would be visible. We read in the Semitic
Scriptures, “In the beginning the Lord said, ‘Let there be light.”‘ Therefore, that which
stands in the external universe as one of the purest symbols of the Divine, also dwells in
subtle form in the heart of every living being as the vital energy, the life–force or cause of
existence.

Yama now tells Nachiketas how, by performing sacrifice with the three–fold knowledge, he
may transcend grief and death and reach heaven. The three–fold knowledge referred to is
regarding the preparation of the altar and fire. Nachiketas being eager to learn, listened
with wholehearted attention and was able to repeat all that was told him. This so pleased
Yama that he granted him the extra boon of naming the fire–sacrifice after him and gave
him a garland set with precious stones.
Verses XVI–XVIII are regarded by many as an interpolation, which would account for
certain obscurities and repetitions in them.
XX
Nachiketas said: There is this doubt regarding what becomes of a man after death. Some
say he exists, others that he does not exist. This knowledge I desire, being instructed by
thee. Of the boons this is the third boon.
XXI
Yama replied: Even the Devas (Bright Ones) of old doubted regarding this. It is not easy to
know; subtle indeed is this subject. O Nachiketas, choose another boon. Do not press me.
Ask not this boon of me.
XXII
Nachiketas said: O Death, thou sayest that even the Devas had doubts about this, and
that it is not easy to know. Another teacher like unto thee is not to be found. Therefore no
other boon can be equal to this one.
XXIII
Yama said: Ask for sons and grandsons who shall live a hundred years, many cattle,
elephants, gold and horses. Ask for lands of vast extent and live thyself as many autumns
as thou desirest.
XXIV
If thou thinkest of any other boon equal to this, ask for wealth and long life; be ruler over
the wide earth. O Nachiketas, I shall make thee enjoyer of all desires.
XXV
Whatsoever objects of desire are difficult to obtain in the realm of mortals, ask them all as
thou desirest; these lovely maidens with their chariots and musical instruments, such as
are not obtainable by mortals–be served by these whom I give to thee. O Nachiketas, do
not ask regarding death.
The third boon asked by Nachiketas concerning the great Hereafter was one which could
be granted only to those who were freed from all mortal desires and limitations, therefore
Yama first tested Nachiketas to see whether he was ready to receive such knowledge. “Do
not press me regarding this secret,” he said. “Even wise men cannot understand it and
thou art a mere lad. Take, rather, long life, wealth, whatever will give thee happiness on
the mortal plane.” But the boy proved his strength and worthiness by remaining firm in his
resolution to know the great secret of life and death.
XXVI
Nachiketas said: O Death, these are fleeting; they weaken the vigour of all the senses in
man. Even the longest life is short. Keep thou thy chariots, dance and music.
XXVII
Man cannot be satisfied by wealth. Shall we possess wealth when we see thee (Death)?
Shall we continue to live as long as thou rulest? Therefore that boon alone is to be chosen
by me.
XXVIII
What man dwelling on the decaying mortal plane, having approached the undecaying
immortal one, and having reflected upon the nature of enjoyment through beauty and
sense pleasure, would delight in long life?
XXIX
O Death, that regarding which there is doubt, of the great Hereafter, tell us. Nachiketas
asks for no other boon than that which penetrates this hidden secret.
