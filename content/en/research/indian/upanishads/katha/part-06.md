This ancient Aswattha tree has its root above and branches below. That is pure, That is
Brahman, That alone is called the Immortal. All the worlds rest in That. None goes beyond
That. This verily is That.
This verse indicates the origin of the tree of creation (the Samsara–Vriksha), which is
rooted above in Brahman, the Supreme, and sends its branches downward into the
phenomenal world. Heat and cold, pleasure and pain, birth and death, and all the shifting
conditions of the mortal realm–these are the branches; but the origin of the tree, the
Brahman, is eternally pure, unchanging, free and deathless. From the highest angelic form
to the minutest atom, all created things have their origin in Him. He is the foundation of the
universe. There is nothing beyond Him.


II
Whatever there is in the universe is evolved from Prana and vibrates in Prana. That is a
mighty terror, like an upraised thunderbolt. They who know That become immortal.
III
From fear of Him the fire burns, from fear of Him the sun shines. From fear of Him Indra
and Vayu and Death, the fifth, speed forth.
Just as the body cannot live or act without the Soul, similarly nothing in the created world
can exist independent of Brahman, who is the basis of all existence. His position is like
that of a king whom all must obey; hence it is said that the gods of sun, moon, wind, rain,
do His bidding. He is likened to an upraised thunderbolt, because of the impartial and
inevitable nature of His law, which all powers, great or small, must obey absolutely.
IV
If a man is not able to know Him before the dissolution of the body, then he becomes
embodied again in the created worlds.
As soon as a man acquires knowledge of the Supreme, he is liberated; but if he fails to
attain such knowledge before his Soul is separated from the body, then he must take other
bodies and return again and again to this realm of birth and death, until through varied
experience he realizes the nature of the Supreme and his relation to Him.
V
As in a mirror, so is He seen within oneself; as in a dream, so (is He seen) in the world of
the fathers (departed spirits); as in water, so (is He seen) in the world of Gandharvas (the
angelic realm). As light and shadow, so (is He seen) in the world of Brahma (the Creator).
When by means of a purified understanding one beholds God within, the image is distinct
as in a polished mirror; but one cannot have clear vision of the Supreme by attaining to the
various realms known as heavens, where one reaps the fruit of his good deeds. It is only
by developing one’s highest consciousness here in this life that perfect God–vision can be
attained.
VI
Knowing that the senses are distinct (from the Atman) and their rising and setting separate
(from the Atman), a wise man grieves no more.
A wise man never confounds the Atman, which is birthless and deathless, with that which
has beginning and end. Therefore, when he sees his senses and his physical organism
waxing and waning, he knows that his real Self within can never be affected by these outer
changes, so he remains unmoved.
VII
Higher than the senses is the mind, higher than the mind is the intellect, higher than the
intellect is the great Atman, higher than the Atman is the Unmanifested.
VIII
Beyond the Unmanifested is the all–pervading and imperceptible Being (Purusha). By
knowing Him, the mortal is liberated and attains immortality.
This division of the individual into senses, mind, intellect, self–consciousness,
undifferentiated creative energy and the Absolute Self is explained in the commentary of
verse XI, Part Third.
IX
His form is not to be seen. No one can see Him with the eye. He is perceived by the heart,
by the intellect and by the mind. They who know this become immortal.
The Supreme, being formless, cannot be discerned by the senses, hence all knowledge of
Him must be acquired by the subtler faculties of heart, intellect and mind, which are
developed only through the purifying practice of meditation.
X
When the five organs of perception become still, together with the mind, and the intellect
ceases to be active: that is called the highest state.
The teacher now shows Nachiketas the process by which the transcendental vision can be
attained. he out–going senses,–seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting; the restless
mind and the intellect: all must be indrawn and quieted. The state of equilibrium thus
attained is called the highest state, because all the forces of one’s being become united
and focused; and this inevitably leads to supersensuous vision.
XI
This firm holding back of the senses is what is known as Yoga. Then one should become
watchful, for Yoga comes and goes.
Yoga literally means to join or to unite the lower self with the Higher Self, the object with
the subject, the worshipper with God. In order to gain this union, however, one must first
disunite oneself from all that scatters the physical, mental and intellectual forces; so the
outgoing perceptions must be detached from the external world and indrawn. When this is
accomplished through constant practice of concentration and meditation, the union takes
place of its own accord. But it may be lost again, unless one is watchful.
XII
He cannot be attained by speech, by mind, or by the eye. How can That be realized except
by him who says “He is”?
XIII
He should be realized as “He is” and also as the reality of both (visible and invisible). He
who knows Him as “He is,” to him alone His real nature is revealed.
This supersensuous vision cannot be gained through man’s ordinary faculties. By mind,
eye, or speech the manifested attributes of the Divine can be apprehended; but only one
who has acquired the supersensuous sight can directly perceive God’s existence and
declare definitely that “He is,” that He alone exists in both the visible and the invisible
world.
XIV
When all desires dwelling in the heart cease, then the mortal becomes immortal and
attains Brahman here.
XV
When all the ties of the heart are cut asunder here, then the mortal becomes immortal.
Such is the teaching.
XVI
There are a hundred and one nerves of the heart. One of them penetrates the centre of
the head. Going upward through it, one attains immortality. The other (hundred nerve–
courses) lead, in departing, to different worlds.
The nervous system of the body provides the channels through which the mind travels; the
direction in which it moves is determined by its desires and tendencies. When the mind
becomes pure and desireless, it takes the upward course and at the time of departing
passes out through the imperceptible opening at the crown of the head; but as long as it
remains full of desires, its course is downward towards the realms where those desires
can be satisfied.
XVII
The Purusha, the inner Self, of the size of a thumb, is ever seated in the heart of all living
beings. With perseverance man should draw Him out from his body as one draws the inner
stalk from a blade of grass. One should know Him as pure and deathless, as pure and
deathless.
As has been explained in Part Fourth, verse XII, the inner Self, although unlimited, is
described as “the size of a thumb” because of its abiding–place in the heart, often likened
to a lotus–bud which is similar to a thumb in size and shape. Through the process of
steadfast discrimination, one should learn to differentiate the Soul from the body, just as
one separates the pith from a reed.
XVIII
Thus Nachiketas, having acquired this wisdom taught by the Ruler of Death, together with
all the rules of Yoga, became free from impurity and death and attained Brahman (the
Supreme). So also will it be with another who likewise knows the nature of the Self.

PEACE CHANT
May He (the Supreme Being) protect us both. May He be pleased with us. May we acquire
strength. May our study bring us illumination. May there be no enmity among us.
