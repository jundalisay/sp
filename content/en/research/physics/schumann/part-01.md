It deals with the non-radiating natural frequencies of a conducting sphere for E-waves, which is surrounded by a relatively thin spherical air layer that in turn borders a homogeneous plasma atmosphere without shock absorption. 

The lowest eigenfrequency of undamped oscillations wei lies between zero and wei=c/r, depending on the relative thickness of the air layer and the plasma eigenfrequency w0.

For Earth-sized dimensions, this corresponds to an upper frequency limit of about 11 Hz. 

A lowest eigenfrequency of the same order of magnitude, wei... , would occur if a dielectric sphere with dielectric constant ED were immediately surrounded by a plasma shell instead of the ionosphere. For all undamped eigenfrequencies 

, i.e., the dielectric constant of the surrounding plasma is negative. There are infinitely many eigenfrequencies in the frequency range from 

 , which cluster strongly near the upper limit. Near the lower boundary, if 

  (which is the case for Earth), 

The higher the mode number of the eigenfrequency, the deeper it penetrates the plasma atmosphere. While the low eigenfrequencies are almost completely reflected at the plasma boundary, higher eigenfrequencies with an order of magnitude of 20 dB attenuation per Earth radius (depending on plasma parameters) can be radiated outward and become damped eigenmodes. The damping increases with distance and also when 

 , i.e., the plasma shell becomes thinner toward the air layer. The damping of the ionosphere is determined by the size of 

 τ (τ is the electron collision time). For the ionosphere, the value of 

 τ>1 typically results, so the dielectric constant is given by:



The dielectric constant plays no role in the propagation here, and the plasma behaves like a poor conductor. Unfortunately, the collision times are still relatively unknown, so more precise quantitative conclusions cannot yet be made. The eigenfrequencies are approximately given by

 
and experience significant damping from losses in the plasma. This damping must be considered in practical applications.

Meteorological Questions, the "Atmospheric" and Biological Interests:

These are concerned with the eigenfrequencies, e.g., of the Earth with its air envelope and the surrounding Heaviside layer (i.e., the ionosphere). The natural oscillations of spheres with radius 

a in a plasma atmosphere—i.e., with only an air layer in between—have been investigated earlier.

It was found that dielectric spheres with relative dielectric constant 

in a plasma atmosphere can exhibit undamped oscillations without shock damping, the lowest eigenfrequency

Here,

 ) becomes small, and for increasing 

  (with increasing  ), the fields fall off more sharply with distance outside, so the radiation only interacts with the plasma shell close to the sphere.

For a plasma shell that is in a plasma atmosphere, undamped oscillations occur only when the electron density of the shell is larger than that of the sphere. Then 

  (apart from the existing damping by the plasma itself). The eigenfrequencies lie between these two plasma eigenfrequencies


and the lowest is approximately


In contrast, it was found that conducting spheres (

χ→∞) in a plasma atmosphere can only support damped oscillations due to radiation losses. In the case of “thin” plasma, 

<c/a, the eigenfrequencies and damping behave not much differently from those for a sphere in air. However, for “thick” plasma, 

 >c/a, the lowest eigenfrequency is approximately 

 , so for large spheres, it is significantly higher than in the air


and the damping


is very small if 

  is sufficiently large, i.e., smaller than in air (

In the following, the case is discussed where a conducting sphere (

χ→∞) is surrounded by a finite air shell and then an infinitely extended plasma shell (see Fig. 1). It will be shown that the fields in the plasma shell fall off so quickly that no eigenfrequencies occur if the plasma shell does not extend to the boundary. Just as with the Earth, a finite air shell exists, which is much smaller than
