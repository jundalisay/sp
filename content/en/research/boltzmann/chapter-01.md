The relationship between the second fundamental theorem and calculations of probability became
clear for the first time when I demonstrated that the theorem‚Äôs analytical proof is only possible on the
basis of probability calculations. (I refer to my publication ‚ÄúAnalytical proof of the second fundamental
theorem of the mechanical theory of heat derived from the laws of equilibrium for kinetic energy‚Äù Wien.Entropy 2015, 17
1975 Ber. 63, p8 reprinted as Wiss. Abhand. Vol I, reprint 20, pp295 1 and also my ‚ÄúRemarks about several
problems in the mechanical theory of heat‚Äù; 3rd paragraph, Wiss. Abhand. Vol II, reprint 39. 

This
relationship is also confirmed by demonstrating that an exact proof of the fundamental theorems of
the equilibrium of heat is most easily obtained if one demonstrates that a certain quantity‚Äîwhich I
wish to define again as E 2 ‚Äîhas to decrease as a result of the exchange of the kinetic energy among
the gaseous molecules and therefore reaching its minimum value for the state of the equilibrium of
heat. (Compare my ‚ÄúAdditional studies about the equilibrium of heat among gaseous molecules‚Äù Wiss.
Abhand. Vol I, reprint 22, p316). The relationship between the second fundamental theorem and the
laws of the equilibrium of heat is made even more compelling in light of the developments in the second
paragraph of my ‚ÄúRemarks about several problems of the mechanical theory of heat‚Äù. There I mentioned
for the first time the possibility of a very unique way of calculating the equilibrium of heat using the
following formulation: ‚ÄúIt is clear that every single uniform state distribution which establishes itself
after a certain time given a defined initial state is equally as probable as every single nonuniform state
distribution, comparable to the situation in the game of Lotto where every single quintet is as improbable
as the quintet 12345. The higher probability that the state distribution becomes uniform with time arises
only because there are far more uniform than nonuniform state distributions‚Äù; furthermore: ‚ÄúIt is even
possible to calculate the probabilities from the relationships of the number of different state distributions.
This approach would perhaps lead to an interesting method for the calculation of the equilibrium of heat.‚Äù
It is thereby indicated that it is possible to calculate the state of the equilibrium of heat by finding the
probability of the different possible states of the system. The initial state in most cases is bound to
be highly improbable and from it the system will always rapidly approach a more probable state until
it finally reaches the most probable state, i.e., that of the heat equilibrium. If we apply this to the
second basic theorem we will be able to identify that quantity which is usually called entropy with the
probability of the particular state. Let‚Äôs assume a system of bodies which are in a state of isolation with
no interaction with other bodies, e.g., one body with higher and one with lower temperature and one
so called intermediate body which accomplishes the heat transfer between the two bodies; or choosing
another example by assuming a vessel with absolutely even and rigid walls one half of which is filled
with air of low temperature and pressure whereas the other half is filled with air of high temperature
and pressure. The hypothetical system of particles is assumed to have a certain state at time zero.
Through the interaction between the particles the state is changed. According to the second fundamental
theorem, this change has to take place in such a way that the total entropy of the particles increases.
This means according to our present interpretation that nothing changes except that the probability of
the overall state for all particles will get larger and larger. The system of particles always changes from
an improbable to a probable state. It will become clear later what this means. After the publication of
my last treatise regarding this topic the same idea was taken up and developed further by Mr. Oskar
Emil Meyer totally independent of me {Die kinetische Theorie der Gase; Breslau 1877, Seite 262}. He
attempts to interpret, in the described manner, the equations of my continued studies concerning the

equilibrium of heat particles. However, the line of reasoning of Mr. Meyer remained entirely unclear to
me and I will return to my concerns with his approach on page 172 (Wiss. Abhand. Vol II).
We have to take here a totally different approach because it is our main purpose not to limit our
discussion to thermal equilibrium, but to explore the relationship of this probabilistic formulation to the
second theorem of the mechanical theory of heat. We want first to solve the problem which I referred
to above and already defined in my ‚ÄúRemarks on some problems of the mechanical theory of heat‚Äù 3 ,
namely to calculate the probability of state distributions from the number of different distributions.
We want first to treat as simple a case as possible, namely a gas of rigid absolutely elastic spherical
molecules trapped in a container with absolutely elastic walls. (Which interact with central forces only
within a certain small distance, but not otherwise; the latter assumption, which includes the former
as a special case, does not change the calculations in the least). Even in this case, the application of
probability theory is not easy. The number of molecules is not infinite, in a mathematical sense, yet
the number of velocities each molecule is capable of is effectively infinite. Given this last condition,
the calculations are very difficult; to facilitate understanding, I will, as in earlier work, consider a
limiting case.
I. Kinetic Energy Has Discrete Values
We assume initially, each molecule is only capable of assuming a finite number of velocities, such as
p
1 2 3
0, , , , . . . ,
q q q
q
where p and q are arbitrary finite numbers. Upon colliding, two molecules may exchange velocities, but
after the collision both molecules still have one of the above velocities, namely
2
p
1
0, or , or , etc. till ,
q
q
q
This assumption does not correspond to any realistic mechanical model, but it is easier to handle
mathematically, and the actual problem to be solved is re-established by letting p and q go to infinity.
Even if, at first sight, this seems a very abstract way of treating the problem, it rapidly leads to the
desired objective, and when you consider that in nature all infinities are but limiting cases, one assumes
each molecule can behave in this fashion only in the limiting case where each molecule can assume more
and more values of the velocity.
To continue, however, we will consider the kinetic energy, rather than the velocity of the molecules.
Each molecule can have only a finite number of values for its kinetic energy. As a further simplification,
we assume that the kinetic energies of each molecule form an arithmetic progression, such as
the following:
0, , 2, 3, . . . p
3


`P` is the largest possible value of the kinetic energy, p Before impact, each of two colliding
molecules shall have a kinetic energy of 0, or , or 2, etc. . . . p
which means that after the collision, each molecule still has one of the above values of kinetic energy.

The number of molecules in the vessel is n. 

If we know how many of these n molecules have a kinetic energy of zero, how many have a kinetic energy of  and so on, then we know the kinetic energy
distribution. If at the beginning there is some state distribution among the gas molecules, this will in
general be changed by the collisions. The laws governing this change have already been the subject of
my previous investigations. 

I want to:
- establish the probability of a state distribution regardless of how it is created
- find all possible combinations of the p+1 kinetic energy values allowed to each of the n molecules and then establish how many of these combinations correspond to each state distribution. 

The latter number then determines the likelihood of the relevant state distribution, as I have already stated in my published


As a preliminary, we will use a simpler schematic approach to the problem, instead of the exact case. 

Suppose we have n molecules. Each of them is capable of having kinetic energy
0, , 2, 3, . . . p.
and suppose these energies are distributed in all possible ways among the n molecules, such that the
total energy is a constant, e.g., Œª = L. 

Any such distribution, in which the first molecule may have a kinetic energy of e.g., 2, the second may have 6, and so on, up to the last molecule, we call a
complexion.

Each individual complexion can be easily enumerated by writing them in sequence (for convenience we divide through by ), specifying the kinetic energy of each molecule. 

We seek the number P of complexions where w0 molecules have kinetic energy 0, w1 molecules have kinetic energy
, w2 have kinetic energy 2, up to the wp which have kinetic energy p. We said, earlier, that given
how many molecules have kinetic energy 0, how many have kinetic energy  , etc., this distribution
among the molecules specifies the number of P of complexions for that distribution; in other words,
it determines the likelihood of that state distribution. Dividing the number P by the number of all
possible complexions, we get the probability of the state distribution. Since a distribution of states does
not determine kinetic energies exactly, the goal is to describe the state distribution by writing as many
zeros as molecules with zero kinetic energy (w0 ), w1 ones for those with kinetic energy  etc. All these
zeros, ones, etc. are the elements defining the state distribution. It is now immediately clear that the
number P for each state distribution is exactly the same as the number of permutations of which the
elements of the state distribution are capable, and that is why the number P is the desired measure of
the permutability of the corresponding distribution of states. Once we have specified every possible
complexion, we have also all possible state distributions, the latter differing from the former only by
immaterial permutations of molecular labels. All those complexions which contain the same number
of zeros, the same number of ones etc., differing from each other merely by different arrangements of
elements, will result in the same state distribution; the number of complexions forming the same state
distribution, and which we have denoted by P, must be equal to the number of permutations which the elements of the state distribution are capable of. In order to give a simple numerical example, take n = 7, Œª = 7, p = 7, so L = 7, P = 7. 

With 7 molecules, there are 8 possible values for the
kinetic energy, 0, , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 to distribute in any possible way such that the total kinetic energy
= 7. There are then 15 possible state distributions. We enumerate each of them in the above manner,
producing the numbers listed in the second column of the following table of state distributions. The
numbers in the first column label the different state distributions.

The state distributions are so arranged that, read as a number, the rows are arranged in increasing order.

In the last column, under the heading P is the number of possible permutations of members for
each state. The first state distribution, for example, has 6 molecules with zero kinetic energy, and
the seventh has kinetic energy 7. 

So w0 = 6, w7 = 1, w2 = w3 = w4 = w5 = w6 = 0.
It is immaterial which molecule has kinetic energy 7. So there are 7 possible complexions which
represent this state distribution. Denoting the sum of all possible complexions, 1716, by J then the
probability of the first state distribution is 7/J; similarly, the probability of the second state distribution
is 42/J; the most probable state distribution is the tenth, as its elements permit the greatest number of
permutations. 

Hereon, we call the number of permutations the relative likelihood of the state distribution;
this can be defined in a different way, which we next illustrate with a specific numerical example, since
generalization is straightforward. Suppose we have an urn containing an infinite number of paper slips.
On each slip is one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7; each number is on the same amount of slips, and
has the same probability of being picked. We now draw the first septet of slips, and note the numbers on
them. 

This septet provides a sample state distribution with a kinetic energy of  times the number written on the first slip for molecule 1, and so forth. We return the slips to the urn, and draw a second septet which gives us a second state distribution, etc. After we draw a very large number of septets, we reject all those for which the total does not equal 7. This still leaves a large number of septets. Since each number has the same probability of occurrence, and the same elements in a different order form different complexions, each possible complexion will occur equally often. By ordering the numbers within each septet by size, we can classify each into one of the fifteen cases tabulated above. So the number of septets which fall into the class 0000007 relative to the 0000016 class will be 7:42. Similarly for all the other septets. The most likely state distribution is the one which produces the most septets, namely the 10th.

(LB footnote: 4 If we divide the number of septets corresponding to a particular state by the total number of septets, we obtain the probability distribution. Instead of discarding all septets whose total is not 7 we could, after drawing a slip remove from the urn all those other slips for which a total of 7 is now impossible, e.g., on drawing a slip with 6 on it, all other slips except those with 0 or 1 would be removed. If the first 6 slips all had 0 on them, only slips with 7 on them would be left in the urn. One more thing should be noted at this point: We construct all possible complexions. If we denote by wÃÑ0 the arithmetic mean of all values of w0 which belong to the different complexions, and form analogous expressions wÃÑ1 , wÃÑ2 . . . , in the limit these quantities would also form the same state distribution.)

The first task is to determine the permutation number, previously designated by P, for any state
distribution. Denoting by J the sum of the permutations P for all possible state distributions, the quotient
P/J is the state distribution‚Äôs probability, henceforth denoted by W . We would first like to calculate
the permutations P for the state distribution characterized by w0 molecules with kinetic energy 0, w1
molecules with kinetic energy , etc. 

w0 + w1 + w2 + . . . + wp = n(1)
w1 + 2w2 + 3w3 + . . . + pwp = Œª(2)

This is because the total number of molecules is n, and the total kinetic energy is Œª = L. Describing the state
distribution as before, a complexion has w0 molecules with zero energy, w1 with one unit, and so on.
The permutations, P, arise since of the n elements w0 are mutually identical. Similarly with the w1 , w2 ,
etc. elements. The total number of permutations is well known

<!-- P=
n!
w0 !w1 ! . . .

The most likely state distribution will be for those w0 , w1 . . . values for which P is a maximum or
since the numerator is a constant, for which the denominator is a minimum. The values w0 , w1 must
simultaneously satisfy the two constraints (1) and (2). Since the denominator of P is a product, it is
easiest to determine the minimum of its logarithm, that is the minimum of
M = ln[(w0 !] + ln[(w1 ]! . . .
(4)
here ln is the natural logarithm5 . It is natural in our problem that only integer values of w0 , w1 . . . are
meaningful. However to apply differential calculus, we will allow non-integer values, and so find the
minimum of the expression

M1 = ln Œì(w0 + 1) + ln Œì(w1 + 1) + . . .

which is identical to (4) for integer values of w0 , w1 . . .. We then get the non-integer values which for
constraints (1) and (2) maximize M1 6 . The solution to the problem will in any case be obtained if for
w0 , w1 , etc. we select the closest set of integer values. If here and there a deviation of a few integers is
required, the nearest complexion is easily found. The minimum of M1 is found by adding to both sides
of the equation for M1 Equation (1) multiplied by the constant h, and Equation (2) multiplied by the
constant k, and setting the partial derivatives with respect to each of the variables w0 , w1 , w2 . . . to zero.
We thus obtain the following equations:

Exact solution of the problem through evaluation of the gamma function integral is very difficult;
fortunately the general solution for arbitrary finite values of p and n does not interest us here, but only the
solution for the limiting case of larger and larger number of molecules. Then the numbers w0 , w1 , w2 etc.
become larger and larger, so we introduce the function œÜ(x) = ln Œì(x + 1) ‚àí x(ln x ‚àí 1) ‚àí 21 ln 2œÄ 7 .
