Even if we achieve gigantic successes in our work, there is no reason to feel conceited and arrogant. Modesty helps one to go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind. This is a truth we must always bear in mind.

With victory, certain moods may grow within the Party - arrogance, the airs of a self-styled hero, inertia and unwillingness to make progress, love of pleasure and distaste for continued hard living. 

With victory, the people will be grateful to us and the bourgeoisie will come forward to flatter us. It has been proved that the enemy cannot conquer us by force of arms. 

However, the flattery of the bourgeoisie may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks. 

There may be some Communists, who were not conquered by enemies with guns and were worthy of the name of heroes for standing up to these enemies, but who cannot withstand sugar-coated bullets; they will be defeated by sugar-coated bullets. We must guard against such a situation.

Many things may become baggage, may become encumbrances if we cling to them blindly and uncritically. Let us take some illustrations. 

Having made mistakes, you may feel that you are saddled with them and so become dispirited.

If you have not made mistakes, you may feel that you are free from error and so become conceited. Lack of achievement in work may breed pessimism and depression, while achievement may breed pride and arrogance. 
- A comrade with a short record of struggle may shirk responsibility on this account
- A veteran may become opinionated because of his long record of struggle.
- Worker and peasant comrades, because of pride in their class origin, may look down upon intellectuals
- Intellectuals, because they have a certain amount of knowledge, may look down on worker and peasant comrades. 

Any specialized skill may becapitalized on and so may lead to arrogance and contempt of others. 

Even one's age may become ground for conceit. The young, because they are bright and capable, may look down upon the old; and the old, because they are rich in experience, may look down upon the young.

All such things become encumbrances or baggage if there is no critical awareness.

Some comrades in the army have become arrogant and high-handed in their behaviour towards the soldiers, the people, the government and the Party.

They always:
- blame the comrades doing local work but never themselves
- see their own achievements but never their own shortcomings
- welcome flattery but never criticismâ€¦ 

The army must endeavour to eradicate these faults.

Hard work is like a load placed before us, challenging us to shoulder it. Some loads are light, some heavy. 

Some people prefer the light to the heavy; they pick the light and shove the heavy on to others. That is not a good attitude.

Some comrades are different. They leave ease and comfort to others and take the heavy loads themselves. They are the first to bear hardships the last to enjoy comforts. They are good comrades. 

We should all learn from their communist spirit.

There are not a few people who are irresponsible in their work, preferring the light to the heavy, shoving the heavy loads on to others and choosing the easy ones for themselves. At every turn they think of themselves before others.

When they make some small contribution, they swell with pride and brag about it for fear that others will not know. They feel no warmth towards comrades and the people but are cold, indifferent and apathetic. In fact such people are not Communists, or at least cannot be counted as true Communists.

Those who assert this kind of "independence" are usually wedded to the doctrine of "me first" and are generally wrong on the question of therelationship between the individual and the Party. 

Although in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice they put themselves first and the Party second. What are these people after? They are after fame and position and want to be in the limelight. 

Whenever they are put in charge of a branch of work, they assert their "independence". 

With this aim, they draw some people in, push others out and resort to boasting, flattery and touting among-the comrades, thus importing the vulgar style of the bourgeois political parties into the Communist Party. 

It is their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief. I believe we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is absolutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world.

Communists must grasp the principle of subordinating the needs of the part to the needs of the whole. If a proposal appears feasible for a partial situation but not for the situation as a whole, then the part must give way to the whole. 

Conversely, if the proposal is not feasible for the part but is feasible in the light of the situation as a whole, again the part must give way to the whole. This is what is meant by considering the situation as a whole.

### Pleasure-seeking

In the Red Army there are also quite a few people whose individualism finds expression in pleasure-seeking. They always hope that their unit will march into big cities. They want to go there not to work but to enjoy themselves. The last thing they want is to work in the Red areas where life is hard.

We must oppose the tendency towards selfish departmentalism by which the interests of one's own unit are looked after to the exclusion of those of others. 

Whoever is indifferent to the difficulties of others, refuses to transfer cadres to other units on request, or releases only the inferior ones, "using the neighbour's field as an outlet for his overflow", and does not give the slightest consideration to other departments, localities or people - such a person is a selfish departmentalist who has entirely lost the spirit of communism. 

Lack of consideration for the whole and complete indifference to other departments, localities and people are characteristics of a selfishdepartmentalist. We must intensify our efforts to educate such persons and to make them understand that selfish departmentalism is a sectarian tendency which will become very dangerous, if allowed to develop.
