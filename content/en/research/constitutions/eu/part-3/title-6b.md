already adopted within the framework of enhanced cooperation. However, if the Council considers
that the conditions of participation have not been fulfilled, it shall indicate the arrangements to be

COMMON PROVISIONS
Article 3-424
Taking account of the structural economic and social situation of Guadeloupe, French Guiana,
Martinique, Réunion, the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands, which is compounded by their
remoteness, insularity, small size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few
products, the permanence and combination of which severely restrain their development, the
Council, on a proposal from the Commission, shall adopt European laws, framework laws,
regulations and decisions aimed, in particular, at laying down the conditions of application of the
Constitution to those regions, including common policies. It shall act after consulting the European
Parliament.
The acts referred to in the first paragraph concern in particular areas such as customs and trade
policies, fiscal policy, free zones, agriculture and fisheries policies, conditions for supply of raw
materials and essential consumer goods, State aids and conditions of access to structural funds and to
horizontal Union programmes.
The Council shall adopt the acts referred to in the first paragraph taking into account the special
characteristics and constraints of the outermost regions without undermining the integrity and the
coherence of the Union legal order, including the internal market and common policies.954393_TRAITE_EN_151_200

Article 3-431
The Union's contractual liability shall be governed by the law applicable to the contract in question.
In the case of non-contractual liability, the Union shall, in accordance with the general principles

To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the Constitution, the Member State or
States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established.
Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall, where appropriate,
adopt a common attitude.
In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member States shall take into account
the fact that the advantages accorded under the Constitution by each Member State form an integral

powers have been conferred by the Constitution and the granting of identical advantages by all the
other Member States.

(a) no Member State shall be obliged to supply information the disclosure of which it considers

essential interests of its security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms,

competition in the internal market regarding products which are not intended for specifically
military purposes.

2. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission, may unanimously adopt a European decision
making changes to the list of 15 April 1958 of the products to which the provisions of paragraph 1
