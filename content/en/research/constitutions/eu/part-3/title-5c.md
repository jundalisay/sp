1. The tasks referred to in Article I-41(1), in the course of which the Union may use civilian and
military means, shall include joint disarmament operations, humanitarian and rescue tasks, military
advice and assistance tasks, conflict prevention and peace-keeping tasks, tasks of combat forces in
crisis management, including peace-making and post-conflict stabilisation. All these tasks may
contribute to the fight against terrorism, including by supporting third countries in combating
terrorism in their territories.

2. The Council shall adopt European decisions relating to the tasks referred to in paragraph 1,
defining their objectives and scope and the general conditions for their implementation. The
Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, acting under the authority of the Council and in close and
constant contact with the Political and Security Committee, shall ensure coordination of the civilian
and military aspects of such tasks.

### Article 3-310

1. Within the framework of the European decisions adopted in accordance with Article 3-309, the
Council may entrust the implementation of a task to a group of Member States which are willing and
have the necessary capability for such a task. Those Member States, in association with the
Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, shall agree among themselves on the management of the task.

2. Member States participating in the task shall keep the Council regularly informed of its progress
on their own initiative or at the request of another Member State. Those States shall inform the
Council immediately should the completion of the task entail major consequences or require
amendment of the objective, scope and conditions determined for the task in the European decisions
referred to in paragraph 1. In such cases, the Council shall adopt the necessary European decisions.

### Article 3-311

1. The Agency in the field of defence capabilities development, research, acquisition and armaments
(European Defence Agency), established by Article I-41(3) and subject to the authority of the Council,
shall have as its task to:

(a) contribute to identifying the Member States' military capability objectives and evaluating
observance of the capability commitments given by the Member States;

(b) promote harmonisation of operational needs and adoption of effective, compatible procurement
methods;

(c) propose multilateral projects to fulfil the objectives in terms of military capabilities, ensure
coordination of the programmes implemented by the Member States and management of specific
cooperation programmes;

(e) contribute to identifying and, if necessary, implementing any useful measure for strengthening
the industrial and technological base of the defence sector and for improving the effectiveness of
military expenditure.

2. The European Defence Agency shall be open to all Member States wishing to be part of it. The
Council, acting by a qualified majority, shall adopt a European decision defining the Agency's statute,
seat and operational rules. That decision should take account of the level of effective participation in
the Agency's activities. Specific groups shall be set up within the Agency bringing together
Member States engaged in joint projects. The Agency shall carry out its tasks in liaison with the
Commission where necessary.

### Article 3-312

1. Those Member States which wish to participate in the permanent structured cooperation referred
to in Article I-41(6), which fulfil the criteria and have made the commitments on military capabilities
set out in the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation shall notify their intention to the
Council and to the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.

2. Within three months following the notification referred to in paragraph 1 the Council shall adopt a European decision establishing permanent structured cooperation and determining the list of
participating Member States. The Council shall act by a qualified majority after consulting the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs.

Protocol on permanent structured cooperation. The Council shall act by a qualified majority after
consulting the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs. Only members of the Council representing the
participating Member States shall take part in the vote.

A qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the members of the Council representing the
participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the population of these States.
A blocking minority must include at least the minimum number of Council members representing
more than 35 % of the population of the participating Member States, plus one member, failing
which the qualified majority shall be deemed attained.

4. If a participating Member State no longer fulfils the criteria or is no longer able to meet the
commitments referred to in Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on permanent structured cooperation,
the Council may adopt a European decision suspending the participation of the Member State
concerned.

The Council shall act by a qualified majority. Only members of the Council representing the
participating Member States, with the exception of the Member State in question, shall take part in
the vote.

A qualified majority shall be defined as at least 55 % of the members of the Council representing the
participating Member States, comprising at least 65 % of the population of these States.
A blocking minority must include at least the minimum number of Council members representing
more than 35 % of the population of the participating Member States, plus one member, failing

cooperation shall notify its intention to the Council, which shall take note that the Member State in
question has ceased to participate.
