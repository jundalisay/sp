CHAPTER VI INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS

### Article 3-323

1. The Union may conclude an agreement with one or more third countries or international
organisations where the Constitution so provides or where the conclusion of an agreement is
necessary in order to achieve, within the framework of the Union's policies, one of the objectives
referred to in the Constitution, or is provided for in a legally binding Union act or is likely to affect
common rules or alter their scope.

2. Agreements concluded by the Union are binding on the institutions of the Union and on its
Member States.

### Article 3-324

The Union may conclude an association agreement with one or more third countries or international
organisations in order to establish an association involving reciprocal rights and obligations,
common actions and special procedures.


### Article 3-325

1. Without prejudice to the specific provisions laid down in Article 3-315, agreements between the
Union and third countries or international organisations shall be negotiated and concluded in
accordance with the following procedure.

2. The Council shall authorise the opening of negotiations, adopt negotiating directives, authorise
the signing of agreements and conclude them.

3. The Commission, or the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs where the agreement envisaged
relates exclusively or principally to the common foreign and security policy, shall submit
recommendations to the Council, which shall adopt a European decision authorising the opening of
negotiations and, depending on the subject of the agreement envisaged, nominating the Union
negotiator or head of the Union's negotiating team.

4. The Council may address directives to the negotiator and designate a special committee in
consultation with which the negotiations must be conducted.
5. The Council, on a proposal by the negotiator, shall adopt a European decision authorising the
signing of the agreement and, if necessary, its provisional application before entry into force.

6. The Council, on a proposal by the negotiator, shall adopt a European decision concluding the
agreement.

Except where agreements relate exclusively to the common foreign and security policy, the Council
shall adopt the European decision concluding the agreement:

(a) after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament in the following cases:

(i) association agreements;

(ii) Union accession to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and
Fundamental Freedoms;

(iii) agreements establishing a specific institutional framework by organising cooperation
procedures;

(iv) agreements with important budgetary implications for the Union;

(v) agreements covering fields to which either the ordinary legislative procedure applies, or the
special legislative procedure where consent by the European Parliament is required.
The European Parliament and the Council may, in an urgent situation, agree upon a time-limit for
consent.

(b) after consulting the European Parliament in other cases. The European Parliament shall deliver its
opinion within a time-limit which the Council may set depending on the urgency of the matter.
In the absence of an opinion within that time-limit, the Council may act.

7. When concluding an agreement, the Council may, by way of derogation from paragraphs 5, 6
and 9, authorise the negotiator to approve on the Union's behalf modifications to the agreement
where it provides for them to be adopted by a simplified procedure or by a body set up by the
agreement. The Council may attach specific conditions to such authorisation.

8. The Council shall act by a qualified majority throughout the procedure.
However, it shall act unanimously when the agreement covers a field for which unanimity is required
for the adoption of a Union act as well as for association agreements and the agreements referred to
in Article 3-319 with the States which are candidates for accession.

9. The Council, on a proposal from the Commission or the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, shall
adopt a European decision suspending application of an agreement and establishing the positions to
be adopted on the Union's behalf in a body set up by an agreement, when that body is called upon to
adopt acts having legal effects, with the exception of acts supplementing or amending the
institutional framework of the agreement.

10. The European Parliament shall be immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedure.

11. A Member State, the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission may obtain the
opinion of the Court of Justice as to whether an agreement envisaged is compatible with the
Constitution. Where the opinion of the Court of Justice is adverse, the agreement envisaged may not
enter into force unless it is amended or the Constitution is revised.

### Article 3-326

1. By way of derogation from Article 3-325, the Council, either on a recommendation from the
European Central Bank or on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the
European Central Bank, in an endeavour to reach a consensus consistent with the objective of price
stability, may conclude formal agreements on an exchange-rate system for the euro in relation to the
currencies of third States. The Council shall act unanimously after consulting the European
Parliament and in accordance with the procedure provided for in paragraph 3.
The Council, either on a recommendation from the European Central Bank or on a recommendation
from the Commission and after consulting the European Central Bank, in an endeavour to reach a
consensus consistent with the objective of price stability, may adopt, adjust or abandon the central
rates of the euro within the exchange-rate system. The President of the Council shall inform the
European Parliament of the adoption, adjustment or abandonment of the central rates of the euro.

2. In the absence of an exchange-rate system in relation to one or more currencies of third States as
referred to in paragraph 1, the Council, acting either on a recommendation from the European
Central Bank or on a recommendation from the Commission and after consulting the European
Central Bank, may formulate general orientations for exchange-rate policy in relation to these
currencies. These general orientations shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the
European System of Central Banks, to maintain price stability.

3. By way of derogation from Article 3-325, where agreements on matters relating to the
monetary or exchange-rate system are to be the subject of negotiations between the Union and one
or more third States or international organisations, the Council, acting on a recommendation from
the Commission and after consulting the European Central Bank, shall decide the arrangements for
the negotiation and for the conclusion of such agreements. These arrangements shall ensure that the
Union expresses a single position. The Commission shall be fully associated with the negotiations.

4. Without prejudice to Union competence and Union agreements as regards economic and
monetary union, Member States may negotiate in international bodies and conclude agreements.
