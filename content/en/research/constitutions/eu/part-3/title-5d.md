### Article 3-313

1. Administrative expenditure which the implementation of this Chapter entails for the institutions
shall be charged to the Union budget.

2. Operating expenditure to which the implementation of this Chapter gives rise shall also be
charged to the Union budget, except for such expenditure arising from operations having military or
defence implications and cases where the Council decides otherwise.

In cases where expenditure is not charged to the Union budget it shall be charged to the
Member States in accordance with the gross national product scale, unless the Council decides
otherwise. As for expenditure arising from operations having military or defence implications,
Member States whose representatives in the Council have made a formal declaration under Article 3-
300(1), second subparagraph, shall not be obliged to contribute to the financing thereof.

3. The Council shall adopt a European decision establishing the specific procedures for
guaranteeing rapid access to appropriations in the Union budget for urgent financing of initiatives
in the framework of the common foreign and security policy, and in particular for preparatory
activities for the tasks referred to in Article I-41(1) and Article 3-309. It shall act after consulting the
European Parliament.

Preparatory activities for the tasks referred to in Article I-41(1) and Article 3-309 which are not
charged to the Union budget shall be financed by a start-up fund made up of Member States'
contributions.

The Council shall adopt by a qualified majority, on a proposal from the Union Minister for
Foreign Affairs, European decisions establishing:

(a) the procedures for setting up and financing the start-up fund, in particular the amounts allocated
to the fund;

(b) the procedures for administering the start-up fund;

(c) the financial control procedures.

When the task planned in accordance with Article I-41(1) and Article 3-309 cannot be charged to
the Union budget, the Council shall authorise the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs to use the fund.
The Union Minister for Foreign Affairs shall report to the Council on the implementation of this
remit.
