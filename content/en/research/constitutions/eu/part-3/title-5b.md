2. The Member States shall support the common foreign and security policy actively and
unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity.
The Member States shall work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity. They
shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its
effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations.
The Council and the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs shall ensure that these principles are complied
with.

3. The Union shall conduct the common foreign and security policy by:

(a) defining the general guidelines;

(b) adopting European decisions defining:

(i) actions to be undertaken by the Union;

(ii) positions to be taken by the Union;

(iii) arrangements for the implementation of the European decisions referred to in points (i) and

(ii);
(c) strengthening systematic cooperation between Member States in the conduct of policy.

### Article 3-295

1. The European Council shall define the general guidelines for the common foreign and security
policy, including for matters with defence implications.
If international developments so require, the President of the European Council shall convene an
extraordinary meeting of the European Council in order to define the strategic lines of the Union's
policy in the face of such developments.

2. The Council shall adopt the European decisions necessary for defining and implementing the
common foreign and security policy on the basis of the general guidelines and strategic lines defined
by the European Council.

### Article 3-296

1. The Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, who shall chair the Foreign Affairs Council, shall
contribute through his or her proposals towards the preparation of the common foreign and security
policy and shall ensure implementation of the European decisions adopted by the European Council
and the Council.

2. The Minister for Foreign Affairs shall represent the Union for matters relating to the common
foreign and security policy. He or she shall conduct political dialogue with third parties on the
Union's behalf and shall express the Union's position in international organisations and at
international conferences.
3. In fulfilling his or her mandate, the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be assisted by a
European External Action Service. This service shall work in cooperation with the diplomatic services
of the Member States and shall comprise officials from relevant departments of the General
Secretariat of the Council and of the Commission as well as staff seconded from national diplomatic
services of the Member States. The organisation and functioning of the European External Action
Service shall be established by a European decision of the Council. The Council shall act on a
proposal from the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs after consulting the European Parliament and
after obtaining the consent of the Commission.
Article 3-297
1. Where the international situation requires operational action by the Union, the Council shall
adopt the necessary European decisions. Such decisions shall lay down the objectives, the scope, the
means to be made available to the Union, if necessary the duration, and the conditions for
implementation of the action.
If there is a change in circumstances having a substantial effect on a question subject to such a
European decision, the Council shall review the principles and objectives of that decision and adopt
the necessary European decisions.

2. The European decisions referred to in paragraph 1 shall commit the Member States in the
positions they adopt and in the conduct of their activity.

3. Whenever there is any plan to adopt a national position or take national action pursuant to a
European decision as referred to in paragraph 1, information shall be provided by the Member State
concerned in time to allow, if necessary, for prior consultations within the Council. The obligation to
provide prior information shall not apply to measures which are merely a national transposition of
such a decision.

4. In cases of imperative need arising from changes in the situation and failing a review of the
European decision pursuant to the second subparagraph of paragraph 1, Member States may take the
necessary measures as a matter of urgency, having regard to the general objectives of that decision.
The Member State concerned shall inform the Council immediately of any such measures.

5. Should there be any major difficulties in implementing a European decision as referred to in this
Article, a Member State shall refer them to the Council which shall discuss them and seek appropriate
solutions. Such solutions shall not run counter to the objectives of the action or impair its
effectiveness.

### Article 3-298

The Council shall adopt European decisions which shall define the approach of the Union to a
particular matter of a geographical or thematic nature. Member States shall ensure that their national
policies conform to the positions of the Union.

Article 3-299

1. Any Member State, the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, or that Minister with the
Commission's support, may refer any question relating to the common foreign and security policy to
the Council and may submit to it initiatives or proposals as appropriate.
2. In cases requiring a rapid decision, the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, of the Minister's own
motion or at the request of a Member State, shall convene an extraordinary meeting of the Council
within forty-eight hours or, in an emergency, within a shorter period.
Article 3-300
1. The European decisions referred to in this Chapter shall be adopted by the Council acting
unanimously.
When abstaining in a vote, any member of the Council may qualify its abstention by making a formal
declaration. In that case, it shall not be obliged to apply the European decision, but shall accept that
the latter commits the Union. In a spirit of mutual solidarity, the Member State concerned shall
refrain from any action likely to conflict with or impede Union action based on that decision and the
other Member States shall respect its position. If the members of the Council qualifying their
abstention in this way represent at least one third of the Member States comprising at least one third
of the population of the Union, the decision shall not be adopted.

By way of derogation from paragraph 1, the Council shall act by a qualified majority:

(a) when adopting European decisions defining a Union action or position on the basis of a
European decision of the European Council relating to the Union's strategic interests and
objectives, as referred to in Article 3-293(1);

(b) when adopting a European decision defining a Union action or position, on a proposal which the
Union Minister for Foreign Affairs has presented following a specific request to him or her from
the European Council, made on its own initiative or that of the Minister;

(c) when adopting a European decision implementing a European decision defining a Union action
or position;

(d) when adopting a European decision concerning the appointment of a special representative in accordance with Article 3-302.

If a member of the Council declares that, for vital and stated reasons of national policy, it intends to
oppose the adoption of a European decision to be adopted by a qualified majority, a vote shall not be
taken. The Union Minister for Foreign Affairs will, in close consultation with the Member State
involved, search for a solution acceptable to it. If he or she does not succeed, the Council may, acting
by a qualified majority, request that the matter be referred to the European Council for a European
decision by unanimity.

3. In accordance with Article I-40(7) the European Council may unanimously adopt a European
decision stipulating that the Council shall act by a qualified majority in cases other than those
referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article.

4. Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall not apply to decisions having military or defence implications.

### Article 3-301

the common approach referred to in paragraph 1.

implementing the common foreign and security policy, including the common security and defence
policy.


### Article 3-305

1. Member States shall coordinate their action in international organisations and at international
conferences. They shall uphold the Union's positions in such fora. The Union Minister for
Foreign Affairs shall organise this coordination.
In international organisations and at international conferences where not all the Member States
participate, those which do take part shall uphold the Union's positions.

2. In accordance with Article I-16(2), Member States represented in international organisations or
international conferences where not all the Member States participate shall keep the latter, as well as
the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, informed of any matter of common interest.
Member States which are also members of the United Nations Security Council shall concert and
keep the other Member States and the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs fully informed.
Member States which are members of the Security Council will, in the execution of their functions,
defend the positions and the interests of the Union, without prejudice to their responsibilities under
the United Nations Charter.

When the Union has defined a position on a subject which is on the United Nations Security Council
agenda, those Member States which sit on the Security Council shall request that the Union Minister
for Foreign Affairs be asked to present the Union's position.

### Article 3-306

The diplomatic and consular missions of the Member States and the Union delegations in
third countries and international conferences, and their representations to international organisa-
tions, shall cooperate in ensuring that the European decisions defining Union positions and actions

cooperation by exchanging information and carrying out joint assessments.

They shall contribute to the implementation of the right of European citizens to protection in the
territory of third countries as referred to in Article I-10(2)(c) and the measures adopted pursuant to
Article 3-127.

### Article 3-307

latter, or of the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, or on its own initiative. It shall also monitor the
implementation of agreed policies, without prejudice to the powers of the Union Minister for
Foreign Affairs.

2. Within the scope of this Chapter, the Political and Security Committee shall exercise, under the
responsibility of the Council and of the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs, the political control and
strategic direction of the crisis management operations referred to in Article 3-309.
The Council may authorise the Committee, for the purpose and for the duration of a crisis
management operation, as determined by the Council, to take the relevant measures concerning the
political control and strategic direction of the operation.

### Article 3-308

procedures and the extent of the powers of the institutions laid down by the Constitution for the
exercise of the Union competences referred to in Articles I-13 to I-15 and I-17.
Similarly, the implementation of the policies listed in those Articles shall not affect the application of
