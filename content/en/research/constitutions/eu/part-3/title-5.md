## CHAPTER I PROVISIONS HAVING GENERAL APPLICATION

### Article 3-292

1. The Union's action on the international scene shall be guided by the principles which have
inspired its own creation, development and enlargement, and which it seeks to advance in the wider
world: democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental
freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the
principles of the United Nations Charter and international law.

The Union shall seek to develop relations and build partnerships with third countries, and
international, regional or global organisations which share the principles referred to in the first
subparagraph. It shall promote multilateral solutions to common problems, in particular in the
framework of the United Nations.

2. The Union shall define and pursue common policies and actions, and shall work for a high
degree of cooperation in all fields of international relations, in order to:

(a) safeguard its values, fundamental interests, security, independence and integrity;

(b) consolidate and support democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the principles of
international law;

(c) preserve peace, prevent conflicts and strengthen international security, in accordance with the
purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, with the principles of the
Helsinki Final Act and with the aims of the Charter of Paris, including those relating to external
borders;

(d) foster the sustainable economic, social and environmental development of developing countries,
with the primary aim of eradicating poverty;

(e) encourage the integration of all countries into the world economy, including through the
progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade;

(f) help develop international measures to preserve and improve the quality of the environment and
the sustainable management of global natural resources, in order to ensure sustainable
development;

(g) assist populations, countries and regions confronting natural or man-made disasters;

(h) promote an international system based on stronger multilateral cooperation and good
global governance.
3. The Union shall respect the principles and pursue the objectives set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 in
the development and implementation of the different areas of the Union's external action covered by
this Title and the external aspects of its other policies.
The Union shall ensure consistency between the different areas of its external action and between
these and its other policies. The Council and the Commission, assisted by the Union Minister for
Foreign Affairs, shall ensure that consistency and shall cooperate to that effect.

### Article 3-293

1. On the basis of the principles and objectives set out in Article 3-292, the European Council
shall identify the strategic interests and objectives of the Union.

European decisions of the European Council on the strategic interests and objectives of the Union
shall relate to the common foreign and security policy and to other areas of the external action of the
Union. Such decisions may concern the relations of the Union with a specific country or region or
may be thematic in approach. They shall define their duration, and the means to be made available by
the Union and the Member States.

The European Council shall act unanimously on a recommendation from the Council, adopted by the
latter under the arrangements laid down for each area. European decisions of the European Council
shall be implemented in accordance with the procedures provided for in the Constitution.

the Commission, for other areas of external action, may submit joint proposals to the Council.
