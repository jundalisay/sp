PROVISIONS ON THE ACQUISITION OF SECONDARY RESIDENCES IN MALTA

### Article 61

Bearing in mind the very limited number of residences in Malta and the very limited land available for
construction purposes, which can only cover the basic needs created by the demographic
development of the present residents, Malta may on a non‑discriminatory basis maintain in force the
rules on the acquisition and holding of immovable property for secondary residence purposes by
nationals of the Member States who have not legally resided in Malta for at least five years laid down
in the Immovable Property (Acquisition by Non‑Residents) Act (Chapter 246).

Malta shall apply authorisation procedures for the acquisition of immovable property for secondary
residence purposes in Malta, which shall be based on published, objective, stable and transparent
criteria. These criteria shall be applied in a non‑discriminatory manner and shall not differentiate
between nationals of Malta and of other Member States. Malta shall ensure that in no instance shall a
national of a Member State be treated in a more restrictive way than a national of a third country.
In the event that the value of one such property bought by a national of a Member State exceeds the
thresholds provided for in Malta's legislation, namely 30 000 Maltese lira for apartments and 50 000
Maltese lira for any type of property other than apartments and property of historical importance,
authorisation shall be granted. Malta may revise the thresholds established by such legislation to
reflect changes in prices in the property market in Malta.


## TITLE 7: PROVISIONS ON ABORTION IN MALTA


### Article 62
Nothing in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe or in the Treaties and Acts modifying or
supplementing it shall affect the application in the territory of Malta of national legislation relating to
abortion.
