Article 116: Definition of “German” – Restoration of citizenship

1. Unless otherwise provided by a law, a German within the meaning of this Basic Law is a person
who possesses German citizenship or who has been admitted to the territory of the German Reich
within the boundaries of 31 December 1937 as a refugee or expellee of German ethnic origin or as the
spouse or descendant of such person.

2. Former German citizens who, between 30 January 1933 and 8 May 1945, were deprived of their
citizenship on political, racial or religious grounds and their descendants shall, on application, have
their citizenship restored. They shall be deemed never to have been deprived of their citizenship if
they have established their domicile in Germany after 8 May 1945 and have not expressed a contrary
intention.

Article 117

[Suspended entry into force of two basic rights]

(1) Law which is inconsistent with paragraph (2) of Article 3 of this Basic Law shall remain in force until
adapted to that provision, but not beyond 31 March 1953.

(2) Laws that restrict freedom of movement in view of the present accommodation shortage shall
remain in force until repealed by a federal law.

Article 118

[New delimitation of Baden and Württemberg]

The division of the territory comprising Baden, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern
into Länder may be revised, without regard to the provisions of Article 29, by agreement between the
Länder concerned. If no agreement is reached, the revision shall be effected by a federal law, which
shall provide for an advisory referendum.

Article 118a [New delimitation of Berlin and Brandenburg]

The division of the territory comprising Berlin and Brandenburg into Länder may be revised, without
regard to the provisions of Article 29, by agreement between the two Länder with the participation of
their inhabitants who are entitled to vote.

Article 119 [Refugees and expellees]

In matters relating to refugees and expellees, especially as regards their distribution among the
Länder, the Federal Government, with the consent of the Bundesrat, may issue statutory instruments
having the force of law, pending settlement of the matter by a federal law. In this connection the
Federal Government may be authorised to issue individual instructions in particular cases. Unless time
is of the essence, such instructions shall be addressed to the highest Land authorities.

Article 120 [Occupation costs – Burdens resulting from the war]

(1) The Federation shall finance the expenditures for occupation costs and other internal and external
burdens resulting from the war, as regulated in detail by federal laws. To the extent that these war
burdens were regulated by federal laws on or before 1 October 1969, the Federation and the Länder
shall finance such expenditures in the proportion established by such federal laws. Insofar as
expenditures for such of these war burdens as neither have been nor will be regulated by federal laws
were met on or before 1 October 1965 by Länder, municipalities (associations of municipalities) or
other entities performing functions of the Länder or municipalities, the Federation shall not be obliged
to finance them even after that date. The Federation shall be responsible for subsidies towards
meeting the costs of social security, including unemployment insurance and public assistance to the
unemployed. The distribution of war burdens between the Federation and the Länder prescribed by
this paragraph shall not be construed to affect any law regarding claims for compensation for
consequences of the war.

(2) Revenue shall pass to the Federation at the time it assumes responsibility for the expenditures
referred to in this Article.

Article 120a [Equalisation of burdens]

(1) Laws implementing the equalisation of burdens may, with the consent of the Bundesrat, provide
that, with respect to equalisation payments, they shall be executed partly by the Federation and partly
by the Länder acting on federal commission and that the relevant powers vested in the Federal
Government and the competent highest federal authorities by virtue of Article 85 shall be wholly or
partly delegated to the Federal Equalisation of Burdens Office. In exercising these powers, the Federal
Equalisation of Burdens Office shall not require the consent of the Bundesrat; except in urgent cases,
its instructions shall be given to the highest Land authorities (Land Equalisation of Burdens Offices).
(2) The second sentence of paragraph (3) of Article 87 shall not be affected by this provision.
Article 121
[Definition of “majority of the members”]
Within the meaning of this Basic Law, a majority of the Members of the Bundestag and a majority of
the members of the Federal Convention shall be a majority of the number of their members specified
by a law.

Article 122
[Date of transmission of legislative powers]

(1) From the date on which the Bundestag first convenes, laws shall be enacted only by the legislative
bodies recognised by this Basic Law.

(2) Legislative bodies and institutions participating in the legislative process in an advisory capacity
whose competence expires by virtue of paragraph (1) of this Article shall be dissolved as of that date.

Article 123
[Continued applicability of pre-existing law]

(1) Law in force before the Bundestag first convenes shall remain in force insofar as it does not conflict
with this Basic Law.

(2) Subject to all rights and objections of interested parties, treaties concluded by the German Reich
concerning matters within the legislative competence of the Länder under this Basic Law shall remain
in force, provided they are and continue to be valid under general principles of law, until new treaties are concluded by the authorities competent under this Basic Law or until they are in some other way
terminated pursuant to their provisions.

Article 124
[Continued applicability of law within the scope of exclusive legislative power]

Law regarding matters subject to the exclusive legislative power of the Federation shall become
federal law in the area in which it applies.
