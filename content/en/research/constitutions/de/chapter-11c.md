Article 131

[Persons formerly in the public service]

The legal relations of persons, including refugees and expellees, who on 8 May 1945 were employed
in the public service, have left the service for reasons other than those recognised by civil service
regulations or collective bargaining agreements and have not yet been reinstated or are employed in
positions that do not correspond to those they previously held shall be regulated by a federal law. The
same shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to persons, including refugees and expellees, who on 8 May 1945
were entitled to pensions and related benefits and who for reasons other than those recognised by
civil service regulations or collective bargaining agreements no longer receive any such pension or
related benefits. Until the pertinent federal law takes effect, no legal claims may be made, unless Land
law otherwise provides.

Article 132
[Retirement of civil servants]

(1) Civil servants and judges who enjoy life tenure when this Basic Law takes effect may, within six
months after the Bundestag first convenes, be retired, suspended or transferred to lower-salaried
positions if they lack the personal or professional aptitude for their present positions. This provision
shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to salaried public employees other than civil servants or judges whose
employment cannot be terminated at will. In the case of salaried employees whose employment may
be terminated at will, notice periods longer than those set by collective bargaining agreements may be
rescinded within the same period.

(2) The preceding provision shall not apply to members of the public service who are unaffected by the
provisions regarding “Liberation from National Socialism and Militarism” or who are recognised victims
of National Socialism, save on important personal grounds.

(3) Persons affected may have recourse to the courts in accordance with paragraph (4) of Article 19.

(4) Details shall be specified by a statutory instrument issued by the Federal Government with the
consent of the Bundesrat.

Article 133
[Succession to the Administration of the Combined Economic Area]

The Federation shall succeed to the rights and duties of the Administration of the Combined Economic
Area.

Article 134
[Succession to Reich assets]

(1) Reich assets shall, in principle, become federal assets.

(2) Insofar as such assets were originally intended to be used principally for administrative tasks not
entrusted to the Federation under this Basic Law, they shall be transferred without compensation to
the authorities now entrusted with such tasks, and to the extent that such assets are now being used,
not merely temporarily, for administrative tasks that under this Basic Law are now performed by the
Länder, they shall be transferred to the Länder. The Federation may also transfer other assets to the
Länder.

(3) Assets that were placed at the disposal of the Reich without compensation by Länder or
municipalities (associations of municipalities) shall revert to those Länder or municipalities
(associations of municipalities) insofar as the Federation does not require them for its own
administrative purposes.

(4) Details shall be regulated by a federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat.

Article 135

[Assets in case of territorial changes between the Länder]

(1) If, after 8 May 1945 and before the effective date of this Basic Law, an area has passed from one
Land to another, the Land to which the area now belongs shall be entitled to the assets of the Land to
which it previously belonged that are located in that area.

(2) The assets of Länder or of other corporations or institutions established under public law that no
longer exist, insofar as they were originally intended to be used principally for administrative tasks or
are now being so used, not merely temporarily, shall pass to the Land, corporation or institution that
now performs those tasks.

(3) Real property of Länder that no longer exist, including appurtenances, shall pass to the Land within
which it is located, insofar as it is not among the assets already referred to in paragraph (1) of this
Article.

(4) Insofar as an overriding interest of the Federation or the particular interest of a region requires, a
federal law may depart from the rules prescribed by paragraphs (1) to (3) of this Article.

(5) In all other respects, the succession to and disposition of assets, insofar as it has not been effected
before 1 January 1952 by agreement between the affected Länder or corporations or institutions
established under public law, shall be regulated by a federal law requiring the consent of the
Bundesrat.

(6) Holdings of the former Land of Prussia in enterprises established under private law shall pass to
the Federation. Details shall be regulated by a federal law, which may also depart from this provision.

(7) Insofar as assets that, on the effective date of this Basic Law, would devolve upon a Land or a
corporation or institution established under public law pursuant to paragraphs (1) to (3) of this Article
have been disposed of by or pursuant to a Land law or in any other manner by the party thus entitled,
the transfer of assets shall be deemed to have taken place before such disposition.
Article 135a

[Old debts]

(1) Federal legislation enacted pursuant to paragraph (4) of Article 134 or paragraph (5) of Article 135
may also provide that the following debts shall not be discharged, or that they shall be discharged only
in part:

1. debts of the Reich, of the former Land of Prussia, or of such other corporations and institutions established under public law as no longer exist;

2. such debts of the Federation or of corporations and institutions established under public
law as are connected with the transfer of assets pursuant to Article 89, 90, 134 or 135 and such
debts of these bodies as arise from measures taken by the bodies designated in item 1;

3. such debts of the Länder or municipalities (associations of municipalities) as have arisen
from measures taken by them before 1 August 1945 within the framework of administrative
functions incumbent upon or delegated by the Reich to comply with orders of the occupying powers
or to terminate a state of emergency resulting from the war.

(2) Paragraph (1) of this Article shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to debts of the German Democratic
Republic or its institutions as well as to debts of the Federation or other corporations and institutions
established under public law that are connected with the transfer of assets of the German Democratic
Republic to the Federation, Länder or municipalities, and to debts arising from measures taken by the
German Democratic Republic or its institutions.

Article 136
[First convening of the Bundesrat]

(1) The Bundesrat shall convene for the first time on the day on which the Bundestag first convenes.

(2) Until the election of the first Federal President, his powers shall be exercised by the President of the Bundesrat. He shall not have authority to dissolve the Bundestag.

President shall be governed by an electoral law to be enacted by the Parliamentary Council.

(3) Until the Federal Constitutional Court is established, its authority under paragraph (2) of Article 41
shall be exercised by the German High Court for the Combined Economic Area, which shall make
determinations in accordance with its procedural rules.

Militarism” shall not be affected by the provisions of this Basic Law.
