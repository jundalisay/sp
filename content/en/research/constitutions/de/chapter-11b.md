Article 125

[Continued applicability of law within the scope of concurrent legislative power]
Law regarding matters subject to the concurrent legislative power of the Federation shall become
federal law in the area in which it applies:

1.insofar as it applies uniformly within one or more occupation zones;

2.insofar as it is law by which former Reich law has been amended since 8 May 1945.

Article 125a [Continued applicability of federal law – Replacement by Land law]

(1) Law that was enacted as federal law but that, by virtue of the amendment of paragraph (1) of
Article 74, the insertion of the seventh sentence of paragraph (1) of Article 84, of the second sentence
of paragraph (1) of Article 85 or of the second sentence of paragraph (2a) of Article 105 or because of
the repeal of Articles 74a, 75 or the second sentence of paragraph (3) of Article 98, could no longer be
enacted as federal law shall remain in force as federal law. It may be superseded by Land law.

(2) Law that was enacted pursuant to paragraph (2) of Article 72 as it stood up to 15 November 1994
but which, because of the amendment of paragraph (2) of Article 72, could no longer be enacted as
federal law shall remain in force as federal law. A federal law may provide that it may be superseded
by Land law.

(3) Law that has been enacted as Land law but which, because of the amendment of Article 73, could
not be enacted any longer as Land law shall continue in force as Land law. It may be superseded by
federal law.

Article 125b [Continued applicability of framework laws – Deviation power of the Länder]

(1) Law that was enacted pursuant to Article 75 as it stood up to 1 September 2006 and which could
be enacted as federal law even after this date shall remain in force as federal law. The powers and
duties of the Länder to legislate shall, in this regard, remain unaffected. In the areas referred to in the
first sentence of paragraph (3) of Article 72 the Länder may enact regulations that deviate from this
law; however, in those areas covered by items 2, 5 and 6 of the first sentence of Article 72 the Länder
may do so only if and insofar as the Federation has made use of its power to legislate after 1
September 2006, in those areas covered by items 2 and 5 beginning at the latest on 1 January 2010,
in cases under item 6 beginning at the latest on 1 August 2008.

(2) The Länder may enact regulations deviating from federal regulations enacted pursuant to
paragraph (1) of Article 84 as it stood up to 1 September 2006; up to 31 December 2008, however,
they may deviate from regulations on administrative procedure only if, after 1 September 2006,
regulations on administrative procedure in the relevant federal law have been amended.

(3) In the area covered by item 7 of the first sentence of paragraph (3) of Article 72 deviating Land law
may be taken as a basis for levying taxes on real property for periods beginning on 1 January 2025 at
the earliest.

Article 125c [Continued applicability of law within the scope of joint tasks]

(1) Law that was enacted by virtue of paragraph (2) of Article 91a in conjunction with item 1 of
paragraph (1) as it stood up to 1 September 2006 shall continue in force until 31 December 2006.

(2) The rules enacted in the areas of municipal transport financing and promotion of social housing by
virtue of paragraph (4) of Article 104a as it stood up to 1 September 2006 shall remain in force until 31
December 2006. The rules enacted on municipal transport financing for special programmes pursuant
to paragraph (1) of section 6 of the Municipal Transport Infrastructure Financing Act, as well as the
other rules enacted by the Act of 20 December 2001 governing the Federal Financing of Seaports in
Bremen, Hamburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein under
paragraph (4) of Article 104a of the Basic Law as it stood up to 1 September 2006 shall continue in
force until their repeal. Amendment of the Municipal Transport Infrastructure Financing Act shall be
permissible. The fourth sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 104b shall apply, mutatis mutandis. The other rules enacted in accordance with paragraph (4) of Article 104a of the Basic Law as it stood up to
1 September 2006 shall continue in force until 31 December 2019, provided no earlier repeal has
been or is determined.

(3) The fifth sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 104b shall apply for the first time to regulations that
enter into force after 31 December 2019.

Article 126
[Determination about continued applicability of law as federal law]

Disagreements concerning the continued applicability of law as federal law shall be resolved by the
Federal Constitutional Court.

Article 127

[Extension of law to the French zone and to Berlin]

governments of the Länder concerned, may extend to the Länder of Baden, Greater Berlin, Rhineland-
Palatinate and Württemberg-Hohenzollern any law of the Administration of the Combined Economic
Area, insofar as it remains in force as federal law under Article 124 or 125.

Article 128

[Continued authority to issue instructions]

Insofar as law that remains in force grants authority to issue instructions within the meaning of
paragraph (5) of Article 84, this authority shall remain in existence until a law otherwise provides.

Article 129

[Continued authority to issue legal acts]

(1) Insofar as legal provisions that remain in force as federal law grant authority to issue statutory
instruments or general administrative rules or to make administrative decisions in individual cases,
such powers shall pass to the authorities that henceforth have competence over the subject matter. In
cases of doubt the Federal Government shall decide in agreement with the Bundesrat; such decisions
shall be published.

(2) Insofar as legal provisions that remain in force as Land law grant such authority, it shall be
exercised by the authorities competent under Land law.

(3) Insofar as legal provisions within the meaning of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article grant
authority to amend or supplement the provisions themselves or to issue legal provisions that have the
force of laws, such authority shall be deemed to have expired.

(4) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this Article shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to legal
provisions that refer to provisions no longer in force or to institutions no longer in existence.

Article 130

[Transfer of existing administrative institutions]

(1) Administrative agencies and other institutions that serve the public administration or the
administration of justice and are not based on Land law or on agreements between Länder, as well as
the Administrative Union of South West German Railways and the Administrative Council for Postal
and Telecommunications Services for the French Occupation Zone, shall be placed under the control
of the Federal Government. The Federal Government, with the consent of the Bundesrat, shall provide
for their transfer, dissolution or liquidation.

(2) The supreme disciplinary authority for the personnel of these administrative bodies and institutions
shall be the competent Federal Minister.

(3) Corporations and institutions under public law not directly subordinate to a Land nor based on
agreements between Länder shall be under the supervision of the competent highest federal authority.
