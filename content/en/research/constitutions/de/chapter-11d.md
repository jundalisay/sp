[Compensation for the cessation of joint tasks]

(1) From 1 January 2007 until 31 December 2019, the Länder shall be entitled to receive annual
payments from the federal budget as compensation for losing the Federation’s financial contributions
resulting from the abolition of the joint tasks of extension and construction of institutions of higher
education, including university hospitals and educational planning, as well as for losing financial
assistance for the improvement of municipal traffic infrastructure and for the promotion of social
housing. Until 31 December 2013, these amounts are to be determined by averaging the financial
share of the Federation for the years 2000 to 2008.

(3) Until the end of 2013, the Federation and the Länder shall review the extent to which the financing
allotted to individual Länder pursuant to paragraph (1) is still appropriate and necessary for the
discharge of their tasks. Beginning on 1 January 2014, the earmarking pursuant to item 2 of paragraph

(2) of the financial means allotted under paragraph (1) shall cease; the earmarking for the volume of the means for investment purposes shall remain unchanged. Agreements resulting from Solidarity
Pact II shall remain unaffected.

first time to the 2011 budget; debit authorisations existing on 31 December 2010 for special trusts
already established shall remain unaffected. In the period from 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2019,
the Länder may, in accordance with their applicable legal regulations, derogate from the provisions of
paragraph (3) of Article 109. The budgets of the Länder are to be planned in such a way that the 2020

January 2011 to 31 December 2015, the Federation may derogate from the provisions of the second
sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 115. The reduction of the existing deficits should begin with the
2011 budget. The annual budgets are to be planned in such a way that the 2016 budget satisfies the
requirement of the second sentence of paragraph (2) of Article 115; details shall be regulated by
federal law.

(2) As assistance for compliance with the provisions of paragraph (3) of Article 109 after 1 January
2020, the Länder of Berlin, Bremen, Saarland, Saxony-Anhalt and Schleswig-Holstein may receive, for
the period 2011 to 2019, consolidation assistance from the federal budget in the global amount of 800
million euros annually. The respective amounts are 300 million euros for Bremen, 260 million euros for
Saarland and 80 million euros each for Berlin, Saxony-Anhalt, and Schleswig-Holstein. The assistance
payments shall be allocated on the basis of an administrative agreement under the terms of a federal
law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat. These grants require a complete reduction of financial
deficits by the end of 2020. The details, especially the annual steps to be taken to reduce financial
deficits and the supervision of the reduction of financial deficits by the Stability Council, along with the
consequences entailed in case of failure to carry out the step-by-step reduction, shall be regulated by
a federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat and by an administrative agreement.
Consolidation assistance shall not be granted concurrently with redevelopment assistance awarded on
the grounds of an extreme budgetary emergency.

(3) The financial burden resulting from the granting of the consolidation assistance shall be borne
equally by the Federation and the Länder, to be financed from their share of revenue from the turnover
tax. Details shall be regulated by a federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat.

(4) As assistance for future autonomous compliance with the provisions of paragraph (3) of Article
109, the Länder of Bremen and Saarland may receive redevelopment assistance from the federal
budget in the global amount of 800 million euros annually from 1 January 2020. To this end, the
Länder shall adopt measures to reduce excessive debts and to strengthen their economic and
financial capacity. Details shall be regulated by a federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat.
This redevelopment assistance shall not be granted concurrently with redevelopment assistance
awarded on the grounds of an extreme budgetary emergency.

administered on federal commission by the Länder or such self-governing bodies as are competent
under Land law until no later than 31 December 2020. The Federation shall regulate the
transformation from commissioned administration to federal administration under paragraphs (2) and

(4) of Article 90 by means of a federal law requiring the consent of the Bundesrat.

federal trunk roads, insofar as they lie within the territory of that Land, with effect from 1 January 2021.

(3) By a federal law with the consent of the Bundesrat, it may be regulated that a Land, upon
application, takes over, on commission of the Federation, the function of administering plan approval
and planning permission for the construction and alteration of federal motorways and other federal
trunk roads for which the Federation has assumed administrative responsibility under paragraph (4) of
Article 90 or paragraph (2) of Article 143e and on what conditions this function may be transferred
back.
