THUS SPAKE ZARATHUSTRA.

FIRST PART. ZARATHUSTRA’S DISCOURSES.

ZARATHUSTRA’S PROLOGUE.

1. When Zarathustra was 30 years old, he left his home and went into the mountains for 10 years.

But at last his heart changed, saying :

Oh sun, for 10 years you have climbed to my cave with me, my eagle, and my serpent.

We waited for you every morning. But now I must go down out of here. 

<!-- Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.

Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest happiness without envy!

Bless the cup that is about to overflow, that the water may flow golden out of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!

Lo! This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again going to be a man.

Thus began Zarathustra’s down-going. -->


2. Zarathustra went to the forest alone. Suddenly there appeared before him an old man, who had left his holy cot to seek roots.

Saint: “I met you before. You are Zarathustra. But now you have changed. Your eye is Pure, without loathing. You have become an awakened one. What will you do in the land of the sleepers?”

Zarathustra answered: “I love mankind too much."

Saint:  I love God, not men. Man is too imperfect for me. Love to man would be fatal to me.”

Zarathustra answered: “I am bringing gifts unto men.”

Saint: “Give them nothing. Instead, take a part of their load, and carry it along with them. If, however, you want to give to them, give them only alms, and let them also beg for it!”

Zarathustra: No, “I give no alms. I am not poor enough for that.”

The saint laughed at Zarathustra: “Then see to it that they accept your treasures! They are distrustful of anchorites, and do not believe that we come with gifts. 

<!-- The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets. And just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before sunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us: Where goeth the thief? Go not to men, but stay in the forest! Go rather to the animals! Why not be like me—a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?” -->

Zarathustra: “What do you do in the forest?”

saint: “I make hymns and sing them as praise to God through singing, weeping, laughing, and mumbling. But what do you bring us as a gift?”

Zarathustra bowed to the saint: “What can I give you? I should leave lest I take away from you!”

And thus they parted both of them laughing like schoolboys.

When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart: “This old saint has not yet heard that GOD IS DEAD!”


3. When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which adjoineth the forest, he found many people assembled in the market-place; for it had been announced that a rope-dancer would give a performance. 

Zarathustra said to the people:

I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN. Man is something that is to be surpassed. 

What have ye done to surpass man? All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves.

<!-- and ye want to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the beast than surpass man? -->

An ape is a laughing-stock, a thing of shame to a man.*

{{< n n="This is a sign of Negative Force similar to the one that infected Hitler" >}} 


Man is the same shame to the Superman.

<!-- : a laughing-stock, a thing of shame. -->

Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is still worm. 

Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than any of the apes.

<!-- Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and phantom. But do I bid you become phantoms or plants? -->

The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: The Superman SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!

I conjure you, my brethren:
- REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH
- do not believe those who speak to you of superearthly hopes!
  - They are:
    - Poisoners.
    - Despisers of life

<!-- are they, decaying ones and poisoned ones themselves, of whom the earth is weary: so away with them! -->

In the past, blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy. 

But God died, and along with God those blasphemers.

To blaspheme the earth is now the most dreadful sin.

 <!-- and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the meaning of the earth! -->

In the past, the soul looked contemptuously on the body, and then that contempt was the supreme thing.

The soul wanted the body to be meagre, ghastly, and famished. 

In this way, the soul would escape from the body and the earth.

<!-- Oh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and famished; and cruelty was the delight of that soul! -->

But my brethren, what does your body say about your soul?*

{{< n n="This is an attack on Plato">}}


Is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency?

A polluted stream is man. 

**One must be a sea, to receive a polluted stream without becoming impure.**

The Superman is that sea.
- In him can your great contempt be submerged.


### The hour of great contempt

The greatest thing ye can experience is "the hour of great contempt". It is when your happiness, reason, and virtue, become loathsome to you.

In that hour we say: 

- “What good is my happiness! It is poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency. But my happiness should justify existence itself!”
- “What good is my reason! Doth it long for knowledge as the lion for his food? It is poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency!”
- “What good is my virtue! As yet it hath not made me passionate. How weary I am of my good and my bad! It is all poverty and pollution and wretched self-complacency!”
- “What good is my justice! I do not see that I am fervour and fuel. The just, however, are fervour and fuel!”
- “What good is my pity! Is not pity the cross on which he is nailed who loveth man? But my pity is not a crucifixion.”

<!-- It is not your sin—it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto heaven; your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven!

Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue? Where is the frenzy with which ye should be inoculated? -->

The Superman is that lightning, he is that frenzy!

<!-- When Zarathustra had thus spoken, one of the people called out: “We have now heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is time now for us to see him!” And all  -->

The people laughed at Zara

The rope-dancer thought that Zara was talking about him.
