A madman lit a lantern and ran around the marketplace crying, 'I'm looking for God! l'm looking for God!' 

Since many of those who did not believe in God were standing around together just then, he
caused great laughter. 

Has he been lost, then? asked one. Did he lose his
way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has
he gone to sea? Emigrated? - Thus they shouted and laughed, one
interrupting the other. 

The madman jumped into their midst and
pierced them with his eyes. 

'Where is God?' he cried; 

'I'll tel1 you! We have killed him - you and I! 

We are all his murderers. But how did we do
this? How were wc able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the spange to
wipe away the entire horizon? What were wc doing when wc unchained
this earth from its sun? Where is it moving to now? Where are wc
moving to? Away from all suns? 

Are wc not continually falling? And
backwards, sidewards, forwards, in all directions? Is there still an up and
a down? Aren't wc straying as though through an infinite nothing? Isn't
empty space breathing at us? Hasn't it got colder? Isn't night and more
night coming again and again? Don't lanterns have to be lit in the
morning? Do wc still hear nothing of the noise of the grave-diggers who
are burying God? 

Do we still smell nothing of the divine decomposition? - Gods, too, decompose! God is dead! God remains dead! 

We have killed him! How can wc console ourselves, the murderers of all
murderers. 

The holiest and the mightiest thing the world has ever possessed has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood
from us? With what water could wc clean ourselves? 

What festivals of
atonement, what holy games will wc have to invent for ourselves? Is the
magnitude of this deed not too great for us? Do wc not ourselves have to
become gods merely to appear worthy of it? There was never a greater
deed - and whoever is horn after us will on account of this deed belong
to a higher history than all history up to now!' 

The madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; they too were silent and looked
at him disconcertedly. 

Finally he threw his lantern on the ground so that it broke into pieces and went out. 

'I come too early my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, wandering;
it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder need
time; the light of the stars needs time; deeds need time, even after they
are done, in arder to be seen and heard. This deed is still more remote
to them than the remotest stars - and yet they have done it themselves!' 

It is still recounted how on the same day the madman forced his way into several churches and there started singing his requiem aeternam deo. 10

Led out and called to account, he is said always to have replied nothing but, 'What then are these churches now if not the tombs and sepulchres
of God?'
