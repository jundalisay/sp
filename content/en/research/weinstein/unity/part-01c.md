## 1.4.1 Ehresmannian Geometry Advantages

Ehresmannian geometry gives the freedom to choose the internal symmetries of a physical theory without being confined to symmetries tied to the tangent bundle of Space-time. 

This decoupling allows physics to account for forces like the Strong and Electro-Weak forces responsible for atomic nuclei, the electron orbitals that surround them, and their decay through beta radiation respectively.

Secondarily, the ability to remove redundancy in the description of nature by restricting our attention to Gauge Invariant quantities has turned out to be a powerful tool.

<!-- Yet some benefit is clearly gained by being able to write down expressions where they are most natural and then reducing them via gauge symmetry to where they are most economical and least repetitive. -->


## 1.4.2 Riemannian Geometry Advantages

In the case of Riemannian and Pseudo-Riemannian geometries, the freedom to consider ad hoc candidates for physical symmetries is radically restricted. Yet there is again a major and a minor advantage.

While the full Riemann curvature tensor is a specific example of the more general Ehresmannian Curvature tensor construction, its decomposition into sub-components has no general analog in Ehresmannian geometry. 

Thus the greatest advantage of Einstein and Grossman’s choice of Riemannian geometry is almost certainly to replace the broad freedom lost in bundle choice with the much more restricted freedom to play separately with the Weyl, (Traceless) Ricci, and Scalar components of the full curvature tensor as Einstein did in 1915.

While that may not seem to modern field theoretic tastes like a sensible trade-off given the loss in choice of structure, it appears sufficient for one very particular application of great importance: gravity. 

Further, properly abstracted, the projection operators onto curvature sub-components may be seen as tensor product decompositions in such a way as to include the Dirac operator on Spinors with its contraction on 1-form valued Spinors. 

Viewed in this fashion, the ability to decompose tensor products of representations involving the tangent and cotangent bundles is the clear enticement to work within the metric paradigm.

The way this discussion has been framed by the above is designed to suggest the search for a parallel in the form of a second minor advantage. And here there is room for debate. The other main attribute of Riemannian geometry that suggests itself hides in plain sight under the label of the ‘The Fundamental Theorem’ of Riemannian geometry.

The choice of a Levi-Civita connection made by the metric is certainly convenient, but its use can always be seen as a choice to be made dynamically by allowing more general connections as suggested by Palatini. Thus its main value is that it allows the torsion tensor of any other connection to be calculated by converting the affine space of connections into an honest vector space with the Levi-Civita connection at the origin.

However, this has always led to a puzzle: what good is being able to define the torsion tensor of a metric connection if the Levi-Civita connection is the only one that appears to matter in practice? Thus the torsion tensor appears, potentially, to be the solution to a problem which no one has yet thought to ask. As such, its potential advantages have so far been minor with its realized ones closer to non-existent. But it must be considered to be a potential advantage as the natural answer to a question which may some day arise.


<!-- 1.5 Notes On The Present Draft Document
There is something about the nature of LaTeX that is likely to confuse the
professional reader. It is as if a typeset document constitutes agreement to
participate in some academic social contract. No such consent is intended by
this. The author functions totally divorced from the professional research context which is oddly automatically inferred from typeset mathematics by nearly
every capable reader, perhaps due to the rarity of such research programs.
Without wishing to dwell on this unduly, there is no way around the fact
that the author has been working in near total isolation from the community
for over 25 years, does not know the current state of the literature, and has few,
if any, colleagues to regularly consult.
As such this document is an attempt to begin recovering a rather more
complete theory which is at this point only partially remembered and stiched
together from old computer files, notebooks, recordings and the like dating back
as far as 1983-4 when the author began the present line of investigation. This
is the first time the author has attempted to assemble the major components of
the story and has discovered in the process how much variation there has been
across matters of notation, convention, and methodology1
. Every effort has been
made to standardize notation but what you are reading is stitched together from
entirely heterogeneous sources and inaccuracies and discrepancies are regularly
encountered as well as missing components when old work is located.
The author notes many academicians find this unprofessional and therefore
irritating. This is quite literally unprofessional as the author is not employed
1The biggest issue of heterodox methodology appears to have been shifts between representation theoretic and indicial methods of tensorial and spinorial products and contractions. -->

<!-- within the profession and has not worked professionally on such material since
the fall of 1994. If you find this disagreeable, please feel free to take your
professional assumptions elsewhere. This document comes from a context totally
different from the world of grants, citations, research metrics, lectures, awards
and positions. In fact, the author claims that if there is any merit to be found
here, it is unlikely that it could be worked out in such a context due to the
author’s direct experience of the political economy of modern academic research.
This work stands apart from that context and does so proudly, intentionally,
and without apology.
With that said, the author welcomes constructive technical feedback at:
technicalfeedback@geometricunity.org and non-technical constructive feedback
at generalfeedback@geometricunity.org.
Lastly, the author notes that academicians repeatedly fail to cite, acknowledge or name work that does not come from within the circle of leading research
institutions. The author alerts the reader that these practices are widespread
within the academy but are generally not acceptable in the world outside academe.
Constructive feedback is welcome but this should be considered as work in
progress of the author and not an invitation for cherry topping, denigration,
theft, scooping or other widespread anti-social academic practices broadly tolerated within the profession. Consult the author if this is any way confusing. -->
