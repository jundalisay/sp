### 2.3 Higgs Sector Remains Geometrically Unmotivated

For most of the 20th century, fundamental physics was split into two halves,
only one of which was geometric. Then, in the mid 1970s, the quantum sector
was discovered to have a basis in differential geometry with the advent of the
Wu-Yang dictionary of Simons, Wu and Yang. Gauge potentials corresponded to the geometer’s notion of a connection and Fermi fields fit with Atiyah and
Singer’s rediscovery of the Dirac operator in a bundle theoretic context.

After that point, fields of fractional spin, spin 1 and spin 2 were all well motivated in either Ehresmannian or Riemannian geometry. This left the curious case of the spin 0 Higgs sector with its so-called Mexican Hat potential. While
the Higgs sector could be described bundle theoretically, it was not fully natural
for geometers to consider a spinless field valued in a Lie Algebra and governed
by a quartic potential, despite the seemingly geometric nature of the Mexican
Hat shape.


## 2.4 Geometric Unity

<!-- This leads us finally to the question of the motivating concept(s) behind Geometric Unity.
In essence, there is both a scientific basis and a human basis rooted in
political economy. The scientific basis is the more important of the two and
proceeds as follows. -->

Mapping out the various reasons that Riemannian and Ehresmannian geometry have continued to progress side by side reveals that there is a trade-off to be had between the two. 

In the case of Ehresmannian geometry, the leading advantage has to be the freedom to accommodate any observed field content
found through experiment through the use of auxiliary bundles structures. As a compensating secondary advantage, the use of the gauge group to simultaneously transform the field content together with the derivative structures which furnish the differential equations that govern propagation allows us to consider a greatly reduced set of truly distinct configurations without being overwhelmed by unnecessary redundancies that we would face in the group’s absence.

The power of these advantages are so central to the massive edifice that is modern Quantum Field Theory that the advantages of classical Einsteinian gravity based on Riemann’s geometry theory seem highly restrictive and almost provincial or perhaps quaint by comparison.

The leading advantage of Einstein’s theory would most likely be thought by most
to be the ability to ‘Project’ or contract the full Riemann Curvature tensor back
onto a subspace of Symmetric 2-tensors which can be put in correspondence with
the tangent space to the parameter space of metrics. 

This gives the Einstein theory the flavor of having the matter and energy warp space directly,

rather than a change in the curvature represented by a differential operator
providing the link. This however pays a high price in that it treats the two
copies of Λ2
in Λ2 ⊗Λ

2 where the Riemann curvature tensor lives symmetrically
while the gauge group acts only on the second factor. This seemingly negates
much of the advantage of working within the Riemannian paradigm if one is
interested in harmonizing GR with QFT.

There is however a small hope. If one can give up the freedom of being able
to choose auxiliary gauge content as needed in the hopes of avoiding the double
origin problem, then it may be possible to work within an extremely narrow class
of theories which are amenable to the advantages of both geometries. But such
geometric frameworks are likely to be extremely restrictive. Thus one must
hope that the Standard Model and General Relativity would be of a highly
unusual and non-generic geometric variety. And the main hope here is that
observed quantum numbers of (ii) and (iii) that have no explanation within
Witten’s point (i) seem to us to be highly suggestive that the Standard Model
with its three generation and 16 particle per generation structure is of exactly
the non-generic theory that carries both attributes.

This brings us to the less scientific and more human point. Let us ask
the question whether the incentive structures of physics select for or against
the search for a highly specific and restrictive class of geometries on which
to focus. Attempts to find such a class are likely to fail, be considered as
numerological and quixotic, and be career limiting. As such, leading physicists
would likely avoid such theories in favor of flexible frameworks which do not
paint the investigator into a research corner. 

To a seasoned investigator, trading
gauge invariance of the action and the freedom to choose field content to fit
the needs of a problem for mere Einstein projection maps and a distinguished
connection, is likely to seem akin to a naive Magic Beans trade where something
of great value is bartered away for something of obviously lesser or even dubious
importance. Here that trade is auxiliary content freedom and gauge covariance
for contraction operators and a distinguished choice of connection.

It is the assertion here that this is not only an advantageous trade but likely
a necessary one. That is, we do not need auxiliary freedom because of our good
fortune in the Standard Model, and we can buy back the gauge invariance after
exploiting the riches of projection operators and the choice of a distinguished
connection.


## 2.5 Geometric Harmony vs Quantum Gravity

It is said that Gravity has to be quantized because of the paradox that since every particle creates a gravitational field, a classical localization would ultimately have to be as uncertain as the quantum particle’s location under observation.

In fact, this presupposes that the answer will be found in the simple Einsteinian space-time paradigm where the argument is maximally persuasive.

However, even here, there is a significant issue that is often glossed over.

Because the group Gl(4 f , R) does not carry a finite dimensional copy of the
15
fractional spin representations, if we allow the space time metric to become uncertain, we find a profound puzzle in the fractional spin fields. 

While the Spin-1
force particles and Spin-0 Higgs fields may be difficult to measure between metric observations, the bundles in which they live are well defined in the absence of a definite choice of metric. 

This however is not true for fractional spin fields.

Should the metric ever successfully be ‘quantized’ in a manner similar to the
other fields, there will be no finite dimensional bundle for the hadrons and leptons during the period between observations. Not only do the waves become uncertain but the media in which the waves would live would appear to be uncertain or even said to vanish. One of the goals of GU is to ensure that the bundles for spinors and Rarita-Schwinger matter do not vanish in the absence of a metric.

By the above reasoning, gravity must be somehow harmonized with quantum fields in an as yet unspecified way more persuasive
than the argument that metric gravity must be quantized on the same footing
as the other fields. 

Thus, whether gravity is to be harmonized or quantized, it is the goal of GU to decouple the existence of the fractional spin bundles as the medium for matter waves from the assumption of a metric in the ultimate
quantum theory.
