[a1] Enki said to the gods, his brothers:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
What calumny do we lay to their charge? Their forced labor was heavy, their misery too much!

[a5] Every day ... the outcry was loud, we could hear the clamor.

There is ... Belet-ili, the midwife, is present. Let her create, then, a human, a man,

[a10] Let him bear the yoke!
Let man assume the drudgery of the god.
{{< /l >}}


Belet-ili, the midwife, is present.

[190] Let the midwife create a human being! Let man assume the drudgery of the god."

They summoned and asked the goddess the midwife of the gods, wise Mami:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
"Will you be the birth goddess, creatress of mankind?

[195] Create a human being, that he bear the yoke, let him bear the yoke, the task of Enlil, let man assume the drudgery of the god." 
{{< /l >}}


Nintu replied to the great gods:

{{< r a="Ninti" >}}
[200] "It is not for me to do it, the task is Enki's. He it is that cleanses all, let him provide me the clay so I can do the making."
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
[205] "On the first, seventh, and fifteenth days of the month, let me establish a purification, a bath. Let one god be slaughtered, then let the gods be cleansed by immersion.

[210] Let Nintu mix clay with his flesh and blood.

Let that same god and man be thoroughly mixed in the clay.
Let us hear the drum for the rest of the time.

[215] From the flesh of the god let a spirit remain, let it make the living know its sign,
lest he be allowed to be forgotten, let the spirit remain."
{{< /l >}}


The great Anunna-gods, who administer destinies, [220] answered "yes!" in the assembly.


### The Creation of Man

On the first, seventh, and fifteenth days of the month,note he established a purification, a bath.

They slaughtered Aw-ilu, who had the inspiration, in their assembly.

[225] Nintu mixed clay with his flesh and blood. That same god and man were thoroughly mixed in the clay.

For the rest of the time they would hear the drum.
From the flesh of the god the spirit remained.
It would make the living know its sign.

[230] Lest he be allowed to be forgotten, the spirit remained. 

After she had mixed the clay, she summoned the Anunna, the great gods. The Igigi, the great gods, spat upon the clay.


[235] Mami said to the great gods:

{{< r a="Mami" >}}
"You ordered me the task and I have completed it! You have slaughtered the god, along with his inspiration. [240] I have done away with your heavy forced labor, I have imposed your drudgery on man. You have bestowed clamor upon mankind. I have released the yoke, I have made restoration." 
{{< /r >}}



They heard this speech of hers, [245] they ran, free of care, and kissed her feet, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
"Formerly we used to call you Mami, now let your name be Belet-kala-ili:"
{{< /l >}}

[The human population increases and their noise disturbs the gods, who decide to wipe out mankind. The god Enki, however, sends a dream to Atrahasis. When the text resumes, Enki is still speaking.]


### Enki explains Atraḥasis' dream


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
[i.b35] Enlil committed an evil deed against the people.
{{< /l >}}


<!-- Atraḥasis replied to his lord: -->
{{< r a="Atrahasis" >}}
[i.c11] What is the meaning of the dream? Let me know so I may look out for its consequence.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
[i.c15] You might say 'Am I to be looking out while in the bedroom?' 

Do you pay attention to message that I speak for you.

[i.c20] 'Wall, listen to me! Reed wall, pay attention to all my words!

Flee the house, build a boat, forsake possessions, and save life.

[i.c25] The boat which you build ... be equal ... Roof her over like the depth..

[i.c30] so that the sun shall not see inside her.

Let her be roofed over fore and aft.

The gear should be very strong, the pitch should be firm, and so give the boat strength.

I will shower down on you later

[i.c35] a windfall of birds, a spate of fishes.'"

He opened the water clock and filled it, and told it of the coming of the seven-day deluge.
