First was the Golden Age. Then rectitude spontaneous in the heart prevailed, and faith.

Avengers were not seen, for laws unframed were all unknown and needless. 

Punishment and fear of penalties existed not.

No harsh decrees were fixed on brazen plates.

No suppliant multitude the countenance of Justice feared, averting, for they dwelt without a judge in peace. 

Descended not the steeps, shorn from its height, the lofty pine, cleaving the trackless waves of alien shores, nor distant realms were known to wandering men.

The towns were not entrenched for time of war; they had no brazen trumpets, straight, nor horns of curving brass, nor helmets, shields nor swords.

There was no thought of martial pomp —secure a happy multitude enjoyed repose.

Then of her own accord the earth produced a store of every fruit. 

The harrow touched her not, nor did the plowshare wound her fields. 

Man content with given food, and none compelling, gathered arbute fruits and wild strawberries on the mountain sides, and ripe blackberries clinging to the bush, and corners and sweet acorns on the ground, down fallen from the spreading tree of Jove. 

Eternal Spring! Soft breathing zephyrs soothed and warmly cherished buds and blooms, produced without a seed. The valleys though unplowed gave many fruits. The fields though not renewed white glistened with the heavy bearded wheat:
rivers flowed milk and nectar, and the trees, the very oak trees, then gave honey of themselves.

When Saturn had been banished into night and all the world was ruled by Jove supreme, the Silver Age, though not so good as gold but still surpassing yellow brass, prevailed.

Jove first reduced to years the Primal Spring, by him divided into periods four, unequal,—summer, autumn, winter, spring.— then glowed with tawny heat the parched air, or pendent icicles in winter froze and man stopped crouching in crude caverns, while he built his homes of tree rods, bark entwined.

Then were the cereals planted in long rows,
and bullocks groaned beneath the heavy yoke.

The third Age followed, called The Age of Bronze,
when cruel people were inclined to arms
but not to impious crimes. 

The ruthless and hard Age of Iron prevailed,
from which malignant vein great evil sprung;
and modesty and faith and truth took flight,
and in their stead deceits and snares and frauds
and violence and wicked love of gain,
succeeded.—

Then the sailor spread his sails to winds unknown, and keels that long had stood
on lofty mountains pierced uncharted waves.

Surveyors anxious marked with metes and bounds the lands, created free as light and air:
nor need the rich ground furnish only crops,
and give due nourishment by right required,—
they penetrated to the bowels of earth
and dug up wealth, bad cause of all our ills,—
rich ores which long ago the earth had hid
and deep removed to gloomy Stygian caves:
and soon destructive iron and harmful gold
were brought to light; and War, which uses both,
came forth and shook with sanguinary grip
his clashing arms. 

Rapacity broke forth— the guest was not protected from his host, the father in law from his own son in law; even brothers seldom could abide in peace.

The husband threatened to destroy his wife, and she her husband: horrid step dames mixed the deadly henbane: eager sons  nquired their fathers, ages. 

Piety was slain: and last of all the virgin deity, Astraea vanished from the blood-stained earth.

## GIANTS

And lest ethereal heights should long remain less troubled than the earth, the throne of Heaven
was threatened by the Giants; and they piled mountain on mountain to the lofty stars.
But Jove, omnipotent, shot thunderbolts through Mount Olympus, and he overturned
from Ossa huge, enormous Pelion.

While these dreadful bodies lay overwhelmed in their tremendous bulk, (so fame reports)
the Earth was reeking with the copious blood of her gigantic sons; and thus replete
with moisture she infused the steaming gore with life renewed. 

So that a monument of such ferocious stock should be retained, she made that offspring in the shape of man; but this new race alike despised the Gods, and by the greed of savage slaughter proved a sanguinary birth.
