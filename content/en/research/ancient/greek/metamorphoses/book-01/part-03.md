## Lycaon Changed To A Wolf

When, from his throne, the Son of Saturn Igigi viewed their deeds, he deeply groaned.

 <!-- and calling to his mind the loathsome feast Lycaon had prepared, a recent deed not common to report, -->

His soul conceived great anger —worthy Jove— and he convened a council. 

No delay detained the chosen Gods.

<!-- When skies are clear a path is well defined on high, which men, because so white, have named the Milky Way. -->

It makes a passage for the deities and leads to mansions of the Thunder God, to Jove's imperial home. 

On either side of its wide way the noble Gods are seen, inferior Gods in other parts abide, but there the potent and renowned of Heaven have fixed their homes.

<!-- It is a glorious place, our most audacious verse might designate the “Palace of High Heaven.”  -->

<!-- When the Gods were seated, therefore, in its marble halls the King of all above the throng sat high, and leaning on his ivory scepter, thrice, and once again he shook his awful locks, wherewith he moved the earth, and seas and stars, and thus indignantly began to speak. -->


{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
The time when serpent-footed giants strove to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven, not more than this event could cause alarm for my dominion of the universe.

Although it was a savage enemy, yet warred we with a single source derived of one. 

Now I must utterly destroy this mortal race wherever Nereus roars around the world.

Yea, by the Infernal Streams that glide through Stygian groves beneath the world, I swear it. 

Every method has been tried. 

The knife must cut immedicable wounds, lest maladies infect untainted parts.

Beneath my sway are demi gods and fauns, nymphs, rustic deities, sylvans of the hills, satyrs.

All of these, unworthy Heaven's abodes, we should at least permit to dwell on earth which we to them bequeathed.

What think ye, Gods, is safety theirs when I, your sovereign lord, the Thunder-bolt Controller, am ensnared by fierce Lycaon?

Ardent in their wrath, the astonished Gods demand revenge overtake this miscreant who dared commit such crimes.

<!-- 'Twas even thus when raged that impious band to blot the Roman name in sacred blood of Caesar, sudden apprehensive fears
of ruin absolute astonished man, and all the world convulsed.  -->

<!-- Nor is the love thy people bear to thee, Augustus, less than these displayed to Jupiter whose voice and gesture all the murmuring host restrained: and as indignant clamour ceased, suppressed by regnant majesty, Jove once again broke the deep silence with imperial words. -->

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
Dismiss your cares; he paid the penalty however all the crime and punishment now learn from this:—An infamous report of this unholy age had reached my ears, and wishing it were false, I sloped my course from high Olympus, and—although a God— 
disguised in human form I viewed the world.

It would delay us to recount the crimes unnumbered, for reports were less than truth.

I traversed Maenalus where fearful dens abound, over Lycaeus, wintry slopes of pine tree groves, across Cyllene steep; and as the twilight warned of night's approach, I stopped in that Arcadian tyrant's realms and entered his inhospitable home:

When I showed his people that a God had come, the lowly prayed and worshiped me, but this Lycaon mocked their pious vows and scoffing said;

A fair experiment will prove the truth if this be god or man.

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
He prepared to slay me in the night, to end my slumbers in the sleep of death.

So made he merry with his impious proof. But not content with this he cut the throat of a Molossian hostage sent to him, and partly softened his still quivering limbs in boiling water, partly roasted them on fires that burned beneath. 

When this flesh was served to me on tables, I destroyed his dwelling and his worthless Household Gods, with thunder bolts avenging. 

Terror-struck he took to flight, and on the silent plains is howling in his vain attempts to speak; he raves and rages and his greedy jaws, desiring their accustomed slaughter, turn against the sheep—still eager for their blood. 

His vesture separates in shaggy hair, his arms are changed to legs; and as a wolf he has the same grey locks, the same hard face, the same bright eyes, the same ferocious look.

## The Deluge

{{< l a="Enlil" >}}
Thus fell one house, but not one house alone deserved to perish.

Over all the earth ferocious deeds prevail,—all men conspire in evil.

Let them therefore feel the weight of dreadful penalties so justly earned, for such hath my unchanging will ordained.”

With exclamations, some approved the words of Enlil and added fuel to his wrath, while others gave assent.

But all deplored and questioned Earth being deprived of mortals. 

Who could offer frankincense upon the altars? 

Would he suffer earth to be despoiled by hungry beasts of prey?

The King of Gods forbade such idle questions of the state of man. 

But granted soon to people earth with race miraculous, unlike the first.
