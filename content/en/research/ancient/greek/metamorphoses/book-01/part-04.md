Enlil scattered his thunder bolts wide.

But he feared the flames, unnumbered, sacred ether might ignite and burn the axle of the universe.

He remembered in the scroll of fate, there is a time appointed when the sea and earth and Heavens shall melt, and fire destroy the universe of mighty labour wrought.

Such weapons by the skill of Cyclops forged, for different punishment he laid aside.

For straightway he preferred to overwhelm the mortal race beneath deep waves and storms from every raining sky.

Instantly he shut the Northwind in Aeolian caves, and every other wind that might dispel the gathering clouds. 

He bade the Southwind blow:

The Southwind flies abroad with dripping wings, concealing in the gloom his awful face:

The drenching rain descends from his wet beard and hoary locks.

Dark clouds are on his brows and from his wings and garments drip the dews: 

His great hands press the overhanging clouds; loudly the thunders roll; the torrents pour;

Iris, the messenger of Juno, clad in many coloured raiment, upward draws the steaming moisture to renew the clouds.

The standing grain is beaten to the ground, the rustic's crops are scattered in the mire, and he bewails the long year's fruitless toil.

Enlil's wrath was not content with powers that emanate from Heaven.

He brought to aid his azure brother, lord of flowing waves, who called upon the Rivers and the Streams.

When they entered his impearled abode, Enki, their ancient ruler, thus began.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
A long appeal is needless. Pour ye forth in rage of power; open up your fountains; rush over obstacles; let every stream pour forth in boundless floods. 
{{< /l >}}


Thus he commands, and none dissenting all the River Gods return, and opening up their fountains roll tumultuous to the deep unfruitful sea.

Enki with his trident smote the Earth, which trembling with unwonted throes heaved up the sources of her waters bare.

Through her open plains the rapid rivers rushed resistless, onward bearing the waving grain, the budding groves, the houses, sheep and men,—and holy temples, and their sacred urns.

The mansions that remained, resisting vast and total ruin, deepening waves concealed and whelmed their tottering turrets in the flood and whirling gulf.

Now one vast expanse, the land and sea were mingled in the waste of endless waves—a sea without a shore.

One desperate man seized on the nearest hill;
another sitting in his curved boat,
plied the long oar where he was wont to plow;
another sailed above his grain, above
his hidden dwelling; and another hooked
a fish that sported in a leafy elm.

Perchance an anchor dropped in verdant fields,
or curving keels were pushed through tangled vines;
and where the gracile goat enjoyed the green,
unsightly seals reposed. 

Beneath the waves were wondering Nereids, viewing cities, groves
and houses. 

Dolphins darting mid the trees, meshed in the twisted branches, beat against
the shaken oak trees. 

There the sheep, affrayed, swim with the frightened wolf, the surging waves float tigers and lions: availeth naught
his lightning shock the wild boar, nor avails the stag's fleet footed speed. The wandering bird,
seeking umbrageous groves and hidden vales,
with wearied pinion droops into the sea.

The waves increasing surge above the hills,
and rising waters dash on mountain tops.

Myriads by the waves are swept away, and those the waters spare, for lack of food,
starvation slowly overcomes at last.

A fruitful land and fair but now submerged beneath a wilderness of rising waves, 'Twixt Oeta and Aonia, Phocis lies,
where through the clouds Parnassus' summits twain point upward to the stars, unmeasured height,
save which the rolling billows covered all:

There in a small and fragile boat, arrived, Deucalion and the consort of his couch, prepared to worship the Corycian Nymphs, the mountain deities, and Themis kind, who in that age revealed in oracles the voice of fate. As he no other lived
so good and just, as she no other feared the Gods.

When Enlil beheld the globe in ruin covered, swept with wasting waves, and when he saw one man of myriads left, one helpless woman left of myriads lone, both innocent and worshiping the Gods, he scattered all the clouds; he blew away the great storms by the cold northwind.


Once more the earth appeared to heaven and the skies appeared to earth. 

The fury of the main abated, for the Ocean ruler laid his trident down and pacified the waves, and called on azure Triton.

Triton arose above the waving seas, his shoulders mailed in purple shells.—He bade the Triton blow, blow in his sounding shell, the wandering streams and rivers to recall with signal known: a hollow wreathed trumpet, tapering wide
and slender stemmed, the Triton took amain
and wound the pearly shell at midmost sea.

Betwixt the rising and the setting suns the wildered notes resounded shore to shore, and as it touched his lips, wet with the brine beneath his dripping beard, sounded retreat: and all the waters of the land and sea
obeyed. 

Their fountains heard and ceased to flow; their waves subsided; hidden hills uprose; emerged the shores of ocean; channels filled with flowing streams; the soil appeared; the land increased its surface as the waves decreased: and after length of days the trees put forth, with ooze on bending boughs, their naked tops.

All the wasted globe was now restored, but as he viewed the vast and silent world Noah [Deucalion] wept and thus to Naamah [Pyrrha] spoke:

{{< l a="Noah">}}
O sister! wife! alone of woman left! 

My kindred in descent and origin! Dearest companion of my marriage bed, doubly endeared by deepening dangers borne, of all the dawn and eve behold of earth, but you and I are left—for the deep sea has kept the rest! And what prevents the tide from overwhelming us? Remaining clouds affright us.

How could you endure your fears if you alone were rescued by this fate, and who would then console your bitter grief?

Oh be assured, if you were buried in the waves, that I would follow you and be with you!

Oh would that by my father's art I might restore the people, and inspire this clay to take the form of man.

Alas, the Gods decreed and only we are living!”
{{< /l >}}

They wept.


After he had spoken, they resolved to ask the aid of sacred oracles. 

And so they hastened to Cephissian waves which rolled a turbid flood in known channels. 

From there, they walked to the goddess' fane.

Its gables were befouled with reeking moss and on its altars every fire was cold.

But when the twain had reached the temple steps they fell on the earth, inspired with awe, and kissed the cold stone with their trembling lips, and said.

{{< r a="Noah" >}}
If righteous prayers appease the Gods, and if the wrath of high celestial powers may thus be turned, declare, O Themis! From where and how can we raise humanity? O gentle goddess help the dying world!
{{< /r >}}


Moved by their supplications, she replied;

{{< l a="Oracle">}}
Depart from me and veil your brows. Ungird your robes, and cast behind you as you go, the bones of your great mother.
{{< /l >}}

Long they stood in dumb amazement: Naamah refused the mandate and with trembling lips implored the goddess to forgive.

She feared to violate her mother's bones and vex her sacred spirit.

Often pondered they the words involved in such obscurity, repeating often. Thus, Noah to Epimetheus' daughter uttered speech
of soothing import.


{{< r a="Noah" >}}
Oracles are just. They urge not evil deeds, or naught avails the skill of thought. Our mother is the Earth, and I may judge the stones of earth are bones that we should cast behind us as we go.
{{< /r >}}


Although Pyrrha by his words was moved, she hesitated to comply.

Both amazed doubted the purpose of the oracle, but deemed no harm to come of trial. 

They, descending from the temple, veiled their heads and loosed their robes and threw some stones behind them. 

It is much beyond belief, were not receding ages witness, hard and rigid stones assumed a softer form, enlarging as their brittle nature changed to milder substance,—till the shape of man appeared, imperfect, faintly outlined first, as marble statue chiseled in the rough. 

The soft moist parts were changed to softer flesh, the hard and brittle substance into bones, the veins retained their ancient name. 

Now the Gods supreme ordained that every stone Noah threw should take the form of man, and those by Naamah cast should woman's form assume: so are we hardy to endure and prove by toil and deeds from what we sprung.
