3 Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb.

2 The agent of Enki appeared to him as a burning bush that was not consumed by its fire.

   <!-- flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. -->

3 And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.

4 And when Enki saw that he turned aside to see, Enki called to him from the bush, and said:

Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am!

5 Draw not nigh hither: put off your shoes, for the place where you stand is holy ground. 6 I am the God of your father, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.

Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look upon God.

7 I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt. I have heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know their sorrows.

8 I am come down to:
- deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and
- bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.

9 The cry of the children of Israel is come unto me. I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppress them.

10 Come now and I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt.

11 Who am I to go to Pharaoh to bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
12 Certainly I will be with you. This shall be a token to you, that I have sent you. When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.

13 Behold, I will come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them: The God of your fathers had sent me to you. They shall ask me 'What is his name?' What shall I say unto them?

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
14 I Am That I Am. You will tell to the children of Israel: I Am had sent me to you. 15 the God of your fathers, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, had sent me to you. This is my name forever. This is my memorial unto all generations.

16 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them: 'The Lord God of your fathers, of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, 'I have visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. 17 I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.'

18 They shall hearken to your voice. You and the elders of Israel shall come to the king of Egypt. You shall tell him: The Lord God of the Hebrews had met with us. Let us go, we beseech thee 3 days' journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God.

19 I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand.

20 I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go.

21 I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians. It shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.

22 But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment.

You shall put them on your sons and your daughters. You shall spoil the Egyptians.
