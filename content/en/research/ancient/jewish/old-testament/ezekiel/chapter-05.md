<sup>1</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barberâ€™s razor, and cause [it] to pass upon thine head and upon your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the [hair.]

<sup>2</sup> Burn 1/3 in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and you shalt take a third part, [and] smite about it with a knife: and a third part you shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them. 

<sup>3</sup> Take thereof a few in number, and bind them in your skirts. 

<sup>4</sup> Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; [for] thereof shall a fire come forth into all the Israelites.

<sup>5</sup> This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries [that are] round about her. 

<sup>6</sup> She has changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that [are] round about her.

For they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them. 

<sup>7</sup> Because you multiplied more than the nations that [are] round about you, [and] have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that [are] round about you

<sup>8</sup> Behold, I, even I, [am] against you, and will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations. 

<sup>9</sup> I will do in you that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations. 

<sup>10</sup> Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds. 

<sup>11</sup> You have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and abominations.

So I will diminish you. I will not spare you nor have any pity.

<sup>12</sup> A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of you.

A third part shall fall by the sword around you. 

I will:
- scatter a third part into all the winds
- draw out a sword after them

<sup>13</sup> Thus shall my anger be accomplished.

I will cause my fury to rest on them and I will be comforted.

They shall know that I Enki have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them. 

<sup>14</sup> I will make you waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all that pass by.

<sup>15</sup> So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the nations that are round about you, when I shall execute judgments in you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. 

I Enki have spoken it.

<sup>16</sup> When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, [and] which I will send to destroy you.

I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread: 

<sup>17</sup> So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you; and pestilence and blood shall pass through you and I will bring the sword upon you. 

I Enki have spoken it.
