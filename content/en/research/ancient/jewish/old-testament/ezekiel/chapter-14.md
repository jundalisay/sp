<sup>1</sup> Then came certain of the elders of Israel to me and sat before me. 

<sup>2</sup> I heard Enki saying:


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>3</sup> Son of man, these men have:
- set up their idols in their heart
- put the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face. 

Should I be enquired of at all by them? 

<sup>4</sup> Every man of the Israelites that sets up his idols in his heart, and puts the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and comes to the prophet, I Enki will answer him that comes according to the multitude of his idols

<sup>5</sup> I may take the Israelites in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols. 

<sup>6</sup> Tell the Israelites:

{{< r a="Ezekiel" >}}
Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols. Turn away from all your abominations.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>7</sup> There are Israelites and foreigners in Israel who:
- separate themselves from me
- sets up their idols in their hearts
- put the stumblingblock of iniquity before their faces
- come to a prophet to ask of me


<sup>8</sup> I will personally:
- set my face against them
- make them a sign and a proverb
- cut them off from my people

<sup>9</sup> If the prophet be deceived when he hath spoken a thing, I Enki have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch out my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst of my people Israel. 

<sup>10</sup> They shall bear the punishment of their iniquity: the punishment of the prophet shall be even as the punishment of him that seeks him

<sup>11</sup> The Israelites may go no more astray from me, neither be polluted any more with all their transgressions; but that they may be my people, and I may be their God.

<sup>12-13</sup> Son of man, when the land sinned against me by trespassing grievously, then will I stretch out mine hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof, and will send famine upon it, and will cut off man and beast from it.

<sup>14</sup> These 3 men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it.

But they deliver their own souls by their righteousness.

<sup>15</sup> I can cause noisome beasts to pass through the land and destroy it.

 <!-- be desolate, that no man may pass through because of the beasts:  -->

<sup>16</sup>  Though these 3 men were in it, as I live, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters; 

They only shall be delivered, but the land shall be desolate.

<sup>17</sup> Or if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast from it: 

<sup>18</sup> These 3 men were in it. They shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.

<sup>19</sup> Or [if] I send a pestilence into that land, and pour out my fury upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and
beast: 

<sup>20</sup> Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it. 

As long as I live, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall [but] deliver their own souls by their righteousness. 

<sup>21</sup> How much more when I send my four sore judgments upon Jerusalem, the sword, and the famine, and the noisome beast, and the pestilence, to cut off from it man and beast?

<sup>22</sup> Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, [both] sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and you shall see their way and their doings.

You shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, [even] concerning all that I have brought upon it.

<sup>23</sup> They shall comfort you, when you see their ways and their doings: and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it
