<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, set your face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them.

3} Tell the Ammonites, Hear the word of Enki:

"Because you saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity; 4} Behold, therefore I will deliver you to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in you, and make their dwellings in you: they shall eat your fruit, and they shall drink your milk. 

5 I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and you shall
know that I am the Lord.

6 Enki said:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Because you hast clapped [thine] hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all your despite against the land of Israel; 

7 So I will stretch out mine hand upon you, and will deliver you for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut you off from the people, and I will cause you to perish out of the countries: I will destroy you; and you shalt know that I am the Lord. 

8 Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah [is] like unto all the heathen; 9} Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities [which are] on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal- meon, and Kiriathaim, 10} Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations. 11} And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the Lord.

12 Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them; 

13 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword. 14} And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith Enki.

15 Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy [it] for the old hatred.

16 Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.

17 I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
