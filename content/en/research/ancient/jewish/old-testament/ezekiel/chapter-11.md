<sup>1</sup> The spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the east gate of Enkiâ€™s house, which looketh eastward.

At the door of the gate were 25 men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people.

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, these are the men who devise mischief, and give wicked counsel in this  city: {11:3} Which say, [It is] not near; let us build houses: this [city is] the caldron, and we [be] the flesh. {11:4} Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son
of man.

<sup>5</sup> The Spirit of Enki fell on me saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
Israelites, I know the things that come into your mind, every one of them. 

6 Ye have:
- multiplied your slain in this city
- filled its streets with the slain

7 Your slain are the flesh, and this city is the caldron. But I will bring you forth out of the midst of it. 

8 You have feared the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you.

9 I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you.

10 Ye shall fall by the sword. I will judge you in the border of Israel. You shall know that I am the Lord.

11 This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall you be the flesh in the midst thereof; [but] I will judge you in the border of Israel

12 You shall know that I am the Lord: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that [are] round about you.

13 While I was prophesying, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. 

Then fell I down on my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said:

{{< r a="Ezekiel" >}}
Lord Enki! wilt you make a full end of the remnant of Israel? 
{{< /r >}}


14 The word of Enki came unto me, saying:

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
15 Son of man, your brethren, [even] your brethren, the men of your kindred, and all the Israelites wholly, [are] they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Enki: unto us is this land given in possession. {11:16} Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Enki.

Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. {11:17} Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even gather you from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.

18 They shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence. 

19 I will:
- give them one heart
- put a new spirit within you
- take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh

20 They may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them. They shall be my people, and I will be their God.

21 But as for those whose heart walks after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads

22 Then the cherubims lifted up their wings, and the wheels beside them.

The glory of the God of Israel was over them above.

23 The glory of Enki went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which [is] on the east side of the city. 

24 Afterwards the spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.

25 Then I spake unto them of the captivity all the things that Enki had shewed me.
