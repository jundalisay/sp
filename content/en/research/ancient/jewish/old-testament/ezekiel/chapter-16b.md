<sup>24</sup> You have also:
- built an eminent place for yourself, and a high place in every street. 
- <sup>25</sup> built your high place at every head of the way
- made your beauty abhorred
- opened your feet to every one that passed by
- multiplied your whoredoms
- <sup>26</sup> committed fornication with the Egyptians your neighbours, great of flesh
- have increased your whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.

<sup>27</sup> Therefore, I:
- have stretched out my hand over you
- have reduced your ordinary food
- delivered you unto the will of those who hate you, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed of your lewd way. 

<sup>28</sup> You have played:
- the whore also with the Assyrians, because you wast unsatiable.
- the harlot with them, and yet couldest not be satisfied.

<sup>29</sup> You have multiplied your fornication in the land of Canaan unto Chaldea.

Yet you were not satisfied. 

<sup>30</sup> How weak is your heart seeing you doe all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman?

<sup>31</sup> You:
- build your eminent place in the head of every way
- make your high place in every street


<sup>32</sup> You have not been as an harlot in that you scornest hire, but a wife who committed adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband! 

<sup>33</sup> They give gifts to all whores.

But you:
- give your gifts to all your lovers
- hire them so that they may come to you on every side for your whoredom

  <!-- in you from [other] women in your whoredoms, whereas -->

<sup>34</sup> The contrary is the other [Israelites] who did not follow you to commit whoredoms.

<!-- : and in that thou givest a reward, and no reward is given unto you, therefore you art contrary. -->

<sup>35-36</sup> O harlot:
- your filthiness was poured out
- your nakedness was discovered through:
  - your whoredoms with your lovers and with the idols of your abominations
  - by the blood of your children which you gave to them

<sup>37</sup> So I will gather all your lovers to see your nakedness

<!-- , with whom you hast taken pleasure, and all [them] that you hast loved, with all [them] that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against you, and will discover your nakedness unto them, that they may see all .  -->

<sup>38</sup> I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged.

I will give you blood in fury and jealousy. 

<sup>39</sup> I will also give you into their hand.

They shall:
- throw down your eminent place
- break down your high places
- strip you also of your clothes
- take your fair jewels
- leave you naked and bare. 
- <sup>40</sup> bring up a company against you
- stone you 
- thrust you with their swords.
- <sup>41</sup> burn your houses with fire
- execute judgments on you in the sight of many women

I will cause you to cease from playing the harlot, and you also shall give no hire any more. 

<sup>42</sup> This will calm me down.

 <!-- So will I make my fury toward you to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry. -->

<sup>43</sup> You have not remembered the days of your youth.

You have fretted me in all these things.

So I will also recompense your way on your head.

You shall not commit this lewdness above all your abominations.

<sup>44</sup> Every one that uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you: **As is the mother, so is her daughter.**

<sup>45</sup> You are:
- your motherâ€™s daughter, that lothed her husband and her children.
- the sister of your sisters, which lothed their husbands and their children

Your mother was a Hittite.

Your father was an Amorite

<sup>46</sup> Your elder sister is Samaria.

She and her daughters dwell at your left hand.

Your younger sister is Sodom and her daughters.
- They dwell at your right hand

<sup>47</sup> Yet you have not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations.

But, you were more corrupted than they in all your ways, as if that were a very little thing.

<sup>48</sup> As I live, Sodom your sister hath not done, she nor her daughters, as you hast done, you and your daughters. 

<sup>49</sup> The iniquity of your sister Sodom were:
- pride
- fullness of bread
- abundance of idleness in her and her daughters

They did not strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.

<sup>50</sup> They were haughty, and committed abomination before me.

Therefore, I took them away as I saw good.

<sup>51</sup> Neither had Samaria committed half of your sins.

But you have:
- multiplied your abominations more than they 
- justified your sisters in all your abominations
- <sup>51</sup> judged your sisters, bearing your own shame for your sins more abominable than theirs

They are more righteous than you.

: yea, be you confounded also, and bear your shame, in that you hast justified your sisters. 

<sup>53</sup> After I make capitves of Sodom and Samaria and their daughters, I will make you captives for them to see.

<sup>55</sup> In that way, you may:
- bear your own shame
- be confounded in all that you have done, in that you art a comfort to them.

<sup>55</sup> You and your daughters shall return to your former estate after Sodom and Samaria and their daughters return to theirs

<sup>56</sup> Your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day of your pride.

<sup>57</sup> The daughters of Syria and all around her discovered your wickedness and reproached you. 
- This included the daughters of the Philistines who despise everything about you.

<sup>58</sup> You have borne your lewdness and your abominations.

<sup>59</sup> I will even deal with you as you have done, which has despised the oath and broken the covenant.

<sup>60</sup> Nevertheless, I will:
- remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth
- establish an everlasting covenant with you

<sup>61</sup> Then you shall remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters, elder and your younger.

I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant. 

<sup>62</sup> I will establish my covenant with you. And you shall know that I am the Lord.

<sup>63</sup> After I am pacified toward you for all that you have done, then you will remember and never open your mouth any more because of your shame.
