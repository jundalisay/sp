<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, you live in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see, but see not.

They have ears to hear, but hear not for they are a rebellious house. 

<sup>3</sup> Therefore, prepare your stuff for moving, and move from your place to another place by day in their sight.

They might consider, even if they are a rebellious house. 

<sup>4</sup> You shall go forth at even in their sight, as they that go into captivity.

<sup>5</sup> Dig you through the wall in their sight, and carry out thereby. 

<!-- Then bring forth your stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving. -->

<sup>6</sup> In their sight, you shall:
- bear it on your shoulders
- carry it forth in the twilight
- cover your face, that you see not the ground

For I have set a sign for you to the Israelites. 
{{< /l >}}


<sup>7</sup> I did so as I was commanded. I:
- brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for captivity 
- dug through the wall with my hand

I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it on my shoulder in their sight.


<sup>8</sup> In the morning, Enki said to me:


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>9</sup> Son of man, the rebellious Israelites have said to you:
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Israelites" >}}
What are you doing!?
{{< /r >}}

{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>10</sup> Say: 
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Ezekiel" >}}
Enki says that this burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem, and all the Israelites that are among them.

<sup>11</sup> I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done to them. They shall remove and go into captivity.
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>12</sup> The prince among them shall:
- bear on his shoulder in the twilight
- go forth

They shall dig through the wall to carry out thereby.

He shall cover his face, that he see not the ground with his eyes.

<sup>13</sup> I will also spread my net on him. He shall be taken in my snare.

I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans. Yet he shall not see it, though he shall die there. 

<sup>14</sup> I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to help him, and all his bands.

I will draw out the sword after them. 

<sup>15</sup> They shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall scatter them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.

<sup>16</sup> But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence so that they:
- may declare all their abominations among the heathen whither they come.
- shall know that I am the Lord.

<sup>17-18</sup> Eat your bread with quaking. Drink your water with trembling and with carefulness.

<sup>19</sup> Say to the people:
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Ezekiel" >}}
The Lord of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment.

This is so that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the violence of the people living there.
 <!-- dwell therein. -->
{{< /r >}}



{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>20</sup> The cities shall be laid waste. The land shall be desolate. You shall know that I am the Lord.

<sup>21-22</sup> Son of man, you in the land of Israel have a proverb: The days are prolonged, and every vision fails.

<sup>23</sup> Tell them:
- I will make this proverb to cease
- they shall no longer use it as a proverb in Israel
- the days are at hand
- the effect of every vision

<sup>24</sup> For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering divination within the Israelites. 

<sup>25</sup> I am the Lord. The word that I shall speak shall come to pass. It shall not be delayed any more.

I will say the word and will perform it in your days, O rebellious house.

<sup>26-27</sup> The Israelites say:
{{< /l >}}

{{< r a="Israelites" >}}
The vision that you see is still far away. He prophesies of the times that are far off. 
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Enki" >}}
<sup>28</sup> So say to them: 
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Ezekiel" >}}
Enki said that there shall my words will no longer be delayed, it shall be done.
{{< /r >}}
