<sup>1-2</sup> [To Ezekiel] Son of man, make Jerusalem aware of her abominations. 

<sup>3</sup> Tell them that I say to Jerusalem that:
- their birth and nativity is of the land of Canaan
- their father was an Amorite
- their mother was a Hittite

<sup>4</sup> In the day they were born, their navel was not cut, neither were they washed in water to supple them. 

They were not salted nor swaddled at all.

<sup>5</sup> No one cared about them. They were cast out in the open field.
<!-- , to the lothing of their person when they were born. -->

<sup>6</sup> I passed by you, polluted in your own blood. I said to you: Live! 

<sup>7</sup> I have caused you to multiply as the bud of the field. You have increased and waxen great. 

You are come to excellent ornaments: your breasts are fashioned. Your hair is grown, whereas you were naked and bare. 

<sup>8</sup> When I passed by you, and looked at you, your time was the time of love.

I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness.

I sware unto you, and entered into a covenant with you, and you became mine.

<sup>9</sup> Then I washed you with water. I throughly washed away your blood from you, and anointed you with oil. 

<sup>10</sup> I clothed you also with broidered work, and shod you with badgersâ€™ skin.

I girded you about with fine linen, and I covered you with silk.

<sup>11</sup> I decked you also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon your hands, and a chain on your neck. 

<sup>12</sup> I put a jewel on your forehead, and earrings in thine ears, and a beautiful crown upon thine head.

<sup>13</sup> And so you were decked with gold and silver.

Your raiment was of fine linen, silk, and broidered work.

You are fine flour, honey, and oil.

You were exceedingly beautiful. You prospered into a kingdom. 

<sup>14</sup> Your renown went forth among the heathen for your beauty.

It was perfect because of my comeliness, which I had put on you.

<sup>15</sup> But you:
- trusted in your own beauty
- played the harlot because of your renown
- poured out your fornications on every one that passed by

<sup>16</sup> You:
- took your garments
- decked your high places with diverse colours
- played the harlot

[The like things] shall not come, neither shall it be so.


<sup>17</sup> You have also:
- taken your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you*
- made to yourself images of men
- commit whoredom with them
- <sup>18</sup> took your broidered garments, and covered them
- have set my oil and mine incense before them

{{< n n="The Anunnaki created humans to mine gold and minerals for them" >}}


<sup>19</sup> The meat, fine flour, oil, and honey, that I gave you, you even set it before men for a sweet savour.

<sup>20</sup> You bore sons and daughters through me which you sacrificed to be devoured.

<sup>20</sup> Is this of your whoredoms a small matter?

<sup>21</sup> That you have slain my children, and caused them to pass through the fire?*

{{< n n="The Jews killed off the Nephilim, as seen in David slaying Goliath" >}}


<sup>22</sup> In your abominations and whoredoms, you have forgotten the days of your youth, when you were:
- naked and bare
- polluted in your blood

<sup>23</sup> And it came to pass after all your wickedness, woe, woe unto you!
