### 1. Lineage of King Goujian of Yue

King Goujian of Yue was a distant descendant of Yu the Great, and the illegitimate son of Shaokang, an emperor of the Xia dynasty.

He was enfeoffed at Kuaiji to guard and maintain the ancestral sacrifices to Yu. 

The people tattooed their bodies and cut their hair short. They cleared the grass and woods to build their settlements. 

After more than 20 generations, the lineage reached Yunchang.


### 2. War with Wu Begins

In Yunchang’s time, he fought with King Helü of Wu. They harbored mutual enmity. 

When Yunchang died, his son Goujian ascended the throne as King of Yue.


### 3. First Campaigns Against Wu

In Goujian’s first year, King Helü of Wu heard of Yunchang’s death and raised an army to attack Yue. 

King Goujian sent warriors ready to die, who marched 3 ranks deep, approached the Wu lines, and slit their own throats. 

As the Wu army looked on, Yue forces suddenly attacked, defeating Wu at Zuili and wounding King Helü. 

As he lay dying, Helü told his son Fuchai: “Never forget Yue.”


### 4. Yue’s Defeat and Siege at Kuaiji

By Goujian’s third year, he heard that King Fuchai of Wu was drilling his troops day and night to avenge his father. 

Goujian wanted to strike first. 

His minister Fan Li remonstrated: 

“This must not be done. Weapons are ominous tools, war opposes virtue, and contention is the end of proper affairs. Plotting in secret, opposing virtue, and delighting in weapons—such things Heaven forbids; those who do them will not prosper.” 

Goujian ignored him, attacked Wu, but was defeated at Fujiao. With only 5,000 troops left, he retreated to Kuaiji Mountain. Wu pursued and besieged him.


### 5. Goujian’s Humiliation and Submission to Wu

King Goujian said to Fan Li, “We are in this plight because I did not listen to you—what now?” 

Fan Li replied: “To sustain fullness is Heaven’s gift; to reverse ruin is a matter for men; to manage affairs is to rely on the land. Send humble words and rich gifts; if they will not accept them, then sell yourself into service.” 

Goujian agreed. 

He sent his minister Wen Zhong to Wu, crawling on his knees and knocking his head on the ground, saying: “My king, Goujian, sends his servant Zhong to humbly beg you: Goujian will serve you as a subject, and his wife will become your concubine.” 

Wu’s king was about to agree, but the minister Wu Zixu advised: “Heaven has given Yue to Wu—do not spare them.”


Goujian then considered killing his wife and children, burning his treasures, and fighting to the death, but Wen Zhong stopped him, saying: 

“The Wu grandee Bo Pi is greedy—he can be bribed. Let me try.” 

Goujian sent beautiful women and treasures to Bo Pi, who accepted them and interceded for Goujian. 

Wu Zixu again warned King Fuchai: “If you do not destroy Yue now, you will regret it. Goujian is a wise ruler, and Wen Zhong and Fan Li are good ministers. If they return home, they will cause trouble.” Fuchai ignored him, pardoned Yue, lifted the siege, and returned home.


### 6. Goujian’s Years of Endurance (“Sleeping on firewood, tasting gall”)

Back in Yue, Goujian lived with hardship, hung a gall bladder above his bed, and whenever he lay down or ate, he tasted its bitterness, saying: “Have you forgotten the humiliation of Kuaiji?” 

He worked his own fields, his wife wove her own cloth, he ate no meat, and wore no richly colored clothes. He humbled himself to employ worthy men, treated guests generously, and shared the hardships of the people.


### 7. Goujian Bides His Time

Seven years after returning, Goujian nursed his soldiers and civilians, planning revenge on Wu. 

Ministers counseled patience: “Strengthen ties with Qi, Chu, and Jin, and only later strike Wu.” Goujian agreed.


### 8–11. Yue’s Final Conquest of Wu

Years passed. Wu’s king killed Wu Zixu despite his warnings. Eventually, when Wu sent its main army north, Fan Li told Goujian, “Now is the time.” 

Yue struck Wu, first making peace temporarily, then striking again. 

Yue’s armies crushed Wu, besieging it for three years. Wu was exhausted; Fuchai sued for peace, crawling bare-chested to plead. 

Goujian almost relented, but Fan Li urged him: “When Heaven gave Yue to Wu, Wu refused. Now Heaven gives Wu to Yue—how can you refuse Heaven?” 

Yue pressed the attack; Fuchai committed suicide in shame, covering his face: “I have no face to meet Wu Zixu in death.” Goujian buried him with honors and executed Bo Pi.


### 12. Goujian’s Hegemony

Goujian then led his armies north across the Huai River, met with the lords of Qi and Jin, and paid tribute to Zhou. The Zhou king gave him sacrificial meat and named him Hegemon. Yue was celebrated as overlord of the realm.


### 13–14. Aftermath

Fan Li foresaw danger and left Yue, writing to Wen Zhong: “When the birds are gone, the bow is put away; when the hare is dead, the hound is cooked. 

King Goujian can share hardship, but not comfort. Why not leave?” Wen Zhong stayed, fell victim to slander, and was forced to commit suicide by Goujian.



### 15–16. Decline of Yue

Goujian died; his descendants continued to reign. Later, under King Wuqiang, Yue fought Chu and Qi but was finally destroyed by Chu. The Yue people dispersed to the south and along the coast.



### 17. Legacy

Seven generations later, Minjun Yao helped the feudal lords destroy Qin. Emperor Gao of Han reestablished him as King of Yue to maintain Yue’s ancestral sacrifices. Eastern Yue and Minyue descended from this line.


### 18–26. Fan Li’s Later Life

Fan Li, after helping Goujian, foresaw trouble, changed his name to Chi Yi Zipi, became the wealthy merchant “Lord Tao Zhu,” moved three times, and each time gained honor and wealth. He died peacefully, and later generations praised him as the ideal loyal minister and clever merchant.


### 27. Sima Qian’s Judgment

The Grand Historian comments:

“Yu’s achievements were immense: he dredged the nine rivers, regulated the nine provinces, and brought peace to the land of the Xia. 

His descendant Goujian endured hardship, destroyed powerful Wu, displayed his troops to the Central States, honored the Zhou royal house, and was acclaimed as Hegemon. Can Goujian not be called worthy?

He inherited Yu’s heroic legacy. Fan Li, who moved three times, each time earning honor, left his name for all generations. With such a ruler and such a minister, how could they not become renowned?”
