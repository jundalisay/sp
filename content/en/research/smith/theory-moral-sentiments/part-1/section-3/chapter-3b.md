{{< s v="34" >}} The rich and the great can set or lead fashion because of our disposition to admire and consequently to imitate them.
- Their dress is the fashionable dress.
- Their language of conversation is the fashionable style.
- Their air and deportment is the fashionable behaviour.
- Even their vices and follies are fashionable.

Most people are proud to imitate and resemble them in the very qualities which dishonour them.

Vain men often give themselves airs of a fashionable profligacy.
<!-- In their hearts, they do not approve of it.
Perhaps they are really not guilty of it.
 -->
- They want to be praised for what they themselves do not think praise-worthy.
- They are ashamed of unfashionable virtues:
  - which they sometimes practise in secret, and
  - which they secretly venerate.

There are hypocrites of wealth and greatness, as well as of religion and virtue.

A vain man tends to pretend to be what he is not, as a cunning man is in the other.
- He assumes the equipage and splendid way of living of his superiors.
- He does not consider that their praise-worthiness is in their suitableness to that situation and fortune= 
  - which require them and
  - which can easily support the expence.

Many poor men place their glory in being thought of as rich. They do not consider that the duties which that reputation imposes on him, must soon reduce him to beggary.
 
**In the lower ranks, the road to fortune is through virtue, but in the upper ranks, the road is through vice.**


{{< s v="35" >}} The candidates for fortune too frequently abandon virtue to attain this envied situation because the road to fortune is sometimes opposite from the road to virtue.

The ambitious man thinks that the lustre of his future conduct will entirely cover the foulness of the steps he used to get there. He flatters himself that while he advances= 
- he will have so many ways to command mankind's respect, and
- he will be able to act with superior propriety.

In many governments, the candidates for the highest positions are above the law.
- If they can reach those positions, they will not be afraid of the consequences of how they acquired it.
- That is why they often try to destroy those who stand in the way of their greatness by= 
  - fraud and falsehood
  - sometimes by murder and assassination
  - rebellion and civil war.

They frequently fail. They commonly gain only the disgraceful punishment for their crimes. Even if they are so lucky to attain success, they are always most miserably disappointed in the happiness they expected.

The ambitious man really pursues a very misunderstood honour and not ease or pleasure.
- This honour is polluted by the baseness of how he rose to it.
- He tries to remove this bad memory through= 
  - great spending,
  - excessive indulgence in every profligate pleasure,
    - the hurry of public business, and
    - the prouder and more dazzling tumult of war.


The memory of his misdeeds always haunts him. He is still secretly pursued by the avenging furies of shame and remorse= 

<!-- He can erase the remembrance of what he has done from his own memory and from others.
But that remembrance always pursues him. -->
<!-- In vain, he invokes the dark and dismal powers of forgetfulness and oblivion.
He remembers what he has done.
That remembrance tells him that other people must likewise remember it.
 -->
- amidst all the gaudy pomp of the most ostentatious greatness,
- amidst the venal and vile adulation of the great and the learned,
- amidst the more innocent, though more foolish, acclamations of the common people, and
- amidst all the pride of conquest and the triumph of a successful war.

Glory seems to surround him on all sides. But in his imagination, he sees black and foul infamy fast pursuing him.


<!-- It is always ready to overtake him from behind. -->
Even the great Caesar could not dismiss his suspicions, even though he had the magnanimity to dismiss his guards.
- The remembrance of Pharsalia still haunted and pursued him.
- At the senate's request, he had the generosity to pardon Marcellus.
- He told the senate that he was aware of their plot against his life.
- But as he had lived long enough for nature and glory, he= 
  - was contented to die and
  - therefore despised all conspiracies

He had, perhaps, lived long enough for nature. But a man has certainly lived too long for real glory if he felt that he was the object of deadly resentment from his friends. 


### Notes for this chapter

The feeling of approbation is always agreeable. I based it on sympathy.

But people have objected that it is inconsistent in my system to admit any disagreeable sympathy. 

I answer, that in the feeling of approbation, there are 2 things to notice:
1. The observer's sympathetic feeling 
2. The observer's feeling (Feeling C) after he sees the perfect coincidence between his sympathetic feeling (Feeling B) and the original feeling (Feeling A) in the observee.

The feeling of approbation is in the last emotion (Feeling C) and is always agreeable. 

The second emotion (Feeling B) may be agreeable or disagreeable, according to the nature of the original emotion (Feeling A). 

That second emotion must always retain some features of the original emotion.
