<!-- 
We have only two things further to mention relating to the price of commodities= 
    Interest
    Exchange
 -->

It is commonly supposed that:
- the premium of interest depends on the value of gold and silver
- the value of gold and silver are regulated by their quantity 
  - As the quantity increases, the value declines
  - As the quantity decreases, the value rises.

**However, the premium of interest is regulated by the quantity of stock.**

Around the time of the discovery of the West Indies, the common interest rate was at 10% or 12%.
- Since that time, it has gradually declined.

Under the feudal constitution, stock could not be accumulated:
<!--     which will appear from considering the situation of those three orders of men, which made up the whole body of the people=  the peasants, the landlords, and the merchants.
 -->
- The peasants had leases which depended on their masters' caprice. 
  - They could never increase in wealth because the landlord was ready to squeeze it all from them. And so they had no motive to acquire it.
- The landlords' wealth could only be increased a little as they were indolent and involved in perpetual wars.
- The merchants were again oppressed by all ranks.
  - They were not able to secure the produce of their industry from rapine and violence.

<!-- Thus, there could be little accumulation of wealth at all. -->

But after the fall of the feudal government, these obstacles to industry were removed. The stock of commodities began to increase gradually.

<!-- What one trade lends to another is not so much to be considered as money, as commodities 
 -->

A loan is usually done in money. But this is immediately turned into stock. 

Thus, it is the quantity of stock that enables you to make more loans.

**The rate of interest is entirely regulated by this circumstance.**

If there were so many borrowers but only a few lenders then the interest rate would be high.

But if the amount of stock on hand were so great as to enable many to lend, then it would fall proportionably.*

{{< n n="This is overturned by Keynes who made expectation as the cause of interest rates as liquidity preference. This is why central banks can increase or decrease productivity unnaturally by setting interest rates. But this leads to bubbles if productivity is pushed when there was really no productivity, or anti-innovation if interest rates were increased when real productivity was being naturally generated." >}}
