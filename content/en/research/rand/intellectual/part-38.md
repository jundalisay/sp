<!-- Some of you might plead the excuse of your ignorance, of a limited mind and  a limited range. But the damned and the guiltiest among you are the men who had the capacity to know, yet chose to blank out reality, the men who were
willing to sell their intelligence into cynical servitude to force: the contemptible
breed of those mystics of science who profess a devotion to some sort of ‘pure
knowledge’—the purity consisting of their claim that such knowledge has no
practical purpose on this earth—who reserve their logic for inanimate matter, but
believe that the subject of dealing with men requires and deserves no rationality,
who scorn money and sell their souls in exchange for a laboratory supplied by
loot. And since there is no such thing as ‘non-practical knowledge’ or any sort of
‘disinterested’ action, since they scorn the use of their science for the purpose
and profit of life, they deliver their science to the service of death, to the only
practical purpose it can ever have for looters: to inventing weapons of coercion
and destruction. They, the intellects who seek escape from moral values, they are
the damned on this earth, theirs is the guilt beyond forgiveness. Do you hear me,
Dr. Robert Stadler? -->

<!-- “But it is not to him that I wish to speak. I am speaking to those among you
who have retained some sovereign shred of their soul, unsold and unstamped:
‘—to the order of others.’ If, in the chaos of the motives that have made you
listen to the radio tonight, there was an honest, rational desire to learn what is
wrong with the world, you are the man whom I wished to address. By the rules
and terms of my code, one owes a rational statement to those whom it does
concern and who’re making an effort to know. Those who’re making an effort to
fail to understand me, are not a concern of mine. -->

I am speaking to those who want to live and to recapture the honor of their soul.

<!-- Now that you know the truth about your world, stop supporting your own
destroyers. The evil of the world is made possible by nothing but the sanction
you give it. Withdraw your sanction. Withdraw your support. Do not try to live
on your enemies’ terms or to win at a game where they’re setting the rules. Do
not seek the favor of those who enslaved you, do not beg for alms from those
who have robbed you, be it subsidies, loans or jobs, do not join their team to
recoup what they’ve taken by helping them rob your neighbors. One cannot hope
to maintain one’s life by accepting bribes to condone one’s destruction. Do not
struggle for profit, success or security at the price of a lien on your right to exist.
Such a lien is not to be paid off; the more you pay them, the more they will
demand; the greater the values you seek or achieve, the more vulnerably helpless
you become. Theirs is a system of white blackmail devised to bleed you, not by
means of your sins, but by means of your love for existence. -->

<!-- “Do not attempt to rise on the looters’ terms or to climb a ladder while they’re
holding the ropes. Do not allow their hands to touch the only power that keeps
them in power: your living ambition. Go on strike—in the manner I did. Use
your mind and skill in private, extend your knowledge, develop your ability, but
do not share your achievements with others. Do not try to produce a fortune,
with a looter riding on your back. Stay on the lowest rung of their ladder, earn no
more than your barest survival, do not make an extra penny to support the
looters’ state. Since you’re captive, act as a captive, do not help them pretend
that you’re free. Be the silent, incorruptible enemy they dread. When they force
you, obey—but do not volunteer. Never volunteer a step in their direction, or a
wish, or a plea, or a purpose. Do not help a holdup man to claim that he acts as
your friend and benefactor. Do not help your jailers to pretend that their jail is
your natural state of existence. Do not help them to fake reality. That fake is the
only dam holding off their secret terror, the terror of knowing they’re unfit to
exist; remove it and let them drown; your sanction is their only life belt.
“If you find a chance to vanish into some wilderness out of their reach, do so,
but not to exist as a bandit or to create a gang competing with their racket; build
a productive life of your own with those who accept your moral code and are
willing to struggle for a human existence. You have no chance to win on the
Morality of Death or by the code of faith and force; raise a standard to which the
honest will repair: the standard of Life and Reason. -->

Act as a rational being and aim at becoming a rallying point for all those who
are starved for a voice of integrity—act on your rational values, whether alone in
the midst of your enemies, or with a few of your chosen friends, or as the
founder of a modest community on the frontier of mankind’s rebirth.

When the looters’ state collapses, deprived of the best of its slaves, when it
falls to a level of impotent chaos, like the mystic-ridden nations of the Orient,
and dissolves into starving robber gangs fighting to rob one another—when the
advocates of the morality of sacrifice perish with their final ideal—then and on
that day we will return.

“We will open the gates of our city to those who deserve to enter, a city of
smokestacks, pipe lines, orchards, markets and inviolate homes. We will act as
the rallying center for such hidden outposts as you’ll build. With the sign of the
dollar as our symbol—the sign of free trade and free minds—we will move to
reclaim this country once more from the impotent savages who never discovered
its nature, its meaning, its splendor. Those who choose to join us, will join us;
those who don’t, will not have the power to stop us; hordes of savages have
never been an obstacle to men who carried the banner of the mind.

Then this country will once more become a sanctuary for a vanishing
species: the rational being. The political system we will build is contained in a
single moral premise: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to
physical force. Every man will stand or fall, live or die by his rational judgment.
If he fails to use it and falls, he will be his only victim. If he fears that his
judgment is inadequate, he will not be given a gun to improve it. If he chooses to
correct his errors in time, he will have the unobstructed example of his betters,
for guidance in learning to think; but an end will be put to the infamy of paying
with one life for the errors of another.


In that world, you’ll be able to rise in the morning with the spirit you had
known in your childhood: that spirit of eagerness, adventure and certainty which
comes from dealing with a rational universe. No child is afraid of nature; it is
your fear of men that will vanish, the fear that has stunted your soul, the fear you
acquired in your early encounters with the incomprehensible, the unpredictable,
the contradictory, the arbitrary, the hidden, the faked, the irrational in men. You
will live in a world of responsible beings, who will be as consistent and reliable
as facts; the guarantee of their character will be a system of existence where
objective reality is the standard and the judge. Your virtues will be given
protection, your vices and weaknesses will not. Every chance will be open to
your good, none will be provided for your evil. What you’ll receive from men
will not be alms, or pity, or mercy, or forgiveness of sins, but a single value:
justice. And when you’ll look at men or at yourself, you will feel, not disgust,
suspicion and guilt, but a single constant: respect.

“Such is the future you are capable of winning. It requires a struggle; so does
any human value. All life is a purposeful struggle and your only choice is the
choice of a goal. Do you wish to continue the battle of your present or do you
wish to fight for my world? Do you wish to continue a struggle that consists of
clinging to precarious ledges in a sliding descent to the abyss, a struggle where
the hardships you endure are irreversible and the victories you win bring you
closer to destruction? Or do you wish to undertake a struggle that consists of
rising from ledge to ledge in a steady ascent to the top, a struggle where the
hardships are investments in your future, and the victories bring you irreversibly
closer to the world of your moral ideal, and should you die without reaching full
sunlight, you will die on a level touched by its rays? Such is the choice before
you. Let your mind and your love of existence decide.


The last of my words will be addressed to those heroes who might still be
hidden in the world, those who are held prisoner, not by their evasions, but by
their virtues and their desperate courage. My brothers in spirit, check on your
virtues and on the nature of the enemies you’re serving. Your destroyers hold
you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, your love—
the endurance that carries their burdens—the generosity that responds to their
cries of despair—the innocence that is unable to conceive of their evil and gives
them the benefit of every doubt, refusing to condemn them without
understanding and incapable of understanding such motives as theirs—the love,
your love of life, which makes you believe that they are men and that they love
it, too. But the world of today is the world they wanted; life is the object of their
hatred. Leave them to the death they worship. In the name of your magnificent
devotion to this earth, leave them, don’t exhaust the greatness of your soul on
achieving the triumph of the evil of theirs. Do you hear me . . . my love?
“In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world to those who
are its worst. In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision
of man be distorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless in those who have
never achieved his title. Do not lose your knowledge that man’s proper estate is
an upright posture, an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads.
Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps
of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero
in your soul perish, in lonely frustation for the life you deserved, but have never
been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you
desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it’s yours.

“But to win it requires your total dedication and a total break with the world
of your past, with the doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal who exists for the
pleasure of others. Fight for the value of your person. Fight for the virtue of your
pride. Fight for the essence of that which is man: for his sovereign rational mind.
Fight with the radiant certainty and the absolute recitude of knowing that yours
is the Morality of Life and that yours is the battle for any achievement, any
value, any grandeur, any goodness, any joy that has ever existed on this earth.
