“Degrees of ability vary, but the basic principle remains the same: the degree
of a man’s independence, initiative and personal love for his work determines his
talent as a worker and his worth as a man. Independence is the only gauge of
human virtue and value. What a man is and makes of himself; not what he has or
hasn’t done for others. There is no substitute for personal dignity. There is no
standard of personal dignity except independence.

“In all proper relationships there is no sacrifice of anyone to anyone. An
architect needs clients, but he does not subordinate his work to their wishes.
They need him, but they do not order a house just to give him a commission.
Men exchange their work by free, mutual consent to mutual advantage when
their personal interests agree and they both desire the exchange. If they do not
desire it, they are not forced to deal with each other. They seek further. This is
the only possible form of relationship between equals. Anything else is a relation
of slave to master, or victim to executioner.

“No work is ever done collectively, by a majority decision. Every creative job
is achieved under the guidance of a single individual thought. An architect
requires a great many men to erect his building. But he does not ask them to vote
on his design. They work together by free agreement and each is free in his
proper function. An architect uses steel, glass, concrete, produced by others. But
the materials remain just so much steel, glass and concrete until he touches them.
What he does with them is his individual product and his individual property.
This is the only pattern for proper co-operation among men.

“The first right on earth is the right of the ego. Man’s first duty is to himself.
His moral law is never to place his prime goal within the persons of others. His
moral obligation is to do what he wishes, provided his wish does not depend
primarily upon other men. This includes the whole sphere of his creative faculty,
his thinking, his work. But it does not include the sphere of the gangster, the
altruist and the dictator.

“A man thinks and works alone. A man cannot rob, exploit or rule—alone.
Robbery, exploitation and ruling presuppose victims. They imply dependence.
They are the province of the second-hander.

“Rulers of men are not egoists. They create nothing. They exist entirely
through the persons of others. Their goal is in their subjects, in the activity of
enslaving. They are as dependent as the beggar, the social worker and the bandit.

The form of dependence does not matter.

“But men were taught to regard second-handers—tyrants, emperors, dictators
—as exponents of egoism. By this fraud they were made to destroy the ego,
themselves and others. The purpose of the fraud was to destroy the creators. Or
to harness them. Which is a synonym.

“From the beginning of history, the two antagonists have stood face to face:
the creator and the second-hander. When the first creator invented the wheel, the
first second-hander responded. He invented altruism.
“The creator—denied, opposed, persecuted, exploited—went on, moved
forward and carried all humanity along on his energy. The second-hander
contributed nothing to the process except the impediments. The contest has
another name: the individual against the collective.

“The ‘common good’ of a collective—a race, a class, a state—was the claim
and justification of every tyranny ever established over men. Every major horror
of history was committed in the name of an altruistic motive. Has any act of
selfishness ever equaled the carnage perpetrated by disciples of altruism? Does
the fault lie in men’s hypocrisy or in the nature of the principle? The most
dreadful butchers were the most sincere. They believed in the perfect society
reached through the guillotine and the firing squad. Nobody questioned their
right to murder since they were murdering for an altruistic purpose. It was
accepted that man must be sacrificed for other men. Actors change, but the
course of the tragedy remains the same. A humanitarian who starts with
declarations of love for mankind and ends with a sea of blood. It goes on and
will go on so long as men believe that an action is good if it is unselfish. That
permits the altruist to act and forces his victims to bear it. The leaders of
collectivist movements ask nothing for themselves. But observe the results.

“The only good which men can do to one another and the only statement of
their proper relationship is—Hands off!

“Now observe the results of a society built on the principle of individualism.
This, our country. The noblest country in the history of men. The country of
greatest achievement, greatest prosperity, greatest freedom. This country was not
based on selfless service, sacrifice, renunciation or any precept of altruism. It
was based on a man’s right to the pursuit of happiness. His own happiness. Not
anyone else’s. A private, personal, selfish motive. Look at the results. Look into
your own conscience.

“It is an ancient conflict. Men have come close to the truth, but it was
destroyed each time and one civilization fell after another. Civilization is the
progress toward a society of privacy. The savage’s whole existence is public,
ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from
men.

“Now, in our age, collectivism, the rule of the second-hander and second-rater,
the ancient monster, has broken loose and is running amuck. It has brought men
to a level of intellectual indecency never equaled on earth. It has reached a scale
of horror without precedent. It has poisoned every mind. It has swallowed most
of Europe. It is engulfing our country.
“I am an architect. I know what is to come by the principle on which it is
built. We are approaching a world in which I cannot permit myself to live.
“Now you know why I dynamited Cortlandt.

“I designed Cortlandt. I gave it to you. I destroyed it.
“I destroyed it because I did not choose to let it exist. It was a double monster.
In form and in implication. I had to blast both. The form was mutilated by two
second-handers who assumed the right to improve upon that which they had not
made and could not equal. They were permitted to do it by the general
implication that the altruistic purpose of the building superseded all rights and
that I had no claim to stand against it.

“I agreed to design Cortlandt for the purpose of seeing it erected as I designed
it and for no other reason. That was the price I set for my work. I was not paid.
“I do not blame Peter Keating. He was helpless. He had a contract with his
employers. It was ignored. He had a promise that the structure he offered would
be built as designed. The promise was broken. The love of a man for the
integrity of his work and his right to preserve it are now considered a vague
intangible and an inessential. You have heard the prosecutor say that. Why was
the building disfigured? For no reason. Such acts never have any reason, unless
it’s the vanity of some second-handers who feel they have a right to anyone’s
property, spiritual or material. Who permitted them to do it? No particular man
among the dozens in authority. No one cared to permit or to stop it. No one was
responsible. No one can be held to account. Such is the nature of all collective
action.

“I did not receive the payment I asked. But the owners of Cortlandt got what
they needed from me. They wanted a scheme devised to build a structure as
cheaply as possible. They found no one else who could do it to their satisfaction.
I could and did. They took the benefit of my work and made me contribute it as a
gift. But I am not an altruist. I do not contribute gifts of this nature.
“It is said that I have destroyed the home of the destitute. It is forgotten that
but for me the destitute could not have had this particular home. Those who were
concerned with the poor had to come to me, who have never been concerned, in
order to help the poor. It is believed that the poverty of the future tenants gave
them a right to my work. That their need constituted a claim on my life. That it
was my duty to contribute anything demanded of me. This is the secondhander’s credo now swallowing the world.
“I came here to say that I do not recognize anyone’s right to one minute of my
life. Nor to any part of my energy. Nor to any achievement of mine. No matter
who makes the claim, how large their number or how great their need.
“I wished to come here and say that I am a man who does not exist for others.
“It had to be said. The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing.
“I wished to come here and say that the integrity of a man’s creative work is
of greater importance than any charitable endeavor. Those of you who do not
understand this are the men who’re destroying the world.

“I wished to come here and state my terms. I do not care to exist on any
others.

“I recognize no obligations toward men except one: to respect their freedom
and to take no part in a slave society. To my country, I wish to give the ten years
which I will spend in jail if my country exists no longer. I will spend them in
memory and in gratitude for what my country has been. It will be my act of
loyalty, my refusal to live or work in what has taken its place.
“My act of loyalty to every creator who ever lived and was made to suffer by
the force responsible for the Cortlandt I dynamited. To every tortured hour of
loneliness, denial, frustration, abuse he was made to spend—and to the battles he
won. To every creator whose name is known—and to every creator who lived,
struggled and perished unrecognized before he could achieve. To every creator
who was destroyed in body or in spirit. To Henry Cameron. To Steven Mallory.
To a man who doesn’t want to be named, but who is sitting in this courtroom and
knows that I am speaking of him.”
