“Death is the standard of your values, death is your chosen goal, and you have
to keep running, since there is no escape from the pursuer who is out to destroy
you or from the knowledge that that pursuer is yourself. Stop running, for once
—there is no place to run—stand naked, as you dread to stand, but as I see you,
and take a look at what you dared to call a moral code.

“Damnation is the start of your morality, destruction is its purpose, means and
end. Your code begins by damning man as evil, then demands that he practice a
good which it defines as impossible for him to practice. It demands, as his first
proof of virtue, that he accept his own depravity without proof. It demands that
he start, not with a standard of value, but with a standard of evil, which is
himself, by means of which he is then to define the good: the good is that which
he is not.

“It does not matter who then becomes the profiteer on his renounced glory and
tormented soul, a mystic God with some incomprehensible design or any passerby whose rotting sores are held as some inexplicable claim upon him—it does
not matter, the good is not for him to understand, his duty is to crawl through
years of penance, atoning for the guilt of his existence to any stray collector of
unintelligible debts, his only concept of a value is a zero: the good is that which
is non-man.

“The name of this monstrous absurdity is Original Sin.

“A sin without volition is a slap at morality and an insolent contradiction in
terms: that which is outside the possibility of choice is outside the province of
morality. If man is evil by birth, he has no will, no power to change it; if he has
no will, he can be neither good nor evil; a robot is amoral. To hold, as man’s sin,
a fact not open to his choice is a mockery of morality. To hold man’s nature as
his sin is a mockery of nature. To punish him for a crime he committed before he
was born is a mockery of justice. To hold him guilty in a matter where no
innocence exists is a mockery of reason. To destroy morality, nature, justice and
reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched. Yet
that is the root of your code.

“Do not hide behind the cowardly evasion that man is born with free will, but
with a ‘tendency’ to evil. A free will saddled with a tendency is like a game with
loaded dice. It forces man to struggle through the effort of playing, to bear
responsibility and pay for the game, but the decision is weighted in favor of a
tendency that he had no power to escape. If the tendency is of his choice, he
cannot possess it at birth; if it is not of his choice, his will is not free.
“What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call his Original Sin? What
are the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection?
Their myth declares that he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge—he acquired a
mind and became a rational being. It was the knowledge of good and evil—he
became a moral being. He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor—he
became a productive being. He was sentenced to experience desire—he acquired
the capacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils for which they damn him are reason,
morality, creativeness, joy—all the cardinal values of his existence. It is not his
vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain and condemn, it is not
his errors that they hold as his guilt, but the essence of his nature as man.
Whatever he was—that robot in the Garden of Eden, who existed without mind,
without values, without labor, without love—he was not man.
“Man’s fall, according to your teachers, was that he gained the virtues
required to live. These virtues, by their standard, are his Sin. His evil, they
charge, is that he’s man. His guilt, they charge, is that he lives.
“They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man.
“No, they say, they do not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alien
object: his body. No, they say, they do not wish to kill him, they only wish to
make him lose his body. They seek to help him, they say, against his pain—and
they point at the torture rack to which they’ve tied him, the rack with two wheels
that pull him in opposite directions, the rack of the doctrine that splits his soul
and body.
“They have cut man in two, setting one half against the other. They have
taught him that his body and his consciousness are two enemies engaged in
deadly conflict, two antagonists of opposite natures, contradictory claims,
incompatible needs, that to benefit one is to injure the other, that his soul belongs
to a supernatural realm, but his body is an evil prison holding it in bondage to
this earth—and that the good is to defeat his body, to undermine it by years of
patient struggle, digging his way to that glorious jail-break which leads into the
freedom of the grave.
“They have taught man that he is a hopeless misfit made of two elements,
both symbols of death. A body without a soul is a corpse, a soul without a body
is a ghost—yet such is their image of man’s nature: the battleground of a
struggle between a corpse and a ghost, a corpse endowed with some evil volition
of its own and a ghost endowed with the knowledge that everything known to
man is non-existent, that only the unknowable exists.
“Do you observe what human faculty that doctrine was designed to ignore? It
was man’s mind that had to be negated in order to make him fall apart. Once he
surrendered reason, he was left at the mercy of two monsters whom he could not
fathom or control: of a body moved by unaccountable instincts and a soul moved
by mystic revelations—he was left as the passively ravaged victim of a battle
between a robot and a dictaphone.
“And as he now crawls through the wreckage, groping blindly for a way to
live, your teachers offer him the help of a morality that proclaims that he’ll find
no solution and must seek no fulfillment on earth. Real existence, they tell him,
is that which he cannot perceive, true consciousness is the faculty of perceiving
the non-existent—and if he is unable to understand it, that is the proof that his
existence is evil and his consciousness impotent.
“As products of the split between man’s soul and body, there are two kinds of
teachers of the Morality of Death: the mystics of spirit and the mystics of
muscle, whom you call the spiritualists and the materialists, those who believe in
consciousness without existence and those who believe in existence without
consciousness. Both demand the surrender of your mind, one to their revelations,
the other to their reflexes. No matter how loudly they posture in the roles of
irreconcilable antagonists, their moral codes are alike, and so are their aims: in
matter—the enslavement of man’s body, in spirit—the destruction of his mind.
“The good, say the mystics of spirit, is God, a being whose only definition is
that he is beyond man’s power to conceive—a definition that invalidates man’s
consciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence. The good, say the mystics
of muscle, is Society—a thing which they define as an organism that possesses
no physical form, a super-being embodied in no one in particular and everyone
in general except yourself. Man’s mind, say the mystics of spirit, must be
subordinated to the will of God. Man’s mind, say the mystics of muscle, must be
subordinated to the will of Society. Man’s standard of value, say the mystics of
spirit, is the pleasure of God, whose standards are beyond man’s power of
comprehension and must be accepted on faith. Man’s standard of value, say the
mystics of muscle, is the pleasure of Society, whose standards are beyond man’s
right of judgment and must be obeyed as a primary absolute. The purpose of
man’s life, say both, is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he
does not know, for reasons he is not to question. His reward, say the mystics of
spirit, will be given to him beyond the grave. His reward, say the mystics of
muscle, will be given on earth—to his great-grandchildren.
“Selfishness—say both—is man’s evil. Man’s good—say both—is to give up
his personal desires, to deny himself, renounce himself, surrender; man’s good is
to negate the life he lives. Sacrifice—cry both—is the essence of morality, the
highest virtue within man’s reach.
“Whoever is now within reach of my voice, whoever is man the victim, not
man the killer, I am speaking at the deathbed of your mind, at the brink of that
darkness in which you’re drowning, and if there still remains within you the
power to struggle to hold on to those fading sparks which had been yourself—
use it now. The word that has destroyed you is ‘sacrifice.’ Use the last of your
strength to understand its meaning. You’re still alive. You have a chance.
“‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the rejection of the worthless, but of the precious.
‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the rejection of the evil for the sake of the good, but of
the good for the sake of the evil. ‘Sacrifice’ is the surrender of that which you
value in favor of that which you don’t.
“If you exchange a penny for a dollar, it is not a sacrifice; if you exchange a
dollar for a penny, it is. If you achieve the career you wanted, after years of
struggle, it is not a sacrifice; if you then renounce it for the sake of a rival, it is.
If you own a bottle of milk and give it to your starving child, it is not a sacrifice;
if you give it to your neighbor’s child and let your own die, it is.
“If you give money to help a friend, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to a
worthless stranger, it is. If you give your friend a sum you can afford, it is not a
sacrifice; if you give him money at the cost of your own discomfort, it is only a
partial virtue, according to this sort of moral standard; if you give him money at
the cost of disaster to yourself—that is the virtue of sacrifice in full.
“If you renounce all personal desires and dedicate your life to those you love,
you do not achieve full virtue: you still retain a value of your own, which is your
love. If you devote your life to random strangers, it is an act of greater virtue. If
you devote your life to serving men you hate—that is the greatest of the virtues
you can practice.

“A sacrifice is the surrender of a value. Full sacrifice is full surrender of all
values. If you wish to achieve full virtue, you must seek no gratitude in return
for your sacrifice, no praise, no love, no admiration, no self-esteem, not even the
pride of being virtuous; the faintest trace of any gain dilutes your virtue. If you
pursue a course of action that does not taint your life by any joy, that brings you
no value in matter, no value in spirit, no gain, no profit, no reward—if you
achieve this state of total zero, you have achieved the ideal of moral perfection.
“You are told that moral perfection is impossible to man—and, by this
standard, it is. You cannot achieve it so long as you live, but the value of your
life and of your person is gauged by how closely you succeed in approaching
that ideal zero which is death.

“If you start, however, as a passionless blank, as a vegetable seeking to be
eaten, with no values to reject and no wishes to renounce, you will not win the
crown of sacrifice. It is not a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted. It is not a
sacrifice to give your life for others, if death is your personal desire. To achieve
the virtue of sacrifice, you must want to live, you must love it, you must burn
with passion for this earth and for all the splendor it can give you—you must
feel the twist of every knife as it slashes your desires away from your reach and
drains your love out of your body. It is not mere death that the morality of
sacrifice holds out to you as an ideal, but death by slow torture.
“Do not remind me that it pertains only to this life on earth. I am concerned
with no other. Neither are you.
“If you wish to save the last of your dignity, do not call your best actions a
‘sacrifice’: that term brands you as immoral. If a mother buys food for her
hungry child rather than a hat for herself, it is not a sacrifice: she values the child
higher than the hat; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of mother whose higher value
is the hat, who would prefer her child to starve and feeds him only from a sense
of duty. If a man dies fighting for his own freedom, it is not a sacrifice: he is not
willing to live as a slave; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of man who’s willing. If
a man refuses to sell his convictions, it is not a sacrifice, unless he is the sort of
man who has no convictions.
“Sacrifice could be proper only for those who have nothing to sacrifice—no
values, no standards, no judgment—those whose desires are irrational whims,
blindly conceived and lightly surrendered. For a man of moral stature, whose
desires are born of rational values, sacrifice is the surrender of the right to the
wrong, of the good to the evil.
“The creed of sacrifice is a morality for the immoral—a morality that declares
its own bankruptcy by confessing that it can’t impart to men any personal stake
in virtues or values, and that their souls are sewers of depravity, which they must
be taught to sacrifice. By its own confession, it is impotent to teach men to be
good and can only subject them to constant punishment.
“Are you thinking, in some foggy stupor, that it’s only material values that
your morality requires you to sacrifice? And what do you think are material
values? Matter has no value except as a means for the satisfaction of human
desires. Matter is only a tool of human values. To what service are you asked to
give the material tools your virtue has produced? To the service of that which
you regard as evil: to a principle you do not share, to a person you do not
respect, to the achievement of a purpose opposed to your own—else your gift is
not a sacrifice.
“Your morality tells you to renounce the material world and to divorce your
values from matter. A man whose values are given no expression in material
form, whose existence is unrelated to his ideals, whose actions contradict his
convictions, is a cheap little hypocrite—yet that is the man who obeys your
morality and divorces his values from matter. The man who loves one woman,
but sleeps with another—the man who admires the talent of a worker, but hires
another—the man who considers one cause to be just, but donates his money to
the support of another—the man who holds high standards of craftsmanship, but
devotes his effort to the production of trash—these are the men who have
renounced matter, the men who believe that the values of their spirit cannot be
brought into material reality.
“Do you say it is the spirit that such men have renounced? Yes, of course. You
cannot have one without the other. You are an indivisible entity of matter and
consciousness. Renounce your consciousness and you become a brute. Renounce
your body and you become a fake. Renounce the material world and you
surrender it to evil.
“And that is precisely the goal of your morality, the duty that your code
demands of you. Give to that which you do not enjoy, serve that which you do
not admire, submit to that which you consider evil—surrender the world to the
values of others, deny, reject, renounce your self. Your self is your mind;
renounce it and you become a chunk of meat ready for any cannibal to swallow.
“It is your mind that they want you to surrender—all those who preach the
creed of sacrifice, whatever their tags or their motives, whether they demand it
for the sake of your soul or of your body, whether they promise you another life
in heaven or a full stomach on this earth. Those who start by saying: ‘It is selfish
to pursue your own wishes, you must sacrifice them to the wishes of others’—
end up by saying: ‘It is selfish to uphold your convictions, you must sacrifice
them to the convictions of others.’
“This much is true: the most selfish of all things is the independent mind that
recognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than its
judgment of truth. You are asked to sacrifice your intellectual integrity, your
logic, your reason, your standard of truth—in favor of becoming a prostitute
whose standard is the greatest good for the greatest number.
“If you search your code for guidance, for an answer to the question: ‘What is
the good?’—the only answer you will find is ‘The good of others.’ The good is
whatever others wish, whatever you feel they feel they wish, or whatever you
feel they ought to feel. ‘The good of others’ is a magic formula that transforms
anything into gold, a formula to be recited as a guarantee of moral glory and as a
fumigator for any action, even the slaughter of a continent. Your standard of
virtue is not an object, not an act, not a principle, but an intention. You need no
proof, no reasons, no success, you need not achieve in fact the good of others—
all you need to know is that your motive was the good of others, not your own.
Your only definition of the good is a negation: the good is the ‘non-good for me.’
“Your code—which boasts that it upholds eternal, absolute, objective moral
values and scorns the conditional, the relative and the subjective—your code
hands out, as its version of the absolute, the following rule of moral conduct: If
you wish it, it’s evil; if others wish it, it’s good; if the motive of your action is
your welfare, don’t do it; if the motive is the welfare of others, then anything
goes.
“As this double-jointed, double-standard morality splits you in half, so it splits
mankind into two enemy camps: one is you, the other is all the rest of humanity.
You are the only outcast who has no right to wish or live. You are the only
servant, the rest are the masters, you are the only giver, the rest are the takers,
you are the eternal debtor, the rest are the creditors never to be paid off. You
must not question their right to your sacrifice, or the nature of their wishes and
their needs: their right is conferred upon them by a negative, by the fact that they
are ‘non-you.’
“For those of you who might ask questions, your code provides a consolation
prize and booby-trap: it is for your own happiness, it says, that you must serve
the happiness of others, the only way to achieve your joy is to give it up to
others, the only way to achieve your prosperity is to surrender your wealth to
others, the only way to protect your life is to protect all men except yourself—
and if you find no joy in this procedure, it is your own fault and the proof of
your evil; if you were good, you would find your happiness in providing a
banquet for others, and your dignity in existing on such crumbs as they might
care to toss you.
“You who have no standard of self-esteem, accept the guilt and dare not ask
the questions. But you know the unadmitted answer, refusing to acknowledge
what you see, what hidden premise moves your world. You know it, not in
honest statement, but as a dark uneasiness within you, while you flounder
between guiltily cheating and grudgingly practicing a principle too vicious to
name.
“I, who do not accept the unearned, neither in values nor in guilt, am here to
ask the questions you evaded. Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others,
but not your own? If enjoyment is a value, why is it moral when experienced by
others, but immoral when experienced by you? If the sensation of eating a cake
is a value, why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for
you to achieve in the stomach of others? Why is it immoral for you to desire, but
moral for others to do so? Why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it, but
moral to give it away? And if it is not moral for you to keep a value, why is it
moral for others to accept it? If you are selfless and virtuous when you give it,
are they not selfish and vicious when they take it? Does virtue consist of serving
vice? Is the moral purpose of those who are good, self-immolation for the sake
of those who are evil?
“The answer you evade, the monstrous answer is: No, the takers are not evil,
provided they did not earn the value you gave them. It is not immoral for them
to accept it, provided they are unable to produce it, unable to deserve it, unable
to give you any value in return. It is not immoral for them to enjoy it, provided
they do not obtain it by right.
“Such is the secret core of your creed, the other half of your double standard:
it is immoral to live by your own effort, but moral to live by the effort of others
—it is immoral to consume your own product, but moral to consume the
products of others—it is immoral to earn, but moral to mooch—it is the parasites
who are the moral justification for the existence of the producers, but the
existence of the parasites is an end in itself—it is evil to profit by achievement,
but good to profit by sacrifice—it is evil to create your own happiness, but good
to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others.

“Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by
opposite rules: those who may desire anything and those who may desire
nothing, the chosen and the damned, the riders and the carriers, the eaters and
the eaten. What standard determines your caste? What passkey admits you to the
moral elite? The passkey is lack of value.

“Whatever the value involved, it is your lack of it that gives you a claim upon
those who don’t lack it. It is your need that gives you a claim to rewards. If you
are able to satisfy your need, your ability annuls your right to satisfy it. But a
need you are unable to satisfy gives you first right to the lives of mankind.
“If you succeed, any man who fails is your master; if you fail, any man who
succeeds is your serf. Whether your failure is just or not, whether your wishes
are rational or not, whether your misfortune is undeserved or the result of your
vices, it is misfortune that gives you a right to rewards. It is pain, regardless of
its nature or cause, pain as a primary absolute, that gives you a mortgage on all
of existence.

“If you heal your pain by your own effort, you receive no moral credit: your
code regards it scornfully as an act of self-interest. Whatever value you seek to
acquire, be it wealth or food or love or rights, if you acquire it by means of your
virtue, your code does not regard it as a moral acquisition: you occasion no loss
to anyone, it is a trade, not alms; a payment, not a sacrifice. The deserved
belongs in the selfish, commercial realm of mutual profit; it is only the
undeserved that calls for that moral transaction which consists of profit to one at
the price of disaster to the other. To demand rewards for your virtue is selfish
and immoral; it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand into a moral
right.

“A morality that holds need as a claim, holds emptiness—non-existence—as
its standard of value; it rewards an absence, a defect: weakness, inability,
incompetence, suffering, disease, disaster, the lack, the fault, the flaw—the zero.
“Who provides the account to pay these claims? Those who are cursed for
being non-zeros, each to the extent of his distance from that ideal. Since all
values are the product of virtues, the degree of your virtue is used as the measure
of your penalty; the degree of your faults is used as the measure of your gain.
Your code declares that the rational man must sacrifice himself to the irrational,
the independent man to parasites, the honest man to the dishonest, the man of
justice to the unjust, the productive man to thieving loafers, the man of integrity
to compromising knaves, the man of self-esteem to sniveling neurotics. Do you
wonder at the meanness of soul in those you see around you? The man who
achieves these virtues will not accept your moral code; the man who accepts
your moral code will not achieve these virtues.
“Under a morality of sacrifice, the first value you sacrifice is morality; the
next is self-esteem. When need is the standard, every man is both victim and
parasite. As a victim, he must labor to fill the needs of others, leaving himself in
the position of a parasite whose needs must be filled by others. He cannot
approach his fellow men except in one of two disgraceful roles: he is both a
beggar and a sucker.
“You fear the man who has a dollar less than you, that dollar is rightfully his,
he makes you feel like a moral defrauder. You hate the man who has a dollar
more than you, that dollar is rightfully yours, he makes you feel that you are
morally defrauded. The man below is a source of your guilt, the man above is a
source of your frustration. You do not know what to surrender or demand, when
to give and when to grab, what pleasure in life is rightfully yours and what debt
is still unpaid to others—you struggle to evade, as ‘theory,’ the knowledge that
by the moral standard you’ve accepted you are guilty every moment of your life,
there is no mouthful of food you swallow that is not needed by someone
somewhere on earth—and you give up the problem in blind resentment, you
conclude that moral perfection is not to be achieved or desired, that you will
muddle through by snatching as snatch can and by avoiding the eyes of the
young, of those who look at you as if self-esteem were possible and they
expected you to have it. Guilt is all that you retain within your soul—and so does
every other man, as he goes past, avoiding your eyes. Do you wonder why your
morality has not achieved brotherhood on earth or the good will of man to man?
“The justification of sacrifice, that your morality pro-pounds, is more corrupt
than the corruption it purports to justify. The motive of your sacrifice, it tells
you, should be love—the love you ought to feel for every man. A morality that
professes the belief that the values of the spirit are more precious than matter, a
morality that teaches you to scorn a whore who gives her body indiscriminately
to all men—this same morality demands that you surrender your soul to
promiscuous love for all comers.
“As there can be no causeless wealth, so there can be no causeless love or any
sort of causeless emotion. An emotion is a response to a fact of reality, an
estimate dictated by your standards. To love is to value. The man who tells you
that it is possible to value without values, to love those whom you appraise as
worthless, is the man who tells you that it is possible to grow rich by consuming
without producing and that paper money is as valuable as gold.
“Observe that he does not expect you to feel a causeless fear. When his kind
get into power, they are expert at contriving means of terror, at giving you ample
cause to feel the fear by which they desire to rule you. But when it comes to
love, the highest of emotions, you permit them to shriek at you accusingly that
you are a moral delinquent if you’re incapable of feeling causeless love. When a
man feels fear without reason, you call him to the attention of a psychiatrist; you
are not so careful to protect the meaning, the nature and the dignity of love.
“Love is the expression of one’s values, the greatest reward you can earn for
the moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person, the
emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of
another. Your morality demands that you divorce your love from values and
hand it down to any vagrant, not as response to his worth, but as response to his
need, not as reward, but as alms, not as a payment for virtues, but as a blank
check on vices. Your morality tells you that the purpose of love is to set you free
of the bonds of morality, that love is superior to moral judgment, that true love
transcends, forgives and survives every manner of evil in its object, and the
greater the love the greater the depravity it permits to the loved. To love a man
for his virtues is paltry and human, it tells you; to love him for his flaws is
divine. To love those who are worthy of it is self-interest; to love the unworthy is
sacrifice. You owe your love to those who don’t deserve it, and the less they
deserve it, the more love you owe them—the more loathsome the object, the
nobler your love—the more unfastidious your love, the greater your virtue—and
if you can bring your soul to the state of a dump heap that welcomes anything on
equal terms, if you can cease to value moral values, you have achieved the state
of moral perfection.

“Such is your morality of sacrifice and such are the twin ideals it offers: to
refashion the life of your body in the image of a human stockyard, and the life of
your spirit in the image of a dump.
“Such was your goal—and you’ve reached it. Why do you now moan
complaints about man’s impotence and the futility of human aspirations?
Because you were unable to prosper by seeking destruction? Because you were
unable to find joy by worshipping pain? Because you were unable to live by
holding death as your standard of value?
“The degree of your ability to live was the degree to which you broke your
moral code, yet you believe that those who preach it are friends of humanity, you
damn yourself and dare not question their motives or their goals. Take a look at
them now, when you face your last choice—and if you choose to perish, do so
with full knowledge of how cheaply how small an enemy has claimed your life.
“The mystics of both schools, who preach the creed of sacrifice, are germs
that attack you through a single sore: your fear of relying on your mind. They
tell you that they possess a means of knowledge higher than the mind, a mode of
consciousness superior to reason—like a special pull with some bureaucrat of
the universe who gives them secret tips withheld from others. The mystics of
spirit declare that they possess an extra sense you lack: this special sixth sense
consists of contradicting the whole of the knowledge of your five. The mystics
of muscle do not bother to assert any claim to extrasensory perception: they
merely declare that your senses are not valid, and that their wisdom consists of
perceiving your blindness by some manner of unspecified means. Both kinds
demand that you invalidate your own consciousness and surrender yourself into
their power. They offer you, as proof of their superior knowledge, the fact that
they assert the opposite of everything you know, and as proof of their superior
ability to deal with existence, the fact that they lead you to misery, self-sacrifice,
starvation, destruction.

“They claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence on
this earth. The mystics of spirit call it ‘another dimension,’ which consists of
denying dimensions. The mystics of muscle call it ‘the future,’ which consists of
denying the present. To exist is to possess identity. What identity are they able to
give to their superior realm? They keep telling you what it is not, but never tell
you what it is. All their identifications consist of negating: God is that which no
human mind can know, they say—and proceed to demand that you consider it
knowledge—God is non-man, heaven is non-earth, soul is non-body, virtue is
non-profit, A is non-A, perception is non-sensory, knowledge is non-reason.
Their definitions are not acts of defining, but of wiping out.
“It is only the metaphysics of a leech that would cling to the idea of a universe
where a zero is a standard of identification. A leech would want to seek escape
from the necessity to name its own nature—escape from the necessity to know
that the substance on which it builds its private universe is blood.
“What is the nature of that superior world to which they sacrifice the world
that exists? The mystics of spirit curse matter, the mystics of muscle curse profit.
The first wish men to profit by renouncing the earth, the second wish men to
inherit the earth by renouncing all profit. Their non-material, non-profit worlds
are realms where rivers run with milk and coffee, where wine spurts from rocks
at their command, where pastry drops on them from clouds at the price of
opening their mouth. On this material, profit-chasing earth, an enormous
investment of virtue—of intelligence, integrity, energy, skill—is required to
construct a railroad to carry them the distance of one mile; in their non-material,
non-profit world, they travel from planet to planet at the cost of a wish. If an
honest person asks them: ‘How?’—they answer with righteous scorn that a
‘how’ is the concept of vulgar realists; the concept of superior spirits is
‘Somehow.’ On this earth restricted by matter and profit, rewards are achieved
by thought; in a world set free of such restrictions rewards are achieved by
wishing.
