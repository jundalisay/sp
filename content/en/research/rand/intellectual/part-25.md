Man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge.

Reason is:
- his only means to gain it.
- the faculty that perceives, identifies and integrates the material provided by his senses.

The task of his senses is to give him the evidence of existence, but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason, his senses tell him only that something is, but what it is must be learned by his mind. 

“All thinking is a process of identification and integration. Man perceives a blob of color; by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he learns to identify it as a solid object; he learns to identify the object as a table; he learns that the table is made of wood; he learns that the wood consists of cells, that the cells consist of molecules, that the molecules consist of atoms. 

All through this process, the work of his mind consists of answers to a single question: What is it? 

His means to establish the truth of his answers is logic, and logic rests on the axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification.

A contradiction cannot exist. An atom is itself, and so is the universe; neither can contradict its own identity; nor can a part contradict the whole. 

No concept man forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of his knowledge. To arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one’s thinking; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one’s mind and to evict oneself from the realm of reality.

“Reality is that which exists; the unreal does not exist; the unreal is merely that negation of existence which is the content of a human consciousness when it attempts to abandon reason. Truth is the recognition of reality; reason, man’s only means of knowledge, is his only standard of truth.

“The most depraved sentence you can now utter is to ask: Whose reason? 

The answers is: Yours. No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest, it is your
own mind that has to acquire it. It is only with your own knowledge that you can
deal. 

It is only your own knowledge that you can claim to possess or ask others
to consider. Your mind is your only judge of truth—and if others dissent from
your verdict, reality is the court of final appeal. Nothing but a man’s mind can
perform that complex, delicate, crucial process of identification which is
thinking. Nothing can direct the process but his own judgment. Nothing can
direct his judgment but his moral integrity.

“You who speak of a ‘moral instinct’ as if it were some separate endowment
opposed to reason—man’s reason is his moral faculty. A process of reason is a
process of constant choice in answer to the question: True or False?—Right or
Wrong? Is a seed to be planted in soil in order to grow—right or wrong? Is a
man’s wound to be disinfected in order to save his life—right or wrong? Does
the nature of atmospheric electricity permit it to be converted into kinetic power
—right or wrong? It is the answers to such questions that gave you everything
you have—and the answers came from a man’s mind, a mind of intransigent
devotion to that which is right.

“A rational process is a moral process. You may make an error at any step of
it, with nothing to protect you but your own severity, or you may try to cheat, to
fake the evidence and evade the effort of the quest—but if devotion to truth is
the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of
devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.
“That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, and that which
you call ‘free will’ is your mind’s freedom to think or not, the only will you
have, your only freedom, the choice that controls all the choices you make and
determines your life and your character.
“Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And
his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you
practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful
suspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think—not blindness, but the
refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing
your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment—
on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it,
that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict ‘It is.’ Nonthinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, an attempt to wipe
out reality. 

But existence exists; reality is not to be wiped out, it will merely wipe
out the wiper. By refusing to say ‘It is,’ you are refusing to say ‘I am.’ By
suspending your judgment, you are negating your person. When a man declares:
‘Who am I to know?’—he is declaring: ‘Who am I to live?’
“This, in every hour and every issue, is your basic moral choice: thinking or
non-thinking, existence or non-existence, A or non-A, entity or zero.
“To the extent to which a man is rational, life is the premise directing his
actions. To the extent to which he is irrational, the premise directing his actions
is death.

“You who prattle that morality is social and that man would need no morality
on a desert island—it is on a desert island that he would need it most. Let him try
to claim, when there are no victims to pay for it, that a rock is a house, that sand
is clothing, that food will drop into his mouth without cause or effort, that he will
collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his stock seed today—and reality will
wipe him out, as he deserves; reality will show him that life is a value to be
bought and that thinking is the only coin noble enough to buy it.
“If I were to speak your kind of language, I would say that man’s only moral
commandment is: Thou shalt think. But a ‘moral commandment’ is a
contradiction in terms. The moral is the chosen, not the forced; the understood,
not the obeyed. The moral is the rational, and reason accepts no commandments.

“My morality is the morality of reason. It is contained in:
- a single axiom: existence exists
- a single choice: to live*

The rest proceeds from these.

{{< n n="This is consistent with the Negative Force wanting self-preservation the most" >}}

To live, man must hold 3 things as the supreme values of life:

1. Reason

Reason is his only tool of knowledge

2. Purpose

Purpose is his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve.

3. Self-esteem

Self esteem is his certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living. 

These 3 values imply and require all of man’s virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the relation of existence and consciousness: rationality, independence, integrity, honesty, justice, productiveness, pride.
