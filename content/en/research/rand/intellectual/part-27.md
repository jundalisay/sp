Selfishness—say both—is man’s evil. Man’s good—say both—is to give up
his personal desires, to deny himself, renounce himself, surrender; man’s good is
to negate the life he lives. 

Sacrifice—cry both—is the essence of morality, the highest virtue within man’s reach.

Whoever is now within reach of my voice, whoever is man the victim, not
man the killer, I am speaking at the deathbed of your mind, at the brink of that
darkness in which you’re drowning, and if there still remains within you the
power to struggle to hold on to those fading sparks which had been yourself—
use it now. The word that has destroyed you is ‘sacrifice.’ Use the last of your
strength to understand its meaning. You’re still alive. You have a chance.

“‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the rejection of the worthless, but of the precious.

‘Sacrifice’ does not mean the rejection of the evil for the sake of the good, but of the good for the sake of the evil. ‘Sacrifice’ is the surrender of that which you value in favor of that which you don’t.

“If you exchange a penny for a dollar, it is not a sacrifice; if you exchange a dollar for a penny, it is. If you achieve the career you wanted, after years of struggle, it is not a sacrifice; if you then renounce it for the sake of a rival, it is.
If you own a bottle of milk and give it to your starving child, it is not a sacrifice;
if you give it to your neighbor’s child and let your own die, it is.

“If you give money to help a friend, it is not a sacrifice; if you give it to a
worthless stranger, it is. 

If you give your friend a sum you can afford, it is not a sacrifice; if you give him money at the cost of your own discomfort, it is only a partial virtue, according to this sort of moral standard; if you give him money at
the cost of disaster to yourself—that is the virtue of sacrifice in full.

“If you renounce all personal desires and dedicate your life to those you love,
you do not achieve full virtue: you still retain a value of your own, which is your
love. 

If you devote your life to random strangers, it is an act of greater virtue. If
you devote your life to serving men you hate—that is the greatest of the virtues
you can practice.

A sacrifice is the surrender of a value.

Full sacrifice is full surrender of all values.

If you wish to achieve full virtue, you must seek no gratitude in return for your sacrifice, no praise, no love, no admiration, no self-esteem, not even the pride of being virtuous; the faintest trace of any gain dilutes your virtue. If you
pursue a course of action that does not taint your life by any joy, that brings you
no value in matter, no value in spirit, no gain, no profit, no reward—if you
achieve this state of total zero, you have achieved the ideal of moral perfection.

“You are told that moral perfection is impossible to man—and, by this
standard, it is. You cannot achieve it so long as you live, but the value of your
life and of your person is gauged by how closely you succeed in approaching
that ideal zero which is death.

If you start as a passionless blank, as a vegetable seeking to be
eaten, with no values to reject and no wishes to renounce, you will not win the
crown of sacrifice. It is not a sacrifice to renounce the unwanted. 

It is not a
sacrifice to give your life for others, if death is your personal desire. To achieve
the virtue of sacrifice, you must want to live, you must love it, you must burn
with passion for this earth and for all the splendor it can give you—you must
feel the twist of every knife as it slashes your desires away from your reach and
drains your love out of your body.

It is not mere death that the morality of
sacrifice holds out to you as an ideal, but death by slow torture.
“Do not remind me that it pertains only to this life on earth. I am concerned
with no other. Neither are you.

“If you wish to save the last of your dignity, do not call your best actions a
‘sacrifice’: that term brands you as immoral. If a mother buys food for her
hungry child rather than a hat for herself, it is not a sacrifice: she values the child
higher than the hat; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of mother whose higher value
is the hat, who would prefer her child to starve and feeds him only from a sense
of duty. If a man dies fighting for his own freedom, it is not a sacrifice: he is not
willing to live as a slave; but it is a sacrifice to the kind of man who’s willing. If
a man refuses to sell his convictions, it is not a sacrifice, unless he is the sort of
man who has no convictions.

“Sacrifice could be proper only for those who have nothing to sacrifice—no
values, no standards, no judgment—those whose desires are irrational whims,
blindly conceived and lightly surrendered. For a man of moral stature, whose
desires are born of rational values, sacrifice is the surrender of the right to the
wrong, of the good to the evil.

“The creed of sacrifice is a morality for the immoral—a morality that declares
its own bankruptcy by confessing that it can’t impart to men any personal stake
in virtues or values, and that their souls are sewers of depravity, which they must
be taught to sacrifice. By its own confession, it is impotent to teach men to be
good and can only subject them to constant punishment.

“Are you thinking, in some foggy stupor, that it’s only material values that
your morality requires you to sacrifice? And what do you think are material
values? Matter has no value except as a means for the satisfaction of human
desires. Matter is only a tool of human values. To what service are you asked to
give the material tools your virtue has produced? To the service of that which
you regard as evil: to a principle you do not share, to a person you do not
respect, to the achievement of a purpose opposed to your own—else your gift is
not a sacrifice.

Your morality tells you to renounce the material world and to divorce your values from matter. 

A man whose values are given no expression in material form, whose existence is unrelated to his ideals, whose actions contradict his convictions, is a cheap little hypocrite—yet that is the man who obeys your
morality and divorces his values from matter. 

The man who loves one woman, but sleeps with another—the man who admires the talent of a worker, but hires
another—the man who considers one cause to be just, but donates his money to
the support of another—the man who holds high standards of craftsmanship, but
devotes his effort to the production of trash—these are the men who have
renounced matter, the men who believe that the values of their spirit cannot be brought into material reality.


Do you say it is the spirit that such men have renounced? Yes, of course. 

You cannot have one without the other. You are an indivisible entity of matter and
consciousness. Renounce your consciousness and you become a brute. Renounce
your body and you become a fake. Renounce the material world and you
surrender it to evil.

“And that is precisely the goal of your morality, the duty that your code
demands of you. Give to that which you do not enjoy, serve that which you do
not admire, submit to that which you consider evil—surrender the world to the
values of others, deny, reject, renounce your self. Your self is your mind;
renounce it and you become a chunk of meat ready for any cannibal to swallow.

They want you to surrender your mind.

They want your soul or your body, whether they promise you another life
in heaven or a full stomach on this earth. 

Those who start by saying: ‘It is selfish to pursue your own wishes, you must sacrifice them to the wishes of others’—
end up by saying: ‘It is selfish to uphold your convictions, you must sacrifice
them to the convictions of others.’

“This much is true: the most selfish of all things is the independent mind that
recognizes no authority higher than its own and no value higher than its
judgment of truth. 

You are asked to sacrifice your intellectual integrity, your
logic, your reason, your standard of truth—in favor of becoming a prostitute
whose standard is the greatest good for the greatest number.
