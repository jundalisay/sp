Today, the businessman and the intellectual face each other with the mutual fear and the mutual contempt of Attila and the Witch Doctor. 

The businessman has lost confidence in all theories, and functions on a range-of-the-moment
expediency, not daring to look at the future. The intellectual has cut himself off
from reality and plays a futile word-game with ideas, not daring to look at the
past. 

The businessman considers the intellectual unpractical; the intellectual
considers the businessman immoral. But, secretly, each of them believes that the
other possesses a mysterious faculty he lacks, that the other is the true master of
reality, the true exponent of the power to deal with existence.

It is by this mutual attitude and the philosophical premises from which it
comes that they are destroying each other. The major share of the guilt belongs
to the intellectual: philosophical leadership was his responsibility, which he
betrayed and is now deserting under fire.

The most grotesquely anachronistic and atavistic spectacle in history is the
spectacle of the modern intellectuals raising the primordial voice of the Witch
Doctor and, in the midst of an industrial civilization, wailing about the hopeless
misery of life on earth, the depravity of man, the impotence of man’s mind, the
ignoble vulgarity of material pursuits, and the nobility of longing for the
supernatural.

The echoes answering them are the voices of the plain, medieval Witch
Doctors that are beginning to be heard again, preaching the doctrine of man’s
innate, preordained impotence, of humility, passivity, submission and resignation
—here, in New York City, the greatest monument to the potency of man’s mind
—and proclaiming that all the disasters of the modern age are man’s punishment
for the pride of relying on his intellect, for his attempt to improve his condition,
to establish a rational society and to achieve a perfect way of life on earth.

On a recent television panel discussion, an alleged conservative intellectual
was asked to define the difference between a “conservative” and a “liberal.” He
answered that a “liberal” is one who does not believe in Original Sin. To which a
liberal intellectual replied hastily: “Oh, yes, we do!”—but proceeded to add that
the liberals believe they can improve man’s life just a little.

Such is the bankruptcy of a culture.

It is into the midst of this dismal gray vacuum that the New Intellectuals must
step—and must challenge the worshippers of doom, resignation and death, with
an attitude best expressed by a paraphrase of an ancient salute: “We who are not
about to die . . .”

Who are to be the New Intellectuals? Any man or woman who is willing to
think. All those who know that man’s life must be guided by reason, those who
value their own life and are not willing to surrender it to the cult of despair in the
modern jungle of cynical impotence, just as they are not willing to surrender the
world to the Dark Ages and the rule of the brutes.

The need for intellectual leadership was never as great as now. No human being who has a trace of personal worth can be willing to surrender his life without lifting a hand—or a mind—to defend it, particularly not in America, the
country based on the premise of man’s self-reliance and self-esteem. Americans
have known how to erect a superlative material achievement in the midst of an
untouched wilderness, against the resistance of savage tribes. What we need
today is to erect a corresponding philosophical structure, without which the
material greatness cannot survive. A skyscraper cannot stand on crackerbarrels,
nor on wall mottoes, nor on full-page ads, nor on prayers, nor on meta-language.

The new wilderness to reclaim is philosophy, now all but deserted, with the
weeds of prehistoric doctrines rising again to swallow the ruins. To support a
culture, nothing less than a new philosophical foundation will do. The present
state of the world is not the proof of philosophy’s impotence, but the proof of
philosophy’s power. It is philosophy that has brought men to this state—it is only
philosophy that can lead them out.

Those who could become the New Intellectuals are America’s hidden assets;
their number is probably greater than anyone can estimate; they exist in every
profession, even among the present intellectuals. But they are scattered in silent
helplessness throughout the country, or hidden in that underground which, in
human history, has too often swallowed the best of men’s potential: subjectivity.
They are the men who have long since lost respect for the cultural standards to
which they conform, but who hide their own convictions or repress their ideas or
suppress their minds, each feeling that he has no chance against the others, each
serving as both victim and destroyer. The New Intellectuals will be those men
who will come out into the open and have the courage to break that vicious
circle.

If they glance at the state of our culture, they will see that the entire miserable
show is kept up by nothing but routine and pretense, which disguise
bewilderment and fear: nobody dares to take the first new step, everybody waits
for his neighbor’s initiative. If a society reaches the stage where every man
accepts the feeling that he is “a stranger and afraid in a world [he] never made,”
the world it gives up will be made by Attila. The greatest need today is for men
who are not strangers to reality, because they are not afraid of thought. The New
Intellectuals will be those who will take the initiative and the responsibility: they
will check their own philosophical premises, identify their convictions, integrate
their ideas into coherence and consistency, then offer to the country a view of
existence to which the wise and honest can repair.

The New Intellectual will be the man who lives up to the exact meaning of his
title: a man who is guided by his intellect—not a zombie guided by feelings,
instincts, urges, wishes, whims or revelations. Ending the rule of Attila and the
Witch Doctor, he will discard the basic premise that made them possible: the
soul-body dichotomy. He will discard its irrational conflicts and contradictions,
such as: mind versus heart, thought versus action, reality versus desire, the
practical versus the moral. He will be an integrated man, that is: a thinker who is
a man of action. He will know that ideas divorced from consequent action are
fraudulent, and that action divorced from ideas is suicidal. He will know that the
conceptual level of psycho-epistemology—the volitional level of reason and
thought—is the basic necessity of man’s survival and his greatest moral virtue.

He will know that men need philosophy for the purpose of living on earth.

The New Intellectual will be a reunion of the twins who should never have
been separated: the intellectual and the businessman. He can come from among
the best—that is: the most rational—men who may still exist in both camps. In
place of an involuntary Witch Doctor and a reluctant Attila, the reunion will
produce two new types: the practical thinker and the philosophical businessman.
The best among the present intellectuals should consider the tremendous
power which they are holding, but have never fully exercised or understood. If
any man among them feels that he is the helpless, ineffectual step-son of a
“materialistic” culture that grants him neither wealth nor recognition, let him
remember the meaning of his title: his power is his intellect, not his feelings,
emotions or intuitions. It is not the businessmen who have robbed him of
efficacy, but those of his colleagues who have degraded his profession to the
level of soothsayers, tea-leaf readers and jungle oracles. Let him break with the
neo-mystics; let him realize that ideas are not an escape from reality, not a hobby
for “disinterested” neurotics in ivory towers, but the most crucial and practical
power in human existence. Then let him become an intellectual leader who
assumes full responsibility for the practical consequences of his theories.
The best among the businessmen should consider the function of wealth, and
realize that the power behind the incomprehensible evil now unleashed against
them is their own. Wealth, as such, is only a tool; by renouncing his intellect, the
businessman has placed his wealth in the service of his own destroyers. They do
not need to nationalize his property: they nationalized his mind long ago. Let
him now realize that practical action without a theoretical base achieves the
opposite of his goals, and that intellectual irresponsibility is not a way of escape
from his enemies. Then let him discover the function of philosophy.

Instead of those ludicrous programs of “student exchanges” between America
and Soviet Russia, for the alleged purpose of “gaining mutual understanding,”
there ought to be a private, voluntary program of “student exchanges” between
the intellectuals and the businessmen, the two groups that need each other most,
yet know less and understand less about each other than about any alien society
in any distant corner of the globe. The businessmen need to discover the
intellect; the intellectuals need to discover reality. Let the intellectuals
understand the nature and the function of a free market in order to offer the
businessmen, as well as the public at large, the guidance of an intelligible
theoretical framework for dealing with men, with society, with politics, with
economics. Let the businessmen learn the basic issues and principles of
philosophy in order to know how to judge ideas, then let them assume full
responsibility for the kind of ideologies they choose to finance and support.

Let them both discover the nature, the theory and the actual history of
capitalism; both groups are equally ignorant of it. No other subject is hidden by
so many distortions, misconceptions, misrepresentations and falsifications. Let
them study the historical facts and discover that all the evils popularly ascribed
to capitalism were caused, necessitated and made possible only by government
controls imposed on the economy. Whenever they hear capitalism being
denounced, let them check the facts and discover which of the two opposite
political principles—free trade or government controls—was responsible for the
alleged iniquities. When they hear it said that capitalism has had its chance and
has failed, let them remember that what ultimately failed was a “mixed”
economy, that the controls were the cause of the failure, and that the way to save
a country is not by making it swallow a full, “unmixed” glass of the poison
which is killing it.
