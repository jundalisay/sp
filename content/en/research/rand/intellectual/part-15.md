To preserve one’s integrity is a hard battle. Why
preserve that which one knows to be corrupt already? His soul gives up its selfrespect. You’ve got him. He’ll obey. He’ll be glad to obey—because he can’t trust himself, he feels uncertain, he feels unclean. That’s one way. Here’s
another. Kill man’s sense of values. Kill his capacity to recognize greatness or to
achieve it. Great men can’t be ruled. We don’t want any great men. Don’t deny
the conception of greatness. Destroy it from within. The great is the rare, the
difficult, the exceptional. Set up standards of achievement open to all, to the
least, to the most inept—and you stop the impetus to effort in all men, great or
small. You stop all incentive to improvement, to excellence, to perfection. . . .

Don’t set out to raze all shrines—you’ll frighten men. Enshrine mediocrity—and
the shrines are razed. Then there’s another way. Kill by laughter. Laughter is an
instrument of human joy. Learn to use it as a weapon of destruction. Turn it into
a sneer. It’s simple. Tell them to laugh at everything. Tell them that a sense of
humor is an unlimited virtue. Don’t let anything remain sacred in a man’s soul—
and his soul won’t be sacred to him. Kill reverence and you’ve killed the hero in
man. One doesn’t reverence with a giggle. He’ll obey and he’ll set no limits to
his obedience—anything goes—nothing is too serious. Here’s another way. This
is most important. Don’t allow men to be happy. Happiness is self-contained and
self-sufficient. Happy men have no time and no use for you. Happy men are free
men. 

So kill their joy in living. Take away from them whatever is dear or
important to them. Never let them have what they want. Make them feel that the
mere fact of a personal desire is evil. Bring them to a state where saying ‘I want’
is no longer a natural right, but a shameful admission. Altruism is of great help
in this. Unhappy men will come to you. They’ll need you. They’ll come for
consolation, for support, for escape. Nature allows no vacuum. Empty man’s
soul—and the space is yours to fill. I don’t see why you should look so shocked,
Peter. This is the oldest one of all. Look back at history. Look at any great
system of ethics, from the Orient up. Didn’t they all preach the sacrifice of
personal joy? Under all the complications of verbiage, haven’t they all had a
single leitmotif: sacrifice, renunciation, self-denial? Haven’t you been able to
catch their theme song—‘Give up, give up, give up, give up’? Look at the moral
atmosphere of today. Everything enjoyable, from cigarettes to sex to ambition to
the profit motive, is considered depraved or sinful. Just prove that a thing makes
men happy—and you’ve damned it. That’s how far we’ve come. 

We’ve tied
happiness to guilt. And we’ve got mankind by the throat. Throw your first-born
into a sacrificial furnace— lie on a bed of nails—go into the desert to mortify the
flesh—don’t dance—don’t go to the movies on Sunday—don’t try to get rich—
don’t smoke—don’t drink. It’s all the same line. The great line. Fools think that
taboos of this nature are just nonsense. Something left over, old-fashioned. But
there’s always a purpose in nonsense. Don’t bother to examine a folly—ask
yourself only what it accomplishes. Every system of ethics that preached
sacrifice grew into a world power and ruled millions of men. Of course, you
must dress it up. You must tell people that they’ll achieve a superior kind of
happiness by giving up everything that makes them happy. You don’t have to be
too clear about it. Use big vague words. ‘Universal Harmony’—‘Eternal
Spirit’—‘Divine Purpose’—‘Nirvana’—‘Paradise’—‘Racial Supremacy’—‘The
Dictatorship of the Proletariat.’ Internal corruption, Peter. That’s the oldest one
of all. 

The farce has been going on for centuries and men still fall for it. Yet the
test should be so simple: just listen to any prophet and if you hear him speak of
sacrifice—run. Run faster than from a plague. It stands to reason that where
there’s sacrifice, there’s someone collecting sacrificial offerings. Where there’s
service, there’s someone being served. The man who speaks to you of sacrifice,
speaks of slaves and masters. And intends to be the master. But if ever you hear
a man telling you that you must be happy, that it’s your natural right, that your
first duty is to yourself—that will be the man who’s not after your soul. That will
be the man who has nothing to gain from you. But let him come and you’ll
scream your empty heads off, howling that he’s a selfish monster. So the racket
is safe for many, many centuries. But here you might have noticed something. I
said, ‘It stands to reason.’ Do you see? Men have a weapon against you. Reason.
So you must be very sure to take it away from them. Cut the props from under it.

But be careful. Don’t deny outright. Never deny anything outright, you give your
hand away. Don’t say reason is evil—though some have gone that far and with
astonishing success. Just say that reason is limited. That there’s something above
it. What? You don’t have to be too clear about it either. The field’s inexhaustible.
‘Instinct’—‘Feeling’—‘Revelation’—‘Divine Intuition’—‘Dialectical
Materialism.’ If you get caught at some crucial point and somebody tells you that
your doctrine doesn’t make sense—you’re ready for him. You tell him that
there’s something above sense. That here he must not try to think, he must feel.
He must believe. Suspend reason and you play it deuces wild. Anything goes in
any manner you wish whenever you need it. You’ve got him. Can you rule a
thinking man? We don’t want any thinking men. . . .

“Peter, you’ve heard all this. You’ve seen me practicing it for ten years. You
see it being practiced all over the world. Why are you disgusted? You have no
right to sit there and stare at me with the virtuous superiority of being shocked.
You’re in on it. You’ve taken your share and you’ve got to go along. You’re
afraid to see where it’s leading. I’m not. I’ll tell you. The world of the future.
The world I want. A world of obedience and unity. A world where the thought of
each man will not be his own, but an attempt to guess the thought in the brain of
his neighbor who’ll have no thought of his own but an attempt to guess the
thought of the next neighbor who’ll have no thought—and so on, Peter, around
the globe. Since all must agree with all. A world where no man will hold a desire
for himself, but will direct all his efforts to satisfy the desires of his neighbor
who’ll have no desires except to satisfy the desires of the next neighbor who’ll
have no desires—around the globe, Peter. Since all must serve all. A world in
which man will not work for so innocent an incentive as money, but for that
headless monster—prestige. The approval of his fellows—their good opinion—
the opinion of men who’ll be allowed to hold no opinion. An octopus, all
tentacles and no brain. Judgment, Peter? Not judgment, but public polls. An
average drawn upon zeros—since no individuality will be permitted. A world
with its motor cut off and a single heart, pumped by hand. My hand—and the
hands of a few, a very few other men like me. Those who know what makes you
tick—you great, wonderful average, you who have not risen in fury when we
called you the average, the little, the common, you who’ve liked and accepted
those names. You’ll sit enthroned and enshrined, you, the little people, the
absolute ruler to make all past rulers squirm with envy, the absolute, the
unlimited, God and Prophet and King combined. Vox populi. The average, the
common, the general. Do you know the proper antonym for Ego? Bromide,
Peter. 

The rule of the bromide. 

But even the trite has to be originated by
someone at some time. We’ll do the originating. Vox dei. We’ll enjoy unlimited
submission—from men who’ve learned nothing except to submit. We’ll call it
‘to serve.’ We’ll give out medals for service. You’ll fall over one another in a
scramble to see who can submit better and more. There will be no other
distinction to seek. No other form of personal achievement. Can you see Howard
Roark in the picture? No? Then don’t waste time on foolish questions.
Everything that can’t be ruled, must go. And if freaks persist in being born
occasionally, they will not survive beyond their twelfth year. When their brain
begins to function, it will feel the pressure and it will explode. The pressure
gauged to a vacuum. Do you know the fate of deep-sea creatures brought out to
sunlight? So much for future Roarks. The rest of you will smile and obey. Have
you noticed that the imbecile always smiles? Man’s first frown is the first touch
of God on his forehead. The touch of thought. But we’ll have neither God nor
thought. Only voting by smiles. Automatic levers—all saying yes . . . Now if
you were a little more intelligent—like your ex-wife, for instance—you’d ask:
What of us, the rulers? What of me, Ellsworth Monkton Toohey? And I’d say,
Yes, you’re right. I’ll achieve no more than you will. I’ll have no purpose save to
keep you contented. To lie, to flatter you, to praise you, to inflate your vanity. To
make speeches about the people and the common good. Peter, my poor old
friend, I’m the most selfless man you’ve ever known. I have less independence
than you, whom I just forced to sell your soul. You’ve used people at least for
the sake of what you could get from them for yourself. I want nothing for
myself. I use people for the sake of what I can do to them. It’s my only function
and satisfaction. I have no private purpose. I want power. I want my world of the
future. Let all live for all. Let all sacrifice and none profit. Let all suffer and none
enjoy. Let progress stop. Let all stagnate. There’s equality in stagnation. All
subjugated to the will of all. Universal slavery—without even the dignity of a
master. Slavery to slavery. A great circle—and a total equality. The world of the
future. . . .

“Look around you. Pick up any newspaper and read the headlines. Isn’t it
coming? Isn’t it here? Every single thing I told you? Isn’t Europe swallowed
already and we’re stumbling on to follow? Everything I said is contained in a
single word—collectivism. And isn’t that the god of our century? To act
together. To think—together. To feel—together. To unite, to agree, to obey. To
obey, to serve, to sacrifice. Divide and conquer—first. But then—unite and rule.
We’ve discovered that one at last. Remember the Roman Emperor who said he
wished humanity had a single neck so he could cut it? People have laughed at
him for centuries. But we’ll have the last laugh. We’ve accomplished what he
couldn’t accomplish. We’ve taught men to unite. This makes one neck ready for
one leash. We’ve found the magic word. Collectivism. Look at Europe, you fool.
Can’t you see past the guff and recognize the essence? One country is dedicated
to the proposition that man has no rights, that the collective is all. The individual
held as evil, the mass—as God. No motive and no virtue permitted—except that
of service to the proletariat. That’s one version. Here’s another. A country
dedicated to the proposition that man has no rights, that the State is all. The
individual held as evil, the race—as God. No motive and no virtue permitted—
except that of service to the race. Am I raving or is this the cold reality of two
continents already? Watch the pincer movement. If you’re sick of one version,
we push you into the other. We get you coming and going. We’ve closed the
doors. We’ve fixed the coin. Heads—collectivism, and tails—collectivism. Fight
the doctrine which slaughters the individual with a doctrine which slaughters the
individual. Give up your soul to a council—or give it up to a leader. But give it
up, give it up, give it up. My technique, Peter. Offer poison as food and poison as
antidote. Go fancy on the trimmings, but hang on to the main objective. Give the
fools a choice, let them have their fun—but don’t forget the only purpose you
have to accomplish. Kill the individual. Kill man’s soul. The rest will follow
automatically.”
