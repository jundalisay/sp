This is from a conversation between Francisco d’Anconia and Hank Rearden,
who are in love with the same woman, though neither one of them knows it.
(Francisco speaking.)

“Do you remember what I said about money and about the men who seek to
reverse the law of cause and effect? The men who try to replace the mind by
seizing the products of the mind? Well, the man who despises himself tries to
gain self-esteem from sexual adventures—which can’t be done, because sex is
not the cause, but an effect and an expression of a man’s sense of his own value.
. . .

“The men who think that wealth comes from material resources and has no
intellectual root or meaning, are the men who think—for the same reason—that
sex is a physical capacity which functions independently of one’s mind, choice
or code of values. They think that your body creates a desire and makes a choice
for you—just about in some such way as if iron ore transformed itself into
railroad rails of its own volition. Love is blind, they say; sex is impervious to
reason and mocks the power of all philosophers. But, in fact, a man’s sexual
choice is the result and the sum of his fundamental convictions. Tell me what a
man finds sexually attractive and I will tell you his entire philosophy of life.
Show me the woman he sleeps with and I will tell you his valuation of himself.
No matter what corruption he’s taught about the virtue of selflessness, sex is the
most profoundly selfish of all acts, an act which he cannot perform for any
motive but his own enjoyment—just try to think of performing it in a spirit of
selfless charity!—an act which is not possible in self-abasement, only in selfexaltation, only in the confidence of being desired and being worthy of desire. 

It is an act that forces him to stand naked in spirit, as well as in body, and to accept
his real ego as his standard of value. He will always be attracted to the woman
who reflects his deepest vision of himself, the woman whose surrender permits
him to experience—or to fake—a sense of self-esteem. The man who is proudly
certain of his own value, will want the highest type of woman he can find, the
woman he admires, the strongest, the hardest to conquer—because only the
possession of a heroine will give him the sense of an achievement, not the
possession of a brainless slut. . . . He does not seek to gain his value, he seeks to
express it. There is no conflict between the standards of his mind and the desires
of his body.

“But the man who is convinced of his own worthlessness will be drawn to a
woman he despises—because she will reflect his own secret self, she will release
him from that objective reality in which he is a fraud, she will give him a
momentary illusion of his own value and a momentary escape from the moral
code that damns him. Observe the ugly mess which most men make of their sex
lives—and observe the mess of contradictions which they hold as their moral
philosophy. One proceeds from the other. Love is our response to our highest
values—and can be nothing else. Let a man corrupt his values and his view of
existence, let him profess that love is not self-enjoyment but self-denial, that
virtue consists, not of pride, but of pity or pain or weakness or sacrifice, that the
noblest love is born, not of admiration, but of charity, not in response to values,
but in response to flaws—and he will have cut himself in two. His body will not
obey him, it will not respond, it will make him impotent toward the woman he
professes to love and draw him to the lowest type of whore he can find. His body
will always follow the ultimate logic of his deepest convictions; if he believes
that flaws are values, he has damned existence as evil and only the evil will
attract him. He has damned himself and he will feel that depravity is all he is
worthy of enjoying. He has equated virtue with pain and he will feel that vice is
the only realm of pleasure. Then he will scream that his body has vicious desires
of its own which his mind cannot conquer, that sex is sin, that true love is a pure
emotion of the spirit. And then he will wonder why love brings him nothing but
boredom, and sex—nothing but shame. . . .

“You’d never accept any part of their vicious creed. You wouldn’t be able to
force it upon yourself. If you tried to damn sex as evil, you’d still find yourself,
against your will, acting on the proper moral premise. You’d be attracted to the
highest woman you met. You’d always want a heroine. You’d be incapable of
self-contempt. You’d be unable to believe that existence is evil and that you’re a
helpless creature caught in an impossible universe. You’re the man who’s spent
his life shaping matter to the purpose of his mind. You’re the man who would
know that just as an idea unexpressed in physical action is contemptible
hypocrisy, so is platonic love—and just as physical action unguided by an idea is
a fool’s self-fraud, so is sex when cut off from one’s code of values. It’s the same
issue, and you would know it. Your inviolate sense of self-esteem would know it.
You would be incapable of desire for a woman you despised. Only the man who
extols the purity of a love devoid of desire, is capable of the depravity of a desire
devoid of love. But observe that most people are creatures cut in half who keep
swinging desperately to one side or to the other. One kind of half is the man who
despises money, factories, skyscrapers and his own body. He holds undefined
emotions about non-conceivable subjects as the meaning of life and as his claim
to virtue. And he cries with despair, because he can feel nothing for the women
he respects, but finds himself in bondage to an irresistible passion for a slut from
the gutter. He is the man whom people call an idealist.

The other kind of half is
the man whom people call practical, the man who despises principles,
abstractions, art, philosophy and his own mind. He regards the acquisition of
material objects as the only goal of existence—and he laughs at the need to
consider their purpose or their source. He expects them to give him pleasure—
and he wonders why the more he gets, the less he feels. He is the man who
spends his time chasing women.

Observe the triple fraud which he perpetrates
upon himself. He will not acknowledge his need of self-esteem, since he scoffs
at such a concept as moral values; yet he feels the profound self-contempt which
comes from believing that he is a piece of meat. He will not acknowledge, but he
knows that sex is the physical expression of a tribute to personal values. So he
tries, by going through the motions of the effect, to acquire that which should
have been the cause. He tries to gain a sense of his own value from the women
who surrender to him—and he forgets that the women he picks have neither
character nor judgment nor standard of value. He tells himself that all he’s after
is physical pleasure—but observe that he tires of his women in a week or a night,
that he despises professional whores and that he loves to imagine he is seducing
virtuous girls who make a great exception for his sake. It is the feeling of
achievement that he seeks and never finds. What glory can there be in the
conquest of a mindless body?”

“FROM EACH ACCORDING TO HIS ABILITY, TO EACH ACCORDING TO HIS NEED”

This is the story of what happened at the Twentieth Century Motor Company,
which put the above slogan into practice—as told by one of the survivors.

“Well there was something that happened at that plant where I worked for
twenty years. It was when the old man died and his heirs took over. There were
three of them, two sons and a daughter, and they brought a new plan to run the
factory. They let us vote on it, too, and everybody—almost everybody—voted
for it. We didn’t know. We thought it was good. No, that’s not true, either. We
thought that we were supposed to think it was good. The plan was that
everybody in the factory would work according to his ability, but would be paid
according to his need. . . .

“We voted for that plan at a big meeting, with all of us present, six thousand
of us, everybody that worked in the factory. The Starnes heirs made long
speeches about it, and it wasn’t too clear, but nobody asked any questions. None
of us knew just how the plan would work, but every one of us thought that the
next fellow knew it. And if anybody had doubts, he felt guilty and kept his
mouth shut—because they made it sound like anyone who’d oppose the plan was
a child-killer at heart and less than a human being. They told us that this plan
would achieve a noble ideal. Well, how were we to know otherwise? Hadn’t we
heard it all our lives—from our parents and our schoolteachers and our
ministers, and in every newspaper we ever read and every movie and every
public speech? Hadn’t we always been told that this was righteous and just?
Well, maybe there’s some excuse for what we did at that meeting. Still, we voted
for the plan—and what we got, we had it coming to us. You know, ma’am, we
are marked men, in a way, those of us who lived through the four years of that
plan in the Twentieth Century factory. What is it that hell is supposed to be? Evil
—plain, naked, smirking evil, isn’t it? Well, that’s what we saw and helped to
make—and I think we’re damned, every one of us, and maybe we’ll never be
forgiven. . . .
“Do you know how it worked, that plan, and what it did to people? Try
pouring water into a tank where there’s a pipe at the bottom draining it out faster
than you pour it, and each bucket you bring breaks that pipe an inch wider, and
the harder you work the more is demanded of you, and you stand slinging
buckets forty hours a week, then forty-eight, then fifty-six—for your neighbor’s
supper—for his wife’s operation—for his child’s measles—for his mother’s
wheel chair—for his uncle’s shirt—for his nephew’s schooling—for the baby
next door—for the baby to be born—for anyone anywhere around you—it’s
theirs to receive, from diapers to dentures—and yours to work, from sunup to
sun-down, month after month, year after year, with nothing to show for it but
your sweat, with nothing in sight for you but their pleasure, for the whole of
your life, without rest, without hope, without end. . . . From each according to
his ability, to each according to his need. . . .

“We’re all one big family, they told us, we’re all in this together. But you
don’t all stand working an acetylene torch ten hours a day—together, and you
don’t all get a bellyache—together. What’s whose ability and which of whose
needs comes first? When it’s all one pot, you can’t let any man decide what his
own needs are, can you? If you did, he might claim that he needs a yacht—and if
his feelings is all you have to go by, he might prove it, too. Why not? If it’s not
right for me to own a car until I’ve worked myself into a hospital ward, earning a
car for every loafer and every naked savage on earth—why can’t he demand a
yacht from me, too, if I still have the ability not to have collapsed? No? He
can’t? Then why can he demand that I go without cream for my coffee until he’s
replastered his living room? . . . Oh well . . . Well, anyway, it was decided that
nobody had the right to judge his own need or ability. We voted on it. Yes,
ma’am, we voted on it in a public meeting twice a year. How else could it be
done? Do you care to think what would happen at such a meeting? It took us just
one meeting to discover that we had become beggars—rotten, whining, sniveling
beggars, all of us, because no man could claim his pay as his rightful earning, he
had no rights and no earnings, his work didn’t belong to him, it belonged to ‘the
family,’ and they owed him nothing in return, and the only claim he had on them
was his ‘need’—so he had to beg in public for relief from his needs, like any
lousy moocher, listing all his troubles and miseries, down to his patched drawers
and his wife’s head colds, hoping that ‘the family’ would throw him the alms. He
had to claim miseries, because it’s miseries, not work, that had become the coin
of the realm—so it turned into a contest among six thousand panhandlers, each
claiming that his need was worse than his brother’s. How else could it be done?
Do you care to guess what happened, what sort of men kept quiet, feeling shame,
and what sort got away with the jackpot?

“But that wasn’t all. There was something else that we discovered at the same
meeting. The factory’s production had fallen by forty per cent, in that first halfyear, so it was decided that somebody hadn’t delivered ‘according to his ability.’
Who? How would you tell it? The family voted on that, too. They voted which
men were the best, and these men were sentenced to work overtime each night
for the next six months. Overtime without pay—because you weren’t paid by
time and you weren’t paid by work, only by need.
“Do I have to tell you what happened after that—and into what sort of
creatures we all started turning, we who had once been human? We began to
hide whatever ability we had, to slow down and watch like hawks that we never
worked any faster or better than the next fellow. What else could we do, when
we knew that if we did our best for ‘the family,’ it’s not thanks or rewards that
we’d get, but punishment? We knew that for every stinker who’d ruin a batch of
motors and cost the company money—either through his sloppiness, because he
didn’t have to care, or through plain incompetence—it’s we who’d have to pay
with our nights and our Sundays. So we did our best to be no good.
“There was one young boy who started out, full of fire for the noble ideal, a
bright kid without any schooling, but with a wonderful head on his shoulders.
