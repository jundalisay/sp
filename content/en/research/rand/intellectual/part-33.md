By a feeling he has not learned to identify, but has derived from his first awareness of existence, from his discovery that he has to make choices, man knows that his desperate need of self-esteem is a matter of life or death. As a being of volitional consciousness, he knows that he must know his own value in order to maintain his own life. He knows that he has to be right; to be wrong in action means danger to his life; to be wrong in person, to be evil, means to be unfit for existence.

“Every act of man’s life has to be willed; the mere act of obtaining or eating
his food implies that the person he preserves is worthy of being preserved; every
pleasure he seeks to enjoy implies that the person who seeks it is worthy of
finding enjoyment. He has no choice about his need of self-esteem, his only
choice is the standard by which to gauge it. And he makes his fatal error when
he switches this gauge protecting his life into the service of his own destruction,
when he chooses a standard contradicting existence and sets his self-esteem
against reality.

“Every form of causeless self-doubt, every feeling of inferiority and secret
unworthiness is, in fact, man’s hidden dread of his inability to deal with
existence. But the greater his terror, the more fiercely he clings to the murderous
doctrines that choke him. No man can survive the moment of pronouncing
himself irredeemably evil; should he do it, his next moment is insanity or
suicide. To escape it—if he’s chosen an irrational standard—he will fake, evade,
blank out; he will cheat himself of reality, of existence, of happiness, of mind;
and he will ultimately cheat himself of self-esteem by struggling to preserve its
illusion rather than to risk discovering its lack. To fear to face an issue is to
believe that the worst is true.

“It is not any crime you have ever committed that infects your soul with
permanent guilt, it is none of your failures, errors or flaws, but the blank-out by
which you attempt to evade them—it is not any sort of Original Sin or unknown
prenatal deficiency, but the knowledge and fact of your basic default, of
suspending your mind, of refusing to think. Fear and guilt are your chronic
emotions, they are real and you do deserve them, but they don’t come from the
superficial reasons you invent to disguise their cause, not from your
‘selfishness,’ weakness or ignorance, but from a real and basic threat to your
existence: fear, because you have abandoned your weapon of survival, guilt,
because you know you have done it volitionally.
“The self you have betrayed is your mind; self-esteem is reliance on one’s
power to think. The ego you seek, that essential ‘you’ which you cannot express
or define, is not your emotions or inarticulate dreams, but your intellect, that
judge of your supreme tribunal whom you’ve impeached in order to drift at the
mercy of any stray shyster you describe as your ‘feeling.’ Then you drag
yourself through a self-made night, in a desperate quest for a nameless fire,
moved by some fading vision of a dawn you had seen and lost.

“Observe the persistence, in mankind’s mythologies, of the legend about a
paradise that men had once possessed, the city of Atlantis or the Garden of Eden
or some kingdom of perfection, always behind us. The root of that legend exists,
not in the past of the race, but in the past of every man. You still retain a sense—
not as firm as a memory, but diffused like the pain of hopeless longing—that
somewhere in the starting years of your childhood, before you had learned to
submit, to absorb the terror of unreason and to doubt the value of your mind, you
had known a radiant state of existence, you had known the independence of a
rational consciousness facing an open universe. That is the paradise which you
have lost, which you seek—which is yours for the taking.

“Some of you will never know who is John Galt. But those of you who have
known a single moment of love for existence and of pride in being its worthy
lover, a moment of looking at this earth and letting your glance be its sanction,
have known the state of being a man, and I—I am only the man who knew that
that state is not to be betrayed. I am the man who knew what made it possible
and who chose consistently to practice and to be what you had practiced and
been in that one moment.

“That choice is yours to make. That choice—the dedication to one’s highest
potential—is made by accepting the fact that the noblest act you have ever
performed is the act of your mind in the process of grasping that two and two
make four.
“Whoever you are—you who are alone with my words in this moment, with
nothing but your honesty to help you understand—the choice is still open to be a
human being, but the price is to start from scratch, to stand naked in the face of
reality and, reversing a costly historical error, to declare: ‘I am, therefore I’ll
think.’
“Accept the irrevocable fact that your life depends upon your mind. Admit
that the whole of your struggle, your doubts, your fakes, your evasions, was a
desperate quest for escape from the responsibility of a volitional consciousness
—a quest for automatic knowledge, for instinctive action, for intuitive certainty
—and while you called it a longing for the state of an angel, what you were
seeking was the state of an animal. Accept, as your moral ideal, the task of
becoming a man.

“Do not say that you’re afraid to trust your mind because you know so little.
Are you safer in surrendering to mystics and discarding the little that you know?
Live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the
limit of your life. Redeem your mind from the hockshops of authority. Accept
the fact that you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give you
omniscience—that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not make
you infallible—that an error made on your own is safer than ten truths accepted
on faith, because the first leaves you the means to correct it, but the second
destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error. In place of your dream of
an omniscient automaton, accept the fact that any knowledge man acquires is
acquired by his own will and effort, and that that is his distinction in the
universe, that is his nature, his morality, his glory.

“Discard that unlimited license to evil which consists of claiming that man is
imperfect. By what standard do you damn him when you claim it? Accept the
fact that in the realm of morality nothing less than perfection will do. But
perfection is not to be gauged by mystic commandments to practice the
impossible, and your moral stature is not to be gauged by matters not open to
your choice. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge
of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality—not the degree of
your intelligence, but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of
your knowledge, but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.

“Learn to distinguish the difference between errors of knowledge and
breaches of morality. An error of knowledge is not a moral flaw, provided you
are willing to correct it; only a mystic would judge human beings by the standard
of an impossible, automatic omniscience. But a breach of morality is the
conscious choice of an action you know to be evil, or a willful evasion of
knowledge, a suspension of sight and of thought. That which you do not know, is
not a moral charge against you; but that which you refuse to know, is an account
of infamy growing in your soul. Make every allowance for errors of knowledge;
do not forgive or accept any breach of morality. Give the benefit of the doubt to
those who seek to know; but treat as potential killers those specimens of insolent
depravity who make demands upon you, announcing that they have and seek no
reasons, proclaiming, as a license, that they ‘just feel it’—or those who reject an
irrefutable argument by saying: ‘It’s only logic,’ which means: ‘It’s only reality.’
The only realm opposed to reality is the realm and premise of death.
“Accept the fact that the achievement of your happiness is the only moral
purpose of your life, and that happiness—not pain or mindless self-indulgence—
is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is the proof and the result of your
loyalty to the achievement of your values. Happiness was the responsibility you
dreaded, it required the kind of rational discipline you did not value yourself
enough to assume—and the anxious staleness of your days is the monument to
your evasion of the knowledge that there is no moral substitute for happiness,
that there is no more despicable coward than the man who deserted the battle for
his joy, fearing to assert his right to existence, lacking the courage and the
loyalty to life of a bird or a flower reaching for the sun. Discard the protective
rags of that vice which you call a virtue: humility—learn to value yourself,
which means: to fight for your happiness—and when you learn that pride is the
sum of all virtues, you will learn to live like a man.

“As a basic step of self-esteem, learn to treat as the mark of a cannibal any
man’s demand for your help. To demand it is to claim that your life is his
property—and loathsome as such claim might be, there’s something still more
loathsome: your agreement. Do you ask if it’s ever proper to help another man?
No—if he claims it as his right or as a moral duty that you owe him. Yes—if
such is your own desire based on your own selfish pleasure in the value of his
person and his struggle. Suffering as such is not a value; only man’s fight against
suffering, is. If you choose to help a man who suffers, do it only on the ground
of his virtues, of his fight to recover, of his rational record, or of the fact that he
suffers unjustly; then your action is still a trade, and his virtue is the payment for
your help. But to help a man who has no virtues, to help him on the ground of
his suffering as such, to accept his faults, his need, as a claim—is to accept the
mortgage of a zero on your values. A man who has no virtues is a hater of
existence who acts on the premise of death; to help him is to sanction his evil
and to support his career of destruction. Be it only a penny you will not miss or a
kindly smile he has not earned, a tribute to a zero is treason to life and to all
those who struggle to maintain it. It is of such pennies and smiles that the
desolation of your world was made.

“Do not say that my morality is too hard for you to practice and that you fear
it as you fear the unknown. Whatever living moments you have known, were
lived by the values of my code. But you stifled, negated, betrayed it. You kept
sacrificing your virtues to your vices, and the best among men to the worst. Look
around you: what you have done to society, you had done it first within your
soul; one is the image of the other. This dismal wreckage, which is now your
world, is the physical form of the treason you committed to your values, to your
friends, to your defenders, to your future, to your country, to yourself.
“We—whom you are now calling, but who will not answer any longer—we
had lived among you, but you failed to know us, you refused to think and to see
what we were. You failed to recognize the motor I invented—and it became, in
your world, a pile of dead scrap. You failed to recognize the hero in your soul—
and you failed to know me when I passed you in the street. When you cried in
despair for the unattainable spirit which you felt had deserted your world, you
gave it my name, but what you were calling was your own betrayed self-esteem.
You will not recover one without the other.

“When you failed to give recognition to man’s mind and attempted to rule
human beings by force—those who submitted had no mind to surrender; those
who had, were men who don’t submit. Thus the man of productive genius
assumed in your world the disguise of a playboy and became a destroyer of
wealth, choosing to annihilate his fortune rather than surrender it to guns. Thus
the thinker, the man of reason, assumed in your world the role of a pirate, to
defend his values by force against your force, rather than submit to the rule of
brutality. Do you hear me, Francisco d’Anconia and Ragnar Danneskjöld, my
first friends, my fellow fighters, my fellow outcasts, in whose name and honor I
speak?
