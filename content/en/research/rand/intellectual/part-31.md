This idol of your cult of zero-worship, this symbol of impotence—the congenital dependent—is your image of man and your standard of value, in whose likeness you strive to refashion your soul. 

‘It’s only human,’ you cry in defense of any depravity, reaching the stage of self-abasement where you seek to
make the concept ‘human’ mean the weakling, the fool, the rotter, the liar, the
failure, the coward, the fraud, and to exile from the human race the hero, the
thinker, the producer, the inventor, the strong, the purposeful, the pure—as if ‘to
feel’ were human, but to think were not, as if to fail were human, but to succeed
were not, as if corruption were human, but virtue were not—as if the premise of
death were proper to man, but the premise of life were not.

In order to deprive us of honor, that you may then deprive us of our wealth, you have always regarded us as slaves who deserve no moral recognition. 

You praise any venture that claims to be non-profit, and damn the men who made the
profits that make the venture possible. You regard as ‘in the public interest’ any
project serving those who do not pay; it is not in the public interest to provide
any services for those who do the paying. 

‘Public benefit’ is anything given as alms; to engage in trade is to injure the public. ‘Public welfare’ is the welfare of
those who do not earn it; those who do, are entitled to no welfare. ‘The public,’
to you, is whoever has failed to achieve any virtue or value; whoever achieves it,
whoever provides the goods you require for survival, ceases to be regarded as
part of the public or as part of the human race.

“What blank-out permitted you to hope that you could get away with this
muck of contradictions and to plan it as an ideal society, when the ‘No’ of your
victims was sufficient to demolish the whole of your structure? What permits
any insolent beggar to wave his sores in the face of his betters and to plead for
help in the tone of a threat? You cry, as he does, that you are counting on our
pity, but your secret hope is the moral code that has taught you to count on our
guilt. You expect us to feel guilty of our virtues in the presence of your vices,
wounds and failures—guilty of succeeding at existence, guilty of enjoying the
life that you damn, yet beg us to help you to live.

<!-- I am John Galt, the first man:
- of ability who refused to regard it as guilt
- who would not do penance for my virtues or let them be used as the tools of my destruction
- who would not suffer martyrdom at the hands of those who wished me to perish for the privilege of keeping them alive. 
- who told them that I did not need them, and until they learned to deal with me as traders, giving value for value, they would have to exist without me, as I would exist without them; then I would let them learn whose is the need and whose the ability—and if human survival is the standard, whose terms would set the way to survive.

“I have done by plan and intention what had been done throughout history by
silent default. There have always been men of intelligence who went on strike, in
protest and despair, but they did not know the meaning of their action. The man
who retires from public life, to think, but not to share his thoughts—the man
who chooses to spend his years in the obscurity of menial employment, keeping
to himself the fire of his mind, never giving it form, expression or reality,
refusing to bring it into a world he despises—the man who is defeated by
revulsion, the man who renounces before he has started, the man who gives up
rather than give in, the man who functions at a fraction of his capacity, disarmed
by his longing for an ideal he has not found—they are on strike, on strike against
unreason, on strike against your world and your values. 

But not knowing any
values of their own, they abandoned the quest to know—in the darkness of their
hopeless indignation, which is righteous without knowledge of the right, and
passionate without knowledge of desire, they concede to you the power of reality
and surrender the incentives of their mind—and they perish in bitter futility, as
rebels who never learned the object of their rebellion, as lovers who never
discovered their love. -->

The Dark Ages were an era of intelligence on strike, when men of ability went underground and lived undiscovered, studying
in secret, and died, destroying the works of their mind, when only a few of the bravest of martyrs remained to keep the human race alive. 

Every period ruled by mystics was an era of stagnation and want, when most men were on strike
against existence, working for less than their barest survival, leaving nothing but
scraps for their rulers to loot, refusing to think, to venture, to produce, when the
ultimate collector of their profits and the final authority on truth or error was the
whim of some gilded degenerate sanctioned as superior to reason by divine right
and by grace of a club. The road of human history was a string of blank-outs
over sterile stretches eroded by faith and force, with only a few brief bursts of
sunlight, when the released energy of the men of the mind performed the
wonders you gaped at, admired and promptly extinguished again.

“But there will be no extinction, this time. The game of the mystics is up. You
will perish in and by your own unreality. We, the men of reason, will survive.
“I have called out on strike the kind of martyrs who had never deserted you
before. I have given them the weapon they had lacked: the knowledge of their
own moral value. I have taught them that the world is ours, whenever we choose
to claim it, by virtue and grace of the fact that ours is the Morality of Life. They,
the great victims who had produced all the wonders of humanity’s brief summer,
they, the industrialists, the conquerors of matter, had not discovered the nature of
their right. They had known that theirs was the power. I taught them that theirs
was the glory.

“You, who dare to regard us as the moral inferiors of any mystic who claims
supernatural visions—you, who scramble like vultures for plundered pennies,
yet honor a fortune-teller above a fortune-maker—you, who scorn a
businessman as ignoble, but esteem any posturing artist as exalted—the root of
your standards is that mystic miasma which comes from primordial swamps, that
cult of death, which pronounces a businessman immoral by reason of the fact
that he keeps you alive. You, who claim that you long to rise above the crude
concerns of the body, above the drudgery of serving mere physical needs—who
is enslaved by physical needs: the Hindu who labors from sunrise to sunset at the
shafts of a hand-plow for a bowl of rice, or the American who is driving a
tractor? Who is the conqueror of physical reality: the man who sleeps on a bed of
nails or the man who sleeps on an inner-spring mattress? Which is the monument
to the triumph of the human spirit over matter: the germ-eaten hovels on the
shorelines of the Ganges or the Atlantic skyline of New York?

“Unless you learn the answers to these questions—and learn to stand at
reverent attention when you face the achievements of man’s mind—you will not
stay much longer on this earth, which we love and will not permit you to damn.
You will not sneak by with the rest of your lifespan. I have foreshortened the
usual course of history and have let you discover the nature of the payment you
had hoped to switch to the shoulders of others. It is the last of your own living
power that will now be drained to provide the unearned for the worshippers and
carriers of Death. Do not pretend that a malevolent reality defeated you—you
were defeated by your own evasions. Do not pretend that you will perish for a
noble ideal—you will perish as fodder for the haters of man.

“But to those of you who still retain a remnant of the dignity and will to love
one’s life, I am offering the chance to make a choice. Choose whether you wish
to perish for a morality you have never believed or practiced. Pause on the brink
of self-destruction and examine your values and your life. You had known how
to take an inventory of your wealth. Now take an inventory of your mind.
“Since childhood, you have been hiding the guilty secret that you feel no
desire to be moral, no desire to seek self-immolation, that you dread and hate
your code, but dare not say it even to yourself, that you’re devoid of those moral
‘instincts’ which others profess to feel. The less you felt, the louder you
proclaimed your selfless love and servitude to others, in dread of ever letting
them discover your own self, the self that you betrayed, the self that you kept in
concealment, like a skeleton in the closet of your body. And they, who were at
once your dupes and your deceivers, they listened and voiced their loud
approval, in dread of ever letting you discover that they were harboring the same
unspoken secret. Existence among you is a giant pretense, an act you all perform
for one another, each feeling that he is the only guilty freak, each placing his
moral authority in the unknowable known only to others, each faking the reality
he feels they expect him to fake, none having the courage to break the vicious
circle.

“No matter what dishonorable compromise you’ve made with your
impracticable creed, no matter what miserable balance, half-cynicism, halfsuperstition, you now manage to maintain, you still preserve the root, the lethal
tenet: the belief that the moral and the practical are opposites. Since childhood,
you have been running from the terror of a choice you have never dared fully to
identify: If the practical, whatever you must practice to exist, whatever works,
succeeds, achieves your purpose, whatever brings you food and joy, whatever
profits you, is evil—and if the good, the moral, is the impractical, whatever fails,
destroys, frustrates, whatever injures you and brings you loss or pain—then your
choice is to be moral or to live.

“The sole result of that murderous doctrine was to remove morality from life.
