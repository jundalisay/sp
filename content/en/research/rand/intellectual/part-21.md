The first year, he figured out a work process that saved us thousands of manhours. He gave it to ‘the family,’ didn’t ask anything for it, either, couldn’t ask, but that was all right with him. It was for the ideal, he said. But when he found
himself voted as one of our ablest and sentenced to night work, because we
hadn’t gotten enough from him, he shut his mouth and his brain. You can bet he
didn’t come up with any ideas, the second year.

“What was it they’d always told us about the vicious competition of the profit
system, where men had to compete for who’d do a better job than his fellows?
Vicious, wasn’t it? Well, they should have seen what it was like when we all had
to compete with one another for who’d do the worst job possible. There’s no
surer way to destroy a man than to force him into a spot where he has to aim at
not doing his best, where he has to struggle to do a bad job, day after day. That
will finish him quicker than drink or idleness or pulling stick-ups for a living.
But there was nothing else for us to do except to fake unfitness. The one
accusation we feared was to be suspected of ability. Ability was like a mortgage
on you that you could never pay off. And what was there to work for? You knew
that your basic pittance would be given to you anyway, whether you worked or
not—your ‘housing and feeding allowance,’ it was called—and above that
pittance, you had no chance to get anything, no matter how hard you tried. You
couldn’t count on buying a new suit of clothes next year—they might give you a
‘clothing allowance’ or they might not, according to whether nobody broke a leg,
needed an operation or gave birth to more babies. And if there wasn’t enough
money for new suits for everybody, then you couldn’t get yours, either.
“There was one man who’d worked hard all his life, because he’d always
wanted to send his son through college. Well, the boy graduated from high
school in the second year of the plan—but ‘the family’ wouldn’t give the father
any ‘allowance’ for the college. They said his son couldn’t go to college, until
we had enough to send everybody’s sons to college—and that we first had to
send everybody’s children through high school, and we didn’t even have enough
for that. The father died the following year, in a knife fight with somebody in a
saloon, a fight over nothing in particular—such fights were beginning to happen
among us all the time.

“Then there was an old guy, a widower with no family, who had one hobby:
phonograph records. I guess that was all he ever got out of life. In the old days,
he used to skip meals just to buy himself some new recording of classical music.
Well, they didn’t give him any ‘allowance’ for records—‘personal luxury,’ they
called it. But at that same meeting, Millie Bush, somebody’s daughter, a mean,
ugly little eight-year-old, was voted a pair of gold braces for her buck teeth—this
was ‘medical need,’ because the staff psychologist had said that the poor girl
would get an inferiority complex if her teeth weren’t straightened out. The old
guy who loved music, turned to drink, instead. He got so you never saw him
fully conscious any more. But it seems like there was one thing he couldn’t
forget. One night, he came staggering down the street, saw Millie Bush, swung
his fist and knocked all her teeth out. Every one of them.
“Drink, of course, was what we all turned to, some more, some less. Don’t ask
how we got the money for it. When all the decent pleasures are forbidden,
there’s always ways to get the rotten ones. You don’t break into grocery stores
after dark and you don’t pick your fellow’s pockets to buy classical symphonies
or fishing tackle, but if it’s to get stinking drunk and forget—you do. Fishing
tackle? Hunting guns? Snapshot cameras? Hobbies? There wasn’t any
‘amusement allowance’ for anybody. ‘Amusement’ was the first thing they
dropped. Aren’t you always supposed to be ashamed to object when anybody
asks you to give up anything, if it’s something that gave you pleasure? Even our
‘tobacco allowance’ was cut to where we got two packs of cigarettes a month—
and this, they told us, was because the money had to go into the babies’ milk
fund. Babies was the only item of production that didn’t fall, but rose and kept
on rising—because people had nothing else to do, I guess, and because they
didn’t have to care, the baby wasn’t their burden, it was ‘the family’s.’ In fact,
the best chance you had of getting a raise and breathing easier for a while was a
‘baby allowance.’ Either that, or a major disease.
“It didn’t take us long to see how it all worked out. Any man who tried to play
straight, had to refuse himself everything. He lost his taste for any pleasure, he
hated to smoke a nickel’s worth of tobacco or chew a stick of gum, worrying
whether somebody had more need for that nickel. He felt ashamed of every
mouthful of food he swallowed, wondering whose weary nights of overtime had
paid for it, knowing that his food was not his by right, miserably wishing to be
cheated rather than to cheat, to be a sucker, but not a blood-sucker. He wouldn’t
marry, he wouldn’t help his folks back home, he wouldn’t put an extra burden on
‘the family.’ Besides, if he still had some sort of sense of responsibility, he
couldn’t marry or bring children into the world, when he could plan nothing,
promise nothing, count on nothing. But the shiftless and the irresponsible had a
field day of it. They bred babies, they got girls into trouble, they dragged in
every worthless relative they had from all over the country, every unmarried
pregnant sister, for an extra ‘disability allowance,’ they got more sicknesses than
any doctor could disprove, they ruined their clothing, their furniture, their homes
—what the hell, ‘the family’ was paying for it! They found more ways of getting
in ‘need’ than the rest of us could ever imagine—they developed a special skill
for it, which was the only ability they showed.
“God help us, ma’am! Do you see what we saw? We saw that we’d been given
a law to live by, a moral law, they called it, which punished those who observed
it—for observing it. The more you tried to live up to it, the more you suffered;
the more you cheated it, the bigger reward you got. Your honesty was like a tool
left at the mercy of the next man’s dishonesty. The honest ones paid, the
dishonest collected. The honest lost, the dishonest won. How long could men
stay good under this sort of law of goodness? We were a pretty decent bunch of
fellows when we started. There weren’t many chiselers among us. We knew our
jobs and we were proud of it and we worked for the best factory in the country,
where old man Starnes hired nothing but the pick of the country’s labor. Within
one year under the new plan, there wasn’t an honest man left among us. That
was the evil, the sort of hell-horror evil that preachers used to scare you with, but
you never thought to see alive. Not that the plan encouraged a few bastards, but
that it turned decent people into bastards, and there was nothing else that it could
do—and it was called a moral ideal!


“What was it we were supposed to want to work for? For the love of our
brothers? What brothers? For the bums, the loafers, the moochers we saw all
around us? And whether they were cheating or plain incompetent, whether they
were unwilling or unable—what difference did that make to us? If we were tied
for life to the level of their unfitness, faked or real, how long could we care to go
on? We had no way of knowing their ability, we had no way of controlling their
needs—all we knew was that we were beasts of burden struggling blindly in
some sort of place that was half-hospital, half-stockyards—a place geared to
nothing but disability, disaster, disease—beasts put there for the relief of
whatever whoever chose to say was whichever’s need.


“Love of our brothers? That’s when we learned to hate our brothers for the
first time in our lives. We began to hate them for every meal they swallowed, for
every small pleasure they enjoyed, for one man’s new shirt, for another’s wife’s
hat, for an outing with their family, for a paint job on their house—it was taken
from us, it was paid for by our privations, our denials, our hunger. We began to
spy on one another, each hoping to catch the others lying about their needs, so as
to cut their ‘allowance’ at the next meeting. We began to have stool pigeons who
informed on people, who reported that somebody had bootlegged a turkey to his
family on some Sunday—which he’d paid for by gambling, most likely. We
began to meddle into one another’s lives. We provoked family quarrels, to get
somebody’s relatives thrown out. Any time we saw a man starting to go steady
with a girl, we made life miserable for him. We broke up many engagements. We
didn’t want anyone to marry, we didn’t want any more dependents to feed.
“In the old days, we used to celebrate if somebody had a baby, we used to chip
in and help him out with the hospital bills, if he happened to be hard-pressed for
the moment. Now, if a baby was born, we didn’t speak to the parents for weeks.
Babies, to us, had become what locusts were to farmers. In the old days, we used
to help a man if he had a bad illness in the family. Now—well, I’ll tell you about
just one case. It was the mother of a man who had been with us for fifteen years.
She was a kindly old lady, cheerful and wise, she knew us all by our first names
and we all liked her—we used to like her. One day, she slipped on the cellar
stairs and fell and broke her hip. We knew what that meant at her age. The staff
doctor said that she’d have to be sent to a hospital in town, for expensive
treatments that would take a long time. The old lady died the night before she
was to leave for town. They never established the cause of death. No, I don’t
know whether she was murdered. Nobody said that. Nobody would talk about it
at all. All I know is that I—and that’s what I can’t forget!—I, too, had caught
myself wishing that she would die. This—may God forgive us!—was the
brotherhood, the security, the abundance that the plan was supposed to achieve
for us!
“Was there any reason why this sort of horror would ever be preached by
anybody? Was there anybody who got any profit from it? There was. The
Starnes heirs. I hope you’re not going to remind me that they’d sacrificed a
fortune and turned the factory over to us as a gift. We were fooled by that one,
too. Yes, they gave up the factory. But profit, ma’am, depends on what it is
you’re after. And what the Starnes heirs were after, no money on earth could
buy. Money is too clean and innocent for that.
“Eric Starnes, the youngest—he was a jellyfish that didn’t have the guts to be
after anything in particular. He got himself voted as Director of our Public
Relations Department, which didn’t do anything, except that he had a staff for
the not doing of anything, so he didn’t have to bother sticking around the office.
The pay he got—well, I shouldn’t call it ‘pay,’ none of us was ‘paid’—the alms
voted to him was fairly modest, about ten times what I got, but that wasn’t
riches. Eric didn’t care for money—he wouldn’t have known what to do with it.
He spent his time hanging around among us, showing how chummy he was and
democratic. He wanted to be loved, it seems. The way he went about it was to
keep reminding us that he had given us the factory. We couldn’t stand him.
“Gerald Starnes was our Director of Production. We never learned just what
the size of his rake-off—his alms—had been. It would have taken a staff of
accountants to figure that out, and a staff of engineers to trace the way it was
piped, directly or indirectly, into his office. None of it was supposed to be for
him—it was all for company expenses. Gerald had three cars, four secretaries,
five telephones, and he used to throw champagne and caviar parties that no taxpaying tycoon in the country could have afforded. He spent more money in one year than his father had earned in profits in the last two years of his life. We saw
a hundred-pound stack—a hundred pounds, we weighed them—of magazines in
Gerald’s office, full of stories about our factory and our noble plan, with big
pictures of Gerald Starnes, calling him a great social crusader. Gerald liked to
come into the shops at night, dressed in his formal clothes, flashing diamond cuff
links the size of a nickel and shaking cigar ashes all over. Any cheap show-off
who’s got nothing to parade but his cash, is bad enough—except that he makes
no bones about the cash being his, and you’re free to gape at him or not, as you
wish, and mostly you don’t. But when a bastard like Gerald Starnes puts on an
act and keeps spouting that he doesn’t care for material wealth, that he’s only
serving ‘the family,’ that all the lushness is not for himself, but for our sake and
for the common good, because it’s necessary to keep up the prestige of the
company and of the noble plan in the eyes of the public—then that’s when you
learn to hate the creature as you’ve never hated anything human.

“But his sister Ivy was worse. She really did not care for material wealth. The
alms she got was no bigger than ours, and she went about in scuffed, flat-heeled
shoes and shirtwaists—just to show how selfless she was. She was our Director
of Distribution. She was the lady in charge of our needs. She was the one who
held us by the throat. Of course, distribution was supposed to be decided by
voting—by the voice of the people. But when the people are six thousand
howling voices, trying to decide without yardstick, rhyme or reason, when there
are no rules to the game and each can demand anything, but has a right to
nothing, when everybody holds power over everybody’s life except his own—
then it turns out, as it did, that the voice of the people is Ivy Starnes. By the end
of the second year, we dropped the pretense of the ‘family meetings’—in the
name of ‘production efficiency and time economy,’ one meeting used to take ten
days—and all the petitions of need were simply sent to Miss Starnes’ office. No,
not sent. They had to be recited to her in person by every petitioner. Then she
made up a distribution list, which she read to us for our vote of approval at a
meeting that lasted three-quarters of an hour. We voted approval. There was a
ten-minute period on the agenda for discussion and objections. We made no
objections. We knew better by that time. Nobody can divide a factory’s income
among thousands of people, without some sort of a gauge to measure people’s
value. Her gauge was bootlicking. Selfless? In her father’s time, all of his money
wouldn’t have given him a chance to speak to his lousiest wiper and get away
with it, as she spoke to our best skilled workers and their wives. She had pale
eyes that looked fishy, cold and dead. And if you ever want to see pure evil, you
should have seen the way her eyes glinted when she watched some man who’d
talked back to her once and who’d just heard his name on the list of those getting
nothing above basic pittance. And when you saw it, you saw the real motive of
any person who’s ever preached the slogan: ‘From each according to his ability,
to each according to his need.’

“This was the whole secret of it. At first, I kept wondering how it could be
possible that the educated, the cultured, the famous men of the world could make
a mistake of this size and preach, as righteousness, this sort of abomination—
when five minutes of thought should have told them what would happen if
somebody tried to practice what they preached. Now I know that they didn’t do
it by any kind of mistake. Mistakes of this size are never made innocently. If
men fall for some vicious piece of insanity, when they have no way to make it
work and no possible reason to explain their choice—it’s because they have a
reason that they do not wish to tell. And we weren’t so innocent either, when we
voted for that plan at the first meeting. We didn’t do it just because we believed
that the drippy old guff they spewed was good. We had another reason, but the
guff helped us to hide it from our neighbors and from ourselves. The guff gave
us a chance to pass off as virtue something that we’d be ashamed to admit
otherwise. There wasn’t a man voting for it who didn’t think that under a setup
of this kind he’d muscle in on the profits of the men abler than himself. There
wasn’t a man rich and smart enough but that he didn’t think that somebody was
richer and smarter, and this plan would give him a share of his better’s wealth
and brain. But while he was thinking that he’d get unearned benefits from the
men above, he forgot about the men below who’d get unearned benefits, too. He
forgot about all his inferiors who’d rush to drain him just as he hoped to drain
his superiors. The worker who liked the idea that his need entitled him to a
limousine like his boss’s, forgot that every bum and beggar on earth would come
howling that their need entitled them to an icebox like his own. That was our
real motive when we voted—that was the truth of it—but we didn’t like to think
it, so the less we liked it, the louder we yelled about our love for the common
good.

“Well, we got what we asked for. By the time we saw what it was that we’d
asked for, it was too late. We were trapped, with no place to go. The best men
among us left the factory in the first week of the plan. We lost our best
engineers, superintendents, foremen and highest-skilled workers. A man of selfrespect doesn’t turn into a milch cow for anybody. Some able fellows tried to
stick it out, but they couldn’t take it for long. We kept losing our men, they kept
escaping from the factory like from a pesthole—till we had nothing left except
the men of need, but none of the men of ability.
“And the few of us who were still any good, but stayed on, were only those
who had been there too long. In the old days, nobody ever quit the Twentieth
Century—and, somehow, we couldn’t make ourselves believe that it was gone.
After a while, we couldn’t quit, because no other employer would have us—for
which I can’t blame him. Nobody would deal with us in any way, no respectable
person or firm. All the small shops, where we traded, started moving out of
Starnesville fast—till we had nothing left but saloons, gambling joints and
crooks who sold us trash at gouging prices. The alms we got kept falling, but the
cost of our living went up. The list of the factory’s needy kept stretching, but the
list of its customers shrank. There was less and less income to divide among
more and more people. In the old days, it used to be said that the Twentieth
Century Motor trademark was as good as the karat mark on gold. I don’t know
what it was that the Starnes heirs thought, if they thought at all, but I suppose
that like all social planners and like savages, they thought that this trademark
was a magic stamp which did the trick by some sort of voodoo power and that it
would keep them rich, as it had kept their father. Well, when our customers
began to see that we never delivered an order on time and never put out a motor
that didn’t have something wrong with it—the magic stamp began to work the
other way around: people wouldn’t take a motor as a gift, if it was marked
Twentieth Century. And it came to where our only customers were men who
never paid and never meant to pay their bills. But Gerald Starnes, doped by his
own publicity, got huffy and went around, with an air of moral superiority,
demanding that businessmen place orders with us, not because our motors were
good, but because we needed the orders so badly.
“By that time, a village half-wit could see what generations of professors had
pretended not to notice. What good would our need do to a power plant when its
generators stopped because of our defective engines? What good would it do to a
man caught on an operating table when the electric light went out? What good
would it do to the passengers of a plane when its motor failed in mid-air? And if
they bought our product, not because of its merit, but because of our need, would
that be the good, the right, the moral thing to do for the owner of that power
plant, the surgeon in that hospital, the maker of that plane?
“Yet this was the moral law that the professors and leaders and thinkers had
wanted to establish all over the earth. If this is what it did in a single small town
where we all knew one another, do you care to think what it would do on a world
scale? Do you care to imagine what it would be like, if you had to live and to
work, when you’re tied to all the disasters and all the malingering of the globe?
To work—and whenever any men failed anywhere, it’s you who would have to
make up for it. To work—with no chance to rise, with your meals and your
clothes and your home and your pleasure depending on any swindle, any famine,
any pestilence anywhere on earth. To work—with no chance for an extra ration,
till the Cambodians have been fed and the Patagonians have been sent through
college. To work—on a blank check held by every creature born, by men whom
you’ll never see, whose needs you’ll never know, whose ability or laziness or
sloppiness or fraud you have no way to learn and no right to question—just to
work and work and work—and leave it up to the Ivys and the Geralds of the
world to decide whose stomach will consume the effort, the dreams and the days
of your life. And this is the moral law to accept? This—a moral ideal?
“Well, we tried it—and we learned. Our agony took four years, from our first
meeting to our last, and it ended the only way it could end: in bankruptcy. At our
last meeting, Ivy Starnes was the one who tried to brazen it out. She made a
short, nasty, snippy little speech in which she said that the plan had failed
because the rest of the country had not accepted it, that a single community
could not succeed in the midst of a selfish, greedy world—and that the plan was
a noble ideal, but human nature was not good enough for it. A young boy—the
one who had been punished for giving us a useful idea in our first year—got up,
as we all sat silent, and walked straight to Ivy Starnes on the platform. He said
nothing. He spat in her face. That was the end of the noble plan and of the
Twentieth Century.”
