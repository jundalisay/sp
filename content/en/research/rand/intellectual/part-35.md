It was the 3 of us who started what I am now completing. It was the 3 of us who resolved to avenge this country and to release its imprisoned soul.

This greatest of countries was built on my morality—on the inviolate supremacy of man’s right to exist.

But you dreaded to admit it and live up to it. 

You stared at an achievement unequaled in history, you looted its effects and blanked out its cause.

In the presence of that monument to human morality, which is a factory, a highway or a bridge—you kept damning this country as immoral and its progress as ‘material greed,’ you kept offering apologies for this country’s greatness to the
idol of primordial starvation, to decaying Europe’s idol of a leprous, mystic bum.


“This country is the product of reason. It could not survive on the morality of sacrifice.

It was not built by men who sought self-immolation or by men who
sought hand-outs. It could not stand on the mystic split that divorced man’s soul
from his body. 

It could not live by the mystic doctrine that damned this earth as evil and those who succeeded on earth as depraved. From its start, this country was a threat to the ancient rule of mystics. 

In the brilliant rocket-explosion of its
youth, this country displayed to an incredulous world what greatness was
possible to man, what happiness was possible on earth. It was one or the other:
America or mystics.

The mystics knew it; you didn’t. You let them infect you
with the worship of need—and this country became a giant in body with a
mooching midget in place of its soul, while its living soul was driven
underground to labor and feed you in silence, unnamed, unhonored, negated, its
soul and hero: the industrialist. Do you hear me now, Hank Rearden, the greatest
of the victims I have avenged?

“Neither he nor the rest of us will return until the road is clear to rebuild this
country—until the wreckage of the morality of sacrifice has been wiped out of
our way.

A country’s political system is based on its code of morality. We will
rebuild America’s system on the moral premise which had been its foundation,
but which you treated as a guilty underground, in your frantic evasion of the
conflict between that premise and your mystic morality: the premise that man is
an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others, that man’s life, his
freedom, his happiness are his by inalienable right.

“You who’ve lost the concept of a right, you who swing in impotent
evasiveness between the claim that rights are a gift of God, a supernatural gift to
be taken on faith, or the claim that rights are a gift of society, to be broken at its
arbitrary whim—the source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional
law, but the law of identity. 

A is A—and Man is Man. 

Rights are conditions of existence required by man’s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on
earth, it is right for him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free
judgment, it is right to work for his values and to keep the product of his work.
If life on earth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature
forbids him the irrational. Any group, any gang, any nation that attempts to
negate man’s rights, is wrong, which means: is evil, which means: is anti-life.

“Rights are a moral concept—and morality is a matter of choice. Men are free
not to choose man’s survival as the standard of their morals and their laws, but
not free to escape from the fact that the alternative is a cannibal society, which
exists for a while by devouring its best and collapses like a cancerous body,
when the healthy have been eaten by the diseased, when the rational have been
consumed by the irrational. Such has been the fate of your societies in history,
but you’ve evaded the knowledge of the cause. I am here to state it: the agent of
retribution was the law of identity, which you cannot escape. Just as man cannot
live by means of the irrational, so two men cannot, or two thousand, or two
billion.


Just as man can’t succeed by defying reality, so a nation can’t, or a
country, or a globe. A is A. The rest is a matter of time, provided by the
generosity of victims.

“Just as man can’t exist without his body, so no rights can exist without the
right to translate one’s rights into reality—to think, to work and to keep the
results—which means: the right of property. The modern mystics of muscle who
offer you the fraudulent alternative of ‘human rights’ versus ‘property rights,’ as
if one could exist without the other, are making a last, grotesque attempt to
revive the doctrine of soul versus body. Only a ghost can exist without material
property; only a slave can work with no right to the product of his effort. 

The doctrine that ‘human rights’ are superior to ‘property rights’ simply means that
some human beings have the right to make property out of others; since the
competent have nothing to gain from the incompetent, it means the right of the
incompetent to own their betters and to use them as productive cattle. Whoever
regards this as human and right, has no right to the title of ‘human.’

“The source of property rights is the law of causality. All property and all
forms of wealth are produced by man’s mind and labor. As you cannot have
effects without causes, so you cannot have wealth without its source: without
intelligence. You cannot force intelligence to work: those who’re able to think,
will not work under compulsion; those who will, won’t produce much more than
the price of the whip needed to keep them enslaved. You cannot obtain the
products of a mind except on the owner’s terms, by trade and by volitional
consent. Any other policy of men toward man’s property is the policy of
criminals, no matter what their numbers. Criminals are savages who play it
short-range and starve when their prey runs out—just as you’re starving today,
you who believed that crime could be ‘practical’ if your government decreed that
robbery was legal and resistance to robbery illegal.

“The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, which
means: to protect him from physical violence. A proper government is only a
policeman, acting as an agent of man’s self-defense, and, as such, may resort to
force only against those who start the use of force. The only proper functions of
a government are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect
you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts
from breach or fraud by others, to settle disputes by rational rules, according to
objective law. But a government that initiates the employment of force against
men who had forced no one, the employment of armed compulsion against
disarmed victims, is a nightmare infernal machine designed to annihilate
morality: such a government reverses its only moral purpose and switches from
the role of protector to the role of man’s deadliest enemy, from the role of
policeman to the role of a criminal vested with the right to the wielding of
violence against victims deprived of the right of self-defense. Such a government
substitutes for morality the following rule of social conduct: you may do
whatever you please to your neighbor, provided your gang is bigger than his.
“Only a brute, a fool or an evader can agree to exist on such terms or agree to
give his fellow men a blank check on his life and his mind, to accept the belief
that others have the right to dispose of his person at their whim, that the will of
the majority is omnipotent, that the physical force of muscles and numbers is a
substitute for justice, reality and truth. We, the men of the mind, we who are
traders, not masters or slaves, do not deal in blank checks or grant them. We do
not live or work with any form of the non-objective.

“So long as men, in the era of savagery, had no concept of objective reality
and believed that physical nature was ruled by the whim of unknowable demons
—no thought, no science, no production were possible. Only when men
discovered that nature was a firm, predictable absolute were they able to rely on
their knowledge, to choose their course, to plan their future and, slowly, to rise
from the cave. Now you have placed modern industry, with its immense
complexity of scientific precision, back into the power of unknowable demons—
the unpredictable power of the arbitrary whims of hidden, ugly little bureaucrats.
A farmer will not invest the effort of one summer if he’s unable to calculate his
chances of a harvest. But you expect industrial giants—who plan in terms of
decades, invest in terms of generations and undertake ninety-nine-year contracts
—to continue to function and produce, not knowing what random caprice in the
skull of what random official will descend upon them at what moment to
demolish the whole of their effort. Drifters and physical laborers live and plan by
the range of a day. The better the mind, the longer the range. A man whose
vision extends to a shanty, might continue to build on your quicksands, to grab a
fast profit and run. A man who envisions skyscrapers, will not. Nor will he give
ten years of unswerving devotion to the task of inventing a new product, when
he knows that gangs of entrenched mediocrity are juggling the laws against him,
to tie him, restrict him and force him to fail, but should he fight them and
struggle and succeed, they will seize his rewards and his invention.

“Look past the range of the moment, you who cry that you fear to compete
with men of superior intelligence, that their mind is a threat to your livelihood,
that the strong leave no chance to the weak in a market of voluntary trade. What
determines the material value of your work? Nothing but the productive effort of
your mind—if you lived on a desert island. The less efficient the thinking of
your brain, the less your physical labor would bring you—and you could spend
your life on a single routine, collecting a precarious harvest or hunting with bow
and arrows, unable to think any further. But when you live in a rational society,
where men are free to trade, you receive an incalculable bonus: the material
value of your work is determined not only by your effort, but by the effort of the
best productive minds who exist in the world around you.

“When you work in a modern factory, you are paid, not only for your labor,
but for all the productive genius which has made that factory possible: for the
work of the industrialist who built it, for the work of the investor who saved the
money to risk on the untried and the new, for the work of the engineer who
designed the machines of which you are pushing the levers, for the work of the
inventor who created the product which you spend your time on making, for the
work of the scientist who discovered the laws that went into the making of that
product, for the work of the philosopher who taught men how to think and whom
you spend your time denouncing.

“The machine, the frozen form of a living intelligence, is the power that
expands the potential of your life by raising the productivity of your time. If you
worked as a blacksmith in the mystics’ Middle Ages, the whole of your earning
capacity would consist of an iron bar produced by your hands in days and days
of effort. How many tons of rail do you produce per day if you work for Hank
Rearden? Would you dare to claim that the size of your pay check was created
solely by your physical labor and that those rails were the product of your
muscles? The standard of living of that blacksmith is all that your muscles are
worth; the rest is a gift from Hank Rearden.
“Every man is free to rise as far as he’s able or willing, but it’s only the degree
to which he thinks that determines the degree to which he’ll rise. Physical labor
as such can extend no further than the range of the moment. The man who does
no more than physical labor, consumes the material value-equivalent of his own
contribution to the process of production, and leaves no further value, neither for
himself nor others. But the man who produces an idea in any field of rational
endeavor—the man who discovers new knowledge—is the permanent benefactor
of humanity. Material products can’t be shared, they belong to some ultimate
consumer; it is only the value of an idea that can be shared with unlimited
numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one’s sacrifice or loss, raising
the productive capacity of whatever labor they perform. It is the value of his own
time that the strong of the intellect transfers to the weak, letting them work on
the jobs he discovered, while devoting his time to further discoveries. This is
mutual trade to mutual advantage; the interests of the mind are one, no matter
what the degree of intelligence, among men who desire to work and don’t seek
or expect the unearned.

“In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man who creates a new
invention receives but a small percentage of his value in terms of material
payment, no matter what fortune he makes, no matter what millions he earns.
But the man who works as a janitor in the factory producing that invention,
receives an enormous payment in proportion to the mental effort that his job
requires of him. And the same is true of all men between, on all levels of
ambition and ability. The man at the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes
the most of all those below him, but gets nothing except his material payment,
receiving no intellectual bonus from others to add to the value of his time. The
man at the bottom who, left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude,
contributes nothing to those above him, but receives the bonus of all of their
brains. Such is the nature of the ‘competition’ between the strong and the weak
of the intellect. Such is the pattern of ‘exploitation’ for which you have damned the strong.

“Such was the service we had given you and were glad and willing to give.
What did we ask in return? Nothing but freedom. We required that you leave us
free to function—free to think and to work as we choose—free to take our own
risks and to bear our own losses—free to earn our own profits and to make our
own fortunes—free to gamble on your rationality, to submit our products to your
judgment for the purpose of a voluntary trade, to rely on the objective value of
our work and on your mind’s ability to see it—free to count on your intelligence
and honesty, and to deal with nothing but your mind. Such was the price we
asked, which you chose to reject as too high. You decided to call it unfair that
we, who had dragged you out of your hovels and provided you with modern
apartments, with radios, movies and cars, should own our palaces and yachts—
you decided that you had a right to your wages, but we had no right to our
profits, that you did not want us to deal with your mind, but to deal, instead, with
your gun. Our answer to that, was: ‘May you be damned!’ Our answer came
true. You are.

“You did not care to compete in terms of intelligence—you are now
competing in terms of brutality. You did not care to allow rewards to be won by
successful production—you are now running a race in which rewards are won by
successful plunder. You called it selfish and cruel that men should trade value for
value—you have now established an unselfish society where they trade extortion
for extortion. Your system is a legal civil war, where men gang up on one
another and struggle for possession of the law, which they use as a club over
rivals, till another gang wrests it from their clutch and clubs them with it in their
turn, all of them clamoring protestations of service to an unnamed public’s
unspecified good. You had said that you saw no difference between economic
and political power, between the power of money and the power of guns—no
difference between reward and punishment, no difference between purchase and
plunder, no difference between pleasure and fear, no difference between life and
death. You are learning the difference now.
