You claim that:
- fear and joy are incentives of equal power
- fear is the more ‘practical’

You do not wish to live, and only fear of death still holds you to the existence you have damned. 

You dart in panic through the trap of your days, looking for the exit you have closed, running from a pursuer you dare not name to a terror you dare not acknowledge, and the greater your terror the greater your dread of the only act that could save you: thinking. 

The purpose of your struggle is not to know, not to grasp or name or hear the thing I shall now state to your
hearing: that yours is the Morality of Death.


Death is the standard of your values, death is your chosen goal.

You have to keep running, since there is no escape from the pursuer who is out to destroy you or from the knowledge that that pursuer is yourself. 

<!-- Stop running, for once —there is no place to run—stand naked, as you dread to stand, but as I see you, and take a look at what you dared to call a moral code. -->

Damnation is the start of your morality, destruction is its purpose, means and end.

Your code begins by damning man as evil, then demands that he practice a good which it defines as impossible for him to practice. 

It demands, as his first proof of virtue, that he accept his own depravity without proof. It demands that
he start, not with a standard of value, but with a standard of evil, which is
himself, by means of which he is then to define the good: the good is that which
he is not.

It does not matter who then becomes the profiteer on his renounced glory and tormented soul, a mystic God with some incomprehensible design or any passerby whose rotting sores are held as some inexplicable claim upon him—it does
not matter, the good is not for him to understand, his duty is to crawl through
years of penance, atoning for the guilt of his existence to any stray collector of
unintelligible debts, his only concept of a value is a zero: the good is that which
is non-man.

“The name of this monstrous absurdity is Original Sin.

“A sin without volition is a slap at morality and an insolent contradiction in
terms: that which is outside the possibility of choice is outside the province of
morality. If man is evil by birth, he has no will, no power to change it; if he has
no will, he can be neither good nor evil; a robot is amoral. To hold, as man’s sin,
a fact not open to his choice is a mockery of morality. To hold man’s nature as
his sin is a mockery of nature. To punish him for a crime he committed before he
was born is a mockery of justice. To hold him guilty in a matter where no
innocence exists is a mockery of reason. To destroy morality, nature, justice and
reason by means of a single concept is a feat of evil hardly to be matched. Yet
that is the root of your code.

“Do not hide behind the cowardly evasion that man is born with free will, but
with a ‘tendency’ to evil. A free will saddled with a tendency is like a game with
loaded dice. It forces man to struggle through the effort of playing, to bear
responsibility and pay for the game, but the decision is weighted in favor of a
tendency that he had no power to escape. If the tendency is of his choice, he
cannot possess it at birth; if it is not of his choice, his will is not free.
“What is the nature of the guilt that your teachers call his Original Sin? What
are the evils man acquired when he fell from a state they consider perfection?
Their myth declares that he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge—he acquired a
mind and became a rational being. It was the knowledge of good and evil—he
became a moral being. He was sentenced to earn his bread by his labor—he
became a productive being. He was sentenced to experience desire—he acquired
the capacity of sexual enjoyment. The evils for which they damn him are reason,
morality, creativeness, joy—all the cardinal values of his existence. It is not his
vices that their myth of man’s fall is designed to explain and condemn, it is not
his errors that they hold as his guilt, but the essence of his nature as man.
Whatever he was—that robot in the Garden of Eden, who existed without mind,
without values, without labor, without love—he was not man.

“Man’s fall, according to your teachers, was that he gained the virtues
required to live. These virtues, by their standard, are his Sin. His evil, they
charge, is that he’s man. His guilt, they charge, is that he lives.
“They call it a morality of mercy and a doctrine of love for man.
“No, they say, they do not preach that man is evil, the evil is only that alien
object: his body. No, they say, they do not wish to kill him, they only wish to
make him lose his body. They seek to help him, they say, against his pain—and
they point at the torture rack to which they’ve tied him, the rack with two wheels
that pull him in opposite directions, the rack of the doctrine that splits his soul
and body.

“They have cut man in two, setting one half against the other. They have
taught him that his body and his consciousness are two enemies engaged in
deadly conflict, two antagonists of opposite natures, contradictory claims,
incompatible needs, that to benefit one is to injure the other, that his soul belongs
to a supernatural realm, but his body is an evil prison holding it in bondage to
this earth—and that the good is to defeat his body, to undermine it by years of
patient struggle, digging his way to that glorious jail-break which leads into the
freedom of the grave.

“They have taught man that he is a hopeless misfit made of two elements,
both symbols of death. A body without a soul is a corpse, a soul without a body
is a ghost—yet such is their image of man’s nature: the battleground of a
struggle between a corpse and a ghost, a corpse endowed with some evil volition
of its own and a ghost endowed with the knowledge that everything known to
man is non-existent, that only the unknowable exists.

“Do you observe what human faculty that doctrine was designed to ignore? It
was man’s mind that had to be negated in order to make him fall apart. Once he
surrendered reason, he was left at the mercy of two monsters whom he could not
fathom or control: of a body moved by unaccountable instincts and a soul moved
by mystic revelations—he was left as the passively ravaged victim of a battle
between a robot and a dictaphone.

“And as he now crawls through the wreckage, groping blindly for a way to
live, your teachers offer him the help of a morality that proclaims that he’ll find
no solution and must seek no fulfillment on earth. Real existence, they tell him,
is that which he cannot perceive, true consciousness is the faculty of perceiving
the non-existent—and if he is unable to understand it, that is the proof that his
existence is evil and his consciousness impotent.

“As products of the split between man’s soul and body, there are two kinds of
teachers of the Morality of Death: the mystics of spirit and the mystics of
muscle, whom you call the spiritualists and the materialists, those who believe in
consciousness without existence and those who believe in existence without
consciousness. Both demand the surrender of your mind, one to their revelations,
the other to their reflexes. No matter how loudly they posture in the roles of
irreconcilable antagonists, their moral codes are alike, and so are their aims: in
matter—the enslavement of man’s body, in spirit—the destruction of his mind.

“The good, say the mystics of spirit, is God, a being whose only definition is
that he is beyond man’s power to conceive—a definition that invalidates man’s
consciousness and nullifies his concepts of existence. The good, say the mystics
of muscle, is Society—a thing which they define as an organism that possesses
no physical form, a super-being embodied in no one in particular and everyone
in general except yourself. Man’s mind, say the mystics of spirit, must be
subordinated to the will of God. Man’s mind, say the mystics of muscle, must be
subordinated to the will of Society. Man’s standard of value, say the mystics of
spirit, is the pleasure of God, whose standards are beyond man’s power of
comprehension and must be accepted on faith. Man’s standard of value, say the
mystics of muscle, is the pleasure of Society, whose standards are beyond man’s
right of judgment and must be obeyed as a primary absolute. The purpose of
man’s life, say both, is to become an abject zombie who serves a purpose he
does not know, for reasons he is not to question. His reward, say the mystics of
spirit, will be given to him beyond the grave. His reward, say the mystics of
muscle, will be given on earth—to his great-grandchildren.
