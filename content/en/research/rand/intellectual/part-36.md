The secret of all their esoteric philosophies is to erect on that plastic fog a single holy absolute: their Wish.

<!--  of all their dialectics and super-senses, of their evasive eyes and
snarling words, the secret for which they destroy civilization, language, industries and lives, the secret for which they pierce their own eyes and eardrums, grind out their senses, blank out their minds, the purpose for which
they dissolve the absolutes of reason, logic, matter, existence, reality— -->

The restriction they seek to escape is the law of identity. The freedom they seek is freedom from the fact that an A will remain an A, no matter what their tears or tantrums—that a river will not bring them milk, no matter what their
hunger—that water will not run uphill, no matter what comforts they could gain
if it did, and if they want to lift it to the roof of a skyscraper, they must do it by a
process of thought and labor, in which the nature of an inch of pipeline counts,
but their feelings do not—that their feelings are impotent to alter the course of a
single speck of dust in space or the nature of any action they have committed.

“Those who tell you that man is unable to perceive a reality undistorted by his
senses, mean that they are unwilling to perceive a reality undistorted by their
feelings. ‘Things as they are’ are things as perceived by your mind; divorce them
from reason and they become ‘things as perceived by your wishes.’

“There is no honest revolt against reason—and when you accept any part of
their creed, your motive is to get away with something your reason would not
permit you to attempt. The freedom you seek is freedom from the fact that if you
stole your wealth, you are a scoundrel, no matter how much you give to charity
or how many prayers you recite—that if you sleep with sluts, you’re not a
worthy husband, no matter how anxiously you feel that you love your wife next
morning—that you are an entity, not a series of random pieces scattered through
a universe where nothing sticks and nothing commits you to anything, the
universe of a child’s nightmare where identities switch and swim, where the
rotter and the hero are interchangeable parts arbitrarily assumed at will—that
you are a man—that you are an entity—that you are.

“No matter how eagerly you claim that the goal of your mystic wishing is a
higher mode of life, the rebellion against identity is the wish for non-existence.
The desire not to be anything is the desire not to be.
“Your teachers, the mystics of both schools, have reversed causality in their
consciousness, then strive to reverse it in existence. They take their emotions as
a cause, and their mind as a passive effect. They make their emotions their tool
for perceiving reality. They hold their desires as an irreducible primary, as a fact
superseding all facts. An honest man does not desire until he has identified the
object of his desire. He says: ‘It is, therefore I want it.’ They say: ‘I want it,
therefore it is.’

“They want to cheat the axiom of existence and consciousness, they want their
consciousness to be an instrument not of perceiving but of creating existence,
and existence to be not the object but the subject of their consciousness—they
want to be that God they created in their image and likeness, who creates a
universe out of a void by means of an arbitrary whim. But reality is not to be
cheated. What they achieve is the opposite of their desire. They want an
omnipotent power over existence; instead, they lose the power of their
consciousness. By refusing to know, they condemn themselves to the horror of a
perpetual unknown.

“Those irrational wishes that draw you to their creed, those emotions you
worship as an idol, on whose altar you sacrifice the earth, that dark, incoherent
passion within you, which you take as the voice of God or of your glands, is
nothing more than the corpse of your mind. An emotion that clashes with your
reason, an emotion that you cannot explain or control, is only the carcass of that
stale thinking which you forbade your mind to revise.

“Whenever you committed the evil of refusing to think and to see, of
exempting from the absolute of reality some one small wish of yours, whenever
you chose to say: Let me withdraw from the judgment of reason the cookies I
stole, or the existence of God, let me have my one irrational whim and I will be a
man of reason about all else—that was the act of subverting your consciousness,
the act of corrupting your mind. Your mind then became a fixed jury who takes
orders from a secret underworld, whose verdict distorts the evidence to fit an
absolute it dares not touch—and a censored reality is the result, a splintered
reality where the bits you chose to see are floating among the chasms of those
you didn’t, held together by that embalming fluid of the mind which is an
emotion exempted from thought.

“The links you strive to drown are causal connections. The enemy you seek to
defeat is the law of causality: it permits you no miracles. The law of causality is
the law of identity applied to action. All actions are caused by entities. The
nature of an action is caused and determined by the nature of the entities that act;
a thing cannot act in contradiction to its nature. 

An action not caused by an entity
would be caused by a zero, which would mean a zero controlling a thing, a nonentity controlling an entity, the non-existent ruling the existent—which is the universe of your teachers’ desire, the cause of their doctrines of causeless action,
the reason of their revolt against reason, the goal of their morality, their politics,
their economics, the ideal they strive for: the reign of the zero.
“The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it, too. The
law of causality does not permit you to eat your cake before you have it. But if
you drown both laws in the blanks of your mind, if you pretend to yourself and
to others that you don’t see—then you can try to proclaim your right to eat your
cake today and mine tomorrow, you can preach that the way to have a cake is to
eat it first, before you bake it, that the way to produce is to start by consuming,
that all wishers have an equal claim to all things, since nothing is caused by
anything. The corollary of the causeless in matter is the unearned in spirit.

“Whenever you rebel against causality, your motive is the fraudulent desire,
not to escape it, but worse: to reverse it. You want unearned love, as if love, the
effect, could give you personal value, the cause—you want unearned admiration,
as if admiration, the effect, could give you virtue, the cause—you want unearned
wealth, as if wealth, the effect, could give you ability, the cause—you plead for
mercy, mercy, not justice, as if an unearned forgiveness could wipe out the cause
of your plea. And to indulge your ugly little shams, you support the doctrines of
your teachers, while they run hog-wild proclaiming that spending, the effect,
creates riches, the cause, that machinery, the effect, creates intelligence, the
cause, that your sexual desires, the effect, create your philosophical values, the
cause.

“Who pays for the orgy? Who causes the causeless? Who are the victims,
condemned to remain unacknowledged and to perish in silence, lest their agony
disturb your pretense that they do not exist? We are, we, the men of the mind.
“We are the cause of all the values that you covet, we who perform the
process of thinking, which is the process of defining identity and discovering
causal connections. We taught you to know, to speak, to produce, to desire, to
love. 

You who abandon reason—were it not for us who preserve it, you would
not be able to fulfill or even to conceive your wishes. You would not be able to
desire the clothes that had not been made, the automobile that had not been
invented, the money that had not been devised, as exchange for goods that did
not exist, the admiration that had not been experienced for men who had
achieved nothing, the love that belongs and pertains only to those who preserve
their capacity to think, to choose, to value.

“You—who leap like a savage out of the jungle of your feelings into the Fifth
Avenue of our New York and proclaim that you want to keep the electric lights,
but to destroy the generators—it is our wealth that you use while destroying us,
it is our values that you use while damning us, it is our language that you use
while denying the mind.
“Just as your mystics of spirit invented their heaven in the image of our earth,
omitting our existence, and promised you rewards created by miracle out of nonmatter—so your modern mystics of muscle omit our existence and promise you
a heaven where matter shapes itself of its own causeless will into all the rewards
desired by your non-mind.

“For centuries, the mystics of spirit had existed by running a protection racket
—by making life on earth unbearable, then charging you for consolation and
relief, by forbidding all the virtues that make existence possible, then riding on
the shoulders of your guilt, by declaring production and joy to be sins, then
collecting blackmail from the sinners. We, the men of the mind, were the
unnamed victims of their creed, we who were willing to break their moral code
and to bear damnation for the sin of reason—we who thought and acted, while
they wished and prayed—we who were moral outcasts, we who were
bootleggers of life when life was held to be a crime—while they basked in moral
glory for the virtue of surpassing material greed and of distributing in selfless
charity the material goods produced by—blank-out.
