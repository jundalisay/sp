<!-- THIS IS JOHN GALT SPEAKING -->

This is the philosophy of Objectivism.

This is John Galt -- am who loves his life and does not sacrifice his love or his values.

<!--  I am the man who has deprived you of victims and thus
has destroyed your world, and if you wish to know why you are perishing—you
who dread knowledge—I am the man who will now tell you. . . . -->

This is an age of moral crisis. Man’s sins are destroying the world.

You have cursed human nature for its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded. Since virtue, to you, consists of sacrifice, you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive disaster. In the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils which you held as the cause of your plight. You have sacrificed justice to mercy.

You have sacrificed independence to unity. You have sacrificed reason to faith.

You have sacrificed wealth to need. You have sacrificed self-esteem to selfdenial. You have sacrificed happiness to duty. “You have destroyed all that which you held to be evil and achieved all that which you held to be good. Why, then, do you shrink in horror from the sight of the world around you? That world is not the product of your sins, it is the product and the image of your virtues. It is your moral ideal brought into reality in its full and final perfection. You have fought for it, you have dreamed of it, you have wished it, and I—I am the man who has granted you your wish.

“Your ideal had an implacable enemy, which your code of morality was
designed to destroy. I have withdrawn that enemy. I have taken it out of your
way and out of your reach. I have removed the source of all those evils you were
sacrificing one by one. I have ended your battle. I have stopped your motor. I
have deprived your world of man’s mind.

“You say Men do not live by the mind.

I have withdrawn those who do. The
mind is impotent, you say? I have withdrawn those whose mind isn’t. There are
values higher than the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those for whom there
aren’t.

“While you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice, of
independence, of reason, of wealth, of self-esteem—I beat you to it, I reached
them first. I told them the nature of the game you were playing and the nature of
that moral code of yours, which they had been too innocently generous to grasp.
I showed them the way to live by another morality—mine. It is mine that they
chose to follow.

“All the men who have vanished, the men you hated, yet dreaded to lose, it is
I who have taken them away from you. Do not attempt to find us. We do not
choose to be found. Do not cry that it is our duty to serve you. We do not
recognize such duty. Do not cry that you need us. We do not consider need a
claim. Do not cry that you own us. You don’t. Do not beg us to return. We are on
strike, we, the men of the mind.

“We are on strike against self-immolation. We are on strike against the creed
of unearned rewards and unrewarded duties. We are on strike against the dogma
that the pursuit of one’s happiness is evil. We are on strike against the doctrine
that life is guilt.

“There is a difference between our strike and all those you’ve practiced for
centuries: our strike consists, not of making demands, but of granting them. We
are evil, according to your morality. We have chosen not to harm you any longer.
We are useless, according to your economics. We have chosen not to exploit you
any longer. We are dangerous and to be shackled, according to your politics. We
have chosen not to endanger you, nor to wear the shackles any longer. We are
only an illusion, according to your philosophy. We have chosen not to blind you
any longer and have left you free to face reality—the reality you wanted, the
world as you see it now, a world without mind.

“We have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always
been the givers, but have only now understood it. We have no demands to
present to you, no terms to bargain about, no compromise to reach. You have
nothing to offer us. We do not need you.

“Are you now crying: No, this was not what you wanted? A mindless world of
ruins was not your goal? You did not want us to leave you? You moral cannibals,
I know that you’ve always known what it was that you wanted. But your game is
up, because now we know it, too.

“Through centuries of scourges and disasters, brought about by your code of
morality, you have cried that your code had been broken, that the scourges were
punishment for breaking it, that men were too weak and too selfish to spill all the
blood it required. You damned man, you damned existence, you damned this
earth, but never dared to question your code. Your victims took the blame and
struggled on, with your curses as reward for their martyrdom—while you went
on crying that your code was noble, but human nature was not good enough to
practice it. And no one rose to ask the question: Good?—by what standard?
“You wanted to know John Galt’s identity. I am the man who has asked that
question.

“Yes, this is an age of moral crisis. Yes, you are bearing punishment for your
evil. But it is not man who is now on trial and it is not human nature that will
take the blame. It is your moral code that’s through, this time. Your moral code
has reached its climax, the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish to
go on living, what you now need is not to return to morality—you who have
never known any—but to discover it.

“You have heard no concepts of morality but the mystical or the social. You have been taught that morality is a code of behavior imposed on you by whim, the whim of a supernatural power or the whim of society, to serve God’s purpose
or your neighbor’s welfare, to please an authority beyond the grave or else next
door—but not to serve your life or pleasure. Your pleasure, you have been
taught, is to be found in immorality, your interests would best be served by evil,
and any moral code must be designed not for you, but against you, not to further
your life, but to drain it.

“For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed
that your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your
neighbors—between those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the
sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice
for the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one came to say that your life
belongs to you and that the good is to live it.

“Both sides agreed that morality demands the surrender of your self-interest
and of your mind, that the moral and the practical are opposites, that morality is
not the province of reason, but the province of faith and force. Both sides agreed
that no rational morality is possible, that there is no right or wrong in reason—
that in reason there’s no reason to be moral.

“Whatever else they fought about, it was against man’s mind that all your
moralists have stood united. It was man’s mind that all their schemes and
systems were intended to despoil and destroy. Now choose to perish or to learn
that the anti-mind is the anti-life.
