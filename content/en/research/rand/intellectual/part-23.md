<!-- THIS IS JOHN GALT SPEAKING -->

This is the philosophy of Objectivism.

This is John Galt -- am who loves his life and does not sacrifice his love or his values.

<!--  I am the man who has deprived you of victims and thus
has destroyed your world, and if you wish to know why you are perishing—you
who dread knowledge—I am the man who will now tell you. . . . -->

This is an age of moral crisis. Man’s sins are destroying the world.

You have cursed human nature for
its unwillingness to practice the virtues you demanded. Since virtue, to you,
consists of sacrifice, you have demanded more sacrifices at every successive
disaster. In the name of a return to morality, you have sacrificed all those evils
which you held as the cause of your plight. You have sacrificed justice to mercy.

You have sacrificed independence to unity. You have sacrificed reason to faith.
You have sacrificed wealth to need. You have sacrificed self-esteem to selfdenial. You have sacrificed happiness to duty.
“You have destroyed all that which you held to be evil and achieved all that
which you held to be good. Why, then, do you shrink in horror from the sight of
the world around you? That world is not the product of your sins, it is the
product and the image of your virtues. It is your moral ideal brought into reality
in its full and final perfection. You have fought for it, you have dreamed of it,
you have wished it, and I—I am the man who has granted you your wish.

“Your ideal had an implacable enemy, which your code of morality was
designed to destroy. I have withdrawn that enemy. I have taken it out of your
way and out of your reach. I have removed the source of all those evils you were
sacrificing one by one. I have ended your battle. I have stopped your motor. I
have deprived your world of man’s mind.

“Men do not live by the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those who do. The
mind is impotent, you say? I have withdrawn those whose mind isn’t. There are
values higher than the mind, you say? I have withdrawn those for whom there
aren’t.

“While you were dragging to your sacrificial altars the men of justice, of
independence, of reason, of wealth, of self-esteem—I beat you to it, I reached
them first. I told them the nature of the game you were playing and the nature of
that moral code of yours, which they had been too innocently generous to grasp.
I showed them the way to live by another morality—mine. It is mine that they
chose to follow.
“All the men who have vanished, the men you hated, yet dreaded to lose, it is
I who have taken them away from you. Do not attempt to find us. We do not
choose to be found. Do not cry that it is our duty to serve you. We do not
recognize such duty. Do not cry that you need us. We do not consider need a
claim. Do not cry that you own us. You don’t. Do not beg us to return. We are on
strike, we, the men of the mind.
“We are on strike against self-immolation. We are on strike against the creed
of unearned rewards and unrewarded duties. We are on strike against the dogma
that the pursuit of one’s happiness is evil. We are on strike against the doctrine
that life is guilt.

“There is a difference between our strike and all those you’ve practiced for
centuries: our strike consists, not of making demands, but of granting them. We
are evil, according to your morality. We have chosen not to harm you any longer.
We are useless, according to your economics. We have chosen not to exploit you
any longer. We are dangerous and to be shackled, according to your politics. We
have chosen not to endanger you, nor to wear the shackles any longer. We are
only an illusion, according to your philosophy. We have chosen not to blind you
any longer and have left you free to face reality—the reality you wanted, the
world as you see it now, a world without mind.

“We have granted you everything you demanded of us, we who had always
been the givers, but have only now understood it. We have no demands to
present to you, no terms to bargain about, no compromise to reach. You have
nothing to offer us. We do not need you.

“Are you now crying: No, this was not what you wanted? A mindless world of
ruins was not your goal? You did not want us to leave you? You moral cannibals,
I know that you’ve always known what it was that you wanted. But your game is
up, because now we know it, too.

“Through centuries of scourges and disasters, brought about by your code of
morality, you have cried that your code had been broken, that the scourges were
punishment for breaking it, that men were too weak and too selfish to spill all the
blood it required. You damned man, you damned existence, you damned this
earth, but never dared to question your code. Your victims took the blame and
struggled on, with your curses as reward for their martyrdom—while you went
on crying that your code was noble, but human nature was not good enough to
practice it. And no one rose to ask the question: Good?—by what standard?
“You wanted to know John Galt’s identity. I am the man who has asked that
question.

“Yes, this is an age of moral crisis. Yes, you are bearing punishment for your
evil. But it is not man who is now on trial and it is not human nature that will
take the blame. It is your moral code that’s through, this time. Your moral code
has reached its climax, the blind alley at the end of its course. And if you wish to
go on living, what you now need is not to return to morality—you who have
never known any—but to discover it.
“You have heard no concepts of morality but the mystical or the social. You
have been taught that morality is a code of behavior imposed on you by whim,
the whim of a supernatural power or the whim of society, to serve God’s purpose
or your neighbor’s welfare, to please an authority beyond the grave or else next
door—but not to serve your life or pleasure. Your pleasure, you have been
taught, is to be found in immorality, your interests would best be served by evil,
and any moral code must be designed not for you, but against you, not to further
your life, but to drain it.

“For centuries, the battle of morality was fought between those who claimed
that your life belongs to God and those who claimed that it belongs to your
neighbors—between those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice for the
sake of ghosts in heaven and those who preached that the good is self-sacrifice
for the sake of incompetents on earth. And no one came to say that your life
belongs to you and that the good is to live it.
“Both sides agreed that morality demands the surrender of your self-interest
and of your mind, that the moral and the practical are opposites, that morality is
not the province of reason, but the province of faith and force. Both sides agreed
that no rational morality is possible, that there is no right or wrong in reason—
that in reason there’s no reason to be moral.
“Whatever else they fought about, it was against man’s mind that all your
moralists have stood united. It was man’s mind that all their schemes and
systems were intended to despoil and destroy. Now choose to perish or to learn
that the anti-mind is the anti-life.

“Man’s mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not.
His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its
content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know
the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without a
knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch—or build a
cyclotron—without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To
remain alive, he must think.

“But to think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call
‘human nature,’ the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that
man is a being of volitional consciousness. Reason does not work automatically;
thinking is not a mechanical process; the connections of logic are not made by
instinct. The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; the function
of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are free to think or to
evade that effort. But you are not free to escape from your nature, from the fact
that reason is your means of survival—so that for you, who are a human being,
the question ‘to be or not to be’ is the question ‘to think or not to think.’
“A being of volitional consciousness has no automatic course of behavior. He
needs a code of values to guide his actions. ‘Value’ is that which one acts to gain
and keep, ‘virtue’ is the action by which one gains and keeps it. ‘Value’
presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? ‘Value’
presupposes a standard, a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an
alternative. Where there are no alternatives, no values are possible.
“There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or nonexistence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. The
existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it
depends on a specific course of action. Matter is indestructible, it changes its
forms, but it cannot cease to exist. It is only a living organism that faces a
constant alternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining
and self-generated action. If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical
elements remain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’
that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity that things
can be good or evil.
“A plant must feed itself in order to live; the sunlight, the water, the chemicals
it needs are the values its nature has set it to pursue; its life is the standard of
value directing its actions. But a plant has no choice of action; there are
alternatives in the conditions it encounters, but there is no alternative in its
function: it acts automatically to further its life, it cannot act for its own
destruction.

“An animal is equipped for sustaining its life; its senses provide it with an
automatic code of action, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil.
It has no power to extend its knowledge or to evade it. In conditions where its
knowledge proves inadequate, it dies. But so long as it lives, it acts on its
knowledge, with automatic safety and no power of choice, it is unable to ignore
its own good, unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer.
“Man has no automatic code of survival. His particular distinction from all
other living species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means of
volitional choice. He has no automatic knowledge of what is good for him or
evil, what values his life depends on, what course of action it requires. Are you
prattling about an instinct of self-preservation? An instinct of self-preservation is
precisely what man does not possess. An ‘instinct’ is an unerring and automatic
form of knowledge. A desire is not an instinct. A desire to live does not give you
the knowledge required for living. And even man’s desire to live is not
automatic: your secret evil today is that that is the desire you do not hold. Your
fear of death is not a love for life and will not give you the knowledge needed to
keep it. Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of
thinking, which nature will not force him to perform. Man has the power to act
as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his
history.

“A living entity that regarded its means of survival as evil, would not survive.
A plant that struggled to mangle its roots, a bird that fought to break its wings
would not remain for long in the existence they affronted. But the history of man
has been a struggle to deny and to destroy his mind.
“Man has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice—
and the alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal.
Man has to be man—by choice; he has to hold his life as a value—by choice; he
has to learn to sustain it—by choice; he has to discover the values it requires and
practice his virtues—by choice.

“A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality.
“Whoever you are, you who are hearing me now, I am speaking to whatever
living remnant is left uncorrupted within you, to the remnant of the human, to
your mind, and I say: There is a morality of reason, a morality proper to man,
and Man’s Life is its standard of value.
“All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; all that
which destroys it is the evil.

“Man’s life, as required by his nature, is not the life of a mindless brute, of a
looting thug or a mooching mystic, but the life of a thinking being—not life by
means of force or fraud, but life by means of achievement—not survival at any
price, since there’s only one price that pays for man’s survival: reason.
“Man’s life is the standard of morality, but your own life is its purpose. If
existence on earth is your goal, you must choose your actions and values by the
standard of that which is proper to man—for the purpose of preserving, fulfilling
and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life.
“Since life requires a specific course of action, any other course will destroy
it. A being who does not hold his own life as the motive and goal of his actions,
is acting on the motive and standard of death. Such a being is a metaphysical
monstrosity, struggling to oppose, negate and contradict the fact of his own
existence, running blindly amuck on a trail of destruction, capable of nothing but
pain.

“Happiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death. Happiness
is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one’s
values. A morality that dares to tell you to find happiness in the renunciation of
your happiness—to value the failure of your values—is an insolent negation of
morality. A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, the role of a sacrificial animal
seeking slaughter on the altars of others, is giving you death as your standard.
By the grace of reality and the nature of life, man—every man—is an end in
himself, he exists for his own sake, and the achievement of his own happiness is
his highest moral purpose.

“But neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational
whims. Just as man is free to attempt to survive in any random manner, but will
perish unless he lives as his nature requires, so he is free to seek his happiness in
any mindless fraud, but the torture of frustration is all he will find, unless he
seeks the happiness proper to man. The purpose of morality is to teach you, not
to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.
“Sweep aside those parasites of subsidized classrooms, who live on the profits
of the mind of others and proclaim that man needs no morality, no values, no
code of behavior. They, who pose as scientists and claim that man is only an
animal, do not grant him inclusion in the law of existence they have granted to
the lowest of insects. They recognize that every living species has a way of
survival demanded by its nature, they do not claim that a fish can live out of
water or that a dog can live without its sense of smell—but man, they claim, the
most complex of beings, man can survive in any way whatever, man has no
identity, no nature, and there’s no practical reason why he cannot live with his
means of survival destroyed, with his mind throttled and placed at the disposal of
any orders they might care to issue.
“Sweep aside those hatred-eaten mystics, who pose as friends of humanity and
preach that the highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as of no
value. Do they tell you that the purpose of morality is to curb man’s instinct of
self-preservation? It is for the purpose of self-preservation that man needs a code
of morality. The only man who desires to be moral is the man who desires to
live.
“No, you do not have to live; it is your basic act of choice; but if you choose
to live, you must live as a man—by the work and the judgment of your mind.
“No, you do not have to live as a man; it is an act of moral choice. But you
cannot live as anything else—and the alternative is that state of living death
which you now see within you and around you, the state of a thing unfit for
existence, no longer human and less than animal, a thing that knows nothing but
pain and drags itself through its span of years in the agony of unthinking selfdestruction.
“No, you do not have to think; it is an act of moral choice. But someone had
to think to keep you alive; if you choose to default, you default on existence and
you pass the deficit to some moral man, expecting him to sacrifice his good for
the sake of letting you survive by your evil.
“No, you do not have to be a man; but today those who are, are not there any
longer. I have removed your means of survival—your victims.
“If you wish to know how I have done it and what I told them to make them
quit, you are hearing it now. I told them, in essence, the statement I am making
tonight. They were men who had lived by my code, but had not known how
great a virtue it represented. I made them see it. I brought them, not a reevaluation, but only an identification of their values.

“We, the men of the mind, are now on strike against you in the name of a
single axiom, which is the root of our moral code, just as the root of yours is the
wish to escape it: the axiom that existence exists.
“Existence exists—and the act of grasping that statement implies two
corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists
possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that
which exists.
“If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with
nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious
of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as
consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claim to
perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.
“Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two—existence and
consciousness—are axioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible
primaries implied in any action you undertake, in any part of your knowledge
and in its sum, from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to
the widest erudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape
of a pebble or the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it
exists and that you know it.
“To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of nonexistence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes.
Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors—the greatest of
your philosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and
the rule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You have never grasped the
meaning of his statement. I am here to complete it: Existence is Identity,
Consciousness is Identification.
“Whatever you choose to consider, be it an object, an attribute or an action,
the law of identity remains the same. A leaf cannot be a stone at the same time, it
cannot be all red and all green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the
same time. A is A. Or, if you wish it stated in simpler language: You cannot have
your cake and eat it, too.
“Are you seeking to know what is wrong with the world? All the disasters that
have wrecked your world, came from your leaders’ attempt to evade the fact that
A is A. All the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain you have
ever endured, came from your own attempt to evade the fact that A is A. The
purpose of those who taught you to evade it, was to make you forget that Man is
Man.

“Man cannot survive except by gaining knowledge, and reason is his only
means to gain it. Reason is the faculty that perceives, identifies and integrates
the material provided by his senses. The task of his senses is to give him the
evidence of existence, but the task of identifying it belongs to his reason, his
senses tell him only that something is, but what it is must be learned by his mind.
“All thinking is a process of identification and integration. Man perceives a
blob of color; by integrating the evidence of his sight and his touch, he learns to
identify it as a solid object; he learns to identify the object as a table; he learns
that the table is made of wood; he learns that the wood consists of cells, that the
cells consist of molecules, that the molecules consist of atoms. All through this
process, the work of his mind consists of answers to a single question: What is
it? His means to establish the truth of his answers is logic, and logic rests on the
axiom that existence exists. Logic is the art of non-contradictory identification.
A contradiction cannot exist. An atom is itself, and so is the universe; neither can
contradict its own identity; nor can a part contradict the whole. No concept man
forms is valid unless he integrates it without contradiction into the total sum of
his knowledge. To arrive at a contradiction is to confess an error in one’s
thinking; to maintain a contradiction is to abdicate one’s mind and to evict
oneself from the realm of reality.
“Reality is that which exists; the unreal does not exist; the unreal is merely
that negation of existence which is the content of a human consciousness when it
attempts to abandon reason. Truth is the recognition of reality; reason, man’s
only means of knowledge, is his only standard of truth.
“The most depraved sentence you can now utter is to ask: Whose reason? The
answers is: Yours. No matter how vast your knowledge or how modest, it is your
own mind that has to acquire it. It is only with your own knowledge that you can
deal. It is only your own knowledge that you can claim to possess or ask others
to consider. Your mind is your only judge of truth—and if others dissent from
your verdict, reality is the court of final appeal. Nothing but a man’s mind can
perform that complex, delicate, crucial process of identification which is
thinking. Nothing can direct the process but his own judgment. Nothing can
direct his judgment but his moral integrity.
“You who speak of a ‘moral instinct’ as if it were some separate endowment
opposed to reason—man’s reason is his moral faculty. A process of reason is a
process of constant choice in answer to the question: True or False?—Right or
Wrong? Is a seed to be planted in soil in order to grow—right or wrong? Is a
man’s wound to be disinfected in order to save his life—right or wrong? Does
the nature of atmospheric electricity permit it to be converted into kinetic power
—right or wrong? It is the answers to such questions that gave you everything
you have—and the answers came from a man’s mind, a mind of intransigent
devotion to that which is right.

“A rational process is a moral process. You may make an error at any step of
it, with nothing to protect you but your own severity, or you may try to cheat, to
fake the evidence and evade the effort of the quest—but if devotion to truth is
the hallmark of morality, then there is no greater, nobler, more heroic form of
devotion than the act of a man who assumes the responsibility of thinking.
“That which you call your soul or spirit is your consciousness, and that which
you call ‘free will’ is your mind’s freedom to think or not, the only will you
have, your only freedom, the choice that controls all the choices you make and
determines your life and your character.
“Thinking is man’s only basic virtue, from which all the others proceed. And
his basic vice, the source of all his evils, is that nameless act which all of you
practice, but struggle never to admit: the act of blanking out, the willful
suspension of one’s consciousness, the refusal to think—not blindness, but the
refusal to see; not ignorance, but the refusal to know. It is the act of unfocusing
your mind and inducing an inner fog to escape the responsibility of judgment—
on the unstated premise that a thing will not exist if only you refuse to identify it,
that A will not be A so long as you do not pronounce the verdict ‘It is.’ Nonthinking is an act of annihilation, a wish to negate existence, an attempt to wipe
out reality. But existence exists; reality is not to be wiped out, it will merely wipe
out the wiper. By refusing to say ‘It is,’ you are refusing to say ‘I am.’ By
suspending your judgment, you are negating your person. When a man declares:
‘Who am I to know?’—he is declaring: ‘Who am I to live?’
“This, in every hour and every issue, is your basic moral choice: thinking or
non-thinking, existence or non-existence, A or non-A, entity or zero.
“To the extent to which a man is rational, life is the premise directing his
actions. To the extent to which he is irrational, the premise directing his actions
is death.
“You who prattle that morality is social and that man would need no morality
on a desert island—it is on a desert island that he would need it most. Let him try
to claim, when there are no victims to pay for it, that a rock is a house, that sand
is clothing, that food will drop into his mouth without cause or effort, that he will
collect a harvest tomorrow by devouring his stock seed today—and reality will
wipe him out, as he deserves; reality will show him that life is a value to be
bought and that thinking is the only coin noble enough to buy it.
“If I were to speak your kind of language, I would say that man’s only moral
commandment is: Thou shalt think. But a ‘moral commandment’ is a
contradiction in terms. The moral is the chosen, not the forced; the understood,
not the obeyed. The moral is the rational, and reason accepts no commandments.
“My morality, the morality of reason, is contained in a single axiom: existence
exists—and in a single choice: to live. The rest proceeds from these. To live,
man must hold three things as the supreme and ruling values of his life: Reason
—Purpose—Self-esteem. Reason, as his only tool of knowledge—Purpose, as
his choice of the happiness which that tool must proceed to achieve—Selfesteem, as his inviolate certainty that his mind is competent to think and his person is worthy of happiness, which means: is worthy of living. These three
values imply and require all of man’s virtues, and all his virtues pertain to the
relation of existence and consciousness: rationality, independence, integrity,
honesty, justice, productiveness, pride.
