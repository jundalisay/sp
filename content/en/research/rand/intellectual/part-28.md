“This idol of your cult of zero-worship, this symbol of impotence—the
congenital dependent—is your image of man and your standard of value, in
whose likeness you strive to refashion your soul. ‘It’s only human,’ you cry in
defense of any depravity, reaching the stage of self-abasement where you seek to
make the concept ‘human’ mean the weakling, the fool, the rotter, the liar, the
failure, the coward, the fraud, and to exile from the human race the hero, the
thinker, the producer, the inventor, the strong, the purposeful, the pure—as if ‘to
feel’ were human, but to think were not, as if to fail were human, but to succeed
were not, as if corruption were human, but virtue were not—as if the premise of
death were proper to man, but the premise of life were not.
“In order to deprive us of honor, that you may then deprive us of our wealth,
you have always regarded us as slaves who deserve no moral recognition. You
praise any venture that claims to be non-profit, and damn the men who made the
profits that make the venture possible. You regard as ‘in the public interest’ any
project serving those who do not pay; it is not in the public interest to provide
any services for those who do the paying. ‘Public benefit’ is anything given as
alms; to engage in trade is to injure the public. ‘Public welfare’ is the welfare of
those who do not earn it; those who do, are entitled to no welfare. ‘The public,’
to you, is whoever has failed to achieve any virtue or value; whoever achieves it,
whoever provides the goods you require for survival, ceases to be regarded as
part of the public or as part of the human race.
“What blank-out permitted you to hope that you could get away with this
muck of contradictions and to plan it as an ideal society, when the ‘No’ of your
victims was sufficient to demolish the whole of your structure? What permits
any insolent beggar to wave his sores in the face of his betters and to plead for
help in the tone of a threat? You cry, as he does, that you are counting on our
pity, but your secret hope is the moral code that has taught you to count on our
guilt. You expect us to feel guilty of our virtues in the presence of your vices,
wounds and failures—guilty of succeeding at existence, guilty of enjoying the
life that you damn, yet beg us to help you to live.

“Did you want to know who is John Galt? I am the first man of ability who
refused to regard it as guilt. I am the first man who would not do penance for my
virtues or let them be used as the tools of my destruction. I am the first man who
would not suffer martyrdom at the hands of those who wished me to perish for
the privilege of keeping them alive. I am the first man who told them that I did
not need them, and until they learned to deal with me as traders, giving value for
value, they would have to exist without me, as I would exist without them; then I
would let them learn whose is the need and whose the ability—and if human
survival is the standard, whose terms would set the way to survive.
“I have done by plan and intention what had been done throughout history by
silent default. There have always been men of intelligence who went on strike, in
protest and despair, but they did not know the meaning of their action. The man
who retires from public life, to think, but not to share his thoughts—the man
who chooses to spend his years in the obscurity of menial employment, keeping
to himself the fire of his mind, never giving it form, expression or reality,
refusing to bring it into a world he despises—the man who is defeated by
revulsion, the man who renounces before he has started, the man who gives up
rather than give in, the man who functions at a fraction of his capacity, disarmed
by his longing for an ideal he has not found—they are on strike, on strike against
unreason, on strike against your world and your values. But not knowing any
values of their own, they abandoned the quest to know—in the darkness of their
hopeless indignation, which is righteous without knowledge of the right, and
passionate without knowledge of desire, they concede to you the power of reality
and surrender the incentives of their mind—and they perish in bitter futility, as
rebels who never learned the object of their rebellion, as lovers who never
discovered their love.

“The infamous times you call the Dark Ages were an era of intelligence on
strike, when men of ability went underground and lived undiscovered, studying
in secret, and died, destroying the works of their mind, when only a few of the
bravest of martyrs remained to keep the human race alive. Every period ruled by
mystics was an era of stagnation and want, when most men were on strike
against existence, working for less than their barest survival, leaving nothing but
scraps for their rulers to loot, refusing to think, to venture, to produce, when the
ultimate collector of their profits and the final authority on truth or error was the
whim of some gilded degenerate sanctioned as superior to reason by divine right
and by grace of a club. The road of human history was a string of blank-outs
over sterile stretches eroded by faith and force, with only a few brief bursts of
sunlight, when the released energy of the men of the mind performed the
wonders you gaped at, admired and promptly extinguished again.

“But there will be no extinction, this time. The game of the mystics is up. You
will perish in and by your own unreality. We, the men of reason, will survive.
“I have called out on strike the kind of martyrs who had never deserted you
before. I have given them the weapon they had lacked: the knowledge of their
own moral value. I have taught them that the world is ours, whenever we choose
to claim it, by virtue and grace of the fact that ours is the Morality of Life. They,
the great victims who had produced all the wonders of humanity’s brief summer,
they, the industrialists, the conquerors of matter, had not discovered the nature of
their right. They had known that theirs was the power. I taught them that theirs
was the glory.

“You, who dare to regard us as the moral inferiors of any mystic who claims
supernatural visions—you, who scramble like vultures for plundered pennies,
yet honor a fortune-teller above a fortune-maker—you, who scorn a
businessman as ignoble, but esteem any posturing artist as exalted—the root of
your standards is that mystic miasma which comes from primordial swamps, that
cult of death, which pronounces a businessman immoral by reason of the fact
that he keeps you alive. You, who claim that you long to rise above the crude
concerns of the body, above the drudgery of serving mere physical needs—who
is enslaved by physical needs: the Hindu who labors from sunrise to sunset at the
shafts of a hand-plow for a bowl of rice, or the American who is driving a
tractor? Who is the conqueror of physical reality: the man who sleeps on a bed of
nails or the man who sleeps on an inner-spring mattress? Which is the monument
to the triumph of the human spirit over matter: the germ-eaten hovels on the
shorelines of the Ganges or the Atlantic skyline of New York?

“Unless you learn the answers to these questions—and learn to stand at
reverent attention when you face the achievements of man’s mind—you will not
stay much longer on this earth, which we love and will not permit you to damn.
You will not sneak by with the rest of your lifespan. I have foreshortened the
usual course of history and have let you discover the nature of the payment you
had hoped to switch to the shoulders of others. It is the last of your own living
power that will now be drained to provide the unearned for the worshippers and
carriers of Death. Do not pretend that a malevolent reality defeated you—you
were defeated by your own evasions. Do not pretend that you will perish for a
noble ideal—you will perish as fodder for the haters of man.

“But to those of you who still retain a remnant of the dignity and will to love
one’s life, I am offering the chance to make a choice. Choose whether you wish
to perish for a morality you have never believed or practiced. Pause on the brink
of self-destruction and examine your values and your life. You had known how
to take an inventory of your wealth. Now take an inventory of your mind.
“Since childhood, you have been hiding the guilty secret that you feel no
desire to be moral, no desire to seek self-immolation, that you dread and hate
your code, but dare not say it even to yourself, that you’re devoid of those moral
‘instincts’ which others profess to feel. The less you felt, the louder you
proclaimed your selfless love and servitude to others, in dread of ever letting
them discover your own self, the self that you betrayed, the self that you kept in
concealment, like a skeleton in the closet of your body. And they, who were at
once your dupes and your deceivers, they listened and voiced their loud
approval, in dread of ever letting you discover that they were harboring the same
unspoken secret. Existence among you is a giant pretense, an act you all perform
for one another, each feeling that he is the only guilty freak, each placing his
moral authority in the unknowable known only to others, each faking the reality
he feels they expect him to fake, none having the courage to break the vicious
circle.

“No matter what dishonorable compromise you’ve made with your
impracticable creed, no matter what miserable balance, half-cynicism, halfsuperstition, you now manage to maintain, you still preserve the root, the lethal
tenet: the belief that the moral and the practical are opposites. Since childhood,
you have been running from the terror of a choice you have never dared fully to
identify: If the practical, whatever you must practice to exist, whatever works,
succeeds, achieves your purpose, whatever brings you food and joy, whatever
profits you, is evil—and if the good, the moral, is the impractical, whatever fails,
destroys, frustrates, whatever injures you and brings you loss or pain—then your
choice is to be moral or to live.
“The sole result of that murderous doctrine was to remove morality from life.
You grew up to believe that moral laws bear no relation to the job of living,
except as an impediment and threat, that man’s existence is an amoral jungle
where anything goes and anything works. And in that fog of switching
definitions which descends upon a frozen mind, you have forgotten that the evils
damned by your creed were the virtues required for living, and you have come to
believe that actual evils are the practical means of existence. Forgetting that the
impractical ‘good’ was self-sacrifice, you believe that self-esteem is impractical;
forgetting that the practical ‘evil’ was production, you believe that robbery is
practical.

“Swinging like a helpless branch in the wind of an uncharted moral
wilderness, you dare not fully to be evil or fully to live. When you are honest,
you feel the resentment of a sucker; when you cheat, you feel terror and shame.
When you are happy, your joy is diluted by guilt; when you suffer, your pain is
augmented by the feeling that pain is your natural state. You pity the men you
admire, you believe they are doomed to fail; you envy the men you hate, you
believe they are the masters of existence. You feel disarmed when you come up
against a scoundrel: you believe that evil is bound to win, since the moral is the
impotent, the impractical.
“Morality, to you, is a phantom scarecrow made of duty, of boredom, of
punishment, of pain, a cross-breed between the first schoolteacher of your past
and the tax collector of your present, a scarecrow standing in a barren field,
waving a stick to chase away your pleasures—and pleasure, to you, is a liquorsoggy brain, a mindless slut, the stupor of a moron who stakes his cash on some
animal’s race, since pleasure cannot be moral.

“If you identify your actual belief, you will find a triple damnation—of
yourself, of life, of virtue—in the grotesque conclusion you have reached: you
believe that morality is a necessary evil.

“Do you wonder why you live without dignity, love without fire and die
without resistance? Do you wonder why, wherever you look, you see nothing but
unanswerable questions, why your life is torn by impossible conflicts, why you
spend it straddling irrational fences to evade artificial choices, such as soul or
body, mind or heart, security or freedom, private profit or public good?
“Do you cry that you find no answers? By what means did you hope to find
them? You reject your tool of perception—your mind—then complain that the
universe is a mystery. You discard your key, then wail that all doors are locked
against you. You start out in pursuit of the irrational, then damn existence for
making no sense.

“The fence you have been straddling for two hours—while hearing my words
and seeking to escape them—is the coward’s formula contained in the sentence:
‘But we don’t have to go to extremes!’ The extreme you have always struggled
to avoid is the recognition that reality is final, that A is A and that the truth is
true. A moral code impossible to practice, a code that demands imperfection or
death, has taught you to dissolve all ideas in fog, to permit no firm definitions, to
regard any concept as approximate and any rule of conduct as elastic, to hedge
on any principle, to compromise on any value, to take the middle of any road. By
extorting your acceptance of supernatural absolutes, it has forced you to reject
the absolute of nature. By making moral judgments impossible, it has made you
incapable of rational judgment. A code that forbids you to cast the first stone, has
forbidden you to admit the identity of stones and to know when or if you’re
being stoned.

“The man who refuses to judge, who neither agrees nor disagrees, who
declares that there are no absolutes and believes that he escapes responsibility, is
the man responsible for all the blood that is now spilled in the world. Reality is
an absolute, existence is an absolute, a speck of dust is an absolute and so is a
human life. Whether you live or die is an absolute. Whether you have a piece of
bread or not, is an absolute. Whether you eat your bread or see it vanish into a
looter’s stomach, is an absolute.
“There are two sides to every issue: one side is right and the other is wrong,
but the middle is always evil. The man who is wrong still retains some respect
for truth, if only by accepting the responsibility of choice. But the man in the
middle is the knave who blanks out the truth in order to pretend that no choice or
values exist, who is willing to sit out the course of any battle, willing to cash in
on the blood of the innocent or to crawl on his belly to the guilty, who dispenses
justice by condemning both the robber and the robbed to jail, who solves
conflicts by ordering the thinker and the fool to meet each other halfway. In any
compromise between food and poison, it is only death that can win. In any
compromise between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit. In that
transfusion of blood which drains the good to feed the evil, the compromiser is
the transmitting rubber tube.
“You, who are half-rational, half-coward, have been playing a con game with
reality, but the victim you have conned is yourself. When men reduce their
virtues to the approximate, then evil acquires the force of an absolute, when
loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped by the virtuous, it’s picked up by
scoundrels—and you get the indecent spectacle of a cringing, bargaining,
traitorous good and a self-righteously uncompromising evil. As you surrendered
to the mystics of muscle when they told you that ignorance consists of claiming
knowledge, so now you surrender to them when they shriek that immorality
consists of pronouncing moral judgment. When they yell that it is selfish to be
certain that you are right, you hasten to assure them that you’re certain of
nothing. When they shout that it’s immoral to stand on your convictions, you
assure them that you have no convictions whatever. When the thugs of Europe’s
People’s States snarl that you are guilty of intolerance, because you don’t treat
your desire to live and their desire to kill you as a difference of opinion—you
cringe and hasten to assure them that you are not intolerant of any horror. When
some barefoot bum in some pesthole of Asia yells at you: How dare you be rich
—you apologize and beg him to be patient and promise him you’ll give it all
away.

“You have reached the blind alley of the treason you committed when you
agreed that you had no right to exist. Once, you believed it was ‘only a
compromise’: you conceded it was evil to live for yourself, but moral to live for
the sake of your children. Then you conceded that it was selfish to live for your
children, but moral to live for your community. Then you conceded that it was
selfish to live for your community, but moral to live for your country. Now, you
are letting this greatest of countries be devoured by any scum from any corner of
the earth, while you concede that it is selfish to live for your country and that
your moral duty is to live for the globe. A man who has no right to life, has no
right to values and will not keep them.

“At the end of your road of successive betrayals, stripped of weapons, of
certainty, of honor, you commit your final act of treason and sign your petition of
intellectual bankruptcy: while the muscle-mystics of the People’s States
proclaim that they’re the champions of reason and science, you agree and hasten
to proclaim that faith is your cardinal principle, that reason is on the side of your
destroyers, but yours is the side of faith. To the struggling remnants of rational
honesty in the twisted, bewildered minds of your children, you declare that you
can offer no rational argument to support the ideas that created this country, that
there is no rational justification for freedom, for property, for justice, for rights,
that they rest on a mystical insight and can be accepted only on faith, that in
reason and logic the enemy is right, but faith is superior to reason. You declare to
your children that it is rational to loot, to torture, to enslave, to expropriate, to
murder, but that they must resist the temptations of logic and stick to the
discipline of remaining irrational—that skyscrapers, factories, radios, airplanes
were the products of faith and mystic intuition, while famines, concentration
camps and firing squads are the products of a reasonable manner of existence—
that the industrial revolution was the revolt of the men of faith against that era of
reason and logic which is known as the Middle Ages. Simultaneously, in the
same breath, to the same child, you declare that the looters who rule the People’s
States will surpass this country in material production, since they are the
representatives of science, but that it’s evil to be concerned with physical wealth
and that one must renounce material prosperity—you declare that the looters’
ideals are noble, but they do not mean them, while you do; that your purpose in
fighting the looters is only to accomplish their aims, which they cannot
accomplish, but you can; and that the way to fight them is to beat them to it and
give one’s wealth away. Then you wonder why your children join the People’s
thugs or become half-crazed delinquents, you wonder why the looters’ conquests
keep creeping closer to your doors—and you blame it on human stupidity,
declaring that the masses are impervious to reason.

“You blank out the open, public spectacle of the looters’ fight against the
mind, and the fact that their bloodiest horrors are unleashed to punish the crime
of thinking. You blank out the fact that most mystics of muscle started out as
mystics of spirit, that they keep switching from one to the other, that the men
you call materialists and spiritualists are only two halves of the same dissected
human, forever seeking completion, but seeking it by swinging from the
destruction of the flesh to the destruction of the soul and vice versa—that they
keep running from your colleges to the slave pens of Europe to an open collapse
into the mystic muck of India, seeking any refuge against reality, any form of
escape from the mind.

“You blank it out and cling to your hypocrisy of ‘faith’ in order to blank out
the knowledge that the looters have a stranglehold upon you, which consists of
your moral code—that the looters are the final and consistent practitioners of the
morality you’re half-obeying, half-evading—that they practice it the only way it
can be practiced: by turning the earth into a sacrificial furnace—that your
morality forbids you to oppose them in the only way they can be opposed: by
refusing to become a sacrificial animal and proudly asserting your right to exist
—that in order to fight them to the finish and with full rectitude, it is your
morality that you have to reject.

“You blank it out, because your self-esteem is tied to that mystic
‘unselfishness’ which you’ve never possessed or practiced, but spent so many
years pretending to possess that the thought of denouncing it fills you with terror.
No value is higher than self-esteem, but you’ve invested it in counterfeit
securities—and now your morality has caught you in a trap where you are forced
to protect your self-esteem by fighting for the creed of self-destruction. The grim
joke is on you: that need of self-esteem, which you’re unable to explain or to
define, belongs to my morality, not yours; it’s the objective token of my code, it
is my proof within your own soul.

“By a feeling he has not learned to identify, but has derived from his first
awareness of existence, from his discovery that he has to make choices, man
knows that his desperate need of self-esteem is a matter of life or death. As a
being of volitional consciousness, he knows that he must know his own value in
order to maintain his own life. He knows that he has to be right; to be wrong in
action means danger to his life; to be wrong in person, to be evil, means to be
unfit for existence.

“Every act of man’s life has to be willed; the mere act of obtaining or eating
his food implies that the person he preserves is worthy of being preserved; every
pleasure he seeks to enjoy implies that the person who seeks it is worthy of
finding enjoyment. He has no choice about his need of self-esteem, his only
choice is the standard by which to gauge it. And he makes his fatal error when
he switches this gauge protecting his life into the service of his own destruction,
when he chooses a standard contradicting existence and sets his self-esteem
against reality.

“Every form of causeless self-doubt, every feeling of inferiority and secret
unworthiness is, in fact, man’s hidden dread of his inability to deal with
existence. But the greater his terror, the more fiercely he clings to the murderous
doctrines that choke him. No man can survive the moment of pronouncing
himself irredeemably evil; should he do it, his next moment is insanity or
suicide. To escape it—if he’s chosen an irrational standard—he will fake, evade,
blank out; he will cheat himself of reality, of existence, of happiness, of mind;
and he will ultimately cheat himself of self-esteem by struggling to preserve its
illusion rather than to risk discovering its lack. To fear to face an issue is to
believe that the worst is true.

“It is not any crime you have ever committed that infects your soul with
permanent guilt, it is none of your failures, errors or flaws, but the blank-out by
which you attempt to evade them—it is not any sort of Original Sin or unknown
prenatal deficiency, but the knowledge and fact of your basic default, of
suspending your mind, of refusing to think. Fear and guilt are your chronic
emotions, they are real and you do deserve them, but they don’t come from the
superficial reasons you invent to disguise their cause, not from your
‘selfishness,’ weakness or ignorance, but from a real and basic threat to your
existence: fear, because you have abandoned your weapon of survival, guilt,
because you know you have done it volitionally.
“The self you have betrayed is your mind; self-esteem is reliance on one’s
power to think. The ego you seek, that essential ‘you’ which you cannot express
or define, is not your emotions or inarticulate dreams, but your intellect, that
judge of your supreme tribunal whom you’ve impeached in order to drift at the
mercy of any stray shyster you describe as your ‘feeling.’ Then you drag
yourself through a self-made night, in a desperate quest for a nameless fire,
moved by some fading vision of a dawn you had seen and lost.

“Observe the persistence, in mankind’s mythologies, of the legend about a
paradise that men had once possessed, the city of Atlantis or the Garden of Eden
or some kingdom of perfection, always behind us. The root of that legend exists,
not in the past of the race, but in the past of every man. You still retain a sense—
not as firm as a memory, but diffused like the pain of hopeless longing—that
somewhere in the starting years of your childhood, before you had learned to
submit, to absorb the terror of unreason and to doubt the value of your mind, you
had known a radiant state of existence, you had known the independence of a
rational consciousness facing an open universe. That is the paradise which you
have lost, which you seek—which is yours for the taking.

“Some of you will never know who is John Galt. But those of you who have
known a single moment of love for existence and of pride in being its worthy
lover, a moment of looking at this earth and letting your glance be its sanction,
have known the state of being a man, and I—I am only the man who knew that
that state is not to be betrayed. I am the man who knew what made it possible
and who chose consistently to practice and to be what you had practiced and
been in that one moment.

“That choice is yours to make. That choice—the dedication to one’s highest
potential—is made by accepting the fact that the noblest act you have ever
performed is the act of your mind in the process of grasping that two and two
make four.
“Whoever you are—you who are alone with my words in this moment, with
nothing but your honesty to help you understand—the choice is still open to be a
human being, but the price is to start from scratch, to stand naked in the face of
reality and, reversing a costly historical error, to declare: ‘I am, therefore I’ll
think.’
“Accept the irrevocable fact that your life depends upon your mind. Admit
that the whole of your struggle, your doubts, your fakes, your evasions, was a
desperate quest for escape from the responsibility of a volitional consciousness
—a quest for automatic knowledge, for instinctive action, for intuitive certainty
—and while you called it a longing for the state of an angel, what you were
seeking was the state of an animal. Accept, as your moral ideal, the task of
becoming a man.

“Do not say that you’re afraid to trust your mind because you know so little.
Are you safer in surrendering to mystics and discarding the little that you know?
Live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the
limit of your life. Redeem your mind from the hockshops of authority. Accept
the fact that you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give you
omniscience—that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not make
you infallible—that an error made on your own is safer than ten truths accepted
on faith, because the first leaves you the means to correct it, but the second
destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error. In place of your dream of
an omniscient automaton, accept the fact that any knowledge man acquires is
acquired by his own will and effort, and that that is his distinction in the
universe, that is his nature, his morality, his glory.

“Discard that unlimited license to evil which consists of claiming that man is
imperfect. By what standard do you damn him when you claim it? Accept the
fact that in the realm of morality nothing less than perfection will do. But
perfection is not to be gauged by mystic commandments to practice the
impossible, and your moral stature is not to be gauged by matters not open to
your choice. Man has a single basic choice: to think or not, and that is the gauge
of his virtue. Moral perfection is an unbreached rationality—not the degree of
your intelligence, but the full and relentless use of your mind, not the extent of
your knowledge, but the acceptance of reason as an absolute.

“Learn to distinguish the difference between errors of knowledge and
breaches of morality. An error of knowledge is not a moral flaw, provided you
are willing to correct it; only a mystic would judge human beings by the standard
of an impossible, automatic omniscience. But a breach of morality is the
conscious choice of an action you know to be evil, or a willful evasion of
knowledge, a suspension of sight and of thought. That which you do not know, is
not a moral charge against you; but that which you refuse to know, is an account
of infamy growing in your soul. Make every allowance for errors of knowledge;
do not forgive or accept any breach of morality. Give the benefit of the doubt to
those who seek to know; but treat as potential killers those specimens of insolent
depravity who make demands upon you, announcing that they have and seek no
reasons, proclaiming, as a license, that they ‘just feel it’—or those who reject an
irrefutable argument by saying: ‘It’s only logic,’ which means: ‘It’s only reality.’
The only realm opposed to reality is the realm and premise of death.
“Accept the fact that the achievement of your happiness is the only moral
purpose of your life, and that happiness—not pain or mindless self-indulgence—
is the proof of your moral integrity, since it is the proof and the result of your
loyalty to the achievement of your values. Happiness was the responsibility you
dreaded, it required the kind of rational discipline you did not value yourself
enough to assume—and the anxious staleness of your days is the monument to
your evasion of the knowledge that there is no moral substitute for happiness,
that there is no more despicable coward than the man who deserted the battle for
his joy, fearing to assert his right to existence, lacking the courage and the
loyalty to life of a bird or a flower reaching for the sun. Discard the protective
rags of that vice which you call a virtue: humility—learn to value yourself,
which means: to fight for your happiness—and when you learn that pride is the
sum of all virtues, you will learn to live like a man.

“As a basic step of self-esteem, learn to treat as the mark of a cannibal any
man’s demand for your help. To demand it is to claim that your life is his
property—and loathsome as such claim might be, there’s something still more
loathsome: your agreement. Do you ask if it’s ever proper to help another man?
No—if he claims it as his right or as a moral duty that you owe him. Yes—if
such is your own desire based on your own selfish pleasure in the value of his
person and his struggle. Suffering as such is not a value; only man’s fight against
suffering, is. If you choose to help a man who suffers, do it only on the ground
of his virtues, of his fight to recover, of his rational record, or of the fact that he
suffers unjustly; then your action is still a trade, and his virtue is the payment for
your help. But to help a man who has no virtues, to help him on the ground of
his suffering as such, to accept his faults, his need, as a claim—is to accept the
mortgage of a zero on your values. A man who has no virtues is a hater of
existence who acts on the premise of death; to help him is to sanction his evil
and to support his career of destruction. Be it only a penny you will not miss or a
kindly smile he has not earned, a tribute to a zero is treason to life and to all
those who struggle to maintain it. It is of such pennies and smiles that the
desolation of your world was made.

“Do not say that my morality is too hard for you to practice and that you fear
it as you fear the unknown. Whatever living moments you have known, were
lived by the values of my code. But you stifled, negated, betrayed it. You kept
sacrificing your virtues to your vices, and the best among men to the worst. Look
around you: what you have done to society, you had done it first within your
soul; one is the image of the other. This dismal wreckage, which is now your
world, is the physical form of the treason you committed to your values, to your
friends, to your defenders, to your future, to your country, to yourself.
“We—whom you are now calling, but who will not answer any longer—we
had lived among you, but you failed to know us, you refused to think and to see
what we were. You failed to recognize the motor I invented—and it became, in
your world, a pile of dead scrap. You failed to recognize the hero in your soul—
and you failed to know me when I passed you in the street. When you cried in
despair for the unattainable spirit which you felt had deserted your world, you
gave it my name, but what you were calling was your own betrayed self-esteem.
You will not recover one without the other.

“When you failed to give recognition to man’s mind and attempted to rule
human beings by force—those who submitted had no mind to surrender; those
who had, were men who don’t submit. Thus the man of productive genius
assumed in your world the disguise of a playboy and became a destroyer of
wealth, choosing to annihilate his fortune rather than surrender it to guns. Thus
the thinker, the man of reason, assumed in your world the role of a pirate, to
defend his values by force against your force, rather than submit to the rule of
brutality. Do you hear me, Francisco d’Anconia and Ragnar Danneskjöld, my
