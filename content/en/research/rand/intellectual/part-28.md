What is the good? Your only answer is ‘The good of others.’

The good is whatever others wish, whatever you feel they feel they wish, or whatever you feel they should feel.

‘The good of others’ is a magic formula that guarantees moral glory even the slaught

Your standard of virtue is not an object, not an act, not a principle, but an intention. 

You need no proof, no reasons, no success, you need not achieve in fact the good of others.

All you need to know is that your motive was the good of others, not your own. 

Your only definition of the good is a negation: the good is the ‘non-good for me.’

“Your code—which boasts that it upholds eternal, absolute, objective moral values and scorns the conditional, the relative and the subjective—your code hands out, as its version of the absolute, the following rule of moral conduct: 

If you wish it, it’s evil; if others wish it, it’s good; if the motive of your action is
your welfare, don’t do it; if the motive is the welfare of others, then anything
goes.

“As this double-jointed, double-standard morality splits you in half, so it splits
mankind into two enemy camps: one is you, the other is all the rest of humanity.
You are the only outcast who has no right to wish or live. You are the only
servant, the rest are the masters, you are the only giver, the rest are the takers,
you are the eternal debtor, the rest are the creditors never to be paid off. You
must not question their right to your sacrifice, or the nature of their wishes and
their needs: their right is conferred upon them by a negative, by the fact that they
are ‘non-you.’

“For those of you who might ask questions, your code provides a consolation
prize and booby-trap: it is for your own happiness, it says, that you must serve
the happiness of others, the only way to achieve your joy is to give it up to
others, the only way to achieve your prosperity is to surrender your wealth to
others, the only way to protect your life is to protect all men except yourself—
and if you find no joy in this procedure, it is your own fault and the proof of
your evil; if you were good, you would find your happiness in providing a
banquet for others, and your dignity in existing on such crumbs as they might
care to toss you.

“You who have no standard of self-esteem, accept the guilt and dare not ask
the questions. But you know the unadmitted answer, refusing to acknowledge
what you see, what hidden premise moves your world. You know it, not in
honest statement, but as a dark uneasiness within you, while you flounder
between guiltily cheating and grudgingly practicing a principle too vicious to
name.

“I, who do not accept the unearned, neither in values nor in guilt, am here to
ask the questions you evaded. Why is it moral to serve the happiness of others,
but not your own? If enjoyment is a value, why is it moral when experienced by
others, but immoral when experienced by you? If the sensation of eating a cake
is a value, why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for
you to achieve in the stomach of others? Why is it immoral for you to desire, but
moral for others to do so? Why is it immoral to produce a value and keep it, but
moral to give it away? And if it is not moral for you to keep a value, why is it
moral for others to accept it? If you are selfless and virtuous when you give it,
are they not selfish and vicious when they take it? Does virtue consist of serving
vice? Is the moral purpose of those who are good, self-immolation for the sake
of those who are evil?

“The answer you evade, the monstrous answer is: No, the takers are not evil,
provided they did not earn the value you gave them. It is not immoral for them
to accept it, provided they are unable to produce it, unable to deserve it, unable
to give you any value in return. It is not immoral for them to enjoy it, provided
they do not obtain it by right.

“Such is the secret core of your creed, the other half of your double standard:
it is immoral to live by your own effort, but moral to live by the effort of others
—it is immoral to consume your own product, but moral to consume the
products of others—it is immoral to earn, but moral to mooch—it is the parasites
who are the moral justification for the existence of the producers, but the
existence of the parasites is an end in itself—it is evil to profit by achievement,
but good to profit by sacrifice—it is evil to create your own happiness, but good
to enjoy it at the price of the blood of others.

“Your code divides mankind into two castes and commands them to live by
opposite rules: those who may desire anything and those who may desire
nothing, the chosen and the damned, the riders and the carriers, the eaters and
the eaten. What standard determines your caste? What passkey admits you to the
moral elite? The passkey is lack of value.

“Whatever the value involved, it is your lack of it that gives you a claim upon
those who don’t lack it. It is your need that gives you a claim to rewards. If you
are able to satisfy your need, your ability annuls your right to satisfy it. But a
need you are unable to satisfy gives you first right to the lives of mankind.
“If you succeed, any man who fails is your master; if you fail, any man who
succeeds is your serf. Whether your failure is just or not, whether your wishes
are rational or not, whether your misfortune is undeserved or the result of your
vices, it is misfortune that gives you a right to rewards. It is pain, regardless of
its nature or cause, pain as a primary absolute, that gives you a mortgage on all
of existence.

“If you heal your pain by your own effort, you receive no moral credit: your
code regards it scornfully as an act of self-interest. Whatever value you seek to
acquire, be it wealth or food or love or rights, if you acquire it by means of your
virtue, your code does not regard it as a moral acquisition: you occasion no loss
to anyone, it is a trade, not alms; a payment, not a sacrifice. The deserved
belongs in the selfish, commercial realm of mutual profit; it is only the
undeserved that calls for that moral transaction which consists of profit to one at
the price of disaster to the other. To demand rewards for your virtue is selfish
and immoral; it is your lack of virtue that transforms your demand into a moral
right.

“A morality that holds need as a claim, holds emptiness—non-existence—as
its standard of value; it rewards an absence, a defect: weakness, inability,
incompetence, suffering, disease, disaster, the lack, the fault, the flaw—the zero.
“Who provides the account to pay these claims? Those who are cursed for
being non-zeros, each to the extent of his distance from that ideal. Since all
values are the product of virtues, the degree of your virtue is used as the measure
of your penalty; the degree of your faults is used as the measure of your gain.
Your code declares that the rational man must sacrifice himself to the irrational,
the independent man to parasites, the honest man to the dishonest, the man of
justice to the unjust, the productive man to thieving loafers, the man of integrity
to compromising knaves, the man of self-esteem to sniveling neurotics. Do you
wonder at the meanness of soul in those you see around you? The man who
achieves these virtues will not accept your moral code; the man who accepts
your moral code will not achieve these virtues.

“Under a morality of sacrifice, the first value you sacrifice is morality; the
next is self-esteem. When need is the standard, every man is both victim and
parasite. As a victim, he must labor to fill the needs of others, leaving himself in
the position of a parasite whose needs must be filled by others. He cannot
approach his fellow men except in one of two disgraceful roles: he is both a
beggar and a sucker.

“You fear the man who has a dollar less than you, that dollar is rightfully his,
he makes you feel like a moral defrauder. You hate the man who has a dollar
more than you, that dollar is rightfully yours, he makes you feel that you are
morally defrauded. The man below is a source of your guilt, the man above is a
source of your frustration. You do not know what to surrender or demand, when
to give and when to grab, what pleasure in life is rightfully yours and what debt
is still unpaid to others—you struggle to evade, as ‘theory,’ the knowledge that
by the moral standard you’ve accepted you are guilty every moment of your life,
there is no mouthful of food you swallow that is not needed by someone
somewhere on earth—and you give up the problem in blind resentment, you
conclude that moral perfection is not to be achieved or desired, that you will
muddle through by snatching as snatch can and by avoiding the eyes of the
young, of those who look at you as if self-esteem were possible and they
expected you to have it. Guilt is all that you retain within your soul—and so does
every other man, as he goes past, avoiding your eyes. Do you wonder why your
morality has not achieved brotherhood on earth or the good will of man to man?
“The justification of sacrifice, that your morality pro-pounds, is more corrupt
than the corruption it purports to justify. The motive of your sacrifice, it tells
you, should be love—the love you ought to feel for every man. A morality that
professes the belief that the values of the spirit are more precious than matter, a
morality that teaches you to scorn a whore who gives her body indiscriminately
to all men—this same morality demands that you surrender your soul to
promiscuous love for all comers.

“As there can be no causeless wealth, so there can be no causeless love or any
sort of causeless emotion. An emotion is a response to a fact of reality, an
estimate dictated by your standards. To love is to value. The man who tells you
that it is possible to value without values, to love those whom you appraise as
worthless, is the man who tells you that it is possible to grow rich by consuming
without producing and that paper money is as valuable as gold.
“Observe that he does not expect you to feel a causeless fear. When his kind
get into power, they are expert at contriving means of terror, at giving you ample
cause to feel the fear by which they desire to rule you. But when it comes to
love, the highest of emotions, you permit them to shriek at you accusingly that
you are a moral delinquent if you’re incapable of feeling causeless love. When a
man feels fear without reason, you call him to the attention of a psychiatrist; you
are not so careful to protect the meaning, the nature and the dignity of love.
“Love is the expression of one’s values, the greatest reward you can earn for
the moral qualities you have achieved in your character and person, the
emotional price paid by one man for the joy he receives from the virtues of
another. Your morality demands that you divorce your love from values and
hand it down to any vagrant, not as response to his worth, but as response to his
need, not as reward, but as alms, not as a payment for virtues, but as a blank
check on vices. Your morality tells you that the purpose of love is to set you free
of the bonds of morality, that love is superior to moral judgment, that true love
transcends, forgives and survives every manner of evil in its object, and the
greater the love the greater the depravity it permits to the loved. To love a man
for his virtues is paltry and human, it tells you; to love him for his flaws is
divine. To love those who are worthy of it is self-interest; to love the unworthy is
sacrifice. You owe your love to those who don’t deserve it, and the less they
deserve it, the more love you owe them—the more loathsome the object, the
nobler your love—the more unfastidious your love, the greater your virtue—and
if you can bring your soul to the state of a dump heap that welcomes anything on
equal terms, if you can cease to value moral values, you have achieved the state
of moral perfection.

“Such is your morality of sacrifice and such are the twin ideals it offers: to
refashion the life of your body in the image of a human stockyard, and the life of
your spirit in the image of a dump.
“Such was your goal—and you’ve reached it. Why do you now moan
complaints about man’s impotence and the futility of human aspirations?
Because you were unable to prosper by seeking destruction? Because you were
unable to find joy by worshipping pain? Because you were unable to live by
holding death as your standard of value?
“The degree of your ability to live was the degree to which you broke your
moral code, yet you believe that those who preach it are friends of humanity, you
damn yourself and dare not question their motives or their goals. Take a look at
them now, when you face your last choice—and if you choose to perish, do so
with full knowledge of how cheaply how small an enemy has claimed your life.
“The mystics of both schools, who preach the creed of sacrifice, are germs
that attack you through a single sore: your fear of relying on your mind. They
tell you that they possess a means of knowledge higher than the mind, a mode of
consciousness superior to reason—like a special pull with some bureaucrat of
the universe who gives them secret tips withheld from others. The mystics of
spirit declare that they possess an extra sense you lack: this special sixth sense
consists of contradicting the whole of the knowledge of your five. The mystics
of muscle do not bother to assert any claim to extrasensory perception: they
merely declare that your senses are not valid, and that their wisdom consists of
perceiving your blindness by some manner of unspecified means. Both kinds
demand that you invalidate your own consciousness and surrender yourself into
their power. They offer you, as proof of their superior knowledge, the fact that
they assert the opposite of everything you know, and as proof of their superior
ability to deal with existence, the fact that they lead you to misery, self-sacrifice,
starvation, destruction.

“They claim that they perceive a mode of being superior to your existence on
this earth. The mystics of spirit call it ‘another dimension,’ which consists of
denying dimensions. The mystics of muscle call it ‘the future,’ which consists of
denying the present. To exist is to possess identity. What identity are they able to
give to their superior realm? They keep telling you what it is not, but never tell
you what it is. All their identifications consist of negating: God is that which no
human mind can know, they say—and proceed to demand that you consider it
knowledge—God is non-man, heaven is non-earth, soul is non-body, virtue is
non-profit, A is non-A, perception is non-sensory, knowledge is non-reason.

Their definitions are not acts of defining, but of wiping out.

“It is only the metaphysics of a leech that would cling to the idea of a universe
where a zero is a standard of identification. A leech would want to seek escape
from the necessity to name its own nature—escape from the necessity to know
that the substance on which it builds its private universe is blood.
“What is the nature of that superior world to which they sacrifice the world
that exists? The mystics of spirit curse matter, the mystics of muscle curse profit.
The first wish men to profit by renouncing the earth, the second wish men to
inherit the earth by renouncing all profit. Their non-material, non-profit worlds
are realms where rivers run with milk and coffee, where wine spurts from rocks
at their command, where pastry drops on them from clouds at the price of
opening their mouth. On this material, profit-chasing earth, an enormous
investment of virtue—of intelligence, integrity, energy, skill—is required to
construct a railroad to carry them the distance of one mile; in their non-material,
non-profit world, they travel from planet to planet at the cost of a wish.

If an honest person asks them: ‘How?’—they answer with righteous scorn that a
‘how’ is the concept of vulgar realists; the concept of superior spirits is
‘Somehow.’ On this earth restricted by matter and profit, rewards are achieved
by thought; in a world set free of such restrictions rewards are achieved by
wishing.
