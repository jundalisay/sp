This novel was published in 1943. Its theme is: individualism versus
collectivism, not in politics, but in man’s soul; the psychological motivations and
the basic premises that produce the character of an individualist or a collectivist.
The story presents the career of Howard Roark, an architect and innovator, who
breaks with tradition, recognizes no authority but that of his own independent
judgment, struggles for the integrity of his creative work against every form of
social opposition—and wins.


## The Nature Of The Second-Hander

This excerpt is from a conversation between Roark and his friend Gail Wynand,
in which Roark explains what he has discovered about the psychology of those
whose basic motivation is the opposite of his own.

“It’s what I couldn’t understand about people for a long time. They have no
self. They live within others. They live second-hand. Look at Peter Keating. . . .
I’ve looked at him—at what’s left of him—and it’s helped me to understand.
He’s paying the price and wondering for what sin and telling himself that he’s
been too selfish. In what act or thought of his has there ever been a self? What
was his aim in life? Greatness—in other people’s eyes. Fame, admiration, envy
—all that which comes from others. Others dictated his convictions, which he
did not hold, but he was satisfied that others believed he held them. Others were
his motive power and his prime concern. He didn’t want to be great, but to be
thought great. He didn’t want to build, but to be admired as a builder. He
borrowed from others in order to make an impression on others. There’s your
actual selflessness. It’s his ego that he’s betrayed and given up. But everybody
calls him selfish. . . .

“Isn’t that the root of every despicable action? Not selfishness, but precisely
the absence of a self. Look at them. The man who cheats and lies, but preserves
a respectable front. He knows himself to be dishonest, but others think he’s
honest and he derives his self-respect from that, second-hand. The man who
takes credit for an achievement which is not his own. He knows himself to be
mediocre, but he’s great in the eyes of others. The frustrated wretch who
professes love for the inferior and clings to those less endowed, in order to
establish his own superiority by comparison. . . . They’re second-handers. . . .
“They have no concern for facts, ideas, work. They’re concerned only with
people. They don’t ask: ‘Is this true?’ They ask: ‘Is this what others think is
true?’ Not to judge, but to repeat. Not to do, but to give the impression of doing.

Not creation, but show. Not ability, but friendship. Not merit, but pull. What
would happen to the world without those who do, think, work, produce? Those
are the egoists. You don’t think through another’s brain and you don’t work
through another’s hands. When you suspend your faculty of independent
judgment, you suspend consciousness. To stop consciousness is to stop life.
Second-handers have no sense of reality. Their reality is not within them, but
somewhere in that space which divides one human body from another. Not an
entity, but a relation—anchored to nothing. That’s the emptiness I couldn’t
understand in people. That’s what stopped me whenever I faced a committee.

Men without an ego. Opinion without a rational process. Motion without brakes
or motor. Power without responsibility. The second-hander acts, but the source
of his actions is scattered in every other living person. It’s everywhere and
nowhere and you can’t reason with him. He’s not open to reason. You can’t
speak to him—he can’t hear. You’re tried by an empty bench. A blind mass
running amuck, to crush you without sense or purpose. . . .”

“Notice how they’ll accept anything except a man who stands alone. They
recognize him at once. . . . There’s a special, insidious kind of hatred for him.
They forgive criminals. They admire dictators. Crime and violence are a tie. A
form of mutual dependence. They need ties. They’ve got to force their miserable
little personalities on every single person they meet. The independent man kills
them—because they don’t exist within him and that’s the only form of existence
they know. Notice the malignant kind of resentment against any idea that propounds independence. Notice the malice toward an independent man. . . .”

“After centuries of being pounded with the doctrine that altruism is the
ultimate ideal, men have accepted it in the only way it could be accepted. By
seeking self-esteem through others. By living second-hand. And it has opened
the way for every kind of horror. It has become the dreadful form of selfishness
which a truly selfish man couldn’t have conceived. And now, to cure a world
perishing from selflessness, we’re asked to destroy the self. Listen to what is
being preached today. Look at everyone around us. You’ve wondered why they
suffer, why they seek happiness and never find it. If any man stopped and asked
himself whether he’s ever held a truly personal desire, he’d find the answer.
He’d see that all his wishes, his efforts, his dreams, his ambitions are motivated
by other men. He’s not really struggling even for material wealth, but for the
second-hander’s delusion—prestige. A stamp of approval, not his own. He can
find no joy in the struggle and no joy when he has succeeded. He can’t say about
a single thing: ‘This is what I wanted because I wanted it not because it made my
neighbors gape at me.’ Then he wonders why he’s unhappy. Every form of
happiness is private. Our greatest moments are personal, self-motivated, not to
be touched. 

The things which are sacred or precious to us are the things we
withdraw from promiscuous sharing. But now we are taught to throw everything
within us into public light and common pawing. To seek joy in meeting halls. We
haven’t even got a word for the quality I mean—for the self-sufficiency of man’s
spirit. It’s difficult to call it selfishness or egoism, the words have been
perverted, they’ve come to mean Peter Keating. Gail, I think the only cardinal
evil on earth is that of placing your prime concern within other men. I’ve always
demanded a certain quality in the people I liked. I’ve always recognized it at
once—and it’s the only quality I respect in men. I chose my friends by that. Now
I know what it is. A self-sufficient ego. Nothing else matters.”


## The Soul Of A Collectivist

This excerpt is the confession of Roark’s antipode and archenemy, Ellsworth M.
Toohey, an architectural critic and sociologist, who spends his life plotting the
future establishment of a collectivist society. He is addressing one of his own
victims.

“I’ve always said just that. Clearly, precisely and openly. It’s not my fault if
you couldn’t hear. You could, of course. You didn’t want to. Which was safer
than deafness—for me. I said I intended to rule. Like all my spiritual
predecessors. But I’m luckier than they were. I inherited the fruit of their efforts
and I shall be the one who’ll see the great dream made real. I see it all around me
today. I recognize it. I don’t like it. I didn’t expect to like it. Enjoyment is not my
destiny. I shall find such satisfaction as my capacity permits. I shall rule. . . .

“It’s only a matter of discovering the lever. If you learn how to rule one single
man’s soul, you can get the rest of mankind. It’s the soul, Peter, the soul. Not
whips or swords or fire or guns. 

That’s why the Caesars, the Attilas, the
Napoleons were fools and did not last. We will. The soul, Peter, is that which
can’t be ruled. It must be broken. Drive a wedge in, get your fingers on it—and
the man is yours. You won’t need a whip—he’ll bring it to you and ask to be
whipped. Set him in reverse—and his own mechanism will do your work for
you. Use him against himself. Want to know how it’s done? See if I ever lied to
you. See if you haven’t heard all this for years, but didn’t want to hear, and the
fault is yours, not mine. There are many ways. Here’s one. Make man feel small.
Make him feel guilty. Kill his aspiration and his integrity. That’s difficult. 

The worst among you gropes for an ideal in his own twisted way. Kill integrity by
internal corruption. Use it against itself. Direct it toward a goal destructive of all
integrity. Preach selflessness. Tell man that he must live for others. Tell men that
altruism is the ideal. Not a single one of them has ever achieved it and not a
single one ever will. His every living instinct screams against it. But don’t you
see what you accomplish? Man realizes that he’s incapable of what he’s accepted
as the noblest virtue—and it gives him a sense of guilt, of sin, of his own basic
unworthiness. Since the supreme ideal is beyond his grasp he gives up
eventually all ideals, all aspiration, all sense of his personal value. He feels
himself obliged to preach what he can’t practice. But one can’t be good halfway
or honest approximately.
