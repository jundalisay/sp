The Founding Fathers were neither passive, death-worshipping mystics nor
mindless, power-seeking looters; as a political group, they were a phenomenon
unprecedented in history: they were thinkers who were also men of action. They
had rejected the soul-body dichotomy, with its two corollaries: the impotence of
man’s mind and the damnation of this earth; they had rejected the doctrine of
suffering as man’s metaphysical fate, they proclaimed man’s right to the pursuit
of happiness and were determined to establish on earth the conditions required
for man’s proper existence, by the “unaided” power of their intellect.
A society based on and geared to the conceptual level of man’s consciousness,
a society dominated by a philosophy of reason, has no place for the rule of fear
and guilt. Reason requires freedom, self-confidence and self-esteem. It requires
the right to think and to act on the guidance of one’s thinking—the right to live
by one’s own independent judgment. Intellectual freedom cannot exist without
political freedom; political freedom cannot exist without economic freedom; a
free mind and a free market are corollaries.

The unprecedented social system whose fundamentals were established by the
Founding Fathers, the system which set the terms, the example and the pattern
for the nineteenth century—spreading to all the countries of the civilized world
—was capitalism.

To be exact, it was not a full, perfect, totally unregulated laissez-faire
capitalism. Various degrees of government interference and control still
remained, even in America, as deadly cracks in the system’s foundations. But
during the nineteenth century, the world came close to economic freedom, for
the first and only time in history. The degree of any given country’s economic
freedom was the exact degree of its progress. America, the freest, achieved the
most.

Capitalism wiped out slavery in matter and in spirit. It replaced Attila and the
Witch Doctor, the looter of wealth and the purveyor of revelations, with two new
types of man: the producer of wealth and the purveyor of knowledge—the
businessman and the intellectual.

Capitalism demands the best of every man—his rationality—and rewards him
accordingly. It leaves every man free to choose the work he likes, to specialize in
it, to trade his product for the products of others, and to go as far on the road of
achievement as his ability and ambition will carry him. His success depends on
the objective value of his work and on the rationality of those who recognize that
value. When men are free to trade, with reason and reality as their only arbiter,
when no man may use physical force to extort the consent of another, it is the
best product and the best judgment that win in every field of human endeavor,
and raise the standard of living—and of thought—ever higher for all those who
take part in mankind’s productive activity.

In this complex pattern of human co-operation, two key figures act as the
twin-motors of progress, the integrators of the entire system, the transmission
belts that carry the achievements of the best minds to every level of society: the
intellectual and the businessman.

The professional intellectual is the field agent of the army whose commanderin-chief is the philosopher. The intellectual carries the application of philosophical principles to every field of human endeavor. He sets a society’s
course by transmitting ideas from the “ivory tower” of the philosopher to the
university professor—to the writer—to the artist—to the newspaperman—to the
politician—to the movie maker—to the night-club singer—to the man in the
street. The intellectual’s specific professions are in the field of the sciences that
study man, the so-called “humanities,” but for that very reason his influence
extends to all other professions. Those who deal with the sciences studying
nature have to rely on the intellectual for philosophical guidance and
information: for moral values, for social theories, for political premises, for
psychological tenets and, above all, for the principles of epistemology, that
crucial branch of philosophy which studies man’s means of knowledge and
makes all other sciences possible. The intellectual is the eyes, ears and voice of a
free society: it is his job to observe the events of the world, to evaluate their
meaning and to inform the men in all the other fields. A free society has to be an
informed society. In the stagnation of feudalism, with castes and guilds of serfs
repeating the same motions generation after generation, the services of traveling
minstrels chanting the same old legends were sufficient. But in the racing torrent
of progress which is capitalism, where the free choices of individual men
determine their own lives and the course of the entire economy, where
opportunities are unlimited, where discoveries are constant, where the
achievements of every profession affect all the others, men need a knowledge
wider than their particular specialties, they need those who can point the way to
the better mousetrap—or the better cyclotron, or the better symphony, or the
better view of existence. The more specialized and diversified a society, the
greater its need for the integrating power of knowledge; but the acquisition of
knowledge on so wide a scale is a full-time profession. A free society has to
count on the honor of its intellectuals: it has to expect them to be as efficient,
reliable, precise and objective as the printing presses and the television sets that
carry their voices.

The professional businessman is the field agent of the army whose lieutenantcommander-in-chief is the scientist. The businessman carries scientific discoveries from the laboratory of the inventor to industrial plants, and
transforms them into material products that fill men’s physical needs and expand
the comfort of men’s existence. By creating a mass market, he makes these
products available to every income level of society. By using machines, he
increases the productivity of human labor, thus raising labor’s economic
rewards. By organizing human effort into productive enterprises, he creates
employment for men of countless professions. He is the great liberator who, in
the short span of a century and a half, has released men from bondage to their
physical needs, has released them from the terrible drudgery of an eighteen-hour
workday of manual labor for their barest subsistence, has released them from
famines, from pestilences, from the stagnant hopelessness and terror in which
most of mankind had lived in all the pre-capitalist centuries—and in which most
of it still lives, in non-capitalist countries.

It is on this fundamental division of labor and of responsibility that the
intellectual has defaulted. His twin brother, the businessman, has done a
superlative job and has brought men to an unprecedented material prosperity.
But the intellectual has sold him out, has betrayed their common source, has
failed in his own job and has brought men to spiritual bankruptcy. The
businessman has raised men’s standard of living—but the intellectual has
dropped men’s standard of thought to the level of an impotent savage.
It has often been noted that mankind has achieved an enormous material
progress, but has remained on the level of the primitive brute in spirit. (The
solution usually offered is to abandon material progress.) The cause of the
discrepancy is ignored or evaded. The cause is to be found at that crossroads of
the post-Renaissance period where man’s physical existence and his philosophy
broke apart and went in different directions.

Just as a man’s actions are preceded and determined by some form of idea in
his mind, so a society’s existential conditions are preceded and determined by
the ascendancy of a certain philosophy among those whose job is to deal with
ideas. The events of any given period of history are the result of the thinking of
the preceding period. The nineteenth century—with its political freedom,
science, industry, business, trade, all the necessary conditions of material
progress—was the result and the last achievement of the intellectual power
released by the Renaissance. The men engaged in those activities were still
riding on the remnants of an Aristotelian influence in philosophy, particularly on
an Aristotelian epistemology (more implicitly than explicitly). But they were
like men living on the energy of the light rays of a distant star, who did not know
(it was not their primary task to know) that that star had been extinguished.
It had been extinguished by those whose primary task was to sustain it.
From the start of the post-Renaissance period, philosophy—released from its
bondage as handmaiden of theology—went seeking a new form of servitude, like
a frightened slave, broken in spirit, who recoils from the responsibility of
freedom. Descartes set the direction of the retreat by bringing the Witch Doctor
back into philosophy. While promising a philosophical system as rational,
demonstrable and scientific as mathematics, Descartes began with the basic
epistemological premise of every Witch Doctor (a premise he shared explicitly
with Augustine): “the prior certainty of consciousness,” the belief that the
existence of an external world is not self-evident, but must be proved by
deduction from the contents of one’s consciousness—which means: the concept
of consciousness as some faculty other than the faculty of perception—which
means: the indiscriminate contents of one’s consciousness as the irreducible
primary and absolute, to which reality has to conform. What followed was the
grotesquely tragic spectacle of philosophers struggling to prove the existence of
an external world by staring, with the Witch Doctor’s blind, inward stare, at the
random twists of their conceptions—then of perceptions—then of sensations.
When the medieval Witch Doctor had merely ordered men to doubt the
validity of their mind, the philosophers’ rebellion against him consisted of
proclaiming that they doubted whether man was conscious at all and whether
anything existed for him to be conscious of.

It is at this point that Attila entered the philosophical scene.
Attila—the type of man who longs to live on the perceptual level of
consciousness, without the “interference” of any concepts, to act on the whim
and range of the moment, without the “hampering restriction” of principles or
theories, without the necessity of integrating one experience with another or one
moment with the next—saw his chance to escape from his subservience to the
Witch Doctor, which he had always resented (to muscle in on the racket, one
would have to say), and to obtain from science the sanction of his actions and of
his psycho-epistemology. Attila, who hated and feared intellectual issues, saw
his chance to take over the intellect and found his voice.
