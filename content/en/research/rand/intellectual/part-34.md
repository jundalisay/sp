Their only purpose throughout the ages has been to:
- undercut your consciousness
- rule you by force

The rites of the jungle witch doctors:
- distorted reality into grotesque absurdities
- stunted the minds of their victims and kept them in terror of the supernatural

The supernatural doctrines of the Middle Ages kept men huddling on the mud floors of their hovels, in terror that the devil might steal the soup they had worked eighteen hours to earn—to the seedy little smiling professor who assures you
that your brain has no capacity to think, that you have no means of perception
and must blindly obey the omnipotent will of that supernatural force: 

Society—
all of it is the same performance for the same and only purpose: to reduce you to
the kind of pulp that has surrendered the validity of its consciousness.
“But it cannot be done to you without your consent. If you permit it to be
done, you deserve it.

“When you listen to a mystic’s harangue on the impotence of the human mind
and begin to doubt your consciousness, not his, when you permit your
precariously semi-rational state to be shaken by any assertion and decide it is
safer to trust his superior certainty and knowledge, the joke is on both of you:
your sanction is the only source of certainty he has. The supernatural power that
a mystic dreads, the unknowable spirit he worships, the consciousness he
considers omnipotent is—yours.

“A mystic is a man who surrendered his mind at its first encounter with the
minds of others. Somewhere in the distant reaches of his childhood, when his
own understanding of reality clashed with the assertions of others, with their
arbitrary orders and contradictory demands, he gave in to so craven a fear of
independence that he renounced his rational faculty. At the crossroads of the
choice between ‘I know’ and ‘They say,’ he chose the authority of others, he
chose to submit rather than to understand, to believe rather than to think. Faith in
the supernatural begins as faith in the superiority of others. His surrender took
the form of the feeling that he must hide his lack of understanding, that others
possess some mysterious knowledge of which he alone is deprived, that reality is
whatever they want it to be, through some means forever denied to him.
“From then on, afraid to think, he is left at the mercy of unidentified feelings.
His feelings become his only guide, his only remnant of personal identity, he
clings to them with ferocious possessiveness—and whatever thinking he does is
devoted to the struggle of hiding from himself that the nature of his feelings is
terror.

“When a mystic declares that he feels the existence of a power superior to
reason, he feels it all right, but that power is not an omniscient super-spirit of the
universe, it is the consciousness of any passer-by to whom he has surrendered
his own. A mystic is driven by the urge to impress, to cheat, to flatter, to deceive,
to force that omnipotent consciousness of others. ‘They’ are his only key to
reality, he feels that he cannot exist save by harnessing their mysterious power
and extorting their unaccountable consent. ‘They’ are his only means of
perception and, like a blind man who depends on the sight of a dog, he feels he
must leash them in order to live. To control the consciousness of others becomes
his only passion; power-lust is a weed that grows only in the vacant lots of an
abandoned mind.

“Every dictator is a mystic, and every mystic is a potential dictator. A mystic
craves obedience from men, not their agreement. He wants them to surrender
their consciousness to his assertions, his edicts, his wishes, his whims—as his
consciousness is surrendered to theirs. He wants to deal with men by means of
faith and force—he finds no satisfaction in their consent if he must earn it by
means of facts and reason. Reason is the enemy he dreads and, simultaneously,
considers precarious; reason, to him, is a means of deception; he feels that men
possess some power more potent than reason—and only their causeless belief or
their forced obedience can give him a sense of security, a proof that he has
gained control of the mystic endowment he lacked. His lust is to command, not
to convince: conviction requires an act of independence and rests on the absolute
of an objective reality. What he seeks is power over reality and over men’s
means of perceiving it, their mind, the power to interpose his will between
existence and consciousness, as if, by agreeing to fake the reality he orders them
to fake, men would, in fact, create it.
“Just as the mystic is a parasite in matter, who expropriates the wealth created
by others—just as he is a parasite in spirit, who plunders the ideas created by
others—so he falls below the level of a lunatic who creates his own distortion of
reality, to the level of a parasite of lunacy who seeks a distortion created by
others.

“There is only one state that fulfills the mystic’s longing for infinity, noncausality, non-identity: death. No matter what unintelligible causes he ascribes to
his incommunicable feelings, whoever rejects reality rejects existence—and the
feelings that move him from then on are hatred for all the values of man’s life,
and lust for all the evils that destroy it. A mystic relishes the spectacle of
suffering, of poverty, subservience and terror; these give him a feeling of
triumph, a proof of the defeat of rational reality. But no other reality exists.
“No matter whose welfare he professes to serve, be it the welfare of God or of
that disembodied gargoyle he describes as ‘The People,’ no matter what ideal he
proclaims in terms of some supernatural dimension—in fact, in reality, on earth,
his ideal is death, his craving is to kill, his only satisfaction is to torture.
“Destruction is the only end that the mystics’ creed has ever achieved as it is
the only end that you see them achieving today, and if the ravages wrought by
their acts have not made them question their doctrines, if they profess to be
moved by love, yet are not deterred by piles of human corpses, it is because the
truth about their souls is worse than the obscene excuse you have allowed them,
the excuse that the end justifies the means and that the horrors they practice are
means to nobler ends. The truth is that those horrors are their ends.

“You who’re depraved enough to believe that you could adjust yourself to a
mystic’s dictatorship and could please him by obeying his orders—there is no
way to please him; when you obey, he will reverse his orders; he seeks
obedience for the sake of obedience and destruction for the sake of destruction.
You who are craven enough to believe that you can make terms with a mystic by
giving in to his extortions—there is no way to buy him off, the bribe he wants is
your life, as slowly or as fast as you are willing to give it in—and the monster he
seeks to bribe is the hidden blank-out in his mind, which drives him to kill in
order not to learn that the death he desires is his own.
“You who are innocent enough to believe that the forces let loose in your
world today are moved by greed for material plunder—the mystics’scramble for
spoils is only a screen to conceal from their mind the nature of their motive.
Wealth is a means of human life, and they clamor for wealth in imitation of
living beings, to pretend to themselves that they desire to live. But their swinish
indulgence in plundered luxury is not enjoyment, it is escape. They do not want
to own your fortune, they want you to lose it; they do not want to succeed, they
want you to fail; they do not want to live, they want you to die; they desire
nothing, they hate existence, and they keep running, each trying not to learn that
the object of his hatred is himself.

“You who’ve never grasped the nature of evil, you who describe them as
‘misguided idealists’—may the God you invented forgive you!—they are the
essence of evil, they, those anti-living objects who seek, by devouring the world,
to fill the selfless zero of their soul. It is not your wealth that they’re after. Theirs
is a conspiracy against the mind, which means: against life and man.
“It is a conspiracy without leader or direction, and the random little thugs of
the moment who cash in on the agony of one land or another are chance scum
riding the torrent from the broken dam of the sewer of centuries, from the
reservoir of hatred for reason, for logic, for ability, for achievement, for joy,
stored by every whining anti-human who ever preached the superiority of the
‘heart’ over the mind.
“It is a conspiracy of all those who seek, not to live, but to get away with
living, those who seek to cut just one small corner of reality and are drawn, by
feeling, to all the others who are busy cutting other corners—a conspiracy that
unites by links of evasion all those who pursue a zero as a value: the professor
who, unable to think, takes pleasure in crippling the mind of his students, the
businessman who, to protect his stagnation, takes pleasure in chaining the ability
of competitors, the neurotic who, to defend his self-loathing, takes pleasure in
breaking men of self-esteem, the incompetent who takes pleasure in defeating
achievement, the mediocrity who takes pleasure in demolishing greatness, the
eunuch who takes pleasure in the castration of all pleasure—and all their
intellectual munition-makers, all those who preach that the immolation of virtue
will transform vices into virtue. Death is the premise at the root of their theories,
death is the goal of their actions in practice—and you are the last of their
victims.

“We, who were the living buffers between you and the nature of your creed,
are no longer there to save you from the effects of your chosen beliefs. We are
no longer willing to pay with our lives the debts you incurred in yours or the
moral deficit piled up by all the generations behind you. You had been living on
borrowed time—and I am the man who has called in the loan.
“I am the man whose existence your blank-outs were intended to permit you
to ignore. I am the man whom you did not want either to live or to die. You did
not want me to live, because you were afraid of knowing that I carried the
responsibility you dropped and that your lives depended upon me; you did not
want me to die, because you knew it.

“Twelve years ago, when I worked in your world, I was an inventor. I was one
of a profession that came last in human history and will be first to vanish on the
way back to the subhuman. An inventor is a man who asks ‘Why?’ of the
universe and lets nothing stand between the answer and his mind.
“Like the man who discovered the use of steam or the man who discovered
the use of oil, I discovered a source of energy which was available since the birth
of the globe, but which men had not known how to use except as an object of
worship, of terror and of legends about a thundering god. I completed the
experimental model of a motor that would have made a fortune for me and for
those who had hired me, a motor that would have raised the efficiency of every
human installation using power and would have added the gift of higher
productivity to every hour you spend at earning your living.
“Then, one night at a factory meeting, I heard myself sentenced to death by
reason of my achievement. I heard three parasites assert that my brain and my
life were their property, that my right to exist was conditional and depended on
the satisfaction of their desires. The purpose of my ability, they said, was to
serve the needs of those who were less able. I had no right to live, they said, by
reason of my competence for living; their right to live was unconditional, by
reason of their incompetence.

“Then I saw what was wrong with the world, I saw what destroyed men and
nations, and where the battle for life had to be fought. I saw that the enemy was
an inverted morality—and that my sanction was its only power. I saw that evil
was impotent—that evil was the irrational, the blind, the anti-real—and that the
only weapon of its triumph was the willingness of the good to serve it. Just as
the parasites around me were proclaiming their helpless dependence on my mind
and were expecting me voluntarily to accept a slavery they had no power to
enforce, just as they were counting on my self-immolation to provide them with
the means of their plan—so throughout the world and throughout men’s history,
in every version and form, from the extortions of loafing relatives to the
atrocities of collectivized countries, it is the good, the able, the men of reason,
who act as their own destroyers, who transfuse to evil the blood of their virtue
and let evil transmit to them the poison of destruction, thus gaining for evil the
power of survival, and for their own values—the impotence of death. I saw that
there comes a point, in the defeat of any man of virtue, when his own consent is
needed for evil to win—and that no manner of injury done to him by others can
succeed if he chooses to withhold his consent. I saw that I could put an end to
your outrages by pronouncing a single word in my mind. I pronounced it. The
word was ‘No.’

I quit that factory. I quit your world. 

I made it my job to warn your victims and to give them the method and the weapon to fight you. The method was to
refuse to deflect retribution. The weapon was justice.

If you want to know what you lost when I quit and when my strikers deserted your world—stand on an empty stretch of soil in a wilderness unexplored by
men and ask yourself what manner of survival you would achieve and how long
you would last if you refused to think, with no one around to teach you the
motions, or, if you chose to think, how much your mind would be able to
discover—ask yourself how many independent conclusions you have reached in
the course of your life and how much of your time was spent on performing the
actions you learned from others—ask yourself whether you would be able to
discover how to till the soil and grow your food, whether you would be able to
invent a wheel, a lever, an induction coil, a generator, an electronic tube—then
decide whether men of ability are exploiters who live by the fruit of your labor
and rob you of the wealth that you produce, and whether you dare to believe that
you possess the power to enslave them. Let your women take a look at a jungle
female with her shriveled face and pendulous breasts, as she sits grinding meal
in a bowl, hour after hour, century by century—then let them ask themselves
whether their ‘instinct of tool-making’ will provide them with their electric
refrigerators, their washing machines and vacuum cleaners, and, if not, whether
they care to destroy those who provided it all, but not ‘by instinct.’

You are savages who stutter that ideas are created by men’s means of production, that a machine is not the product of human thought, but a mystical power that produces human thinking. 

You have never discovered the industrial age—and you cling to the morality of the barbarian eras when a
miserable form of human subsistence was produced by the muscular labor of
slaves. 

Every mystic had always longed for slaves, to protect him from the material reality he dreaded. 

But you, you grotesque little atavists, stare blindly at the skyscrapers and smokestacks around you and dream of enslaving the material providers who are scientists, inventors, industrialists. When you clamor
for public ownership of the means of production, you are clamoring for public
ownership of the mind. I have taught my strikers that the answer you deserve is
only: ‘Try and get it.’


You proclaim:
- unable to harness the forces of inanimate matter, yet propose to harness the minds of men who are able to achieve the feats you cannot equal.
- unable to survive without us, yet propose to dictate the terms of our survival
- that you need us, yet indulge the impertinence of asserting your right to rule us by force

You expect that we, who are not afraid of that physical nature which fills you with terror, will cower at the sight of any lout who has talked you into voting him a chance to command us.

You propose to establish a social order based on the following tenets:

1. You’re incompetent to run your own life, but competent to run the lives of others

2. You’re unfit to exist in freedom, but fit to become an omnipotent ruler—

3. You’re unable to earn your living by using your own intelligence, but able to judge politicians and to vote men into jobs of total power over:
- arts you have never seen
- sciences you have never studied
- achievements of which you have no knowledge
- the gigantic industries where you, by your own definition of your capacity, would be unable successfully to fill the job of
assistant greaser
