“It was the three of us who started what I am now completing. It was the three
of us who resolved to avenge this country and to release its imprisoned soul.
This greatest of countries was built on my morality—on the inviolate supremacy
of man’s right to exist—but you dreaded to admit it and live up to it. You stared
at an achievement unequaled in history, you looted its effects and blanked out its
cause. In the presence of that monument to human morality, which is a factory, a
highway or a bridge—you kept damning this country as immoral and its progress
as ‘material greed,’ you kept offering apologies for this country’s greatness to the
idol of primordial starvation, to decaying Europe’s idol of a leprous, mystic bum.
“This country—the product of reason—could not survive on the morality of
sacrifice. It was not built by men who sought self-immolation or by men who
sought hand-outs. It could not stand on the mystic split that divorced man’s soul
from his body. It could not live by the mystic doctrine that damned this earth as
evil and those who succeeded on earth as depraved. From its start, this country
was a threat to the ancient rule of mystics. In the brilliant rocket-explosion of its
youth, this country displayed to an incredulous world what greatness was
possible to man, what happiness was possible on earth. It was one or the other:
America or mystics. The mystics knew it; you didn’t. You let them infect you
with the worship of need—and this country became a giant in body with a
mooching midget in place of its soul, while its living soul was driven
underground to labor and feed you in silence, unnamed, unhonored, negated, its
soul and hero: the industrialist. Do you hear me now, Hank Rearden, the greatest
of the victims I have avenged?

“Neither he nor the rest of us will return until the road is clear to rebuild this
country—until the wreckage of the morality of sacrifice has been wiped out of
our way. A country’s political system is based on its code of morality. We will
rebuild America’s system on the moral premise which had been its foundation,
but which you treated as a guilty underground, in your frantic evasion of the
conflict between that premise and your mystic morality: the premise that man is
an end in himself, not the means to the ends of others, that man’s life, his
freedom, his happiness are his by inalienable right.

“You who’ve lost the concept of a right, you who swing in impotent
evasiveness between the claim that rights are a gift of God, a supernatural gift to
be taken on faith, or the claim that rights are a gift of society, to be broken at its
arbitrary whim—the source of man’s rights is not divine law or congressional
law, but the law of identity. A is A—and Man is Man. Rights are conditions of
existence required by man’s nature for his proper survival. If man is to live on
earth, it is right for him to use his mind, it is right to act on his own free
judgment, it is right to work for his values and to keep the product of his work.
If life on earth is his purpose, he has a right to live as a rational being: nature
forbids him the irrational. Any group, any gang, any nation that attempts to
negate man’s rights, is wrong, which means: is evil, which means: is anti-life.
“Rights are a moral concept—and morality is a matter of choice. Men are free
not to choose man’s survival as the standard of their morals and their laws, but
not free to escape from the fact that the alternative is a cannibal society, which
exists for a while by devouring its best and collapses like a cancerous body,
when the healthy have been eaten by the diseased, when the rational have been
consumed by the irrational. Such has been the fate of your societies in history,
but you’ve evaded the knowledge of the cause. I am here to state it: the agent of
retribution was the law of identity, which you cannot escape. Just as man cannot
live by means of the irrational, so two men cannot, or two thousand, or two
billion. Just as man can’t succeed by defying reality, so a nation can’t, or a
country, or a globe. A is A. The rest is a matter of time, provided by the
generosity of victims.

“Just as man can’t exist without his body, so no rights can exist without the
right to translate one’s rights into reality—to think, to work and to keep the
results—which means: the right of property. The modern mystics of muscle who
offer you the fraudulent alternative of ‘human rights’ versus ‘property rights,’ as
if one could exist without the other, are making a last, grotesque attempt to
revive the doctrine of soul versus body. Only a ghost can exist without material
property; only a slave can work with no right to the product of his effort. The
doctrine that ‘human rights’ are superior to ‘property rights’ simply means that
some human beings have the right to make property out of others; since the
competent have nothing to gain from the incompetent, it means the right of the
incompetent to own their betters and to use them as productive cattle. Whoever
regards this as human and right, has no right to the title of ‘human.’
“The source of property rights is the law of causality. All property and all
forms of wealth are produced by man’s mind and labor. As you cannot have
effects without causes, so you cannot have wealth without its source: without
intelligence. You cannot force intelligence to work: those who’re able to think,
will not work under compulsion; those who will, won’t produce much more than
the price of the whip needed to keep them enslaved. You cannot obtain the
products of a mind except on the owner’s terms, by trade and by volitional
consent. Any other policy of men toward man’s property is the policy of
criminals, no matter what their numbers. Criminals are savages who play it
short-range and starve when their prey runs out—just as you’re starving today,
you who believed that crime could be ‘practical’ if your government decreed that
robbery was legal and resistance to robbery illegal.

“The only proper purpose of a government is to protect man’s rights, which
means: to protect him from physical violence. A proper government is only a
policeman, acting as an agent of man’s self-defense, and, as such, may resort to
force only against those who start the use of force. The only proper functions of
a government are: the police, to protect you from criminals; the army, to protect
you from foreign invaders; and the courts, to protect your property and contracts
from breach or fraud by others, to settle disputes by rational rules, according to
objective law. But a government that initiates the employment of force against
men who had forced no one, the employment of armed compulsion against
disarmed victims, is a nightmare infernal machine designed to annihilate
morality: such a government reverses its only moral purpose and switches from
the role of protector to the role of man’s deadliest enemy, from the role of
policeman to the role of a criminal vested with the right to the wielding of
violence against victims deprived of the right of self-defense. Such a government
substitutes for morality the following rule of social conduct: you may do
whatever you please to your neighbor, provided your gang is bigger than his.
“Only a brute, a fool or an evader can agree to exist on such terms or agree to
give his fellow men a blank check on his life and his mind, to accept the belief
that others have the right to dispose of his person at their whim, that the will of
the majority is omnipotent, that the physical force of muscles and numbers is a
substitute for justice, reality and truth. We, the men of the mind, we who are
traders, not masters or slaves, do not deal in blank checks or grant them. We do
not live or work with any form of the non-objective.

“So long as men, in the era of savagery, had no concept of objective reality
and believed that physical nature was ruled by the whim of unknowable demons
—no thought, no science, no production were possible. Only when men
discovered that nature was a firm, predictable absolute were they able to rely on
their knowledge, to choose their course, to plan their future and, slowly, to rise
from the cave. Now you have placed modern industry, with its immense
complexity of scientific precision, back into the power of unknowable demons—
the unpredictable power of the arbitrary whims of hidden, ugly little bureaucrats.
A farmer will not invest the effort of one summer if he’s unable to calculate his
chances of a harvest. But you expect industrial giants—who plan in terms of
decades, invest in terms of generations and undertake ninety-nine-year contracts
—to continue to function and produce, not knowing what random caprice in the
skull of what random official will descend upon them at what moment to
demolish the whole of their effort. Drifters and physical laborers live and plan by
the range of a day. The better the mind, the longer the range. A man whose
vision extends to a shanty, might continue to build on your quicksands, to grab a
fast profit and run. A man who envisions skyscrapers, will not. Nor will he give
ten years of unswerving devotion to the task of inventing a new product, when
he knows that gangs of entrenched mediocrity are juggling the laws against him,
to tie him, restrict him and force him to fail, but should he fight them and
struggle and succeed, they will seize his rewards and his invention.

“Look past the range of the moment, you who cry that you fear to compete
with men of superior intelligence, that their mind is a threat to your livelihood,
that the strong leave no chance to the weak in a market of voluntary trade. What
determines the material value of your work? Nothing but the productive effort of
your mind—if you lived on a desert island. The less efficient the thinking of
your brain, the less your physical labor would bring you—and you could spend
your life on a single routine, collecting a precarious harvest or hunting with bow
and arrows, unable to think any further. But when you live in a rational society,
where men are free to trade, you receive an incalculable bonus: the material
value of your work is determined not only by your effort, but by the effort of the
best productive minds who exist in the world around you.

“When you work in a modern factory, you are paid, not only for your labor,
but for all the productive genius which has made that factory possible: for the
work of the industrialist who built it, for the work of the investor who saved the
money to risk on the untried and the new, for the work of the engineer who
designed the machines of which you are pushing the levers, for the work of the
inventor who created the product which you spend your time on making, for the
work of the scientist who discovered the laws that went into the making of that
product, for the work of the philosopher who taught men how to think and whom
you spend your time denouncing.

“The machine, the frozen form of a living intelligence, is the power that
expands the potential of your life by raising the productivity of your time. If you
worked as a blacksmith in the mystics’ Middle Ages, the whole of your earning
capacity would consist of an iron bar produced by your hands in days and days
of effort. How many tons of rail do you produce per day if you work for Hank
Rearden? Would you dare to claim that the size of your pay check was created
solely by your physical labor and that those rails were the product of your
muscles? The standard of living of that blacksmith is all that your muscles are
worth; the rest is a gift from Hank Rearden.
“Every man is free to rise as far as he’s able or willing, but it’s only the degree
to which he thinks that determines the degree to which he’ll rise. Physical labor
as such can extend no further than the range of the moment. The man who does
no more than physical labor, consumes the material value-equivalent of his own
contribution to the process of production, and leaves no further value, neither for
himself nor others. But the man who produces an idea in any field of rational
endeavor—the man who discovers new knowledge—is the permanent benefactor
of humanity. Material products can’t be shared, they belong to some ultimate
consumer; it is only the value of an idea that can be shared with unlimited
numbers of men, making all sharers richer at no one’s sacrifice or loss, raising
the productive capacity of whatever labor they perform. It is the value of his own
time that the strong of the intellect transfers to the weak, letting them work on
the jobs he discovered, while devoting his time to further discoveries. This is
mutual trade to mutual advantage; the interests of the mind are one, no matter
what the degree of intelligence, among men who desire to work and don’t seek
or expect the unearned.
“In proportion to the mental energy he spent, the man who creates a new
invention receives but a small percentage of his value in terms of material
payment, no matter what fortune he makes, no matter what millions he earns.
But the man who works as a janitor in the factory producing that invention,
receives an enormous payment in proportion to the mental effort that his job
requires of him. And the same is true of all men between, on all levels of
ambition and ability. The man at the top of the intellectual pyramid contributes
the most of all those below him, but gets nothing except his material payment,
receiving no intellectual bonus from others to add to the value of his time. The
man at the bottom who, left to himself, would starve in his hopeless ineptitude,
contributes nothing to those above him, but receives the bonus of all of their
brains. Such is the nature of the ‘competition’ between the strong and the weak
of the intellect. Such is the pattern of ‘exploitation’ for which you have damned
the strong.
“Such was the service we had given you and were glad and willing to give.
What did we ask in return? Nothing but freedom. We required that you leave us
free to function—free to think and to work as we choose—free to take our own
risks and to bear our own losses—free to earn our own profits and to make our
own fortunes—free to gamble on your rationality, to submit our products to your
judgment for the purpose of a voluntary trade, to rely on the objective value of
our work and on your mind’s ability to see it—free to count on your intelligence
and honesty, and to deal with nothing but your mind. Such was the price we
asked, which you chose to reject as too high. You decided to call it unfair that
we, who had dragged you out of your hovels and provided you with modern
apartments, with radios, movies and cars, should own our palaces and yachts—
you decided that you had a right to your wages, but we had no right to our
profits, that you did not want us to deal with your mind, but to deal, instead, with
your gun. Our answer to that, was: ‘May you be damned!’ Our answer came
true. You are.
“You did not care to compete in terms of intelligence—you are now
competing in terms of brutality. You did not care to allow rewards to be won by
successful production—you are now running a race in which rewards are won by
successful plunder. You called it selfish and cruel that men should trade value for
value—you have now established an unselfish society where they trade extortion
for extortion. Your system is a legal civil war, where men gang up on one
another and struggle for possession of the law, which they use as a club over
rivals, till another gang wrests it from their clutch and clubs them with it in their
turn, all of them clamoring protestations of service to an unnamed public’s
unspecified good. You had said that you saw no difference between economic
and political power, between the power of money and the power of guns—no
difference between reward and punishment, no difference between purchase and
plunder, no difference between pleasure and fear, no difference between life and
death. You are learning the difference now.

“Some of you might plead the excuse of your ignorance, of a limited mind and
a limited range. But the damned and the guiltiest among you are the men who
had the capacity to know, yet chose to blank out reality, the men who were
willing to sell their intelligence into cynical servitude to force: the contemptible
breed of those mystics of science who profess a devotion to some sort of ‘pure
knowledge’—the purity consisting of their claim that such knowledge has no
practical purpose on this earth—who reserve their logic for inanimate matter, but
believe that the subject of dealing with men requires and deserves no rationality,
who scorn money and sell their souls in exchange for a laboratory supplied by
loot. And since there is no such thing as ‘non-practical knowledge’ or any sort of
‘disinterested’ action, since they scorn the use of their science for the purpose
and profit of life, they deliver their science to the service of death, to the only
practical purpose it can ever have for looters: to inventing weapons of coercion
and destruction. They, the intellects who seek escape from moral values, they are
the damned on this earth, theirs is the guilt beyond forgiveness. Do you hear me,
Dr. Robert Stadler?

“But it is not to him that I wish to speak. I am speaking to those among you
who have retained some sovereign shred of their soul, unsold and unstamped:
‘—to the order of others.’ If, in the chaos of the motives that have made you
listen to the radio tonight, there was an honest, rational desire to learn what is
wrong with the world, you are the man whom I wished to address. By the rules
and terms of my code, one owes a rational statement to those whom it does
concern and who’re making an effort to know. Those who’re making an effort to
fail to understand me, are not a concern of mine.

“I am speaking to those who desire to live and to recapture the honor of their
soul. Now that you know the truth about your world, stop supporting your own
destroyers. The evil of the world is made possible by nothing but the sanction
you give it. Withdraw your sanction. Withdraw your support. Do not try to live
on your enemies’ terms or to win at a game where they’re setting the rules. Do
not seek the favor of those who enslaved you, do not beg for alms from those
who have robbed you, be it subsidies, loans or jobs, do not join their team to
recoup what they’ve taken by helping them rob your neighbors. One cannot hope
to maintain one’s life by accepting bribes to condone one’s destruction. Do not
struggle for profit, success or security at the price of a lien on your right to exist.
Such a lien is not to be paid off; the more you pay them, the more they will
demand; the greater the values you seek or achieve, the more vulnerably helpless
you become. Theirs is a system of white blackmail devised to bleed you, not by
means of your sins, but by means of your love for existence.
“Do not attempt to rise on the looters’ terms or to climb a ladder while they’re
holding the ropes. Do not allow their hands to touch the only power that keeps
them in power: your living ambition. Go on strike—in the manner I did. Use
your mind and skill in private, extend your knowledge, develop your ability, but
do not share your achievements with others. Do not try to produce a fortune,
with a looter riding on your back. Stay on the lowest rung of their ladder, earn no
more than your barest survival, do not make an extra penny to support the
looters’ state. Since you’re captive, act as a captive, do not help them pretend
that you’re free. Be the silent, incorruptible enemy they dread. When they force
you, obey—but do not volunteer. Never volunteer a step in their direction, or a
wish, or a plea, or a purpose. Do not help a holdup man to claim that he acts as
your friend and benefactor. Do not help your jailers to pretend that their jail is
your natural state of existence. Do not help them to fake reality. That fake is the
only dam holding off their secret terror, the terror of knowing they’re unfit to
exist; remove it and let them drown; your sanction is their only life belt.
“If you find a chance to vanish into some wilderness out of their reach, do so,
but not to exist as a bandit or to create a gang competing with their racket; build
a productive life of your own with those who accept your moral code and are
willing to struggle for a human existence. You have no chance to win on the
Morality of Death or by the code of faith and force; raise a standard to which the
honest will repair: the standard of Life and Reason.
“Act as a rational being and aim at becoming a rallying point for all those who
are starved for a voice of integrity—act on your rational values, whether alone in
the midst of your enemies, or with a few of your chosen friends, or as the
founder of a modest community on the frontier of mankind’s rebirth.
“When the looters’ state collapses, deprived of the best of its slaves, when it
falls to a level of impotent chaos, like the mystic-ridden nations of the Orient,
and dissolves into starving robber gangs fighting to rob one another—when the
advocates of the morality of sacrifice perish with their final ideal—then and on
that day we will return.

“We will open the gates of our city to those who deserve to enter, a city of
smokestacks, pipe lines, orchards, markets and inviolate homes. We will act as
the rallying center for such hidden outposts as you’ll build. With the sign of the
dollar as our symbol—the sign of free trade and free minds—we will move to
reclaim this country once more from the impotent savages who never discovered
its nature, its meaning, its splendor. Those who choose to join us, will join us;
those who don’t, will not have the power to stop us; hordes of savages have
never been an obstacle to men who carried the banner of the mind.
“Then this country will once more become a sanctuary for a vanishing
species: the rational being. The political system we will build is contained in a
single moral premise: no man may obtain any values from others by resorting to
physical force. Every man will stand or fall, live or die by his rational judgment.
If he fails to use it and falls, he will be his only victim. If he fears that his
judgment is inadequate, he will not be given a gun to improve it. If he chooses to
correct his errors in time, he will have the unobstructed example of his betters,
for guidance in learning to think; but an end will be put to the infamy of paying
with one life for the errors of another.

“In that world, you’ll be able to rise in the morning with the spirit you had
known in your childhood: that spirit of eagerness, adventure and certainty which
comes from dealing with a rational universe. No child is afraid of nature; it is
your fear of men that will vanish, the fear that has stunted your soul, the fear you
acquired in your early encounters with the incomprehensible, the unpredictable,
the contradictory, the arbitrary, the hidden, the faked, the irrational in men. You
will live in a world of responsible beings, who will be as consistent and reliable
as facts; the guarantee of their character will be a system of existence where
objective reality is the standard and the judge. Your virtues will be given
protection, your vices and weaknesses will not. Every chance will be open to
your good, none will be provided for your evil. What you’ll receive from men
will not be alms, or pity, or mercy, or forgiveness of sins, but a single value:
justice. And when you’ll look at men or at yourself, you will feel, not disgust,
suspicion and guilt, but a single constant: respect.
“Such is the future you are capable of winning. It requires a struggle; so does
any human value. All life is a purposeful struggle and your only choice is the
choice of a goal. Do you wish to continue the battle of your present or do you
wish to fight for my world? Do you wish to continue a struggle that consists of
clinging to precarious ledges in a sliding descent to the abyss, a struggle where
the hardships you endure are irreversible and the victories you win bring you
closer to destruction? Or do you wish to undertake a struggle that consists of
rising from ledge to ledge in a steady ascent to the top, a struggle where the
hardships are investments in your future, and the victories bring you irreversibly
closer to the world of your moral ideal, and should you die without reaching full
sunlight, you will die on a level touched by its rays? Such is the choice before
you. Let your mind and your love of existence decide.

“The last of my words will be addressed to those heroes who might still be
hidden in the world, those who are held prisoner, not by their evasions, but by
their virtues and their desperate courage. My brothers in spirit, check on your
virtues and on the nature of the enemies you’re serving. Your destroyers hold
you by means of your endurance, your generosity, your innocence, your love—
the endurance that carries their burdens—the generosity that responds to their
cries of despair—the innocence that is unable to conceive of their evil and gives
them the benefit of every doubt, refusing to condemn them without
understanding and incapable of understanding such motives as theirs—the love,
your love of life, which makes you believe that they are men and that they love
it, too. But the world of today is the world they wanted; life is the object of their
hatred. Leave them to the death they worship. In the name of your magnificent
devotion to this earth, leave them, don’t exhaust the greatness of your soul on
achieving the triumph of the evil of theirs. Do you hear me . . . my love?
“In the name of the best within you, do not sacrifice this world to those who
are its worst. In the name of the values that keep you alive, do not let your vision
of man be distorted by the ugly, the cowardly, the mindless in those who have
never achieved his title. Do not lose your knowledge that man’s proper estate is
an upright posture, an intransigent mind and a step that travels unlimited roads.
Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark, in the hopeless swamps
of the approximate, the not-quite, the not-yet, the not-at-all. Do not let the hero
in your soul perish, in lonely frustation for the life you deserved, but have never
been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you
desired can be won, it exists, it is real, it is possible, it’s yours.

“But to win it requires your total dedication and a total break with the world
of your past, with the doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal who exists for the
pleasure of others. Fight for the value of your person. Fight for the virtue of your
pride. Fight for the essence of that which is man: for his sovereign rational mind.
Fight with the radiant certainty and the absolute recitude of knowing that yours
is the Morality of Life and that yours is the battle for any achievement, any
value, any grandeur, any goodness, any joy that has ever existed on this earth.
