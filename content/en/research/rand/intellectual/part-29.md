Emotions are inherent in your nature, but their content is dictated by your mind.
Your emotional capacity is an empty motor, and your values are the fuel with
which your mind fills it. If you choose a mix of contradictions, it will clog your
motor, corrode your transmission and wreck you on your first attempt to move
with a machine which you, the driver, have corrupted.

“If you hold the irrational as your standard of value and the impossible as your
concept of the good, if you long for rewards you have not earned, for a fortune
or a love you don’t deserve, for a loophole in the law of causality, for an A that
becomes non-A at your whim, if you desire the opposite of existence—you will
reach it. Do not cry, when you reach it, that life is frustration and that happiness
is impossible to man; check your fuel: it brought you where you wanted to go.

“Happiness is not to be achieved at the command of emotional whims.

Happiness is not the satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly
attempt to indulge. 

Happiness is a state of non-contradictory joy— a joy without
penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of your values and does not
work for your own destruction, not the joy of escaping from your mind, but of
using your mind’s fullest power, not the joy of faking reality, but of achieving
values that are real, not the joy of a drunkard, but of a producer. Happiness is
possible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals,
seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.

“Just as I support my life, neither by robbery nor alms, but by my own effort,
so I do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others,
but earn it by my own achievement. Just as I do not consider the pleasure of
others as the goal of my life, so I do not consider my pleasure as the goal of the
lives of others. Just as there are no contradictions in my values and no conflicts
among my desires—so there are no victims and no conflicts of interest among
rational men, men who do not desire the unearned and do not view one another
with a cannibal’s lust, men who neither make sacrifices nor accept them.

“The symbol of all relationships among such men, the moral symbol of
respect for human beings, is the trader. We, who live by values, not by loot, are
traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he gets and
does not give or take the undeserved. A trader does not ask to be paid for his
failures, nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws. A trader does not squander his
body as fodder or his soul as alms. Just as he does not give his work except in
trade for material values, so he does not give the values of his spirit—his love,
his friendship, his esteem—except in payment and in trade for human virtues, in
payment for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can
respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout the ages, reviled the traders
and held them in contempt, while honoring the beggars and the looters, have
known the secret motive of their sneers: a trader is the entity they dread—a man
of justice.

“Do you ask what moral obligation I owe to my fellow men? None—except
the obligation I owe to myself, to material objects and to all of existence:
rationality. I deal with men as my nature and theirs demands: by means of
reason. I seek or desire nothing from them except such relations as they care to
enter of their own voluntary choice. It is only with their mind that I can deal and
only for my own self-interest, when they see that my interest coincides with
theirs. When they don’t, I enter no relationship; I let dissenters go their way and
I do not swerve from mine. I win by means of nothing but logic and I surrender
to nothing but logic. I do not surrender my reason or deal with men who
surrender theirs. I have nothing to gain from fools or cowards; I have no benefits
to seek from human vices: from stupidity, dishonesty or fear. The only value men
can offer me is the work of their mind. When I disagree with a rational man, I let
reality be our final arbiter; if I am right, he will learn; if I am wrong, I will; one
of us will win, but both will profit.

“Whatever may be open to disagreement, there is one act of evil that may not,
the act that no man may commit against others and no man may sanction or
forgive. So long as men desire to live together, no man may initiate—do you
hear me? no man may start—the use of physical force against others.
“To interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his
perception of reality, is to negate and paralyze his means of survival; to force
him to act against his own judgment, is like forcing him to act against his own
sight. Whoever, to whatever purpose or extent, initiates the use of force, is a
killer acting on the premise of death in a manner wider than murder: the premise
of destroying man’s capacity to live.

“Do not open your mouth to tell me that your mind has convinced you of your
right to force my mind. Force and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun
begins. When you declare that men are irrational animals and propose to treat
them as such, you define thereby your own character and can no longer claim the
sanction of reason—as no advocate of contradictions can claim it. There can be
no ‘right’ to destroy the source of rights, the only means of judging right and
wrong: the mind.

“To force a man to drop his own mind and to accept your will as a substitute,
with a gun in place of a syllogism, with terror in place of proof, and death as the
final argument—is to attempt to exist in defiance of reality. Reality demands of
man that he act for his own rational interest; your gun demands of him that he
act against it. Reality threatens man with death if he does not act on his rational
judgment; you threaten him with death if he does. You place him in a world
where the price of his life is the surrender of all the virtues required by life—and
death by a process of gradual destruction is all that you and your system will
achieve, when death is made to be the ruling power, the winning argument in a
society of men.

“Be it a highwayman who confronts a traveler with the ultimatum: ‘Your
money or your life,’ or a politician who confronts a country with the ultimatum:
‘Your children’s education or your life,’ the meaning of that ultimatum is: ‘Your
mind or your life’—and neither is possible to man without the other.
“If there are degrees of evil, it is hard to say who is the more contemptible: the
brute who assumes the right to force the mind of others or the moral degenerate
who grants to others the right to force his mind. That is the moral absolute one
does not leave open to debate. I do not grant the terms of reason to men who
propose to deprive me of reason. I do not enter discussions with neighbors who
think they can forbid me to think. I do not place my moral sanction upon a
murderer’s wish to kill me. When a man attempts to deal with me by force, I
answer him—by force.

“It is only as retaliation that force may be used and only against the man who
starts its use. No, I do not share his evil or sink to his concept of morality: I
merely grant him his choice, destruction, the only destruction he had the right to
choose: his own. He uses force to seize a value; I use it only to destroy
destruction. A holdup man seeks to gain wealth by killing me; I do not grow
richer by killing a holdup man. I seek no values by means of evil, nor do I
surrender my values to evil.

“In the name of all the producers who had kept you alive and received your
death ultimatums in payment, I now answer you with a single ultimatum of our
own: Our work or your guns. You can choose either; you can’t have both. We do
not initiate the use of force against others or submit to force at their hands. If you
desire ever again to live in an industrial society, it will be on our moral terms.
Our terms and our motive power are the antithesis of yours. You have been using
fear as your weapon and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for
rejecting your morality. We offer him life as his reward for accepting ours.

“You who are worshippers of the zero—you have never discovered that
achieving life is not the equivalent of avoiding death. Joy is not ‘the absence of
pain,’ intelligence is not ‘the absence of stupidity,’ light is not ‘the absence of
darkness,’ an entity is not ‘the absence of a nonentity.’ Building is not done by
abstaining from demolition; centuries of sitting and waiting in such abstinence
will not raise one single girder for you to abstain from demolishing—and now
you can no longer say to me, the builder: ‘Produce, and feed us in exchange for
our not destroying your production.’ I am answering in the name of all your
victims: Perish with and in your own void. Existence is not a negation of
negatives. Evil, not value, is an absence and a negation, evil is impotent and has
no power but that which we let it extort from us. Perish, because we have
learned that a zero cannot hold a mortgage over life.

“You seek escape from pain. We seek the achievement of happiness. You exist
for the sake of avoiding punishment. We exist for the sake of earning rewards.
Threats will not make us function; fear is not our incentive. 

It is not death that
we wish to avoid, but life that we wish to live.
