<!-- “Now we are chained and commanded to produce by savages who do not grant us even the identification of sinners—by savages who proclaim that we do not exist, then threaten to deprive us of the life we don’t possess, if we fail to
provide them with the goods we don’t produce. Now we are expected to
continue running railroads and to know the minute when a train will arrive after
crossing the span of a continent, we are expected to continue running steel mills
and to know the molecular structure of every drop of metal in the cables of your
bridges and in the body of the airplanes that support you in mid-air—while the
tribes of your grotesque little mystics of muscle fight over the carcass of our
world, gibbering in sounds of non-language that there are no principles, no
absolutes, no knowledge, no mind.

“Dropping below the level of a savage, who believes that the magic words he
utters have the power to alter reality, they believe that reality can be altered by
the power of the words they do not utter—and their magic tool is the blank-out,
the pretense that nothing can come into existence past the voodoo of their refusal
to identify it. -->

As the savages feed on stolen wealth in body, so they feed on stolen concepts in mind, and proclaim that honesty consists of refusing to know that one is stealing.

As they use effects while denying causes, so they use our concepts while
denying the roots and the existence of the concepts they are using. As they seek,
not to build, but to take over industrial plants, so they seek, not to think, but to
take over human thinking.

“As they proclaim that the only requirement for running a factory is the ability
to turn the cranks of the machines, and blank out the question of who created the
factory—so they proclaim that there are no entities, that nothing exists but
motion, and blank out the fact that motion presupposes the thing which moves,
that without the concept of entity, there can be no such concept as ‘motion.’ As
they proclaim their right to consume the unearned, and blank out the question of
who’s to produce it—so they proclaim that there is no law of identity, that
nothing exists but change, and blank out the fact that change presupposes the
concepts of what changes, from what and to what, that without the law of
identity no such concept as ‘change’ is possible. As they rob an industrialist
while denying his value, so they seek to seize power over all of existence while
denying that existence exists.

“ ‘We know that we know nothing,’ they chatter, blanking out the fact that
they are claiming knowledge—‘There are no absolutes,’ they chatter, blanking
out the fact that they are uttering an absolute—‘You cannot prove that you exist
or that you’re conscious,’ they chatter, blanking out the fact that proof
presupposes existence, consciousness and a complex chain of knowledge: the
existence of something to know, of a consciousness able to know it, and of a
knowledge that has learned to distinguish between such concepts as the proved
and the unproved.

“When a savage who has not learned to speak declares that existence must be
proved, he is asking you to prove it by means of non-existence—when he
declares that your consciousness must be proved, he is asking you to prove it by
means of unconsciousness—he is asking you to step into a void outside of
existence and consciousness to give him proof of both—he is asking you to
become a zero gaining knowledge about a zero.
“When he declares that an axiom is a matter of arbitrary choice and he doesn’t
choose to accept the axiom that he exists, he blanks out the fact that he has
accepted it by uttering that sentence, that the only way to reject it is to shut one’s
mouth, expound no theories and die.

An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained in all others, whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. 

An axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it. 

Let the caveman who does not choose to accept the axiom of identity, try to present his theory without
using the concept of identity or any concept derived from it—let the anthropoid
who does not choose to accept the existence of nouns, try to devise a language
without nouns, adjectives or verbs—let the witch doctor who does not choose to
accept the validity of sensory perception, try to prove it without using the data he
obtained by sensory perception—let the head-hunter who does not choose to
accept the validity of logic, try to prove it without using logic—let the pigmy
who proclaims that a skyscraper needs no foundation after it reaches its fiftieth
story, yank the base from under his building, not yours—let the cannibal who
snarls that the freedom of man’s mind was needed to create an industrial
civilization, but is not needed to maintain it, be given an arrowhead and bear-
skin, not a university chair of economics.

“Do you think they are taking you back to dark ages? They are taking you
back to darker ages than any your history has known. Their goal is not the era of
pre-science, but the era of pre-language. Their purpose is to deprive you of the
concept on which man’s mind, his life and his culture depend: the concept of an
objective reality. Identify the development of a human consciousness—and you
will know the purpose of their creed.

“A savage is a being who has not grasped that A is A and that reality is real.
He has arrested his mind at the level of a baby’s, at the stage when a
consciousness acquires its initial sensory perceptions and has not learned to
distinguish solid objects. It is to a baby that the world appears as a blur of
motion, without things that move—and the birth of his mind is the day when he
grasps that the streak that keeps flickering past him is his mother and the whirl
beyond her is a curtain, that the two are solid entities and neither can turn into
the other, that they are what they are, that they exist.

The day when he grasps
that matter has no volition is the day when he grasps that he has—and this is his
birth as a human being. The day when he grasps that the reflection he sees in a
mirror is not a delusion, that it is real, but it is not himself, that the mirage he
sees in a desert is not a delusion, that the air and the light rays that cause it are
real, but it is not a city, it is a city’s reflection—the day when he grasps that he is
not a passive recipient of the sensations of any given moment, that his senses do
not provide him with automatic knowledge in separate snatches independent of
context, but only with the material of knowledge, which his mind must learn to
integrate—the day when he grasps that his senses cannot deceive him, that
physical objects cannot act without causes, that his organs of perception are
physical and have no volition, no power to invent or to distort, that the evidence
they give him is an absolute, but his mind must learn to understand it, his mind
must discover the nature, the causes, the full context of his sensory material, his
mind must identify the things that he perceives—that is the day of his birth as a
thinker and scientist.

“We are the men who reach that day; you are the men who choose to reach it
partly; a savage is a man who never does.

“To a savage, the world is a place of unintelligible miracles where anything is
possible to inanimate matter and nothing is possible to him. His world is not the
unknown, but that irrational horror: the unknowable. He believes that physical
objects are endowed with a mysterious volition, moved by causeless,
unpredictable whims, while he is a helpless pawn at the mercy of forces beyond
his control. He believes that nature is ruled by demons who possess an
omnipotent power and that reality is their fluid plaything, where they can turn
his bowl of meal into a snake and his wife into a beetle at any moment, where
the A he has never discovered can be any non-A they choose, where the only
knowledge he possesses is that he must not attempt to know. He can count on
nothing, he can only wish, and he spends his life on wishing, on begging his
demons to grant him his wishes by the arbitrary power of their will, giving them
credit when they do, taking the blame when they don’t, offering them sacrifices
in token of his gratitude and sacrifices in token of his guilt, crawling on his belly
in fear and worship of sun and moon and wind and rain and of any thug who
announces himself as their spokesman, provided his words are unintelligible and
his mask sufficiently frightening—he wishes, begs and crawls, and dies, leaving
you, as a record of his view of existence, the distorted monstrosities of his idols,
part-man, part-animal, part-spider, the embodiments of the world of non-A.
“His is the intellectual state of your modern teachers and his is the world to
which they want to bring you.

“If you wonder by what means they propose to do it, walk into any college
classroom and you will hear your professors teaching your children that man can
be certain of nothing, that his consciousness has no validity whatever, that he can
learn no facts and no laws of existence, that he’s incapable of knowing an
objective reality. What, then, is his standard of knowledge and truth? Whatever
others believe, is their answer. There is no knowledge, they teach, there’s only
faith: your belief that you exist is an act of faith, no more valid than another’s
faith in his right to kill you; the axioms of science are an act of faith, no more
valid than a mystic’s faith in revelations; the belief that electric light can be
produced by a generator is an act of faith, no more valid than the belief that it
can be produced by a rabbit’s foot kissed under a stepladder on the first of the
moon—truth is whatever people want it to be, and people are everyone except
yourself; reality is whatever people choose to say it is, there are no objective
facts, there are only people’s arbitrary wishes—a man who seeks knowledge in a
laboratory by means of test tubes and logic is an old-fashioned, superstitious
fool; a true scientist is a man who goes around taking public polls—and if it
weren’t for the selfish greed of the manufacturers of steel girders, who have a
vested interest in obstructing the progress of science, you would learn that New
York City does not exist, because a poll of the entire population of the world
would tell you by a landslide majority that their beliefs forbid its existence.
“For centuries, the mystics of spirit have proclaimed that faith is superior to
reason, but have not dared deny the existence of reason. Their heirs and product,
the mystics of muscle, have completed their job and achieved their dream: they
proclaim that everything is faith, and call it a revolt against believing. As revolt
against unproved assertions, they proclaim that nothing can be proved; as revolt
against supernatural knowledge, they proclaim that no knowledge is possible; as
revolt against the enemies of science, they proclaim that science is superstition;
as revolt against the enslavement of the mind, they proclaim that there is no
mind.

“If you surrender your power to perceive, if you accept the switch of your
standard from the objective to the collective and wait for mankind to tell you
what to think, you will find another switch taking place before the eyes you have
renounced: you will find that your teachers become the rulers of the collective,
and if you then refuse to obey them, protesting that they are not the whole of
mankind, they will answer: ‘By what means do you know that we are not? Are,
brother? Where did you get that old-fashioned term?’

“If you doubt that such is their purpose, observe with what passionate
consistency the mystics of muscle are striving to make you forget that a concept
such as ‘mind’ has ever existed. Observe the twists of undefined verbiage, the
words with rubber meanings, the terms left floating in midstream, by means of
which they try to get around the recognition of the concept of ‘thinking.’ Your
consciousness, they tell you, consists of ‘reflexes,’ ‘reactions, ’ ‘experiences,’
‘urges,’ and ‘drives’—and refuse to identify the means by which they acquired
that knowledge, to identify the act they are performing when they tell it or the
act you are performing when you listen. Words have the power to ‘condition’
you, they say and refuse to identify the reason why words have the power to
change your—blank-out. A student reading a book understands it through a
process of—blank-out. A scientist working on an invention is engaged in the
activity of—blank-out. A psychologist helping a neurotic to solve a problem and
untangle a conflict, does it by means of—blank-out. An industrialist—blank-out
—there is no such person. A factory is a ‘natural resource,’ like a tree, a rock or a
mud puddle.

“The problem of production, they tell you, has been solved and deserves no
study or concern; the only problem left for your ‘reflexes’ to solve is now the
problem of distribution. Who solved the problem of production? Humanity, they
answer. What was the solution? The goods are here. How did they get here?
Somehow. What caused it? Nothing has causes.

“They proclaim that every man born is entitled to exist without labor and, the
laws of reality to the contrary notwithstanding, is entitled to receive his
‘minimum sustenance’—his food, his clothes, his shelter—with no effort on his
part, as his due and his birthright. To receive it—from whom? Blank-out. Every
man, they announce, owns an equal share of the technological benefits created in
the world. Created—by whom? Blank-out. Frantic cowards who posture as
defenders of industrialists now define the purpose of economics as ‘an
adjustment between the unlimited desires of men and the goods supplied in
limited quantity.’ Supplied—by whom? Blank-out. Intellectual hoodlums who
pose as professors, shrug away the thinkers of the past by declaring that their
social theories were based on the impractical assumption that man was a rational
being—but since men are not rational, they declare, there ought to be established
a system that will make it possible for them to exist while being irrational,
which means: while defying reality. Who will make it possible? Blank-out. Any
stray mediocrity rushes into print with plans to control the production of
mankind—and whoever agrees or disagrees with his statistics, no one questions
his right to enforce his plans by means of a gun. Enforce—on whom? Blank-out.
Random females with causeless incomes flitter on trips around the globe and
return to deliver the message that the backward peoples of the world demand a
higher standard of living. Demand—of whom? Blank-out.

“And to forestall any inquiry into the cause of the difference between a jungle
village and New York City, they resort to the ultimate obscenity of explaining
man’s industrial progress—skyscrapers, cable bridges, power motors, railroad
trains—by declaring that man is an animal who possesses an ‘instinct of toolmaking.’
“Did you wonder what is wrong with the world? You are now seeing the
climax of the creed of the uncaused and unearned. All your gangs of mystics, of
spirit or muscle, are fighting one another for power to rule you, snarling that love
is the solution for all the problems of your spirit and that a whip is the solution
for all the problems of your body—you who have agreed to have no mind.

Granting man less dignity than they grant to cattle, ignoring what an animal
trainer could tell them—that no animal can be trained by fear, that a tortured
elephant will trample its torturer, but will not work for him or carry his burdens
—they expect man to continue to produce electronic tubes, supersonic airplanes,
atom-smashing engines and interstellar telescopes, with his ration of meat for
reward and a lash on his back for incentive.
