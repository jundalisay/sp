Rationality is the recognition:
- of existence
- that nothing can alter the truth and nothing can take precedence over that act of perceiving the truth
which is thinking
- that the mind is one’s only judge of values and one’s only guide of action
- that reason is an absolute that permits no compromise
- that a concession to the irrational invalidates one’s consciousness and turns it from the task of perceiving to the task of faking reality
- that the alleged shortcut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short-circuit destroying the mind
- that the acceptance of a mystical invention is a wish for the annihilation of existence and annihilates one’s consciousness.

Independence is the recognition of the fact that yours is the responsibility of judgment and nothing can help you escape it—that no substitute can do your
thinking, as no pinch-hitter can live your life—that the vilest form of selfabasement and self-destruction is the subordination of your mind to the mind of
another, the acceptance of an authority over your brain, the acceptance of his
assertions as facts, his say-so as truth, his edicts as middle-man between your
consciousness and your existence.

“Integrity is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake your
consciousness, just as honesty is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake
existence—that man is an indivisible entity, an integrated unit of two attributes:
of matter and consciousness, and that he may permit no breach between body
and mind, between action and thought, between his life and his convictions—
that, like a judge impervious to public opinion, he may not sacrifice his
convictions to the wishes of others, be it the whole of mankind shouting pleas or
threats against him—that courage and confidence are practical necessities, that
courage is the practical form of being true to existence, of being true to truth,
and confidence is the practical form of being true to one’s own consciousness.
“Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have
no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained by fraud—
that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an act of
raising your victims to a position higher than reality, where you become a pawn
of their blindness, a slave of their non-thinking and their evasions, while their
intelligence, their rationality, their perceptiveness become the enemies you have
to dread and flee—that you do not care to live as a dependent, least of all a
dependent on the stupidity of others, or as a fool whose source of values is the
fools he succeeds in fooling—that honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrifice for
the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice: his
refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousness
of others.

“Justice is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men
as you cannot fake the character of nature, that you must judge all men as
conscientiously as you judge inanimate objects, with the same respect for truth,
with the same incorruptible vision, by as pure and as rational a process of
identification—that every man must be judged for what he is and treated
accordingly, that just as you do not pay a higher price for a rusty chunk of scrap
than for a piece of shining metal, so you do not value a rotter above a hero—that
your moral appraisal is the coin paying men for their virtues or vices, and this
payment demands of you as scrupulous an honor as you bring to financial
transactions—that to withhold your contempt from men’s vices is an act of moral
counterfeiting, and to withhold your admiration from their virtues is an act of
moral embezzlement—that to place any other concern higher than justice is to
devaluate your moral currency and defraud the good in favor of the evil, since
only the good can lose by a default of justice and only the evil can profit—and
that the bottom of the pit at the end of that road, the act of moral bankruptcy, is
to punish men for their virtues and reward them for their vices, that that is the
collapse to full depravity, the Black Mass of the worship of death, the dedication
of your consciousness to the destruction of existence.
“Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your recognition of the fact
that you choose to live—that productive work is the process by which man’s
consciousness controls his existence, a constant process of acquiring knowledge
and shaping matter to fit one’s purpose, of translating an idea into physical form,
of remaking the earth in the image of one’s values—that all work is creative
work if done by a thinking mind, and no work is creative if done by a blank who
repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has learned from others—that your work
is yours to choose, and the choice is as wide as your mind, that nothing more is
possible to you and nothing less is human—that to cheat your way into a job
bigger than your mind can handle is to become a fear-corroded ape on borrowed
motions and borrowed time, and to settle down into a job that requires less than
your mind’s full capacity is to cut your motor and sentence yourself to another
kind of motion: decay—that your work is the process of achieving your values,
and to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition to live—that your
body is a machine, but your mind is its driver, and you must drive as far as your
mind will take you, with achievement as the goal of your road—that the man
who has no purpose is a machine that coasts downhill at the mercy of any
boulder to crash in the first chance ditch, that the man who stifles his mind is a
stalled machine slowly going to rust, that the man who lets a leader prescribe his
course is a wreck being towed to the scrap heap, and the man who makes another
man his goal is a hitchhiker no driver should ever pick up—that your work is the
purpose of your life, and you must speed past any killer who assumes the right to
stop you, that any value you might find outside your work, any other loyalty or
love, can be only travelers you choose to share your journey and must be
travelers going on their own power in the same direction.
“Pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your own highest value and,
like all of man’s values, it has to be earned—that of any achievements open to
you, the one that makes all others possible is the creation of your own character
—that your character, your actions, your desires, your emotions are the products
of the premises held by your mind—that as man must produce the physical
values he needs to sustain his life, so he must acquire the values of character that
make his life worth sustaining—that as man is a being of self-made wealth, so he
is a being of self-made soul—that to live requires a sense of self-value, but man,
who has no automatic values, has no automatic sense of self-esteem and must
earn it by shaping his soul in the image of his moral ideal, in the image of Man,
the rational being he is born able to create, but must create by choice—that the
first precondition of self-esteem is that radiant selfishness of soul which desires
the best in all things, in values of matter and spirit, a soul that seeks above all
else to achieve its own moral perfection, valuing nothing higher than itself—and
that the proof of an achieved self-esteem is your soul’s shudder of contempt and
rebellion against the role of a sacrificial animal, against the vile impertinence of
any creed that proposes to immolate the irreplaceable value which is your
consciousness and the incomparable glory which is your existence to the blind
evasions and the stagnant decay of others.
“Are you beginning to see who is John Galt? I am the man who has earned the
thing you did not fight for, the thing you have renounced, betrayed, corrupted,
yet were unable fully to destroy and are now hiding as your guilty secret,
spending your life in apologies to every professional cannibal, lest it be
discovered that somewhere within you, you still long to say what I am now
saying to the hearing of the whole of mankind: I am proud of my own value and
of the fact that I wish to live.
“This wish—which you share, yet submerge as an evil—is the only remnant
of the good within you, but it is a wish one must learn to deserve. His own
happiness is man’s only moral purpose, but only his own virtue can achieve it.
Virtue is not an end in itself. Virtue is not its own reward or sacrificial fodder for
the reward of evil. Life is the reward of virtue—and happiness is the goal and the
reward of life.

“Just as your body has two fundamental sensations, pleasure and pain, as signs
of its welfare or injury, as a barometer of its basic alternative, life or death, so
your consciousness has two fundamental emotions, joy and suffering, in answer
to the same alternative. Your emotions are estimates of that which furthers your
life or threatens it, lightning calculators giving you a sum of your profit or loss.
You have no choice about your capacity to feel that something is good for you or
evil, but what you will consider good or evil, what will give you joy or pain,
what you will love or hate, desire or fear, depends on your standard of value.
Emotions are inherent in your nature, but their content is dictated by your mind.
Your emotional capacity is an empty motor, and your values are the fuel with
which your mind fills it. If you choose a mix of contradictions, it will clog your
motor, corrode your transmission and wreck you on your first attempt to move
with a machine which you, the driver, have corrupted.
“If you hold the irrational as your standard of value and the impossible as your
concept of the good, if you long for rewards you have not earned, for a fortune
or a love you don’t deserve, for a loophole in the law of causality, for an A that
becomes non-A at your whim, if you desire the opposite of existence—you will
reach it. Do not cry, when you reach it, that life is frustration and that happiness
is impossible to man; check your fuel: it brought you where you wanted to go.
“Happiness is not to be achieved at the command of emotional whims.
Happiness is not the satisfaction of whatever irrational wishes you might blindly
attempt to indulge. Happiness is a state of non-contradictory joy— a joy without
penalty or guilt, a joy that does not clash with any of your values and does not
work for your own destruction, not the joy of escaping from your mind, but of
using your mind’s fullest power, not the joy of faking reality, but of achieving
values that are real, not the joy of a drunkard, but of a producer. Happiness is
possible only to a rational man, the man who desires nothing but rational goals,
seeks nothing but rational values and finds his joy in nothing but rational actions.
“Just as I support my life, neither by robbery nor alms, but by my own effort,
so I do not seek to derive my happiness from the injury or the favor of others,
but earn it by my own achievement. Just as I do not consider the pleasure of
others as the goal of my life, so I do not consider my pleasure as the goal of the
lives of others. Just as there are no contradictions in my values and no conflicts
among my desires—so there are no victims and no conflicts of interest among
rational men, men who do not desire the unearned and do not view one another
with a cannibal’s lust, men who neither make sacrifices nor accept them.

“The symbol of all relationships among such men, the moral symbol of
respect for human beings, is the trader. We, who live by values, not by loot, are
traders, both in matter and in spirit. A trader is a man who earns what he gets and
does not give or take the undeserved. A trader does not ask to be paid for his
failures, nor does he ask to be loved for his flaws. A trader does not squander his
body as fodder or his soul as alms. Just as he does not give his work except in
trade for material values, so he does not give the values of his spirit—his love,
his friendship, his esteem—except in payment and in trade for human virtues, in
payment for his own selfish pleasure, which he receives from men he can
respect. The mystic parasites who have, throughout the ages, reviled the traders
and held them in contempt, while honoring the beggars and the looters, have
known the secret motive of their sneers: a trader is the entity they dread—a man
of justice.

“Do you ask what moral obligation I owe to my fellow men? None—except
the obligation I owe to myself, to material objects and to all of existence:
rationality. I deal with men as my nature and theirs demands: by means of
reason. I seek or desire nothing from them except such relations as they care to
enter of their own voluntary choice. It is only with their mind that I can deal and
only for my own self-interest, when they see that my interest coincides with
theirs. When they don’t, I enter no relationship; I let dissenters go their way and
I do not swerve from mine. I win by means of nothing but logic and I surrender
to nothing but logic. I do not surrender my reason or deal with men who
surrender theirs. I have nothing to gain from fools or cowards; I have no benefits
to seek from human vices: from stupidity, dishonesty or fear. The only value men
can offer me is the work of their mind. When I disagree with a rational man, I let
reality be our final arbiter; if I am right, he will learn; if I am wrong, I will; one
of us will win, but both will profit.
“Whatever may be open to disagreement, there is one act of evil that may not,
the act that no man may commit against others and no man may sanction or
forgive. So long as men desire to live together, no man may initiate—do you
hear me? no man may start—the use of physical force against others.
“To interpose the threat of physical destruction between a man and his
perception of reality, is to negate and paralyze his means of survival; to force
him to act against his own judgment, is like forcing him to act against his own
sight. Whoever, to whatever purpose or extent, initiates the use of force, is a
killer acting on the premise of death in a manner wider than murder: the premise
of destroying man’s capacity to live.
“Do not open your mouth to tell me that your mind has convinced you of your
right to force my mind. Force and mind are opposites; morality ends where a gun
begins. When you declare that men are irrational animals and propose to treat
them as such, you define thereby your own character and can no longer claim the
sanction of reason—as no advocate of contradictions can claim it. There can be
no ‘right’ to destroy the source of rights, the only means of judging right and
wrong: the mind.
“To force a man to drop his own mind and to accept your will as a substitute,
with a gun in place of a syllogism, with terror in place of proof, and death as the
final argument—is to attempt to exist in defiance of reality. Reality demands of
man that he act for his own rational interest; your gun demands of him that he
act against it. Reality threatens man with death if he does not act on his rational
judgment; you threaten him with death if he does. You place him in a world
where the price of his life is the surrender of all the virtues required by life—and
death by a process of gradual destruction is all that you and your system will
achieve, when death is made to be the ruling power, the winning argument in a
society of men.

“Be it a highwayman who confronts a traveler with the ultimatum: ‘Your
money or your life,’ or a politician who confronts a country with the ultimatum:
‘Your children’s education or your life,’ the meaning of that ultimatum is: ‘Your
mind or your life’—and neither is possible to man without the other.
“If there are degrees of evil, it is hard to say who is the more contemptible: the
brute who assumes the right to force the mind of others or the moral degenerate
who grants to others the right to force his mind. That is the moral absolute one
does not leave open to debate. I do not grant the terms of reason to men who
propose to deprive me of reason. I do not enter discussions with neighbors who
think they can forbid me to think. I do not place my moral sanction upon a
murderer’s wish to kill me. When a man attempts to deal with me by force, I
answer him—by force.
“It is only as retaliation that force may be used and only against the man who
starts its use. No, I do not share his evil or sink to his concept of morality: I
merely grant him his choice, destruction, the only destruction he had the right to
choose: his own. He uses force to seize a value; I use it only to destroy
destruction. A holdup man seeks to gain wealth by killing me; I do not grow
richer by killing a holdup man. I seek no values by means of evil, nor do I
surrender my values to evil.
“In the name of all the producers who had kept you alive and received your
death ultimatums in payment, I now answer you with a single ultimatum of our
own: Our work or your guns. You can choose either; you can’t have both. We do
not initiate the use of force against others or submit to force at their hands. If you
desire ever again to live in an industrial society, it will be on our moral terms.
Our terms and our motive power are the antithesis of yours. You have been using
fear as your weapon and have been bringing death to man as his punishment for
rejecting your morality. We offer him life as his reward for accepting ours.
“You who are worshippers of the zero—you have never discovered that
achieving life is not the equivalent of avoiding death. Joy is not ‘the absence of
pain,’ intelligence is not ‘the absence of stupidity,’ light is not ‘the absence of
darkness,’ an entity is not ‘the absence of a nonentity.’ Building is not done by
abstaining from demolition; centuries of sitting and waiting in such abstinence
will not raise one single girder for you to abstain from demolishing—and now
you can no longer say to me, the builder: ‘Produce, and feed us in exchange for
our not destroying your production.’ I am answering in the name of all your
victims: Perish with and in your own void. Existence is not a negation of
negatives. Evil, not value, is an absence and a negation, evil is impotent and has
no power but that which we let it extort from us. Perish, because we have
learned that a zero cannot hold a mortgage over life.
“You seek escape from pain. We seek the achievement of happiness. You exist
for the sake of avoiding punishment. We exist for the sake of earning rewards.
Threats will not make us function; fear is not our incentive. It is not death that
we wish to avoid, but life that we wish to live.
“You, who have lost the concept of the difference, you who claim that fear and
joy are incentives of equal power—and secretly add that fear is the more
‘practical’—you do not wish to live, and only fear of death still holds you to the
existence you have damned. You dart in panic through the trap of your days,
looking for the exit you have closed, running from a pursuer you dare not name
to a terror you dare not acknowledge, and the greater your terror the greater your
dread of the only act that could save you: thinking. The purpose of your struggle
is not to know, not to grasp or name or hear the thing I shall now state to your
hearing: that yours is the Morality of Death.
