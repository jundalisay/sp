Man’s mind is his basic tool of survival. 

Life is given to him, survival is not.

His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. 

His mind is given to him, its content is not.

To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. 

He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. 

He cannot dig a ditch—or build a cyclotron—without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. 

To remain alive, he must think.


But thinking is a choice.

The key to what you so recklessly call ‘human nature,’ the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness. 

Reason does not work automatically.

Thinking is not a mechanical process. The connections of logic are not made by instinct. 

The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; the function of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are free to think or to evade that effort. 

But you are not free to escape from your nature, from the fact
that reason is your means of survival—so that for you, who are a human being,
the question ‘to be or not to be’ is the question ‘to think or not to think.’
“A being of volitional consciousness has no automatic course of behavior. 

He needs a code of values to guide his actions. ‘Value’ is that which one acts to gain and keep, ‘virtue’ is the action by which one gains and keeps it. ‘Value’ presupposes an answer to the question: of value to whom and for what? ‘Value’
presupposes a standard, a purpose and the necessity of action in the face of an
alternative. 

Where there are no alternatives, no values are possible.

There is only one fundamental alternative in the universe: existence or nonexistence—and it pertains to a single class of entities: to living organisms. 

The existence of inanimate matter is unconditional, the existence of life is not: it depends on a specific course of action. Matter is indestructible, it changes its forms, but it cannot cease to exist. 

It is only a living organism that faces a constant alternative: the issue of life or death. Life is a process of self-sustaining and self-generated action.

If an organism fails in that action, it dies; its chemical elements remain, but its life goes out of existence. It is only the concept of ‘Life’ that makes the concept of ‘Value’ possible. It is only to a living entity that things
can be good or evil.

“A plant must feed itself in order to live; the sunlight, the water, the chemicals it needs are the values its nature has set it to pursue; its life is the standard of value directing its actions. 

But a plant has no choice of action; there are alternatives in the conditions it encounters, but there is no alternative in its function: it acts automatically to further its life, it cannot act for its own destruction.

An animal is equipped for sustaining its life; its senses provide it with an automatic code of action, an automatic knowledge of what is good for it or evil.

It has no power to extend its knowledge or to evade it. In conditions where its knowledge proves inadequate, it dies. 

But so long as it lives, it acts on its knowledge, with automatic safety and no power of choice, it is unable to ignore its own good, unable to decide to choose the evil and act as its own destroyer. “Man has no automatic code of survival. 

His particular distinction from all other living species is the necessity to act in the face of alternatives by means of volitional choice. 

He has no automatic knowledge of what is good for him or evil, what values his life depends on, what course of action it requires. 

Are you prattling about an instinct of self-preservation? An instinct of self-preservation is precisely what man does not possess. 

An ‘instinct’ is an unerring and automatic form of knowledge. A desire is not an instinct. A desire to live does not give you the knowledge required for living. And even man’s desire to live is not automatic: your secret evil today is that that is the desire you do not hold. 

Your fear of death is not a love for life and will not give you the knowledge needed to keep it. Man must obtain his knowledge and choose his actions by a process of thinking, which nature will not force him to perform. Man has the power to act as his own destroyer—and that is the way he has acted through most of his history.

“A living entity that regarded its means of survival as evil, would not survive.
A plant that struggled to mangle its roots, a bird that fought to break its wings
would not remain for long in the existence they affronted. But the history of man
has been a struggle to deny and to destroy his mind.

“Man has been called a rational being, but rationality is a matter of choice—and the alternative his nature offers him is: rational being or suicidal animal. 

Man has to be man—by choice; he has to hold his life as a value—by choice; he
has to learn to sustain it—by choice; he has to discover the values it requires and
practice his virtues—by choice.

“A code of values accepted by choice is a code of morality.
“Whoever you are, you who are hearing me now, I am speaking to whatever
living remnant is left uncorrupted within you, to the remnant of the human, to
your mind, and I say: There is a morality of reason, a morality proper to man,
and Man’s Life is its standard of value.

“All that which is proper to the life of a rational being is the good; all that
which destroys it is the evil.

“Man’s life, as required by his nature, is not the life of a mindless brute, of a
looting thug or a mooching mystic, but the life of a thinking being—not life by
means of force or fraud, but life by means of achievement—not survival at any
price, since there’s only one price that pays for man’s survival: reason.
“Man’s life is the standard of morality, but your own life is its purpose. If
existence on earth is your goal, you must choose your actions and values by the
standard of that which is proper to man—for the purpose of preserving, fulfilling
and enjoying the irreplaceable value which is your life.
“Since life requires a specific course of action, any other course will destroy
it. A being who does not hold his own life as the motive and goal of his actions,
is acting on the motive and standard of death. Such a being is a metaphysical
monstrosity, struggling to oppose, negate and contradict the fact of his own
existence, running blindly amuck on a trail of destruction, capable of nothing but
pain.

“Happiness is the successful state of life, pain is an agent of death. Happiness
is that state of consciousness which proceeds from the achievement of one’s
values. A morality that dares to tell you to find happiness in the renunciation of
your happiness—to value the failure of your values—is an insolent negation of
morality. A doctrine that gives you, as an ideal, the role of a sacrificial animal
seeking slaughter on the altars of others, is giving you death as your standard.
By the grace of reality and the nature of life, man—every man—is an end in
himself, he exists for his own sake, and the achievement of his own happiness is
his highest moral purpose.

“But neither life nor happiness can be achieved by the pursuit of irrational
whims. Just as man is free to attempt to survive in any random manner, but will
perish unless he lives as his nature requires, so he is free to seek his happiness in
any mindless fraud, but the torture of frustration is all he will find, unless he
seeks the happiness proper to man. The purpose of morality is to teach you, not
to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live.

“Sweep aside those parasites of subsidized classrooms, who live on the profits
of the mind of others and proclaim that man needs no morality, no values, no
code of behavior. They, who pose as scientists and claim that man is only an
animal, do not grant him inclusion in the law of existence they have granted to
the lowest of insects. They recognize that every living species has a way of
survival demanded by its nature, they do not claim that a fish can live out of
water or that a dog can live without its sense of smell—but man, they claim, the
most complex of beings, man can survive in any way whatever, man has no
identity, no nature, and there’s no practical reason why he cannot live with his
means of survival destroyed, with his mind throttled and placed at the disposal of
any orders they might care to issue.

“Sweep aside those hatred-eaten mystics, who pose as friends of humanity and
preach that the highest virtue man can practice is to hold his own life as of no
value. Do they tell you that the purpose of morality is to curb man’s instinct of
self-preservation? It is for the purpose of self-preservation that man needs a code
of morality. The only man who desires to be moral is the man who desires to
live.
“No, you do not have to live; it is your basic act of choice; but if you choose
to live, you must live as a man—by the work and the judgment of your mind.
“No, you do not have to live as a man; it is an act of moral choice. But you
cannot live as anything else—and the alternative is that state of living death
which you now see within you and around you, the state of a thing unfit for
existence, no longer human and less than animal, a thing that knows nothing but
pain and drags itself through its span of years in the agony of unthinking selfdestruction.
“No, you do not have to think; it is an act of moral choice. But someone had
to think to keep you alive; if you choose to default, you default on existence and
you pass the deficit to some moral man, expecting him to sacrifice his good for
the sake of letting you survive by your evil.
“No, you do not have to be a man; but today those who are, are not there any
longer. I have removed your means of survival—your victims.
“If you wish to know how I have done it and what I told them to make them
quit, you are hearing it now. I told them, in essence, the statement I am making
tonight. They were men who had lived by my code, but had not known how
great a virtue it represented. I made them see it. I brought them, not a reevaluation, but only an identification of their values.

“We, the men of the mind, are now on strike against you in the name of a
single axiom, which is the root of our moral code, just as the root of yours is the
wish to escape it: the axiom that existence exists.
“Existence exists—and the act of grasping that statement implies two
corollary axioms: that something exists which one perceives and that one exists
possessing consciousness, consciousness being the faculty of perceiving that
which exists.

“If nothing exists, there can be no consciousness: a consciousness with
nothing to be conscious of is a contradiction in terms. A consciousness conscious
of nothing but itself is a contradiction in terms: before it could identify itself as
consciousness, it had to be conscious of something. If that which you claim to
perceive does not exist, what you possess is not consciousness.
“Whatever the degree of your knowledge, these two—existence and
consciousness—are axioms you cannot escape, these two are the irreducible
primaries implied in any action you undertake, in any part of your knowledge
and in its sum, from the first ray of light you perceive at the start of your life to
the widest erudition you might acquire at its end. Whether you know the shape
of a pebble or the structure of a solar system, the axioms remain the same: that it
exists and that you know it.

“To exist is to be something, as distinguished from the nothing of nonexistence, it is to be an entity of a specific nature made of specific attributes.

Centuries ago, the man who was—no matter what his errors—the greatest of
your philosophers, has stated the formula defining the concept of existence and
the rule of all knowledge: A is A. A thing is itself. You have never grasped the
meaning of his statement. I am here to complete it: Existence is Identity, Consciousness is Identification.

“Whatever you choose to consider, be it an object, an attribute or an action,
the law of identity remains the same. A leaf cannot be a stone at the same time, it
cannot be all red and all green at the same time, it cannot freeze and burn at the
same time. A is A. Or, if you wish it stated in simpler language: You cannot have
your cake and eat it, too.

“Are you seeking to know what is wrong with the world? All the disasters that
have wrecked your world, came from your leaders’ attempt to evade the fact that
A is A. All the secret evil you dread to face within you and all the pain you have
ever endured, came from your own attempt to evade the fact that A is A. The
purpose of those who taught you to evade it, was to make you forget that Man is
Man.
