While scientists were performing astounding feats of disciplined reason,
breaking down the barriers of the “unknowable” in every field of knowledge,
charting the course of light rays in space or the course of blood in the capillaries
of man’s body—what philosophy was offering them, as interpretation of and
guidance for their achievements, was the plain Witch-doctory of Hegel, who
proclaimed that matter does not exist at all, that everything is Idea (not
somebody’s idea, just Idea), and that this Idea operates by the dialectical process
of a new “super-logic” which proves that contradictions are the law of reality,
that A is non-A, and that omniscience about the physical universe (including
electricity, gravitation, the solar system, etc.) is to be derived, not from the
observation of facts, but from the contemplation of that Idea’s triple somersaults
inside his, Hegel’s, mind. This was offered as a philosophy of reason.

While businessmen were rising to spectacular achievements of creative ability
and self-confidently ambitious courage, challenging the primordial dogma of
man’s poverty and misery on earth, breaking open the trade routes of the world,
releasing mankind’s productive energy and placing in its service the liberating
power of machines (against the scornful resistance of loafing, ex-feudal
aristocrats and the destructive violence of those who were to profit most: the
workers)—what philosophy was offering, as an evaluation of their achievements
and as guidance for the rest of society, was the pure Attila-ism of Marx, who
proclaimed that the mind does not exist, that everything is matter, that matter
develops itself by the dialectical process of its own “super-logic” of
contradictions, and what is true today, will not be true tomorrow, that the
material tools of production determine men’s “ideological superstructure”
(which means: machines create men’s thinking, not the other way around), that
muscular labor is the source of wealth, that physical force is the only practical
means of existence, and that the seizure of the omnipotent machines will transfer
omnipotence to the rule of brute violence. Never had Attila’s psychoepistemology been transcribed so accurately. This was offered as a philosophy of
history and of political economy.

What was offered as philosophical antidote to those who would not accept
these theories?

As a defense against the Witch-doctory of Kant and Hegel, the businessman
was offered the neo-mystic Attila-ism of the Pragmatists. They declared that
philosophy must be practical and that practicality consists of dispensing with all
absolute principles and standards—that there is no such thing as objective reality
or permanent truth—that truth is that which works, and its validity can be judged
only by its consequences—that no facts can be known with certainty in advance,
and anything may be tried by rule-of-thumb—that reality is not firm, but fluid
and “indeterminate,” that there is no such thing as a distinction between an
external world and a consciousness (between the perceived and the perceiver),
there is only an undifferentiated package-deal labeled “experience,” and
whatever one wishes to be true, is true, whatever one wishes to exist, does exist,
provided it works or makes one feel better.

A later school of more Kantian Pragmatists amended this philosophy as
follows. If there is no such thing as an objective reality, men’s metaphysical
choice is whether the selfish, dictatorial whims of an individual or the
democratic whims of a collective are to shape that plastic goo which the ignorant
call “reality”; therefore this school decided that objectivity consists of collective
subjectivism—that knowledge is to be gained by means of public polls among
special elites of “competent investigators” who can “predict and control” reality
—that whatever people wish to be true, is true, whatever people wish to exist,
does exist, and anyone who holds any firm convictions of his own is an arbitrary,
mystic dogmatist, since reality is indeterminate and people determine its actual
nature.

The scientist was offered a slightly different version of philosophy. As a
defense against the Witch-doctory of Hegel, who claimed universal omniscience,
the scientist was offered the combined neo-mystic Witch-doctory and Attila-ism
of the Logical Positivists. They assured him that such concepts as metaphysics
or existence or reality or thing or matter or mind are meaningless—let the
mystics care whether they exist or not, a scientist does not have to know it; the
task of theoretical science is the manipulation of symbols, and scientists are the
special elite whose symbols have the magic power of making reality conform to
their will (“matter is that which fits mathematical equations”). Knowledge, they
said, consists, not of facts, but of words, words unrelated to objects, words of an
arbitrary social convention, as an irreducible primary; thus knowledge is merely
a matter of manipulating language. The job of scientists, they said, is not the
study of reality, but the creation of arbitrary constructs by means of arbitrary
sounds, and any construct is as valid as another, since the criterion of validity is
only “convenience” and the definition of science is “that which the scientists
do.” 

But this omnipotent power, surpassing the dreams of ancient numerologists
or of medieval alchemists, was granted to the scientist by philosophical Attilaism on two conditions: a. that he never claim certainty for his knowledge, since certainty is unknowable to man, and that he claim, instead, “percentages of
probability,” not troubling himself with such questions as how one calculates
percentages of the unknowable; b. that he claim as absolute knowledge the
proposition that all values lie outside the sphere of science, that reason is
impotent to deal with morality, that moral values are a matter of subjective
choice, dictated by one’s feelings, not one’s mind.
The great treason of the philosophers was that they never stepped out of the
Middle Ages: they never challenged the Witch Doctor’s code of morality. They
were willing to doubt the existence of physical objects, they were willing to
doubt the validity of their own senses, they were willing to defy the authority of
absolute monarchies, they were willing (occasionally) to proclaim themselves to
be skeptics or agnostics or atheists—but they were not willing to doubt the
doctrine that man is a sacrificial animal, that he has no right to exist for his own
sake, that service to others is the only justification of his existence and that selfsacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue and value.

Under all its countless guises, variations and adaptations, that doctrine—best
designated as the morality of altruism—has come from prehistoric swamps to
New York City, unchanged. In savage societies, men practiced the ritual of
human sacrifices, immolating individual men on sacrificial altars, for the sake of
what they regarded as their collective, tribal good. Today, they are still doing it,
only the agony is slower and the slaughter greater—but the doctrine that
demands it and sanctions it, is the same doctrine of moral cannibalism.
The philosophers preserved it, by leaving the subject of morality to the
mystics—or by consigning it to the province of subjective feelings, which
means: to the mystics—or by the vehement rejection of reason’s capacity to deal
with moral values and the branding of all value-judgments as “unscientific,”
which means: the re-affirmation and perpetuation of the mystics’ monopoly on
morality—or, worst of all, by accepting the mystics’ moral code in its irrational
entirety, then translating it into earthly terms and propagating it in the name of reason.

The convolutions of this last attempt provide what is, perhaps, the most
grotesquely terrible chapter in the history of Western thought. The political “metoo-ism,” abjectly displayed by the “conservatives” of today toward their
brazenly socialistic adversaries, is only the result and the feeble reflection of the
ethical “me-too-ism” displayed by the philosophers of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, by the alleged champions of reason, toward the Witch
Doctors of morality.

Auguste Comte, the founder of Positivism, the champion of science,
advocated a “rational,” “scientific” social system based on the total subjugation
of the individual to the collective, including a “Religion of Humanity” which
substituted Society for the Gods or gods who collect the blood of sacrificial
victims. It is not astonishing that Comte was the coiner of the term Altruism,
which means: the placing of others above self, of their interests above one’s
own.

Nietzsche’s rebellion against altruism consisted of replacing the sacrifice of
oneself to others by the sacrifice of others to oneself. He proclaimed that the
ideal man is moved, not by reason, but by his “blood,” by his innate instincts,
feelings and will to power—that he is predestined by birth to rule others and
sacrifice them to himself, while they are predestined by birth to be his victims
and slaves—that reason, logic, principles are futile and debilitating, that morality
is useless, that the “superman” is “beyond good and evil,” that he is a “beast of
prey” whose ultimate standard is nothing but his own whim. Thus Nietzsche’s
rejection of the Witch Doctor consisted of elevating Attila into a moral ideal—
which meant: a double surrender of morality to the Witch Doctor.
Jeremy Bentham, the champion of capitalism, defended it by proclaiming “the
greatest happiness of the greatest number” as its moral justification—and pro-
pounded a “hedonistic calculus” for men’s moral guidance, which enunciated the
principle that before taking any action one must consider all the possible forms
and amounts of happiness and unhappiness to accrue to all the people possibly to
be affected by the consequences of one’s action (including oneself as one unit
among the dozens or hundreds or millions), one must compute them all, then act
accordingly and sacrifice the “hedonistic” minority to the majority.
Herbert Spencer, another champion of capitalism, chose to decide that the
theory of evolution and of adaptation to environment was the key to man’s
morality—and declared that the moral justification of capitalism was the survival
of the species, of the human race; that whoever was of no value to the race, had
to perish; that man’s morality consisted of adapting oneself to one’s social
environment, and seeking one’s own happiness in the welfare of society; and that
the automatic processes of evolution would eventually obliterate the distinction
between selfishness and unselfishness.
