<!-- You grew up to believe that moral laws bear no relation to the job of living,
except as an impediment and threat, that man’s existence is an amoral jungle
where anything goes and anything works. And in that fog of switching
definitions which descends upon a frozen mind, you have forgotten that the evils
damned by your creed were the virtues required for living, and you have come to
believe that actual evils are the practical means of existence. Forgetting that the
impractical ‘good’ was self-sacrifice, you believe that self-esteem is impractical;
forgetting that the practical ‘evil’ was production, you believe that robbery is
practical.

“Swinging like a helpless branch in the wind of an uncharted moral
wilderness, you dare not fully to be evil or fully to live. When you are honest,
you feel the resentment of a sucker; when you cheat, you feel terror and shame.
When you are happy, your joy is diluted by guilt; when you suffer, your pain is
augmented by the feeling that pain is your natural state. You pity the men you
admire, you believe they are doomed to fail; you envy the men you hate, you
believe they are the masters of existence. You feel disarmed when you come up
against a scoundrel: you believe that evil is bound to win, since the moral is the
impotent, the impractical. -->

Morality to you is a phantom scarecrow made of duty, boredom, punishment since pleasure cannot be moral.

 <!-- of pain, a cross-breed between the first schoolteacher of your past and the tax collector of your present, a scarecrow standing in a barren field, waving a stick to chase away your pleasures—and pleasure, to you, is a liquorsoggy brain, a mindless slut, the stupor of a moron who stakes his cash on some animal’s race,  -->

If you identify your actual belief, you will find a triple damnation—of yourself, of life, of virtue—in the grotesque conclusion you have reached: you believe that morality is a necessary evil.

Do you wonder why you live without dignity, love without fire and die
without resistance? Do you wonder why, wherever you look, you see nothing but
unanswerable questions, why your life is torn by impossible conflicts, why you
spend it straddling irrational fences to evade artificial choices, such as soul or
body, mind or heart, security or freedom, private profit or public good?
“Do you cry that you find no answers? By what means did you hope to find
them? You reject your tool of perception—your mind—then complain that the
universe is a mystery. You discard your key, then wail that all doors are locked
against you. You start out in pursuit of the irrational, then damn existence for
making no sense.

“The fence you have been straddling for two hours—while hearing my words
and seeking to escape them—is the coward’s formula contained in the sentence:
‘But we don’t have to go to extremes!’ The extreme you have always struggled
to avoid is the recognition that reality is final, that A is A and that the truth is
true. 

A moral code impossible to practice, a code that demands imperfection or
death, has taught you to dissolve all ideas in fog, to permit no firm definitions, to
regard any concept as approximate and any rule of conduct as elastic, to hedge
on any principle, to compromise on any value, to take the middle of any road. By
extorting your acceptance of supernatural absolutes, it has forced you to reject
the absolute of nature. By making moral judgments impossible, it has made you
incapable of rational judgment. A code that forbids you to cast the first stone, has
forbidden you to admit the identity of stones and to know when or if you’re
being stoned.

“The man who refuses to judge, who neither agrees nor disagrees, who
declares that there are no absolutes and believes that he escapes responsibility, is
the man responsible for all the blood that is now spilled in the world. Reality is
an absolute, existence is an absolute, a speck of dust is an absolute and so is a
human life. Whether you live or die is an absolute. Whether you have a piece of
bread or not, is an absolute. Whether you eat your bread or see it vanish into a
looter’s stomach, is an absolute.

“There are two sides to every issue: one side is right and the other is wrong,
but the middle is always evil. The man who is wrong still retains some respect
for truth, if only by accepting the responsibility of choice. But the man in the
middle is the knave who blanks out the truth in order to pretend that no choice or
values exist, who is willing to sit out the course of any battle, willing to cash in
on the blood of the innocent or to crawl on his belly to the guilty, who dispenses
justice by condemning both the robber and the robbed to jail, who solves
conflicts by ordering the thinker and the fool to meet each other halfway. In any
compromise between food and poison, it is only death that can win. In any
compromise between good and evil, it is only evil that can profit. In that
transfusion of blood which drains the good to feed the evil, the compromiser is
the transmitting rubber tube.

“You, who are half-rational, half-coward, have been playing a con game with
reality, but the victim you have conned is yourself. When men reduce their
virtues to the approximate, then evil acquires the force of an absolute, when
loyalty to an unyielding purpose is dropped by the virtuous, it’s picked up by
scoundrels—and you get the indecent spectacle of a cringing, bargaining,
traitorous good and a self-righteously uncompromising evil. As you surrendered
to the mystics of muscle when they told you that ignorance consists of claiming
knowledge, so now you surrender to them when they shriek that immorality
consists of pronouncing moral judgment. When they yell that it is selfish to be
certain that you are right, you hasten to assure them that you’re certain of
nothing. 

When they shout that it’s immoral to stand on your convictions, you
assure them that you have no convictions whatever. When the thugs of Europe’s
People’s States snarl that you are guilty of intolerance, because you don’t treat
your desire to live and their desire to kill you as a difference of opinion—you
cringe and hasten to assure them that you are not intolerant of any horror. When
some barefoot bum in some pesthole of Asia yells at you: How dare you be rich
—you apologize and beg him to be patient and promise him you’ll give it all
away.

“You have reached the blind alley of the treason you committed when you
agreed that you had no right to exist. Once, you believed it was ‘only a
compromise’: you conceded it was evil to live for yourself, but moral to live for
the sake of your children. Then you conceded that it was selfish to live for your
children, but moral to live for your community. Then you conceded that it was
selfish to live for your community, but moral to live for your country. Now, you
are letting this greatest of countries be devoured by any scum from any corner of
the earth, while you concede that it is selfish to live for your country and that
your moral duty is to live for the globe. A man who has no right to life, has no
right to values and will not keep them.

“At the end of your road of successive betrayals, stripped of weapons, of
certainty, of honor, you commit your final act of treason and sign your petition of
intellectual bankruptcy: while the muscle-mystics of the People’s States
proclaim that they’re the champions of reason and science, you agree and hasten
to proclaim that faith is your cardinal principle, that reason is on the side of your
destroyers, but yours is the side of faith. To the struggling remnants of rational
honesty in the twisted, bewildered minds of your children, you declare that you
can offer no rational argument to support the ideas that created this country, that
there is no rational justification for freedom, for property, for justice, for rights,
that they rest on a mystical insight and can be accepted only on faith, that in
reason and logic the enemy is right, but faith is superior to reason. You declare to
your children that it is rational to loot, to torture, to enslave, to expropriate, to
murder, but that they must resist the temptations of logic and stick to the
discipline of remaining irrational—that skyscrapers, factories, radios, airplanes
were the products of faith and mystic intuition, while famines, concentration
camps and firing squads are the products of a reasonable manner of existence—
that the industrial revolution was the revolt of the men of faith against that era of
reason and logic which is known as the Middle Ages. 


You declare that the looters who rule the People’s States will surpass this country in material production, since they are the
representatives of science, but that it’s evil to be concerned with physical wealth
and that one must renounce material prosperity—you declare that the looters’
ideals are noble, but they do not mean them, while you do; that your purpose in
fighting the looters is only to accomplish their aims, which they cannot
accomplish, but you can; and that the way to fight them is to beat them to it and
give one’s wealth away. 

Then you wonder why your children join the People’s thugs or become half-crazed delinquents, you wonder why the looters’ conquests keep creeping closer to your doors—and you blame it on human stupidity,
declaring that the masses are impervious to reason.

“You blank out the open, public spectacle of the looters’ fight against the
mind, and the fact that their bloodiest horrors are unleashed to punish the crime
of thinking. You blank out the fact that most mystics of muscle started out as
mystics of spirit, that they keep switching from one to the other, that the men
you call materialists and spiritualists are only two halves of the same dissected
human, forever seeking completion, but seeking it by swinging from the
destruction of the flesh to the destruction of the soul and vice versa—that they
keep running from your colleges to the slave pens of Europe to an open collapse
into the mystic muck of India, seeking any refuge against reality, any form of
escape from the mind.

“You blank it out and cling to your hypocrisy of ‘faith’ in order to blank out
the knowledge that the looters have a stranglehold upon you, which consists of
your moral code—that the looters are the final and consistent practitioners of the
morality you’re half-obeying, half-evading—that they practice it the only way it
can be practiced: by turning the earth into a sacrificial furnace—that your
morality forbids you to oppose them in the only way they can be opposed: by
refusing to become a sacrificial animal and proudly asserting your right to exist
—that in order to fight them to the finish and with full rectitude, it is your
morality that you have to reject.

“You blank it out, because your self-esteem is tied to that mystic
‘unselfishness’ which you’ve never possessed or practiced, but spent so many
years pretending to possess that the thought of denouncing it fills you with terror.
No value is higher than self-esteem, but you’ve invested it in counterfeit
securities—and now your morality has caught you in a trap where you are forced
to protect your self-esteem by fighting for the creed of self-destruction. The grim
joke is on you: that need of self-esteem, which you’re unable to explain or to
define, belongs to my morality, not yours; it’s the objective token of my code, it
is my proof within your own soul.
