This is the explanation given by a distinguished brain surgeon of why he joined
Galt’s strike.

“I quit when medicine was placed under State control, some years ago,” said
Dr. Hendricks. “Do you know what it takes to perform a brain operation? Do you
know the kind of skill it demands, and the years of passionate, merciless,
excruciating devotion that go to acquire that skill? That was what I would not
place at the disposal of men whose sole qualification to rule me was their
capacity to spout the fraudulent generalities that got them elected to the privilege
of enforcing their wishes at the point of a gun. I would not let them dictate the
purpose for which my years of study had been spent, or the conditions of my
work, or my choice of patients, or the amount of my reward. I observed that in
all the discussions that preceded the enslavement of medicine, men discussed
everything—except the desires of the doctors. Men considered only the ‘welfare’
of the patients, with no thought for those who were to provide it. That a doctor
should have any right, desire or choice in the matter, was regarded as irrelevant
selfishness; his is not to choose, they said, only ‘to serve.’ That a man who’s
willing to work under compulsion is too dangerous a brute to entrust with a job
in the stockyards—never occurred to those who proposed to help the sick by
making life impossible for the healthy. I have often wondered at the smugness
with which people assert their right to enslave me, to control my work, to force
my will, to violate my conscience, to stifle my mind—yet what is it that they
expect to depend on, when they lie on an operating table under my hands? Their
moral code has taught them to believe that it is safe to rely on the virtue of their
victims. Well, that is the virtue I have withdrawn. Let them discover the kind of
doctors that their system will now produce. Let them discover, in their operating
rooms and hospital wards, that it is not safe to place their lives in the hands of a
man whose life they have throttled. It is not safe, if he is the sort of man who
resents it—and still less safe, if he is the sort who doesn’t.”
THE NATURE OF AN ARTIST
This is an excerpt from a conversation between Dagny Taggart, the heroine of
the story, and Richard Halley, a great composer, who is now on strike.
“Miss Taggart, how many people are there to whom my work means as much
as it does to you? . . . That is the payment I demand. Not many can afford it. I
don’t mean your enjoyment, I don’t mean your emotion—emotions be damned!
—I mean your understanding and the fact that your enjoyment was of the same
nature as mine, that it came from the same source: from your intelligence, from
the conscious judgment of a mind able to judge my work by the standard of the
same values that went to write it—I mean, not the fact that you felt, but that you
felt what I wished you to feel, not the fact that you admire my work, but that you
admire it for the things I wished to be admired. . . . There’s only one passion in
most artists more violent than their desire for admiration: their fear of identifying
the nature of such admiration as they do receive. But it’s a fear I’ve never
shared. I do not fool myself about my work or the response I seek—I value both
too highly. I do not care to be admired causelessly, emotionally, intuitively,
instinctively—or blindly. I do not care for blindness in any form, I have too
much to show—or for deafness, I have too much to say. I do not care to be
admired by anyone’s heart—only by someone’s head. And when I find a
customer with that invaluable capacity, then my performance is a mutual trade to
mutual profit. An artist is a trader, Miss Taggart, the hardest and most exacting
of all traders. . . .

“Do you see why I’d give three dozen modern artists for one real
businessman? . . . Whether it’s a symphony or a coal mine, all work is an act of
creating and comes from the same source: from an inviolate capacity to see
through one’s own eyes—which means: the capacity to perform a rational
identification—which means: the capacity to see, to connect and to make what
had not been seen, connected and made before. That shining vision which they
talk about as belonging to the authors of symphonies and novels—what do they
think is the driving faculty of men who discover how to use oil, how to run a
mine, how to build an electric motor? That sacred fire which is said to burn
within musicians and poets—what do they suppose moves an industrialist to
defy the whole world for the sake of his new metal, as the inventors of the
airplane, the builders of the railroads, the discoverers of new germs or new
continents have done through all the ages? . . . An intransigent devotion to the
pursuit of truth, Miss Taggart? Have you heard the moralists and the art lovers of
the centuries talk about the artist’s intransigent devotion to the pursuit of truth?
Name me a greater example of such devotion than the act of a man who says that
the earth does turn, or the act of a man who says that an alloy of steel and copper
has certain properties which enable it to do certain things, that it is and does—
and let the world rack him or ruin him, he will not bear false witness to the
evidence of his mind! This, Miss Taggart, this sort of spirit, courage and love for
truth—as against a sloppy bum who goes around proudly assuring you that he
has almost reached the perfection of a lunatic, because he’s an artist who hasn’t
the faintest idea what his art work is or means, he’s not restrained by such crude
concepts as ‘being’ or ‘meaning,’ he’s the vehicle of higher mysteries, he doesn’t
know how he created his work or why, it just came out of him spontaneously,
like vomit out of a drunkard, he did not think, he wouldn’t stoop to thinking, he
just felt it, all he has to do is feel—he feels, the flabby, loose-mouthed, shiftyeyed, drooling, shivering, uncongealed bastard! I, who know what discipline,
what effort, what tension of mind, what unrelenting strain upon one’s power of
clarity are needed to produce a work of art—I, who know that it requires a labor
which makes a chain gang look like rest and a severity no army-drilling sadist
could impose—I’ll take the operator of a coal mine over any walking vehicle of
higher mysteries. The operator knows that it’s not his feelings that keep the coal
carts moving under the earth—and he knows what does keep them moving.
Feelings? Oh yes, we do feel, he, you and I—we are, in fact, the only people
capable of feeling—and we know where our feelings come from. But what we
did not know and have delayed learning for too long is the nature of those who
claim that they cannot account for their feelings. We did not know what it is that
they feel. We are learning it now. It was a costly error. And those most guilty of
it, will pay the hardest price—as, in justice, they must. Those most guilty of it
were the real artists, who will now see that they are first to be exterminated and
that they had prepared the triumph of their own exterminators by helping to
destroy their only protectors. For if there is more tragic a fool than the
businessman who doesn’t know that he’s an exponent of man’s highest creative
spirit—it’s the artist who thinks that the businessman is his enemy.”
