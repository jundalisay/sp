We the Living

This novel was published in 1936 and reissued in 1959. Its theme is: the
individual against the state; the supreme value of a human life and the evil of the
totalitarian state that claims the right to sacrifice it. The story takes place in
Soviet Russia. The excerpt below is the speech of Kira Argounova to Andrei
Taganov, in the following context: Kira has been having a love affair with Andrei
in order to obtain money to save the life of Leo Kovalensky, the man she loves;
Andrei, an idealistic young Communist, who is profoundly in love with her, was
beginning to discover the importance of personal values, when, in the course of
arresting Leo for a political crime, he learns the truth about Kira’s relationship
to both of them.

“No, you didn’t know. But it was very simple. And not very unusual. Go
through the garrets and basements where men live in your Red cities and see
how many cases like this you can find. He wanted to live. You think everything
that breathes can live? You’ve learned differently, I know. But he was one who
could have lived. There aren’t many of them, so they don’t count with you. The
doctor said he was going to die. And I loved him. You’ve learned what that
means, too, haven’t you? He didn’t need much. Only rest, and fresh air, and
food. He had no right to that, had he? Your State said so. We tried to beg. We
begged humbly. Do you know what they said? There was a doctor in a hospital
and he said he had hundreds on his waiting list. . . .

“You see, you must understand this thoroughly. No one does. No one sees it,
but I do, I can’t help it, I see it, you must see it, too. You understand? Hundreds.
Thousands. Millions. Millions of what? Stomachs, and heads, and legs, and
tongues, and souls. And it doesn’t even matter whether they fit together. Just
millions. Just flesh. Human flesh. And they—it—had been registered and
numbered, you know, like tin cans on a store shelf. I wonder if they’re registered
by the person or by the pound? And they had a chance to go on living. But not
Leo. He was only a man. All stones are cobblestones to you. And diamonds—
they’re useless, because they sparkle too brightly in the sun, and it’s too hard on
the eyes, and it’s too hard under the hoofs marching into the proletarian future.
You don’t pave roads with diamonds. They may have other uses in the world, but
of those you’ve never learned. That is why you had sentenced him to death, and
others like him, an execution without a firing squad. There was a big commissar
and I went to see him. He told me that a hundred thousand workers had died in
the civil war and why couldn’t one aristocrat die—in the face of the Union of
Socialist Soviet Republics? And what is the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics
in the face of one man? But that is a question not for you to answer. I’m grateful
to that commissar. He gave me permission to do what I’ve done. I don’t hate
him. You should hate him. What I’m doing to you—he did it first! . . .
“That’s the question, you know, don’t you? Why can’t one aristocrat die in the
face of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics? You don’t understand that, do
you? 

You and your great commissar, and a million others, like you, like him,
that’s what you brought to the world, that question and your answer to it! A great
gift, isn’t it? But one of you has been paid. I paid it. In you and to you. For all
the sorrow your comrades brought to a living world. How do you like it,
Comrade Andrei Taganov of the All-Union Communist Party? If you taught us
that our life is nothing before that of the State—well then, are you really
suffering? If I brought you to the last hell of despair—well then, why don’t you
say that one’s own life doesn’t really matter? . . . You loved a woman and she
threw your love in your face? But the proletarian mines in the Don Basin have
produced a hundred tons of coal last month! You had two altars and you saw
suddenly that a harlot stood on one of them, and Citizen Morozov on the other?
But the Proletarian State has exported ten thousand bushels of wheat last month!
You’ve had every beam knocked from under your life? But the Proletarian
Republic is building a new electric plant on the Volga! Why don’t you smile and
sing hymns to the toil of the Collective? It’s still there, your Collective. Go and
join it. Did anything really happen to you? It’s nothing but a personal problem of
a private life, the kind that only the dead old world could worry about, isn’t it?
Don’t you have something greater—greater is the word your comrades use—left
to live for? Or do you, Comrade Taganov? . . .

“Now look at me! Take a good look! I was born and I knew I was alive and I
knew what I wanted. What do you think is alive in me? Why do you think I’m
alive? Because I have a stomach and eat and digest the food? Because I breathe
and work and produce more food to digest? Or because I know what I want, and
that something which knows how to want—isn’t that life itself? And who—in
this damned universe—who can tell me why I should live for anything but for
that which I want? Who can answer that in human sounds that speak for human
reason? . . . But you’ve tried to tell us what we should want. You came as a
solemn army to bring a new life to men. You tore that life you knew nothing
about, out of their guts—and you told them what it had to be. You took their
every hour, every minute, every nerve, every thought in the farthest corners of
their souls—and you told them what it had to be. You came and you forbade life
to the living. You’ve driven us all into an iron cellar and you’ve closed all doors,
and you’ve locked us airtight, airtight till the blood vessels of our spirits burst!
Then you stare and wonder what it’s doing to us. Well, then, look! All of you
who have eyes left—look!”
Anthem

This novelette was first published in England in 1938. Its theme is: the meaning
of man’s ego. It projects a society of the future, which has accepted total
collectivism with all of its ultimate consequences: men have relapsed into
primitive savagery and stagnation; the word “I” has vanished from the human
language, there are no singular pronouns, a man refers to himself as “we” and
to another man as “they.” The story presents the gradual rediscovery of the
word “I” by a man of intransigent mind. The following excerpt is from his
statement about his discovery.

“I am. I think. I will. . . .
“What must I say besides? These are the words. This is the answer.
“I stand here on the summit of the mountain. I lift my head and I spread my
arms. This—my body and spirit—this is the end of the quest. I wished to know
the meaning of things. I am the meaning. I wished to find a warrant for being. I
need no warrant for being, and no word of sanction upon my being. I am the
warrant and the sanction. . . .
“I know not if this earth on which I stand is the core of the universe or if it is
but a speck of dust lost in eternity. I know not and I care not. For I know what
happiness is possible to me on earth. And my happiness needs no higher aim to
vindicate it. My happiness is not the means to any end. It is the end. It is its own
goal. It is its own purpose.
“Neither am I the means to any end others may wish to accomplish. I am not a
tool for their use. I am not a servant of their needs. I am not a bandage for their
wounds. I am not a sacrifice on their altars. . . .
“I owe nothing to my brothers, nor do I gather debts from them. I ask none to
live for me, nor do I live for any others. I covet no man’s soul, nor is my soul
theirs to covet.
“I am neither foe nor friend to my brothers, but such as each of them shall
deserve of me. And to earn my love, my brothers must do more than to have
been born. I do not grant my love without reason, nor to any chance passer-by
who may wish to claim it. I honor men with my love. But honor is a thing to be
earned.

“I shall choose friends among men, but neither slaves nor masters. And I shall
choose only such as please me, and them I shall love and respect, but neither
command nor obey. And we shall join our hands when we wish, or walk alone
when we so desire. For in the temple of his spirit, each man is alone. Let each
man keep his temple untouched and undefiled. Then let him join hands with
others if he wishes, but only beyond his holy threshold.
“For the word ‘We’ must never be spoken, save by one’s choice and as a
second thought. This word must never be placed first within man’s soul, else it
becomes a monster, the root of all the evils on earth, the root of man’s torture by
men, and of an unspeakable lie.

“The word ‘We’ is as lime poured over men, which sets and hardens to stone,
and crushes all beneath it, and that which is white and that which is black are
lost equally in the gray of it. It is the word by which the depraved steal the virtue
of the good, by which the weak steal the might of the strong, by which the fools
steal the wisdom of the sages.

“What is my joy if all hands, even the unclean, can reach into it? What is my
wisdom, if even the fools can dictate to me? What is my freedom, if all
creatures, even the botched and the impotent, are my masters? What is my life, if
I am but to bow, to agree and to obey?
“But I am done with this creed of corruption.
“I am done with the monster of ‘We,’ the word of serfdom, of plunder, of
misery, falsehood and shame.
“And now I see the face of god, and I raise this god over the earth, this god
whom men have sought since men came into being, this god who will grant them
joy and peace and pride.
“This god, this one word: I.”
