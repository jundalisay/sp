An animal has no critical faculty; he has no control over the function of his
brain and no power to question its content. To an animal, whatever strikes his
awareness is an absolute that corresponds to reality—or rather, it is a distinction
he is incapable of making: reality, to him, is whatever he senses or feels. And
this is the Witch Doctor’s epistemological ideal, the mode of consciousness he
strives to induce in himself. To the Witch Doctor, emotions are tools of
cognition, and wishes take precedence over facts. He seeks to escape the risks of
a quest for knowledge by obliterating the distinction between consciousness and
reality, between the perceiver and the perceived, hoping that an automatic
certainty and an infallible knowledge of the universe will be granted to him by
the blind, unfocused stare of his eyes turned inward, contemplating the
sensations, the feelings, the urgings, the muggy associational twistings projected
by the rudderless mechanism of his undirected consciousness. Whatever his
mechanism produces is an absolute not to be questioned; and whenever it clashes
with reality, it is reality that he ignores.

Since the clash is constant, the Witch Doctor’s solution is to believe that what
he perceives is another, “higher” reality—where his wishes are omnipotent,
where contradictions are possible and A is non-A, where his assertions, which
are false on earth, become true and acquire the status of a “superior” truth which
he perceives by means of a special faculty denied to other, “inferior,” beings.
The only validation of his consciousness he can obtain on earth is the belief and
the obedience of others, when they accept his “truth” as superior to their own
perception of reality. While Attila extorts their obedience by means of a club, the
Witch Doctor obtains it by means of a much more powerful weapon: he preempts the field of morality.
There is no way to turn morality into a weapon of enslavement except by
divorcing it from man’s reason and from the goals of his own existence. There is
no way to degrade man’s life on earth except by the lethal opposition of the
moral and the practical. Morality is a code of values to guide man’s choices and
actions; when it is set to oppose his own life and mind, it makes him turn against
himself and blindly act as the tool of his own destruction. There is no way to
make a human being accept the role of a sacrificial animal except by destroying
his self-esteem. There is no way to destroy his self-esteem except by making him
reject his own consciousness. There is no way to make him reject his own
consciousness except by convincing him of its impotence.

The damnation of this earth as a realm where nothing is possible to man but
pain, disaster and defeat, a realm inferior to another, “higher,” reality; the
damnation of all values, enjoyment, achievement and success on earth as a proof
of depravity; the damnation of man’s mind as a source of pride, and the
damnation of reason as a “limited,” deceptive, unreliable, impotent faculty,
incapable of perceiving the “real” reality and the “true” truth; the split of man in
two, setting his consciousness (his soul) against his body, and his moral values
against his own interest; the damnation of man’s nature, body and self as evil;
the commandment of self-sacrifice, renunciation, suffering, obedience, humility
and faith, as the good; the damnation of life and the worship of death, with the
promise of rewards beyond the grave—these are the necessary tenets of the
Witch Doctor’s view of existence, as they have been in every variant of Witch
Doctor philosophy throughout the course of mankind’s history.
The secret of the Witch Doctor’s power lies in the fact that man needs an
integrated view of life, a philosophy, whether he is aware of his need or not—
and whenever, through ignorance, cowardice or mental sloth, men choose not to
be aware of it, their chronic sense of guilt, uncertainty and terror makes them
feel that the Witch Doctor’s philosophy is true.

The first to feel it is Attila.

The man who lives by brute force, at the whim and mercy of the moment,
lives on a narrow island suspended in a fog of the unknown, where invisible
threats and unpredictable disasters can descend upon him any morning. He is
willing to surrender his consciousness to the man who offers him protection
against those intangible questions which he does not wish to consider, yet
dreads.

Attila’s fear of reality is as great as the Witch Doctor’s. Both hold their
consciousness on a subhuman level and method of functioning: Attila’s brain is a
jumble of concretes unintegrated by abstractions; the Witch Doctor’s brain is a
miasma of floating abstractions unrelated to concretes. Both are guided and
motivated—ultimately—not by thoughts, but by feelings and whims. Both cling
to their whims as to their only certainty. Both feel secretly inadequate to the task
of dealing with existence.

Thus they come to need each other. Attila feels that the Witch Doctor can give
him what he lacks: a long-range view, an insurance against the dark unknown of
tomorrow or next week or next year, a code of moral values to sanction his
actions and to disarm his victims. The Witch Doctor feels that Attila can give
him the material means of survival, can protect him from physical reality, can
spare him the necessity of practical action, and can enforce his mystic edicts on
any recalcitrant who may choose to challenge his authority. Both of them are
incomplete parts of a human being, who seek completion in each other: the man
of muscle and the man of feelings, seeking to exist without mind.
Since no man can fully escape the conceptual level of consciousness, it is not
the case that Attila and the Witch Doctor cannot or do not think; they can and do
—but thinking, to them, is not a means of perceiving reality, it is a means of
justifying their escape from the necessity of rational perception. Reason, to them,
is a means of defeating their victims, a menial servant charged with the task of
rationalizing the metaphysical validity and power of their whims. Just as a bank
robber will spend years of planning, ingenuity and effort in order to prove to
himself that he can exist without effort, so both Attila and the Witch Doctor will
go to any length of cunning, calculation and thought in order to demonstrate the
impotence of thought and preserve the image of a pliable universe where
miracles are possible and whims are efficacious. The power of ideas has no
reality for either of them, and neither cares to learn that the proof of that power
lies in his own chronic sense of guilt and terror.
Thus Attila and the Witch Doctor form an alliance and divide their respective
domains. Attila rules the realm of men’s physical existence—the Witch Doctor
rules the realm of men’s consciousness. Attila herds men into armies—the Witch
Doctor sets the armies’ goals. Attila conquers empires—the Witch Doctor writes
their laws. Attila loots and plunders—the Witch Doctor exhorts the victims to
surpass their selfish concern with material property. Attila slaughters—the Witch
Doctor proclaims to the survivors that scourges are a retribution for their sins.
Attila rules by means of fear, by keeping men under a constant threat of
destruction—the Witch Doctor rules by means of guilt, by keeping men
convinced of their innate depravity, impotence and insignificance. Attila turns
men’s life on earth into a living hell—the Witch Doctor tells them that it could
not be otherwise.

But the alliance of the two rulers is precarious: it is based on mutual fear and
mutual contempt. Attila is an extrovert, resentful of any concern with
consciousness—the Witch Doctor is an introvert, resentful of any concern with
physical existence. Attila professes scorn for values, ideals, principles, theories,
abstractions—the Witch Doctor professes scorn for material property, for wealth,
for man’s body, for this earth. Attila considers the Witch Doctor unpractical—the
Witch Doctor considers Attila immoral. But, secretly, each of them believes that
the other possesses a mysterious faculty he lacks, that the other is the true master
of reality, the true exponent of the power to deal with existence. In terms, not of
thought, but of chronic anxiety, it is the Witch Doctor who believes that brute
force rules the world—and it is Attila who believes in the supernatural; his name
for it is “fate” or “luck.”

Against whom is this alliance formed? Against those men whose existence
and character both Attila and the Witch Doctor refuse to admit into their view of
the universe: the men who produce. In any age or society, there are men who
think and work, who discover how to deal with existence, how to produce the
intellectual and the material values it requires. These are the men whose effort is
the only means of survival for the parasites of all varieties: the Attilas, the Witch
Doctors and the human ballast. The ballast consists of those who go through life
in a state of unfocused stupor, merely repeating the words and the motions they
learned from others. But the men from whom they learn, the men who are first to
discover any scrap of new knowledge, are the men who deal with reality, with
the task of conquering nature, and who, to that extent, assume the responsibility
of cognition: of exercising their rational faculty.
A producer is any man who works and knows what he is doing. He may
function on a fully human, conceptual level of awareness only some part of his
time, but, to that extent, he is the Atlas who supports the existence of mankind;
he may spend the rest of his time in an unthinking daze, like the others, and, to
that extent, he is the exploited, drained, tortured, self-destroying victim of their
schemes.
