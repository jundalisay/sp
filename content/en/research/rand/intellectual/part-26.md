“And that is the whole of their shabby secret. The secret of all their esoteric
philosophies, of all their dialectics and super-senses, of their evasive eyes and
snarling words, the secret for which they destroy civilization, language,
industries and lives, the secret for which they pierce their own eyes and
eardrums, grind out their senses, blank out their minds, the purpose for which
they dissolve the absolutes of reason, logic, matter, existence, reality—is to erect
upon that plastic fog a single holy absolute: their Wish.

“The restriction they seek to escape is the law of identity. The freedom they
seek is freedom from the fact that an A will remain an A, no matter what their
tears or tantrums—that a river will not bring them milk, no matter what their
hunger—that water will not run uphill, no matter what comforts they could gain
if it did, and if they want to lift it to the roof of a skyscraper, they must do it by a
process of thought and labor, in which the nature of an inch of pipeline counts,
but their feelings do not—that their feelings are impotent to alter the course of a
single speck of dust in space or the nature of any action they have committed.
“Those who tell you that man is unable to perceive a reality undistorted by his
senses, mean that they are unwilling to perceive a reality undistorted by their
feelings. ‘Things as they are’ are things as perceived by your mind; divorce them
from reason and they become ‘things as perceived by your wishes.’

“There is no honest revolt against reason—and when you accept any part of
their creed, your motive is to get away with something your reason would not
permit you to attempt. The freedom you seek is freedom from the fact that if you
stole your wealth, you are a scoundrel, no matter how much you give to charity
or how many prayers you recite—that if you sleep with sluts, you’re not a
worthy husband, no matter how anxiously you feel that you love your wife next
morning—that you are an entity, not a series of random pieces scattered through
a universe where nothing sticks and nothing commits you to anything, the
universe of a child’s nightmare where identities switch and swim, where the
rotter and the hero are interchangeable parts arbitrarily assumed at will—that
you are a man—that you are an entity—that you are.

“No matter how eagerly you claim that the goal of your mystic wishing is a
higher mode of life, the rebellion against identity is the wish for non-existence.
The desire not to be anything is the desire not to be.
“Your teachers, the mystics of both schools, have reversed causality in their
consciousness, then strive to reverse it in existence. They take their emotions as
a cause, and their mind as a passive effect. They make their emotions their tool
for perceiving reality. They hold their desires as an irreducible primary, as a fact
superseding all facts. An honest man does not desire until he has identified the
object of his desire. He says: ‘It is, therefore I want it.’ They say: ‘I want it,
therefore it is.’

“They want to cheat the axiom of existence and consciousness, they want their
consciousness to be an instrument not of perceiving but of creating existence,
and existence to be not the object but the subject of their consciousness—they
want to be that God they created in their image and likeness, who creates a
universe out of a void by means of an arbitrary whim. But reality is not to be
cheated. What they achieve is the opposite of their desire. They want an
omnipotent power over existence; instead, they lose the power of their
consciousness. By refusing to know, they condemn themselves to the horror of a
perpetual unknown.

“Those irrational wishes that draw you to their creed, those emotions you
worship as an idol, on whose altar you sacrifice the earth, that dark, incoherent
passion within you, which you take as the voice of God or of your glands, is
nothing more than the corpse of your mind. An emotion that clashes with your
reason, an emotion that you cannot explain or control, is only the carcass of that
stale thinking which you forbade your mind to revise.

“Whenever you committed the evil of refusing to think and to see, of
exempting from the absolute of reality some one small wish of yours, whenever
you chose to say: Let me withdraw from the judgment of reason the cookies I
stole, or the existence of God, let me have my one irrational whim and I will be a
man of reason about all else—that was the act of subverting your consciousness,
the act of corrupting your mind. Your mind then became a fixed jury who takes
orders from a secret underworld, whose verdict distorts the evidence to fit an
absolute it dares not touch—and a censored reality is the result, a splintered
reality where the bits you chose to see are floating among the chasms of those
you didn’t, held together by that embalming fluid of the mind which is an
emotion exempted from thought.

“The links you strive to drown are causal connections. The enemy you seek to
defeat is the law of causality: it permits you no miracles. The law of causality is
the law of identity applied to action. All actions are caused by entities. The
nature of an action is caused and determined by the nature of the entities that act;
a thing cannot act in contradiction to its nature. An action not caused by an entity
would be caused by a zero, which would mean a zero controlling a thing, a nonentity controlling an entity, the non-existent ruling the existent—which is the
universe of your teachers’ desire, the cause of their doctrines of causeless action,
the reason of their revolt against reason, the goal of their morality, their politics,
their economics, the ideal they strive for: the reign of the zero.
“The law of identity does not permit you to have your cake and eat it, too. The
law of causality does not permit you to eat your cake before you have it. But if
you drown both laws in the blanks of your mind, if you pretend to yourself and
to others that you don’t see—then you can try to proclaim your right to eat your
cake today and mine tomorrow, you can preach that the way to have a cake is to
eat it first, before you bake it, that the way to produce is to start by consuming,
that all wishers have an equal claim to all things, since nothing is caused by
anything. The corollary of the causeless in matter is the unearned in spirit.
“Whenever you rebel against causality, your motive is the fraudulent desire,
not to escape it, but worse: to reverse it. You want unearned love, as if love, the
effect, could give you personal value, the cause—you want unearned admiration,
as if admiration, the effect, could give you virtue, the cause—you want unearned
wealth, as if wealth, the effect, could give you ability, the cause—you plead for
mercy, mercy, not justice, as if an unearned forgiveness could wipe out the cause
of your plea. And to indulge your ugly little shams, you support the doctrines of
your teachers, while they run hog-wild proclaiming that spending, the effect,
creates riches, the cause, that machinery, the effect, creates intelligence, the
cause, that your sexual desires, the effect, create your philosophical values, the
cause.
“Who pays for the orgy? Who causes the causeless? Who are the victims,
condemned to remain unacknowledged and to perish in silence, lest their agony
disturb your pretense that they do not exist? We are, we, the men of the mind.
“We are the cause of all the values that you covet, we who perform the
process of thinking, which is the process of defining identity and discovering
causal connections. We taught you to know, to speak, to produce, to desire, to
love. You who abandon reason—were it not for us who preserve it, you would
not be able to fulfill or even to conceive your wishes. You would not be able to
desire the clothes that had not been made, the automobile that had not been
invented, the money that had not been devised, as exchange for goods that did
not exist, the admiration that had not been experienced for men who had
achieved nothing, the love that belongs and pertains only to those who preserve
their capacity to think, to choose, to value.

“You—who leap like a savage out of the jungle of your feelings into the Fifth
Avenue of our New York and proclaim that you want to keep the electric lights,
but to destroy the generators—it is our wealth that you use while destroying us,
it is our values that you use while damning us, it is our language that you use
while denying the mind.
“Just as your mystics of spirit invented their heaven in the image of our earth,
omitting our existence, and promised you rewards created by miracle out of nonmatter—so your modern mystics of muscle omit our existence and promise you
a heaven where matter shapes itself of its own causeless will into all the rewards
desired by your non-mind.
“For centuries, the mystics of spirit had existed by running a protection racket
—by making life on earth unbearable, then charging you for consolation and
relief, by forbidding all the virtues that make existence possible, then riding on
the shoulders of your guilt, by declaring production and joy to be sins, then
collecting blackmail from the sinners. We, the men of the mind, were the
unnamed victims of their creed, we who were willing to break their moral code
and to bear damnation for the sin of reason—we who thought and acted, while
they wished and prayed—we who were moral outcasts, we who were
bootleggers of life when life was held to be a crime—while they basked in moral
glory for the virtue of surpassing material greed and of distributing in selfless
charity the material goods produced by—blank-out.

“Now we are chained and commanded to produce by savages who do not
grant us even the identification of sinners—by savages who proclaim that we do
not exist, then threaten to deprive us of the life we don’t possess, if we fail to
provide them with the goods we don’t produce. Now we are expected to
continue running railroads and to know the minute when a train will arrive after
crossing the span of a continent, we are expected to continue running steel mills
and to know the molecular structure of every drop of metal in the cables of your
bridges and in the body of the airplanes that support you in mid-air—while the
tribes of your grotesque little mystics of muscle fight over the carcass of our
world, gibbering in sounds of non-language that there are no principles, no
absolutes, no knowledge, no mind.

“Dropping below the level of a savage, who believes that the magic words he
utters have the power to alter reality, they believe that reality can be altered by
the power of the words they do not utter—and their magic tool is the blank-out,
the pretense that nothing can come into existence past the voodoo of their refusal
to identify it.
“As they feed on stolen wealth in body, so they feed on stolen concepts in
mind, and proclaim that honesty consists of refusing to know that one is stealing.
As they use effects while denying causes, so they use our concepts while
denying the roots and the existence of the concepts they are using. As they seek,
not to build, but to take over industrial plants, so they seek, not to think, but to
take over human thinking.
“As they proclaim that the only requirement for running a factory is the ability
to turn the cranks of the machines, and blank out the question of who created the
factory—so they proclaim that there are no entities, that nothing exists but
motion, and blank out the fact that motion presupposes the thing which moves,
that without the concept of entity, there can be no such concept as ‘motion.’ As
they proclaim their right to consume the unearned, and blank out the question of
who’s to produce it—so they proclaim that there is no law of identity, that
nothing exists but change, and blank out the fact that change presupposes the
concepts of what changes, from what and to what, that without the law of
identity no such concept as ‘change’ is possible. As they rob an industrialist
while denying his value, so they seek to seize power over all of existence while
denying that existence exists.

“ ‘We know that we know nothing,’ they chatter, blanking out the fact that
they are claiming knowledge—‘There are no absolutes,’ they chatter, blanking
out the fact that they are uttering an absolute—‘You cannot prove that you exist
or that you’re conscious,’ they chatter, blanking out the fact that proof
presupposes existence, consciousness and a complex chain of knowledge: the
existence of something to know, of a consciousness able to know it, and of a
knowledge that has learned to distinguish between such concepts as the proved
and the unproved.

“When a savage who has not learned to speak declares that existence must be
proved, he is asking you to prove it by means of non-existence—when he
declares that your consciousness must be proved, he is asking you to prove it by
means of unconsciousness—he is asking you to step into a void outside of
existence and consciousness to give him proof of both—he is asking you to
become a zero gaining knowledge about a zero.
“When he declares that an axiom is a matter of arbitrary choice and he doesn’t
choose to accept the axiom that he exists, he blanks out the fact that he has
accepted it by uttering that sentence, that the only way to reject it is to shut one’s
mouth, expound no theories and die.

“An axiom is a statement that identifies the base of knowledge and of any
further statement pertaining to that knowledge, a statement necessarily contained
in all others, whether any particular speaker chooses to identify it or not. An
axiom is a proposition that defeats its opponents by the fact that they have to
accept it and use it in the process of any attempt to deny it. Let the caveman who
does not choose to accept the axiom of identity, try to present his theory without
using the concept of identity or any concept derived from it—let the anthropoid
who does not choose to accept the existence of nouns, try to devise a language
without nouns, adjectives or verbs—let the witch doctor who does not choose to
accept the validity of sensory perception, try to prove it without using the data he
obtained by sensory perception—let the head-hunter who does not choose to
accept the validity of logic, try to prove it without using logic—let the pigmy
who proclaims that a skyscraper needs no foundation after it reaches its fiftieth
story, yank the base from under his building, not yours—let the cannibal who
snarls that the freedom of man’s mind was needed to create an industrial
civilization, but is not needed to maintain it, be given an arrowhead and bear-
skin, not a university chair of economics.

“Do you think they are taking you back to dark ages? They are taking you
back to darker ages than any your history has known. Their goal is not the era of
pre-science, but the era of pre-language. Their purpose is to deprive you of the
concept on which man’s mind, his life and his culture depend: the concept of an
objective reality. Identify the development of a human consciousness—and you
will know the purpose of their creed.

“A savage is a being who has not grasped that A is A and that reality is real.
He has arrested his mind at the level of a baby’s, at the stage when a
consciousness acquires its initial sensory perceptions and has not learned to
distinguish solid objects. It is to a baby that the world appears as a blur of
motion, without things that move—and the birth of his mind is the day when he
grasps that the streak that keeps flickering past him is his mother and the whirl
beyond her is a curtain, that the two are solid entities and neither can turn into
the other, that they are what they are, that they exist. The day when he grasps
that matter has no volition is the day when he grasps that he has—and this is his
birth as a human being. The day when he grasps that the reflection he sees in a
mirror is not a delusion, that it is real, but it is not himself, that the mirage he
sees in a desert is not a delusion, that the air and the light rays that cause it are
real, but it is not a city, it is a city’s reflection—the day when he grasps that he is
not a passive recipient of the sensations of any given moment, that his senses do
not provide him with automatic knowledge in separate snatches independent of
context, but only with the material of knowledge, which his mind must learn to
integrate—the day when he grasps that his senses cannot deceive him, that
physical objects cannot act without causes, that his organs of perception are
physical and have no volition, no power to invent or to distort, that the evidence
they give him is an absolute, but his mind must learn to understand it, his mind
must discover the nature, the causes, the full context of his sensory material, his
mind must identify the things that he perceives—that is the day of his birth as a
thinker and scientist.

“We are the men who reach that day; you are the men who choose to reach it
partly; a savage is a man who never does.

“To a savage, the world is a place of unintelligible miracles where anything is
possible to inanimate matter and nothing is possible to him. His world is not the
unknown, but that irrational horror: the unknowable. He believes that physical
objects are endowed with a mysterious volition, moved by causeless,
unpredictable whims, while he is a helpless pawn at the mercy of forces beyond
his control. He believes that nature is ruled by demons who possess an
omnipotent power and that reality is their fluid plaything, where they can turn
his bowl of meal into a snake and his wife into a beetle at any moment, where
the A he has never discovered can be any non-A they choose, where the only
knowledge he possesses is that he must not attempt to know. He can count on
nothing, he can only wish, and he spends his life on wishing, on begging his
demons to grant him his wishes by the arbitrary power of their will, giving them
credit when they do, taking the blame when they don’t, offering them sacrifices
in token of his gratitude and sacrifices in token of his guilt, crawling on his belly
in fear and worship of sun and moon and wind and rain and of any thug who
announces himself as their spokesman, provided his words are unintelligible and
his mask sufficiently frightening—he wishes, begs and crawls, and dies, leaving
you, as a record of his view of existence, the distorted monstrosities of his idols,
part-man, part-animal, part-spider, the embodiments of the world of non-A.
“His is the intellectual state of your modern teachers and his is the world to
which they want to bring you.

“If you wonder by what means they propose to do it, walk into any college
classroom and you will hear your professors teaching your children that man can
be certain of nothing, that his consciousness has no validity whatever, that he can
learn no facts and no laws of existence, that he’s incapable of knowing an
objective reality. What, then, is his standard of knowledge and truth? Whatever
others believe, is their answer. There is no knowledge, they teach, there’s only
faith: your belief that you exist is an act of faith, no more valid than another’s
faith in his right to kill you; the axioms of science are an act of faith, no more
valid than a mystic’s faith in revelations; the belief that electric light can be
produced by a generator is an act of faith, no more valid than the belief that it
can be produced by a rabbit’s foot kissed under a stepladder on the first of the
moon—truth is whatever people want it to be, and people are everyone except
yourself; reality is whatever people choose to say it is, there are no objective
facts, there are only people’s arbitrary wishes—a man who seeks knowledge in a
laboratory by means of test tubes and logic is an old-fashioned, superstitious
fool; a true scientist is a man who goes around taking public polls—and if it
weren’t for the selfish greed of the manufacturers of steel girders, who have a
vested interest in obstructing the progress of science, you would learn that New
York City does not exist, because a poll of the entire population of the world
would tell you by a landslide majority that their beliefs forbid its existence.
“For centuries, the mystics of spirit have proclaimed that faith is superior to
reason, but have not dared deny the existence of reason. Their heirs and product,
the mystics of muscle, have completed their job and achieved their dream: they
proclaim that everything is faith, and call it a revolt against believing. As revolt
against unproved assertions, they proclaim that nothing can be proved; as revolt
against supernatural knowledge, they proclaim that no knowledge is possible; as
revolt against the enemies of science, they proclaim that science is superstition;
as revolt against the enslavement of the mind, they proclaim that there is no
mind.

“If you surrender your power to perceive, if you accept the switch of your
standard from the objective to the collective and wait for mankind to tell you
what to think, you will find another switch taking place before the eyes you have
renounced: you will find that your teachers become the rulers of the collective,
and if you then refuse to obey them, protesting that they are not the whole of
mankind, they will answer: ‘By what means do you know that we are not? Are,
brother? Where did you get that old-fashioned term?’

“If you doubt that such is their purpose, observe with what passionate
consistency the mystics of muscle are striving to make you forget that a concept
such as ‘mind’ has ever existed. Observe the twists of undefined verbiage, the
words with rubber meanings, the terms left floating in midstream, by means of
which they try to get around the recognition of the concept of ‘thinking.’ Your
consciousness, they tell you, consists of ‘reflexes,’ ‘reactions, ’ ‘experiences,’
‘urges,’ and ‘drives’—and refuse to identify the means by which they acquired
that knowledge, to identify the act they are performing when they tell it or the
act you are performing when you listen. Words have the power to ‘condition’
you, they say and refuse to identify the reason why words have the power to
change your—blank-out. A student reading a book understands it through a
process of—blank-out. A scientist working on an invention is engaged in the
activity of—blank-out. A psychologist helping a neurotic to solve a problem and
untangle a conflict, does it by means of—blank-out. An industrialist—blank-out
—there is no such person. A factory is a ‘natural resource,’ like a tree, a rock or a
mud puddle.

“The problem of production, they tell you, has been solved and deserves no
study or concern; the only problem left for your ‘reflexes’ to solve is now the
problem of distribution. Who solved the problem of production? Humanity, they
answer. What was the solution? The goods are here. How did they get here?
Somehow. What caused it? Nothing has causes.

“They proclaim that every man born is entitled to exist without labor and, the
laws of reality to the contrary notwithstanding, is entitled to receive his
‘minimum sustenance’—his food, his clothes, his shelter—with no effort on his
part, as his due and his birthright. To receive it—from whom? Blank-out. Every
man, they announce, owns an equal share of the technological benefits created in
the world. Created—by whom? Blank-out. Frantic cowards who posture as
defenders of industrialists now define the purpose of economics as ‘an
adjustment between the unlimited desires of men and the goods supplied in
limited quantity.’ Supplied—by whom? Blank-out. Intellectual hoodlums who
pose as professors, shrug away the thinkers of the past by declaring that their
social theories were based on the impractical assumption that man was a rational
being—but since men are not rational, they declare, there ought to be established
a system that will make it possible for them to exist while being irrational,
which means: while defying reality. Who will make it possible? Blank-out. Any
stray mediocrity rushes into print with plans to control the production of
mankind—and whoever agrees or disagrees with his statistics, no one questions
his right to enforce his plans by means of a gun. Enforce—on whom? Blank-out.
Random females with causeless incomes flitter on trips around the globe and
return to deliver the message that the backward peoples of the world demand a
higher standard of living. Demand—of whom? Blank-out.
“And to forestall any inquiry into the cause of the difference between a jungle
village and New York City, they resort to the ultimate obscenity of explaining
man’s industrial progress—skyscrapers, cable bridges, power motors, railroad
trains—by declaring that man is an animal who possesses an ‘instinct of toolmaking.’
“Did you wonder what is wrong with the world? You are now seeing the
climax of the creed of the uncaused and unearned. All your gangs of mystics, of
spirit or muscle, are fighting one another for power to rule you, snarling that love
is the solution for all the problems of your spirit and that a whip is the solution
for all the problems of your body—you who have agreed to have no mind.
Granting man less dignity than they grant to cattle, ignoring what an animal
trainer could tell them—that no animal can be trained by fear, that a tortured
elephant will trample its torturer, but will not work for him or carry his burdens
—they expect man to continue to produce electronic tubes, supersonic airplanes,
atom-smashing engines and interstellar telescopes, with his ration of meat for
reward and a lash on his back for incentive.
