Rationality is the recognition:
- of existence
- that nothing can alter the truth and nothing can take precedence over that act of perceiving the truth
which is thinking
- that the mind is one’s only judge of values and one’s only guide of action
- that reason is an absolute that permits no compromise
- that a concession to the irrational invalidates one’s consciousness and turns it from the task of perceiving to the task of faking reality
- that the alleged shortcut to knowledge, which is faith, is only a short-circuit destroying the mind
- that the acceptance of a mystical invention is a wish for the annihilation of existence and annihilates one’s consciousness.


Independence is the recognition that you are responsible for judgment and nothing can help you escape it.

<!-- —that no substitute can do your thinking, as no pinch-hitter can live your life—that the vilest form of selfabasement and self-destruction is the subordination of your mind to the mind of
another, the acceptance of an authority over your brain, the acceptance of his
assertions as facts, his say-so as truth, his edicts as middle-man between your
consciousness and your existence. -->


Integrity is the recognition that:
- you cannot fake your consciousness, just as honesty is the recognition that you cannot fake existence
- man is an indivisible entity, an integrated unit of matter and consciousness
- he may permit no breach between body and mind, between action and thought, between his life and his convictions—
- like a judge impervious to public opinion, he may not sacrifice his convictions to the wishes of others, be it the whole of mankind shouting pleas or threats against him
- courage and confidence are practical necessities
- courage is the practical form of being true to existence, of being true to truth, and confidence is the practical form of being true to one’s own consciousness.


Honesty is the recognition of the fact that the unreal is unreal and can have no value, that neither love nor fame nor cash is a value if obtained by fraud—that an attempt to gain a value by deceiving the mind of others is an act of
raising your victims to a position higher than reality, where you become a pawn
of their blindness, a slave of their non-thinking and their evasions, while their
intelligence, their rationality, their perceptiveness become the enemies you have
to dread and flee—that you do not care to live as a dependent, least of all a
dependent on the stupidity of others, or as a fool whose source of values is the
fools he succeeds in fooling—that honesty is not a social duty, not a sacrifice for
the sake of others, but the most profoundly selfish virtue man can practice: his
refusal to sacrifice the reality of his own existence to the deluded consciousness
of others.

Justice is the recognition of the fact that you cannot fake the character of men
as you cannot fake the character of nature, that you must judge all men as
conscientiously as you judge inanimate objects, with the same respect for truth,
with the same incorruptible vision, by as pure and as rational a process of
identification—that every man must be judged for what he is and treated
accordingly, that just as you do not pay a higher price for a rusty chunk of scrap
than for a piece of shining metal, so you do not value a rotter above a hero—that
your moral appraisal is the coin paying men for their virtues or vices, and this
payment demands of you as scrupulous an honor as you bring to financial
transactions—that to withhold your contempt from men’s vices is an act of moral
counterfeiting, and to withhold your admiration from their virtues is an act of
moral embezzlement—that to place any other concern higher than justice is to
devaluate your moral currency and defraud the good in favor of the evil, since
only the good can lose by a default of justice and only the evil can profit—and
that the bottom of the pit at the end of that road, the act of moral bankruptcy, is
to punish men for their virtues and reward them for their vices, that that is the
collapse to full depravity, the Black Mass of the worship of death, the dedication
of your consciousness to the destruction of existence.

Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your recognition of the fact
that you choose to live—that productive work is the process by which man’s
consciousness controls his existence, a constant process of acquiring knowledge
and shaping matter to fit one’s purpose, of translating an idea into physical form,
of remaking the earth in the image of one’s values—that all work is creative
work if done by a thinking mind, and no work is creative if done by a blank who
repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has learned from others—that your work
is yours to choose, and the choice is as wide as your mind, that nothing more is
possible to you and nothing less is human—that to cheat your way into a job
bigger than your mind can handle is to become a fear-corroded ape on borrowed
motions and borrowed time, and to settle down into a job that requires less than
your mind’s full capacity is to cut your motor and sentence yourself to another
kind of motion: decay—that your work is the process of achieving your values,
and to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition to live—that your
body is a machine, but your mind is its driver, and you must drive as far as your
mind will take you, with achievement as the goal of your road—that the man
who has no purpose is a machine that coasts downhill at the mercy of any
boulder to crash in the first chance ditch, that the man who stifles his mind is a
stalled machine slowly going to rust, that the man who lets a leader prescribe his
course is a wreck being towed to the scrap heap, and the man who makes another
man his goal is a hitchhiker no driver should ever pick up—that your work is the
purpose of your life, and you must speed past any killer who assumes the right to
stop you, that any value you might find outside your work, any other loyalty or
love, can be only travelers you choose to share your journey and must be
travelers going on their own power in the same direction.

Pride is the recognition of the fact that you are your own highest value and,
like all of man’s values, it has to be earned—that of any achievements open to
you, the one that makes all others possible is the creation of your own character
—that your character, your actions, your desires, your emotions are the products
of the premises held by your mind—that as man must produce the physical
values he needs to sustain his life, so he must acquire the values of character that
make his life worth sustaining—that as man is a being of self-made wealth, so he
is a being of self-made soul—that to live requires a sense of self-value, but man,
who has no automatic values, has no automatic sense of self-esteem and must
earn it by shaping his soul in the image of his moral ideal, in the image of Man,
the rational being he is born able to create, but must create by choice—that the
first precondition of self-esteem is that radiant selfishness of soul which desires
the best in all things, in values of matter and spirit, a soul that seeks above all
else to achieve its own moral perfection, valuing nothing higher than itself—and
that the proof of an achieved self-esteem is your soul’s shudder of contempt and
rebellion against the role of a sacrificial animal, against the vile impertinence of
any creed that proposes to immolate the irreplaceable value which is your
consciousness and the incomparable glory which is your existence to the blind
evasions and the stagnant decay of others.

“Are you beginning to see who is John Galt? I am the man who has earned the
thing you did not fight for, the thing you have renounced, betrayed, corrupted,
yet were unable fully to destroy and are now hiding as your guilty secret,
spending your life in apologies to every professional cannibal, lest it be
discovered that somewhere within you, you still long to say what I am now
saying to the hearing of the whole of mankind: I am proud of my own value and
of the fact that I wish to live.

“This wish—which you share, yet submerge as an evil—is the only remnant
of the good within you, but it is a wish one must learn to deserve. His own
happiness is man’s only moral purpose, but only his own virtue can achieve it.
Virtue is not an end in itself. Virtue is not its own reward or sacrificial fodder for
the reward of evil. Life is the reward of virtue—and happiness is the goal and the
reward of life.

“Just as your body has two fundamental sensations, pleasure and pain, as signs
of its welfare or injury, as a barometer of its basic alternative, life or death, so
your consciousness has two fundamental emotions, joy and suffering, in answer
to the same alternative. Your emotions are estimates of that which furthers your
life or threatens it, lightning calculators giving you a sum of your profit or loss.
You have no choice about your capacity to feel that something is good for you or
evil, but what you will consider good or evil, what will give you joy or pain,
what you will love or hate, desire or fear, depends on your standard of value.
