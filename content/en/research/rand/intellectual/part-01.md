When a man, a business corporation or an entire society is approaching bankruptcy, there are 2 courses it can follow:

1. They can evade the reality of their situation

They can act on a frantic, blind, range-of-the-moment expediency

<!-- —not daring to look ahead, wishing no one would name the truth, yet desperately hoping that something will save them somehow—or -->

2. They can identify the situation, check their premises, discover their hidden assets and start rebuilding.


America, at present, is following the first course. 

<!-- The grayness, the stale cynicism, the noncommittal cautiousness, the guilty evasiveness of our public
voices suggest the attitude of the courtiers in the story “The Emperor’s New
Clothes” who professed admiration for the Emperor’s non-existent garments, having accepted the assertion that anyone who failed to perceive them was
morally depraved at heart. -->

<!-- Let me be the child in the story and declare that the Emperor is naked—or that -->

I declare that America is culturally bankrupt.

A culture is judged by:
- its dominant philosophy
- the trend of its intellectual life as expressed in morality, politics, economics, art. 

Professional intellectuals are the voice of a culture and are, therefore, its leaders, its integrators and its bodyguards.

America’s intellectual leadership has collapsed. 

Her virtues, values, enormous power are scattered in a silent underground and will remain private, subjective, historically impotent if left without intellectual expression. 

America is a country without voice or defense—a country sold out and abandoned by her intellectual bodyguards.

Bankruptcy is defined as the state of being at the end of one’s resources. 

What are the intellectual values or resources offered to us by the present guardians of our culture? 

In philosophy, we are taught that man’s mind is impotent, that
reality is unknowable, that knowledge is an illusion, and reason a superstition. In
psychology, we are told that man is a helpless automaton, determined by forces
beyond his control, motivated by innate depravity. In literature, we are shown a
line-up of murderers, dipsomaniacs, drug addicts, neurotics and psychotics as
representatives of man’s soul—and are invited to identify our own among them
—with the belligerent assertions that life is a sewer, a foxhole or a rat race, with
the whining injunctions that we must love everything, except virtue, and forgive
everything, except greatness. In politics, we are told that America, the greatest,
noblest, freest country on earth, is politically and morally inferior to Soviet
Russia, the bloodiest dictatorship in history—and that our wealth should be
given away to the savages of Asia and Africa, with apologies for the fact that we
have produced it while they haven’t. 

If we look at modern intellectuals, we are
confronted with the grotesque spectacle of such characteristics as militant
uncertainty, crusading cynicism, dogmatic agnosticism, boastful self-abasement
and self-righteous depravity—in an atmosphere of guilt, of panic, of despair, of
boredom and of all-pervasive evasion. If this is not the state of being at the end
of one’s resources, there is no further place to go.

Everybody seems to agree that civilization is facing a crisis, but nobody cares
to define its nature, to discover its cause and to assume the responsibility of
formulating a solution. In times of danger, a morally healthy culture rallies its
values, its self-esteem and its crusading spirit to fight for its moral ideals with
full, righteous confidence. But this is not what we see today. If we ask our
intellectual leaders what are the ideals we should fight for, their answer is such a
sticky puddle of stale syrup—of benevolent bromides and apologetic generalities
about brother love, global progress and universal prosperity at America’s
expense—that a fly would not die for it or in it.
One of America’s tragic errors is that too many of her best minds believe—as
they did in the past—that the solution is to turn anti-intellectual and rely on some
cracker-barrel sort of folksy wisdom. The exact opposite is true. What we need
most urgently is to recognize the enormous power and the crucial importance of
the intellectual professions. A culture cannot exist without a constant stream of
ideas and the alert, independent minds who originate them; it cannot exist
without a philosophy of life, without those who formulate it and express it. A
country without intellectuals is like a body without a head. And that is precisely
the position of America today. Our present state of cultural disintegration is not
maintained and prolonged by intellectuals as such, but by the fact that we
haven’t any. The majority of those who posture as intellectuals today are
frightened zombies, posturing in a vacuum of their own making, who admit their
abdication from the realm of the intellect by embracing such doctrines as
Existentialism and Zen Buddhism.

After decades of preaching that the hallmark of an intellectual consists of
proclaiming the impotence of the intellect, these modern zombies are left aghast
before the fact that they have succeeded—that they are impotent to ignite the
lights of civilization, which they have extinguished—that they are impotent to
halt the triumphant advance of the primordial brute, whom they have released—
that they have no answer to give to those voices out of the Dark Ages who gloat
that reason and freedom have had their chance and have failed, and that the
future, like the long night of the past, belongs once more to faith and force.
If all the manufacturers of railroad engines suddenly went irrational and began
to manufacture covered wagons instead, nobody would accept the claim that this
is a progressive innovation or that the iron horse has failed; and many men
would step into the industrial vacuum to start manufacturing railroad engines.
But when this happens in philosophy—when we are offered Zen Buddhism and
its equivalents as the latest word in human thought—nobody, so far, has chosen
to step into the intellectual vacuum to carry on the work of man’s mind.

Thus our great industrial civilization is now expected to run railroads, airlines,
intercontinental missiles and H-bomb stock piles by the guidance of
philosophical doctrines created by and for barefoot savages who lived in
mudholes, scratched the soil for a handful of grain and gave thanks to the statues
of distorted animals whom they worshipped as superior to man.
Historically, the professional intellectual is a very recent phenomenon: he
dates only from the industrial revolution. There are no professional intellectuals
in primitive, savage societies, there are only witch doctors. There were no
professional intellectuals in the Middle Ages, there were only monks in
monasteries. 

In the post-Renaissance era, prior to the birth of capitalism, the men
of the intellect—the philosophers, the teachers, the writers, the early scientists—
were men without a profession, that is: without a socially recognized position,
without a market, without a means of earning a livelihood. Intellectual pursuits
had to depend on the accident of inherited wealth or on the favor and financial
support of some wealthy protector. And wealth was not earned on an open
market, either; wealth was acquired by conquest, by force, by political power, or
by the favor of those who held political power. 

Tradesmen were more vulnerably
and precariously dependent on favor than the intellectuals.
The professional businessman and the professional intellectual came into
existence together, as brothers born of the industrial revolution. Both are the sons
of capitalism—and if they perish, they will perish together. The tragic irony will
be that they will have destroyed each other; and the major share of the guilt will
belong to the intellectual.
