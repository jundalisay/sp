<!-- What Mortal, if he had never chanc'd to hear your Character, Palemon, cou'd imagine, that a Genius fitted for the greatest Affairs, and form'd amidst Courts and Camps, shou'd have so violent a Turn towards Philosophy and the Schools? 

Who is there cou'd possibly believe that one of your Rank and Credit in the fashionable World, shou'd be so thorowly conversant in the learned one, and deeply interested in the Affairs of a People so disagreeable to the Generality of Mankind and Humour of the Age?

In either Case I pity'd you; thinking it a milder Fate, to be, as I truly was, for my own part, a more indifferent Lover. 'Twas better, I told you, to admire Beauty and Wisdom a little more moderately. 'Twas better, I maintain'd, to ingage so cautiously as to be sure of coming off with a whole Heart, and a Fancy as strong as ever towards all the pretty Entertainments and Diversions of the World. For these, methought, were things one wou'd not willingly part with, for a fine romantick Passion of one of those Gentlemen whom they call'd Virtuosos.

The Name I took to belong in common to your Lover and Philosopher. No matter what the Object was; whether Poetry, Musick, Philosophy, or the Fair. 

All who were enamour'd any-way, were in the same Condition. You might perceive it, I told you, by their Looks, their Admiration, their profound Thoughtfulness, their waking ever and anon as out of a Dream, their talking still of one thing, and scarce minding what they said on any other Subject.—Sad Indications! -->

You, Palemon, want our Philosophical Adventures recorded. 

Our Nation:
- talks Politicks in every Company
- mixes the Discourses of State-affairs with those of Entertainment

We Moderns degraded Philosophy because:
- such freedom is not allowed in Philosophy.
- Politicks is not her domain

 <!-- to be of her Province, or in the least related to her. So much have  -->

<!-- , and stripp'd her of her chief Rights. -->

<!-- You must allow me, Palemon, thus to bemoan Philosophy; since you have forc'd me to ingage with her at a time when her Credit runs so low. She is no longer active in the World; nor can hardly, with any advantage, be brought upon the publick Stage. We have immur'd her (poor Lady!) in Colleges and Cells; and have set her servilely to such Works as those in the Mines.  -->

Empiricks, and pedantick Sophists are the chief Pupils of Philosophy. 

The School-syllogism, and the Elixir, are the choicest of her Products. 

So far is she from producing Statesmen, as of old, that hardly any Man of Note in the publick cares to own the least Obligation to her. 

If some few maintain their Acquaintance, and come now and then to her Recesses, 'tis as the Disciple of Quality came to his Lord and Master; "secretly, and by night."

Morals belong to Philosophy. And so Politicks should too.

For to understand the Manners and Constitutions of Men in common, 'tis necessary to study Man in particular, and know the Creature, as he is in himself, before we consider him in Company, as he is interested in the State, or join'd to any City or Community. 

Nothing is more familiar than to reason concerning Man in his confederate State and national Relation; as he stands ingag'd to this or that Society, by Birth or Naturalization: Yet to consider him as a Citizen or Commoner of the World, to trace his Pedegree a step higher, and view his End and Constitution in Nature it-self, must pass, it seems, for some intricate or over-refin'd Speculation.

It may be properly alledg'd perhaps, as a Reason for this general Shyness in moral Inquirys; that the People to whom it has principally belong’d to handle these Subjects, have done it in such a manner as to put the better Sort out of countenance with the Undertaking. The appropriating this Concern to mere Scholasticks, has brought their Fashion and Air into the very Subject. There are formal Set-places, where, we reckon, there is enough said and taught on the Head of these graver Subjects. We can give no quarter to any thing like it in good Company. The least mention of such matters gives us a disgust, and puts us out of humour. If Learning comes a-cross us, we count it Pedantry; if Morality, 'tis Preaching.

One must own this, however, as a real Disadvantage of our modern Conversations; that by such a scrupulous Nicety they lose those masculine Helps of Learning and sound Reason. Even the Fair Sex, in whose favour we pretend to make this Condescension, may with reason despise us for it, and laugh at us for aiming at their peculiar Softness. 'Tis no Compliment to them, to affect their Manners, and be effeminate. Our Sense, Language, and Style, as well as our Voice, and Person, shou'd have something of that Male-Feature, and natural Roughness, by which our Sex is distinguish'd. And whatever Politeness we may pretend to, 'tis more a Disfigurement than any real Refinement of Discourse, to render it thus delicate.

No Work of Wit can be esteem'd perfect without that Strength and Boldness of Hand, which gives it Body and Proportions. A good Piece, the Painters say, must have good Muscling as well as Colouring and Drapery. And surely no Writing or Discourse of any great moment, can seem other than enervated, when neither strong Reason, nor Antiquity, nor the Records of Things, nor the natural History of Man, nor any-thing which can be call'd Knowledge, dares accompany it; except perhaps in some ridiculous Habit, which may give it an Air of Play and Dalliance.

This brings to my mind a Reason I have often sought for; why we Moderns, who abound so much in Treatises and Essays, are so sparing in the way of [1] Dialogue; which heretofore was found the politest and best way of managing even the graver Subjects. The truth is; 'twou'd be an abominable Falshood, and belying of the Age, to put so much good Sense together in any one Conversation, as might make it hold out steddily, and with plain coherence, for an hour's time, till any one Subject had been rationally examin'd.

To lay Colours, to draw, or describe, against the Appearance of Nature and Truth, is a Liberty neither permitted the Painter nor the Poet. Much less can the Philosopher have such a Privilege; especially in his own Case. If he represents his Philosophy as making any figure in Conversation; if he triumphs in the Debate, and gives his own Wisdom the advantage over that of the World; he may be liable to sound Raillery, and possibly be made a Fable of.

'Tis said of the Lion, that being in civil Conference with the Man, he wisely refus’d to yield the Superiority of Strength to him; when instead of Fact, the Man produc'd only certain Figures and Representations of human Victorys over the Lionkind. These Master-pieces of Art the Beast discover'd to be wholly of human Forgery: and from these he had good right to appeal. Indeed had he ever in his life been witness to any such Combats as the Man represented to him in the way of Art; possibly the Example might have mov'd him. But old Statues of a Hercules, a Theseus, or other Beast-subduers, cou'd have little power over him, whilst he neither saw nor felt any such living Antagonist capable to dispute the Field with him.
