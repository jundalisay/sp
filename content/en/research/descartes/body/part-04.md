How does the body grow from seed?

<!-- A still more perfect knowledge of how all the parts of the body are nourished is to be had when we consider how they were originally formed from the seed. 

Until now, I have been unwilling to put my views on this topic into writing, because I have not yet been able to make enough observations to test all the thoughts I have had on the matter. -->

<!-- Nevertheless, I cannot refrain from setting out some very general points in passing, as I hope that these are those least likely to be among those that I will have to retract later, when new observations have enlightened me further. -->

I specify nothing on the shape and arrangement of the particles of the seed.

<!-- it is enough for me to say that that of  -->

Plants are hard and solid.
- They can have their particles arranged and situated in a way which cannot be altered without making them useless.

But the seed in animals and humans is quite different.

This is quite fluid and is usually produced in the copulation between male and female. 

It seems like an unorganised mixture of 2 liquids.

These act on each other like a kind of yeast, heating one another so that some of the particles acquire the same agitation as fire.

This agitation expands and presss on the others, putting them gradually into the state required for the formation of parts of the body.

<!-- These 2 liquids need not be very different from one another for this purpose. -->

<!-- Old dough can make new dough swell. -->

The scum formed on beer is able to serve as yeast for making more beer.

Likewise, the seeds of the two sexes, when mixed together, serve as yeast to one another. 

<!-- The first thing that happens in this mixture of seed, and which makes all the drops cease to resemble one another, is that  -->

The heat generated by their mixture makes them ferment and expand and merge.*

{{< n n="In Bio Superphysics, this heat is the vital energy prana, So it is the prana that makes the heart beat. This prana is different from chi or vayu which Descartes calls the animal spirits. We assign prana as the Fire Element or Radiant Layer, and animal spirits as the Air Element or Spatial Layer. These are both in line with Descartes and Vedic and Taoist science." >}}


<!-- there – which acts in the same way as does new wine when it ferments, or as hay which is stored before it is dry – causes some of the particles to collect in a part of the space containing them, and then makes them expand, pressing against the others. This is how the heart begins to be formed. -->

<!-- These tiny parts then expand and continue their movement in a straight line. -->

Its heart forms which resists them.

They slowly move away and go to create the brain stem.

 <!-- will later be formed. -->

These go back to the heart to fill the space that they left, and then move away in a cycle. 

<!-- In the process, they displace others which move around in a circle to occupy the place vacated by them in the heart.

After the brief time needed for them to collect in the heart, these in turn expand and move away, following the same path as the former.

This results in some of the former group which are still in the same position – together with others that have moved in from elsewhere to take the place of those that have left in the meantime – moving into the heart.  -->

This repeating cycle creates the beating of the heart. 

<!-- The beating of the heart, or the pulse, consists in this repeating expansion. -->

 <!-- this material that passes into the heart, that  -->
