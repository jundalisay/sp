Polyamander: I find you fortunate to have discovered all these beautiful things in Greek and Latin books, and it seems to me that if I had devoted as much time as you to these studies, I would be as different from what I am now as angels are from you. And I cannot excuse the mistake of my parents, who, persuaded that letters soften the mind, sent me to court and to the camps at such a tender age that I will have my whole life to lament my ignorance, if I do not learn something in your conversations.

Epistemon: The best thing you could learn there is that the desire to know, which is common to all men, is an evil that cannot be cured. For curiosity increases with knowledge; and just as our faults only trouble us insofar as we know them, you have this kind of advantage over us, of not seeing as clearly all that you lack.

Eudoxus: Is it possible, Epistemon, that you, who are so learned, can believe that there is in nature an evil so universal that no remedy can be brought to it? As for me, I think that, just as in every country there are enough fruits and streams to appease the hunger and thirst of all men, so there are enough truths that one can know in every subject to satisfy the curiosity of healthy minds; and I believe that the body of a dropsical person is hardly sicker than the mind of those who are perpetually agitated by an insatiable curiosity.

Epistemon: I have indeed heard it said in the past that our desires could not extend to things that seem impossible to us; but one can know so many things that are clearly within our reach, and which are not only honorable and agreeable, but also useful for the conduct of life, that I do not believe that anyone ever knows enough not to always have legitimate reasons to desire to know more.

**Eudoxus:** What would you say of me, then, if I assured you that I no longer feel any desire to learn anything, and that I am as content with my little knowledge as Diogenes was of his barrel in the past, and that without needing his philosophy? Indeed, the knowledge of my neighbors is not the limit of mine, like their fields which surround on all sides this little piece of land that I possess here; and my mind, disposing at its pleasure of all the truths it has found, does not think of discovering others, and it enjoys the same rest as the king of a country that would be isolated enough from all others for that king to imagine that beyond his borders there are only barren deserts and uninhabitable mountains.

**Epistemon:** If any other man than you spoke to me like this, I would regard him as a proud or insufficiently curious mind; but the retreat you have chosen in this solitude, and the little care you take to shine, remove from you any suspicion of ostentation, and the time you once devoted to travels, to visiting scholars, to examining all that each science contained that was most difficult, assures us that you do not lack curiosity. So I can only say that you are entirely content, and that your knowledge is truly superior to that of others.

**Eudoxus:** I thank you for the good opinion you have of me; but I do not want to abuse your politeness to the point of wanting you to believe what I have just said solely on the faith of my words. One must not put forward opinions so far removed from common belief without being able to show some of their effects at the same time; that is why I beg you both to please spend this beautiful season here, so that I can show you a part of the things I know. I dare to flatter myself that not only will you recognize that I have reasons to be content, but that moreover you yourselves will be very pleased with what you will have learned.



Here's the English translation:

**Epistemon:** I do not want to refuse a favor that I so ardently desired.

**Polyamander:** And I will have great pleasure in attending this conversation, although I am not convinced that I can draw any benefit from it.

**Eudoxus:** Quite the contrary, Polyamander, believe that it will not be without use for you, because your mind is preoccupied by no prejudice, and it will be easier for me to bring a neutral mind to the right side than Epistemon, whom we will often find on the opposing side. But, to make you understand more easily the nature of the knowledge I am going to discuss with you, allow me, I beg you, to note a difference that exists between the sciences and the simple knowledge that is acquired without the aid of reasoning, such as languages, history, geography, and in general everything that depends only on experience. I readily grant that the life of a man would not suffice to acquire the experience of all that the world contains; but I am persuaded that it would be folly to desire it, and that it is no more the duty of an honest man to know Greek or Latin than Swiss or Lower Breton, nor the history of the Holy Roman Empire than that of the smallest state in Europe; and I think that he should only devote his leisure to good and useful things, and fill his memory only with the most necessary. As for the sciences, which are nothing other than judgments that we base on some previously acquired knowledge, some are deduced from common and universally known objects, others from rarer and deliberately made experiments. I admit that it is impossible for us to deal in particular with each of these latter; for we would first have to examine all the herbs and all the stones that are brought here from the Indies; we would have to have seen the phoenix, in a word, to be ignorant of none of the most marvelous secrets of nature. But I will believe I have sufficiently fulfilled my promise if, in explaining to you the truths that can be deduced from common and universally known things, I teach you thereafter to find all the others yourselves, if you think it good to seek them.



**Polyamander:** For my part, I believe that is all we can desire; and I would be content if you taught me a certain number of those propositions that are so famous that no one is ignorant of them, such as those concerning Divinity, the soul, the virtues, their reward, etc., propositions that I compare to those ancient families that are recognized by all as very illustrious, although their titles are hidden beneath the ruins of times past. Indeed, I do not doubt that those who first led humankind to believe all these things employed excellent reasons to prove them; but they have since been so rarely repeated that no one knows them; and yet these are truths of such importance that prudence leads us to have blind faith in them, at the risk of being mistaken, rather than waiting for the future life to be better informed about them.

**Epistemon:** As for me, I am a little more curious, and I would gladly have you explain certain particular difficulties that present themselves to me in each science, and principally in what concerns the secrets of the arts, apparitions, illusions, in a word all the admirable effects that are attributed to magic. I think it is useful to know all this, not to make use of it, but so as not to let one's judgment be surprised by the admiration of an unknown thing.

**Eudoxus:** I will try to satisfy both of you; and, to use an order that we can maintain until the end, I desire first, Polyamander, that we speak of all the things that the world contains, considering them in themselves; and on condition that Epistemon interrupts our discourse as little as possible, because his objections would often force us to abandon our subject. Afterwards, we will consider all these things again, but from another angle, insofar as they relate to us, and as they can be called true or false, good or bad. It is there that Epistemon will find the opportunity to expound all the difficulties that will remain for him from the preceding discussions.


Here's the English translation:

**Polyamander:** Tell us then what order you will follow in explaining each thing.

**Eudoxus:** We must begin with the soul of man, because all our knowledge depends on it; and, after having considered its nature and its effects, we will arrive at its author. When we know who he is and how he created all the things that are in the world, we will note what is most certain about the other creatures; we will examine how our senses perceive things, and how our knowledge becomes false or true. Then I will place before your eyes the works of man on corporeal objects; and, after having struck you with admiration at the sight of the most powerful machines, the rarest automata, the most specious visions, and the most subtle tricks that art can invent, I will reveal their secrets to you, which are so simple that you will henceforth admire nothing in the works of our hands. After that, I will come to the works of nature, and, after having shown you the cause of all its changes, the diversity of its qualities, and the reason why the soul of plants and animals differs from ours, I will give you the architecture of sensible things to consider. The phenomena of the sky observed, and the certain conclusions that can be drawn from them, deduced, I will rise to the soundest conjectures about what man cannot determine positively, to try to account for the relation of sensible things to intellectual ones, and of both to the Creator, of the immortality of creatures, and of their state after the consummation of the ages. Then we will come to the second part of this conversation, in which we will deal especially with all the sciences, choosing from each what is most solid, and we will propose a method to push them much further, and to find for ourselves, with an ordinary mind, what the most subtle can discover. After having thus prepared our intelligence to judge perfectly of the truth, we must still accustom ourselves to direct our will by distinguishing good from evil, and by observing the true difference that is between virtue and vice. That done, I hope that your ardor to know will not be so violent, and all that I tell you will seem so well proven that you will come to believe that a man of sound mind, even if he had been raised in a desert, and had never been enlightened except by the lights of nature, could not, if he weighed the same reasons, embrace an opinion different from ours. To begin this discourse, we must examine what is the first knowledge of man, in what part of the soul it resides, and why in the beginning it is so imperfect.


Here's the English translation:

**Epistemon:** All of that seems to me to be explained very clearly, if one compares the imagination of children to a blank slate on which our ideas, which are like the vivid image of objects, must be painted. The senses, the inclinations of the mind, teachers, and intelligence are the various painters who can do this work, and among them, those least suited to succeed begin it; that is to say, imperfect senses, blind instinct, and foolish nurses. Finally comes the best of all, intelligence; and yet is it still necessary for it to undergo an apprenticeship of several years, and follow the example of its teachers for a long time, before daring to rectify a single one of their errors? That, in my opinion, is one of the main causes of the difficulty we have in attaining science. Our senses, in fact, perceive only what is most crude and common; our instinct is entirely corrupted; and as for teachers, although one can certainly find good ones, they cannot, however, force us to have faith in their reasoning, and to acknowledge it before having examined it with our intelligence, which alone has the power to do so. But it is like a skilled painter, who, called upon to put the finishing touches on a painting sketched by apprentices, could employ all the rules of art in vain, correcting little by little, now one stroke, now another, finally adding all that is missing, yet could not prevent great flaws from remaining, because in the beginning the painting would have been poorly outlined, the figures misplaced, and the proportions observed with little rigor.

**Eudoxus:** Your comparison perfectly sets before our eyes the first obstacle that stops us; but you do not show the way to avoid it. Now, according to me, here it is: just as your painter would have done better, after erasing all the strokes of the painting, to start it entirely anew, than to waste his time correcting it; likewise, all men who have reached the age when intelligence begins to be in its strength should form the design of erasing from their imagination all the inaccurate ideas that have been engraved there until then, and seriously apply all the forces of their intelligence to form new ones. Certainly, if this means did not lead them to perfection, at least they would no longer have the right to blame the weakness of the senses and the errors of nature.



Here's the English translation:

**Epistemon:** That would be the best way if one could easily employ it; but you are not unaware that the first opinions that our imagination has received remain so deeply imprinted there that our will alone, if it did not implore the aid of some strong reasons, could not succeed in erasing them.

**Eudoxus:** It is precisely some of these reasons that I intend to teach you; and if you want to derive some benefit from this conversation, you must lend me all your attention, and let me converse with Polyamander, so that I can begin by overturning all his acquired knowledge. Indeed, since it is not enough to satisfy him, it can only be bad, and I compare it to a poorly constructed building whose foundations are not solid enough. I know of no better remedy than to demolish it and overturn it from top to bottom, in order to erect a new one. For I do not want to be numbered among those unskilled artisans who only apply themselves to restoring old works, because at bottom they are incapable of completing new ones. But, Polyamander, while we are occupied in destroying this edifice, we can at the same time lay the foundations that can serve our purpose, and prepare the most solid material to succeed in it; provided that you are willing to examine with me which, of all the truths that men can know, are the most certain and the easiest to know.

**Polyamander:** Is there anyone who doubts that sensible things (by which I mean those that are seen and touched) are much more certain than others? For my part, I would be very surprised if you showed me as clearly some of the things that are said about God and our soul.

**Eudoxus:** That is nevertheless what I hope to do, and it seems surprising to me that men are credulous enough to base their knowledge on the certainty of the senses, when there is no one who is unaware that they sometimes deceive us, and that we have good reasons to always distrust them, since once they were able to lead us into error.

**Polyamander:** I know well that the senses sometimes deceive us when they suffer, thus a sick person believes that all food is bitter; when they are too far from the object, thus the stars never appear to us as large as they really are; in general, when they do not act freely according to their nature. But all their errors are easy to recognize, and do not prevent me from being persuaded that I see you, that we are walking in a garden, that the sun is shining, in a word, that everything my senses usually offer me is true.



Here's the English translation:

**Eudoxus:** Since it is not enough for me to tell you that the senses deceive us in certain cases where you are well aware of it, to make you fear being deceived by them on other occasions when you do not know it, I will go further, and ask you if you have never seen a melancholic man of the kind who believes himself to be a vase filled with water, or who thinks he has some part of his body of an immoderate size; they would swear that they see and touch this as they imagine it. It is true, however, that the one to whom it would be said that he has no more reason than they to believe his opinion certain would be indignant, since both rely equally on the data of the senses and the imagination. But without going that far, you cannot be angry if I asked you if you are not, like other men, subject to sleep, and if you cannot think while sleeping that you see me, that you are walking in this garden, that the sun is shining, in a word, a thousand other things that you think you see very clearly today. Have you never heard in old comedies this formula of astonishment, "Am I sleeping?" How can you be certain that your life is not a perpetual dream, and that everything you learn through the senses is not as false as when you are sleeping, especially knowing that you were created by a superior being, to whom in his omnipotence it would have been no more difficult to create us as I have described, than as you believe yourselves to be?

**Polyamander:** These are certainly reasons that would suffice to overthrow all of Epistemon's knowledge, if he could give it his full attention; as for me, I would fear being ever so slightly mad if, never having applied myself to study, nor accustomed to turning my mind away from sensible things, I were to apply it to meditations that surpass my strength.

**Epistemon:** I think it is very dangerous to go too far in this way of reasoning; universal doubts of this kind lead us straight to the ignorance of Socrates, or to the uncertainty of the Pyrrhonians, which is like a deep water where one cannot find footing.



Here's the English translation:

**Eudoxus:** I admit that it is not without great danger that one ventures there without a guide, when one does not know the ford, and that many have even been lost there; but you must fear nothing if you follow my steps. It is such fears, in fact, that have prevented many learned men from acquiring knowledge solid and certain enough to merit the name of science; they imagined that there was nothing firmer and more solid on which they could base their faith than sensible things; so they built on this sand rather than seeking a firm ground by digging deeper. It is not here that we must stop. There is more; even if you did not subsequently examine the reasons I have just given you, they would nevertheless have fulfilled their main purpose, the one I wanted to achieve, if they have struck your mind enough to put you on your guard. They show, in fact, that your knowledge is not so infallible that you should not fear seeing its foundations overturned, since they make you doubt everything, and you already doubt your very knowledge. They prove, furthermore, that I have fulfilled my goal, which was to overturn your knowledge by showing you its uncertainty. But, lest you refuse to follow me further, I declare to you that these doubts, which frightened you at the beginning, are like those phantoms and vain images that appear in the night in the uncertain light of a faint lamp. Fear pursues you if you flee them, but approach them, touch them, you will find only wind, only a shadow, and you will be reassured forever.

**Polyamander:** So be it: I desire then, vanquished by your reasons, to represent to myself all these difficulties in their greatest possible force, and to apply myself to doubting whether by chance I have not been delirious all my life, whether even all these ideas that I believed entered my mind, so to speak, through the door of the senses, could not have formed themselves, just as similar ideas form when I sleep, or when I have the certainty that my eyes are closed, my ears blocked, in a word that none of my senses has anything to do with it. In this way I will doubt not only whether you are in the world, whether there exists an earth, whether there is a sun, but also whether I have eyes, ears, a body, whether I am even speaking with you, whether you are addressing me, in a word I will doubt all things.

**Eudoxus:** You are now very well prepared, and that is where I wanted to lead you; but now is the moment to pay attention to the consequences I want to draw from it. You see clearly that you can reasonably doubt all the things whose knowledge reaches you only through the senses; but can you doubt your doubt, and remain uncertain whether you doubt or not?



**Polyamander:** I confess that this astonishes me, and the little perspicacity that a rather meager common sense gives me makes it so that I cannot help but be stupefied to admit that I know nothing with certainty, but that I doubt everything, and that I am certain of nothing. But what do you want to conclude from this? I do not see what purpose this universal astonishment can serve, nor for what reason a doubt of this kind can be a principle that we must deduce from so far away. Quite the contrary, you gave as the goal of this conversation to rid us of our doubts, and to teach us to find truths that Epistemon, learned as he is, might well ignore.

**Eudoxus:** Just lend me your attention; I will lead you further than you think. Indeed, it is from this universal doubt that, as from a fixed and immutable point, I have resolved to derive the knowledge of God, of yourself, and of all that the world contains.

**Polyamander:** These are certainly great promises, and they are well worth it, provided that you fulfill them, that we grant you what you ask. Keep your promises, then, and we will keep ours.

**Eudoxus:** Since then you cannot deny that you doubt, and on the contrary it is certain that you doubt, and so certain that you cannot doubt even that, it is also true that you are, you who doubt; and this is so true that you cannot doubt it any further.

**Polyamander:** I agree with you; for, if I were not, I could not doubt.

**Eudoxus:** You are then, and you know that you are, and you know this because you doubt.

**Polyamander:** All of that is very true.

**Eudoxus:** But, so that you are not diverted from your purpose, let us advance little by little, and, as I told you, you will feel yourself drawn further than you believe. You are, and you know that you are, and you know this because you know that you doubt. But, you who doubt everything and who cannot doubt yourself, who are you?
