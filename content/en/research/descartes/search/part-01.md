{{< r a="Polyamander" >}}
You have learned all these beautiful things in Greek and Latin books.

If I had devoted as much time as you to these studies, I would be as different from what I am now as angels are from you. 

<!-- I cannot excuse the mistake of my parents, who, persuaded that letters soften the mind, sent me to court and to the camps at such a tender age that I will have my whole life to lament my ignorance, if I do not learn something in your conversations. -->
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Epistemon" >}}
The best thing you could learn there is that the desire to know, which is common to all men, is an evil that cannot be cured. 

For curiosity increases with knowledge; and just as our faults only trouble us insofar as we know them, you have this kind of advantage over us, of not seeing as clearly all that you lack.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Eudoxus" >}}
Do you believe that there is in nature an evil so universal that no remedy can be brought to it?

I believe that there are enough truths that one can know in every subject to satisfy the curiosity of healthy minds.

This is the same as country has enough fruits and streams to appease the hunger and thirst of all men.

<!-- I believe that the body of a dropsical person is hardly sicker than the mind of those who are perpetually agitated by an insatiable curiosity. -->
{{< /l >}}



{{< r a="Epistemon" >}}
I have heard it said in the past that:
- our desires could not extend to seemingly impossible things
- one can know so many things that are within our reach, which are honorable, agreeable, and useful for life

<!-- , that I do not believe that anyone ever knows enough not to always have legitimate reasons to desire to know more. -->
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Eudoxus" >}}
I no longer feel any desire to learn anything. 

I am as content with my little knowledge as Diogenes was of his barrel.

 <!-- in the past, and that without needing his philosophy. -->


The knowledge of my neighbors is not the limit of mine, like their fields which surround on all sides this little piece of land that I possess here.

My mind uses all the truths it has found. It does not think of discovering others.It enjoys the same rest as the king of an isolated country.

 <!-- that would be isolated enough from all others for that king to imagine that beyond his borders there are only barren deserts and uninhabitable mountains. -->
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Epistemon" >}}
If another man told me what you told me, I would think of him as proud or insufficiently curious

<!-- but the retreat you have chosen in this solitude, and the little care you take to shine, remove from you any suspicion of ostentation, and the time you once devoted to travels, to visiting scholars, to examining all that each science contained that was most difficult, assures us that you do not lack curiosity. -->

You are entirely content that your knowledge is truly superior to that of others.

{{< r a="Eudoxus" >}}
Thank you for your good opinion of me.

<!-- But I do not want to abuse your politeness to the point of wanting you to believe what I have just said solely on the faith of my words. 

One must not put forward opinions so far removed from common belief without being able to show some of their effects at the same time; that is why I beg you both to please spend this beautiful season here, so that  -->

I would like to show you a part of the things I know.

<!-- I dare to flatter myself that not only will you recognize that I have reasons to be content, but that moreover you yourselves will be very pleased with what you will have learned. -->
{{< /r >}}


<!-- **Epistemon:** I do not want to refuse a favor that I so ardently desired. -->


{{< r a="Polyamander" >}}
I will have great pleasure in attending this conversation, although I am not convinced that I can draw any benefit from it.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Eudoxus" >}}
What I will say is useful.

<!-- Quite the contrary, Polyamander, believe that it will not be without use for you, because your mind is preoccupied by no prejudice, and it will be easier for me to bring a neutral mind to the right side than Epistemon, whom we will often find on the opposing side.

But, to make you understand more easily the nature of the knowledge I am going to discuss with you, allow me, I beg you, to note  -->

There is a difference between the sciences and the simple knowledge that is acquired without the aid of reasoning [i.e. only intuition], such as languages, history, geography, and everything that depends only on experience. 

The life of a man would not suffice to acquire the experience of all that the world contains.

But it would be folly to want to experience all.

 <!-- desire it, and that it is no more the duty of an honest man to know Greek or Latin than Swiss or Lower Breton, nor the history of the Holy Roman Empire than that of the smallest state in Europe -->

**I think that we should only devote our leisure to good and useful things, and fill our memory only with the most necessary.** 

The sciences are merely judgments based on some previously acquired knowledge.

Some are deduced from common and universally known objects. Others are from rarer and deliberately made experiments. 

It is impossible for us to deal with each of these latter. For we would first have to examine all the herbs and all the stones that are brought here from the Indies.

We would have to have seen the phoenix, in a word, to be ignorant of none of the most marvelous secrets of nature. 

<!-- But I will believe I have sufficiently fulfilled my promise if, in explaining to you the truths that can be deduced from common and universally known things, I teach you thereafter to find all the others yourselves, if you think it good to seek them. -->
{{< /l >}}


{{< r a="Polyamander" >}}
I believe that is all we can desire.

<!-- I would be content if you taught me a certain number of those propositions that are so famous that no one is ignorant of them, such as those concerning Divinity, the soul, the virtues, their reward, etc., propositions that I compare to those ancient families that are recognized by all as very illustrious, although their titles are hidden beneath the ruins of times past. 

I do not doubt that those who first led humankind to believe all these things employed excellent reasons to prove them; 

but they have since been so rarely repeated that no one knows them; and yet these are truths of such importance that prudence leads us to have blind faith in them, at the risk of being mistaken, rather than waiting for the future life to be better informed about them. -->
{{< /r >}}


{{< r a="Epistemon" >}}
I am a little more curious. 

Please explain particular difficulties in each science, and principally in what concerns the secrets of the arts, apparitions, illusions, and all the admirable effects that are attributed to magic.

I think it is useful to know all this, not to make use of it, but so as not to let one's judgment be surprised by the admiration of an unknown thing.
{{< /r >}}


{{< l a="Eudoxus" >}}
I will try to satisfy both of you.

We will first speak of all the things that the world contains, considering them in themselves and on condition that Epistemon interrupts our discourse as little as possible, because his objections would often force us to abandon our subject. 

Afterwards, we will consider all these things again, but from another angle, insofar as they relate to us, and as they can be called true or false, good or bad.

It is there that Epistemon will find the opportunity to expound all the difficulties that will remain for him from the preceding discussions.

<!-- **Polyamander:** Tell us then what order you will follow in explaining each thing. -->
