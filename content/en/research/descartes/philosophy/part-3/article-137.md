## 138. Why the tails of comets are sometimes a little curved, not always straight, nor directly opposite the Sun.


The tail or hair of comets does not always appear completely straight [going from the comet to the sun in a line]. 

Instead, it:
- deviates or bends from it somewhat. 
- does not always appear equally broad
  - Sometimes it appears narrower
  - Sometimes it appears brighter when the rays that come from its sides converge toward the eye

All of these are caused by the the sphere `DEFGH` not being regular. 

Its shape is flatter towards the poles [minor axis of ellipse] than elsewhere.
- This is why the tails of the Comets are straighter and broader at the poles. 
<!-- - The tails of comets must be straighter and broader there. -->

But when the tails extend obliquely across between the poles and the ecliptic, [major axis of ellipse] they are curved and bend a little from the line that passes through the centers of the Sun and the comet.

Finally, when they extend farther in those regions, they are brighter and narrower.


 <!-- than in other places. -->

<!-- I do not think that any observation ever made about comets—which should not be taken as fable nor as miracle—fails to have its reason explained here. -->
 
<!-- This coma or tail is sometimes:
- straight
- curved
- in a straight line, which passes through the centers of the Comet and the Sun
- deviating somewhat from it
- wider, narrower, or even brighter

These depend on the lateral rays converging towards the eye.

These show the irregularity of the spheroid `DEFGH`.
- Towards the poles, its shape is flatter
  
This makes the tails of Comets appear straighter and wider.
- In the bend between the poles and the ecliptic, this makes it appear more curved
- Deviating from the opposite Sun and according to the length of this bend, it appears brighter and narrower. 

All the causes explained here have been observed so far about Comets in reality. -->

<!-- , at least not anything to be considered neither as a fable nor as a miracle, whose cause is not here.  -->


## 139. Why do such comae not appear around Fixed Stars or around the higher planets Jupiter and Saturn?

This is because: 

1. They are not usually seen in Comets.

This is because their apparent diameter is not greater than that of fixed stars, because then these secondary rays do not have enough strength to move the eyes.

2. The fixed stars emit light from themselves.

This would cause their coma, if there is any, to scattered and be very brief.

<!-- Indeed it seems to be such around them: for they -->

Stars do not appear circumscribed by a uniform line. Instead, they are surrounded by wandering rays from all sides.

This also causes their twinkling.

<!-- and perhaps not incorrectly we will also refer their twinkling (of which, however, there may be several other causes) to this.  -->

Jupiter and Saturn have very clear atmospheres. 
- This causes short comae sometimes to appear from around their dark sides. 

<!--  part opposing the sun. 

 even , extending towards the part away from the Sun may be seen around them. -->

I have read something like this somewhere, though I do not recall the author.

Aristotle says in his Meteorology, book 1, chapter 6 on the fixed stars, that they have been seen as comets by the Egyptians sometimes.

<!-- , I think it should be understood about these planets;  -->

He says he saw a comet from one of the stars which are in the thigh of the Dog. This would have been:
- a very oblique refraction in the air, or
- a defect of his eyes

This is because he says that it was less conspicuous when he was focusing his eyes on it than when he was looking away.
