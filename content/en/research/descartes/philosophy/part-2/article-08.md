<!-- substance with idea -->

## 8. The mental size and quantity of something is different from its physical size and quantity.

<!-- (RATIONE)  -->

For example, we can imagine a 10 feet long thing in our minds, even if it does not measure 10 feet in reality. 

 <!-- feet, without paying attention to the specific measurement of ten feet—because this thing is of the same nature in each of its parts as in the whole—and although  -->

We can think of the number ten by itself. 

 <!-- although we can conceive of a continuous size of ten feet without reflecting on this or that particular thing, even though we cannot conceive it without something extended—nonetheless, it is clear that  -->

But if we remove:
- a part of a thing's size or aetherspace [extension], then we also remove a part of the thing.
- a part of the thing, we necessarily remove just as much of its size or aetherspace [extension].

<!-- Conversely, the number ten can be understood, as well as the continuous quantity of ten feet, even if we do not attend to that determinate substance: because the concept of the number ten is plainly the same, whether it is referred to this measure of ten feet or to anything else.

The continuous quantity of ten feet, although it cannot be understood without some extended substance of which it is the quantity, can nevertheless be understood without this determinate substance. 

But in reality, it cannot happen that the smallest part of this quantity or extension be removed without an equal part also being taken away from the substance; nor conversely, that the smallest part of the substance be removed without an equal part of quantity and extension also being taken away. -->

<!-- The following are different only in our minds, but not in physical reality:
- Actual quantity-thought versus metaphysical quantity-idea
- Actual numbered-thought versus metaphysical number-idea

For example, we see a log that we estimate to measure 10 feet.*
- The 10-feet-estimate is our thought of its occupied space which is different from our ideal [substance] of 10 feet of space.
- Yet we do not make a distinction between both because the 10-foot-idea is understood to represent the 10-foot-estimate  -->

<!-- n n="This is spacetime">}} -->

<!-- Conversely, the idea of 10 feet* can be understood without looking at the log. This is even if the 10 feet needs a representation of something so that the idea of 10 feet can be understood [in discussion?].  

n n="This is timespace">}}

But in reality, the following cannot happen:
- the smallest part of this quantity-thought is only removed when an equal part is also removed from the quantity-idea 
- the smallest part of the quantity-idea is only removed when  an equal part is also removed from the quantity-thought 
- conversely, that the smallest part of the substance be removed without 
 without thinking of this determinate substance, we can conceive both*:
- the number 10
- 10 feet (as a continuous quantity) -->

<!-- This is because the concept of the number 10 is the same in 10 feet, 10 things, etc.  -->

 <!-- whether we consider a number of 10 feet or 10 of anything else. -->

<!-- We can conceive a continuous quantity of 10 feet without thinking of this or that determinate substance, 

Although we cannot conceive 10 feet without some extended substance of which it is the quantity. 

It is in reality, however, impossible that any, even the least part, of such quantity or extension, can be taken away, without the retrenchment at the same time of as much of the substance, nor, on the other hand, can we lessen the substance, without at the same time taking as much from the quantity or extension. -->


## 9. The physical substance cannot be clearly conceived without its aetherspace [extension]

<!-- , when distinguished from its number, is confusedly thought of as incorporeal. -->

<!-- If some people explain this subject differently, I do not think they conceive anything other than what I have just stated.  -->

Some people distinguish a thing's substance [idea-body] from its aetherspace [extension] and its physical size.

Such people either:
- mean nothing by the word “substance” or
- they have a confused idea of immaterial substance,which they attribute to material substance

In so doing, they:
- leave the aetherspace [extension] with the true idea of that material substance.
- yet call material substance an “accident” so inappropriately that their words do not match their thoughts.


<!-- Physical matter, when distinguished from metaphysical quantity, is confusedly conceived as something metaphysical.

When people distinguish physical matter from metaphysical space or number, they either:
- mean nothing by the word "physical matter", or
- form in their minds merely a confused idea of metaphysical substance, which they falsely think to be physical. 

Then they leave to metaphysical space the true idea of this physical matter.
- This metaphysical space they call an accident. But this means that their words are not in harmony with their thoughts.   -->

<!-- And although perhaps some may say otherwise, I do not think they perceive anything else; but  -->




<!-- People who distinguish substance from size or number actually do not know what incorporeal substance means. 
- They think that substance is physical. 

They thus think that a corporeal substance has a [metaphysical] size which they nevertheless call an accident.

And so they express something quite different from what they comprehend in their mind. -->


## 10. What is space or internal place?

Space, or internal place, and the body contained within that space differ only in our thinking. 

In fact, the same aetherspace [extension] in length, width, and height that constitutes a body's [atomic] space also constitutes the body.

The difference between them is that: 

- We attribute to the body its own aetherspace [extension].
  - We think that that aetherspace [extension] changes position and goes with it whenever it is moved.
- But we attribute to space a vague aetherspace [extension].

When we move a body from a space we do not think that we have also moved that space’s [aetherspace] extension.

This is because we see that same aetherspace [extension] always there as long as it has the same size, shape, and has not changed location with respect to the external bodies by which we define it.


<!-- corporeal substance -->
<!-- Space or internal place, and the physical matter in it, are not different in reality.

They are merely different in the mode conceived by us. 

The same extension in length, width, and height, which constitutes space, constitutes body. -->

<!-- Their only difference is that **in body, we consider extension as particular, and conceive it to change with the body**. Whereas in space **we attribute a generic unity to extension**. -->

<!-- Their only difference is that **we see the space occupied by the body as different from the body**. Whereas we see space **to be united to extension**.

- After a body has occupied a space, we know that the extension of that space was not removed at the same time. The same extension remains there so long as it is of the same size and shape, and preserves the same location relative to certain bodies around it, by means of which we determine this space. -->

<!-- - After taking from a certain space the body which occupied it, we do not suppose that we have at the same time removed the extension of the space. This is because it appears to us that the same extension remains there so long as it is of the same magnitude and shape, and preserves the same location relative to certain bodies around it, by means of which we determine this space. -->


## 11. Space is the same as the body that it contains

<!-- Space, in reality, is not different from corporeal substance -->

The same aetherspace [extension] which constitutes the nature of a body also constitutes the nature of space.
- The aetherspace is specific.
- Space is general. 

Get a stone and remove everything that does not pertain to the nature of body:
- Remove hardness because the stone can be ground into soft powder, yet it will still be a body. 
- Remove color since some stones are transparent and have no color.
- Remove weight because we see that fire, though very light, remains a body. 
- Remove cold, heat, and other such qualities because we *believe* that these do not exist intrinsically in the stone

The stone’s nature does not change just because it is hot at one time and cold at another. 

Our true idea of the stone is seeing it as a substance extended in length, width, and height.

Length, width, and height is in our idea of space whether:
- space that is filled with bodies [aetherspace]
- but even what we call empty space [spacetime]
