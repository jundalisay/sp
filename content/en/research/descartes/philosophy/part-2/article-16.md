## 16. There can be no Void

Void is an empty space where there is no substance.

No such space exists in the universe.

This is because the extension of space or of internal place is the same as the extension of body.

A substance is anything that has aetherspace [extension] in length, width, and height.
- This is because we cannot conceive of a “nothing” that has the aetherspace [extension]

Empty space has length, width, and height. 
- Therefore, it must necessarily also contain substance [as the aetherspace].*

{{< n n="This is because our minds are able to impose a length, width and depth to empty space, but not to a Void" >}}


<!-- The philosophical void is a space where there is no substance . It does not exist since  the extension of space or internal place is not different from that of body. 

The philosophical vacuum is a space where there is no substance. It does not exist since  the extension of space or internal place is not different from that of body. 

Since a body has extension in length, width, and height, it follows that it is a substance. 

It is absolutely contradictory that nothing should possess extension. And so we should form a similar inference regarding the space which is supposed void, viz., that ***since there is extension in it there is necessarily also substance.*** -->


## 17. The word “void” in everyday language does not exclude all kinds of body

In everyday speech, we use the word “void” for an empty place.

"Void" here means that that place lacks whatever we expected to be there. 
- It does not mean a total lack of anything. 

For example:
- a jug is made to hold water.
  - We say that it is empty when it contains only air.
- a pond usually has fish
  - If there are no fish, we say there is nothing in it even if it is full of water. 

Similarly, we say a ship is empty when, instead of being loaded with its usual cargo, it is filled only with sand to help it resist the force of the wind.

We use the word “void” in the same sense when we say a space is empty.
- We mean that it contains nothing perceptible to us even if it may still contain created matter and extended substance [aetherspace]. 

This is because we normally consider nearby bodies only if they cause strong enough impressions on our senses for us to perceive them.

This is why when we see an empty jug, we mistakenly say that it is void.
- This is because we cannot see the air in it, not because we think that air is not a real thing or substance.


<!-- And if, instead of remembering what we should mean by “void” or “nothing,” we later think that a space where our senses detect nothing contains no created thing, we would be making a mistake as obvious as imagining that a jug containing only air holds nothing at all,  -->

<!-- 
The common 'vacuum' does not mean a place or space in which there is absolutely nothing.

**It means a place in which there is none of those things which we presume should be there.** 

A pitcher is made to hold water.
- It is said to be empty when it is merely filled with air.

A fish-pond is meant to hold fish.
- It has nothing if there are no fish in it although it is full of water.

Thus, a vessel is said to be empty when, in place of the merchandise which it was designed to carry, it is loaded with sand only, to enable it to resist the violence of the wind.

Finally, it is in the same sense that we say space is void when it contains nothing sensible, although it contain created and self-subsisting matter. For we are not in the habit of considering the bodies near us, unless in so far as they cause in our organs of sense, impressions strong enough to enable us to perceive them.  -->

<!-- If, in place of keeping in mind what ought to be understood by these terms a vacuum and nothing, we afterwards suppose that in the space we called a vacuum, there is not only no sensible object, but no object at all, we will fall into the same error as if, because a -->

<!-- We are wrong to say that a pitcher that only has air is empty, because it makes us regard air as not being a substance (RES SUBSISTENS).

In the same way, we are wrong if we say that a common vacuum has nothing, or is empty. -->


## 18. How we can correct the false opinion about void

<!-- Nearly all of us have been influenced by this mistaken idea from the very beginning of our lives—namely, that since  -->

There is no necessary connection between a vessel and its contents.
- And so it seems to us that God could remove the contents of the vessel while preserving the vessel itself unchanged, without requiring new content to replace the removed one.

Although there is no necessary link between the vessel and its contents, there is an absolutely necessary connection **between the concave shape of the vessel and the aetherspace [extension] that exists within that concavity.**

It is absurd to imagine:
- a mountain without a valley
- a hollow shape without any aetherspace [extension] in it

It is impossible to have length, width, height [extension] without something having that length, width, height.
- This is because nothingness cannot have length, width, height 
 <!-- extension. -->

Therefore, if God removed the contents of a vessel without replacing it, then the sides of the vessel would collapse inward.
- They would immediately touch each other.

<!-- become so close that  -->

This is because 2 bodies must touch whenever there is nothing between them.

It would be a contradiction to say that:
- 2 bodies are separated by a distance
- at the same time, this distance is nothing.

Distance is a property of length, width, height [extension].
- Length, width, height cannot exist without something having that length, width, height
<!-- - Extension cannot exist without something extended. -->


<!-- We have almost all fallen into this error from the earliest age.

We observe that there is no necessary connection between a vessel and its contents. 

This makes us think that God can remove its contents without replacing what was removed.  -->

<!-- But that we may be able now to correct this false opinion, it is necessary to remark that  -->

<!-- In truth, there is no connection between the vessel and its contents.  -->

<!-- the particular body which it contains. -->

<!-- But there is an absolutely necessary connection between:
- the vessel's concave shape, and
- the general extension [metaphysical space] in that cavity.

A mountain has a valley just as a cavity has extension [metaphysical space].
- The extension [metaphysical space] has extended substance [metaphysical aether] -->

<!-- , for, as we have often said, of nothing there can be no extension.  -->

<!-- If God removed all the space from inside a vessel, then its sides would collapse inward.  -->

 <!-- all the body contained in it, without permitting another body to occupy its place, then the sides of the vessel would thus come into proximity with each other.  -->

<!-- This is because 2 bodies must touch each other when there is nothing between them. -->

<!-- It is contradictory for two bodies to be apart, in other words, that there should be a distance between them, and this distance yet be nothing.  -->

<!-- **For all distance is a mode of extension [metaphysical space], and cannot therefore exist without an extended substance [metaphysical aether].** -->
