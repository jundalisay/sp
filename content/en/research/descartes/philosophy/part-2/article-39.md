## 39. The Second law of nature: Every motion in itself is straight. Things which move in a circular manner  always tend to move away from the center of the circle which they describe.


The second law of nature is: each particle of matter, considered separately, moves only along straight lines.

Many are often forced to deflect due to encounters with others.

All the matter moving together forms a circular pattern. 

This has the same cause as the First Law -- the immutability and simplicity of how God preserves motion in matter.

He preserves it precisely every time, without any consideration of what it might have been earlier.

No motion happens in an instant. Yet everything which is moved, in each instant while it is being moved, continues its motion in a straight line, never along a curved line. 

<!-- For example, the stone A, rotated in the sling EA through the circle ABF, at the instant when it is at point A, is indeed determined to move towards some part, namely according to the straight line towards C, so that the straight line AC is the tangent of the circle. However, it cannot be imagined to be determined towards any curved motion: for although it previously came from L to A through a curved line, nothing of that curvature can be understood to remain in it while it is at point A. And this is also confirmed by experience, because if it then exits the sling, it does not continue to move towards B, but towards C. From this it follows that any body which moves in a circular manner perpetually tends to move away from the center of the circle it describes. As we experience with our very senses in the case of a stone, while we whirl it around in a sling. And because this consideration will often be used in what follows, it will be diligently noted and more fully explained below." -->


For example, let `A` be a stone rotating in the sling `DA` through the circle `ABF`.

 When it is at the point `A`, it moves along line towards `C`, so that the straight line `AC` is a tangent to the circle. 

<!-- before from L to A -->
But it cannot be supposed to be determined to any curved motion. Although it came along a curved line, this curvature does not remain in it while it is at the point `A`. 

This is also confirmed by experience, because if it then leaves the sling, it will not continue to move toward `B`, but towards `C`. 

From which it follows that every body which is moved circularly tends perpetually to recede from the center of the circle which it describes. 

We experience this by the very sense of touch in a stone while we whirl it around in the sling. 


## 40. The Third Law: A moving body loses its determination but not its motion when it hits a more powerful body. But if it hits a less powerful body, it will move it along with itself and transfer some of its motion.


Body `weak` has less force than body `strong`. If `weak`, moving in a straight line, hits `strong`, then `weak` will be deflected, retaining its motion but losing its direction.*

<!-- determination of its motion;  -->

<!-- But if `strong` were moving and hits `weak`, then `strong` will move `weak` with it. `strong` will lose as much of its own motion as it gives to `weak`. 

Thus, when hard bodies are projected and strike another hard body, they do not stop moving. Instead, they are reflected to the opposite direction.

On the contrary, when they encounter a soft body, they can easily transfer all their motion to it. This stops them. 

All the changes which happen to corporeal bodies are contained in this Third Law.

I do not look here into what force human or angelic minds have for moving bodies. That will be discussed in the Treatise on Man. -->

Thus, we see that a hard body we've pushed against another, larger body that is also hard and firm, bounces back to the side from which it came and loses none of its motion. 

However, if the body it encounters is soft, it stops immediately because it transfers its motion to it.

{{< n n="This explains friction when the deflected object is not allowed to fully deflect because of the irregulatrity of the surfaces" >}}

All the causes of changes that occur in bodies are included in this rule, at least those that are corporeal. 

I am not now inquiring whether **Angels and the thoughts of men have the force to move bodies**. I will answer that in the treatise on man.
