## 26. Effort is both needed for action and rest


<!-- it displaces while moving, and its slowness (since I assume it is calm and still), gradually diminishes its motion. -->

People wrongly think that more action is required for motion than for rest. 

This is because from a young age, our body is accustomed to be moved by our will.
- We notice our will.

We think that our body is at rest simply because of the gravity of the Earth.
- We do not notice gravity. 

Gravity and many other unnoticed causes resist the motions we want to initiate in our limbs. This causes us to tire.
- And so, we think that more force is needed to initiate motion than to stop it because we have mistaken action for the effort that we must exert to move our limbs.

<!-- , considering action as that effort we use to move our limbs and, with their help, other bodies.  -->

However, we can easily get rid of this prejudice if we think that we need effort to both:
- move external bodies
- stop their motion when they are not stopped by gravity or another cause. 

For example, we use the same force to:
- push a ship at rest in still water
- stop it when it is moving

We might experience that less effort is needed to stop the ship than to make it go.
- This is because the weight of the displaced water slows it down.*

<!-- In both, we counteract the weight of the water displaced by ship and its viscosity. -->

<!-- , by which it could gradually be stopped. -->



## 27. Motion and rest are merely two different modes of a moving body

 <!-- only with the translation and the absence of translation, that is, rest, it is clear that  -->

The mover produces motion just as the stopper stops the motion. We are not talking about either's action. 

Rest is the lack of translation of external action onto the body. 

Motion is the translation of external action onto the body. 

We are talking about the internal translation which cannot exist outside the moving body.

The body has a different state:
- when it is being transferred 
- when it is not being transferred or when it is at rest


<!--  **external causes of motion** and not internal ones. 

The external cause of motion causes motion. The lack of a cause leads to rest, as a lack of motion. -->

<!-- but only with translation and the absence of translation or rest, this translation cannot be motion outside the body, and that this body behaves differently when it is transferred, and differently when it is not transferred or when it is at rest, so that  -->

In this way, motion and rest are but 2 different modes of the body.


<!-- ### 28. Motion properly taken is not to be referred to, except to the bodies contiguous to it which are moved.  -->

## 28. Motion only happens when the body is moved from the bodies touching it

<!-- But when we take movement for the transport of a body which leaves the vicinity of those which it touches: It is certain that we cannot attribute to the same moving body more than one movement, because there is only a certain quantity of bodies which can touch it at the same time. -->

Motion occurs from the vicinity of contiguous bodies to the vicinity of others, not from one place to another. **This is because the concept of place [spot] varies and depends on our thought.** 

A body can have only one motion at a time, instead of multiple, if we define motion as the transfer of a body that occurs **from the vicinity of contiguous bodies**, instead of as a change in location. 

This is because at any given moment, **a moving body can only be contiguous to one set of bodies at one time**.

<!-- we cannot attribute multiple motions to that moving body simultaneously, but only one. -->

<!-- I have also added that translation is made from the vicinity of contiguous bodies to the vicinity of others, and not from one place to another, because, as I have explained above, the acceptance of place is varied and depends on our thought: but since by motion we understand that translation which is made from the vicinity of contiguous bodies, since only one body can be contiguous to the same mobile at the same moment of time, we cannot attribute several motions to this mobile at the same time, but only one. -->


<!-- ### 29. Nor are they to be referred to except to those bodies contiguous: which are looked upon as if they were at rest -->


## 29. Motion only happens when the bodies contiguous to the moving body are at rest.

This transfer occurs not just between any contiguous bodies, but only those that are perceived as being at rest.

This is because motion is reciprocal. 
- The body `AB` leaves the vicinity of the body `CD` just as `CD` leaves the vicinity of `AB`.
- As much action is necessary for one as for the other.

This is very different from the common way of regarding motion.

We are on Earth and think of it as being at rest even if its parts move.



## 30. When 2 contiguous bodies are separated from each other, why is one is said to be moving instead of the other? 

This is because motion is that of the body that is moving and not of the entire Earth that it is moving on.

The motion of the body affects the immediate vicinity of the smaller bodies that are contiguous. There are often many such translations, mutually opposed to each other. 

<!-- , and it cannot be so understood to be of the whole earth, because of the translation of some of its parts from the vicinity of smaller bodies to which they are contiguous; 
because often many such translations, mutually contrary to each other, can be observed in it.  -->

Let:
<!-- - `EFGH` be the Earth -->
- ship `AB` on the Earth's surface be transferred from `East` to `West`
- ship `CD` be transferred from `West` to `East`

{{< img src="/graphics/physics/relativity.jpg" alt="Movement" >}}


The motion of ship `AB` means that the surface of the earth contiguous to it are transferred from `B` towards `A` with the same action that moves `AB`. But it does not mean that the Earth is also rotating from `B` to `A` or from West to the East.  

This is because ship `CD` is moving East, and the Earth's surface contiguous to it should be moving West which is contradictory.  

Thus, here we do not say that the earth is moving, but only the ships `AB` and `CD` and similarly for the rest.
