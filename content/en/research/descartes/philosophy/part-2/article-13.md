## 12. Space is different from the aetherspace [extension] 

<!-- differs from body in our mode of conceiving it. -->

<!-- It is true that there is a difference in the way we think about it. For  -->

If a stone is removed from the place it occupied, we consider the aetherspace [extension] of the stone itself has been removed.

This is because we judge the aetherspace [extension] and body to be inseparable. 

Yet we also believe that the aetherspace [extension] of the former location of the stone persists, despite that area now appearing empty. 

 <!-- remains—despite the place now being filled with wood, water, air, or another body, or even appearing empty.  -->

This is because we think of extension in a general way.

We think that it can be common to stones, wood, water, air, and all other bodies, and even to the void (if it exists) as long as it keeps the same size, shape, and position relative to the external bodies that define that space.


<!-- There is, however, some difference between them in the mode of conception.

If we remove a stone from the place where it was, we see that its extension [of stone] is also taken away. This is because we regard its extension as particular and inseparable from the stone itself.

But the same extension of place where this stone was remains, even if that place is now occupied by air or even if it is vacant.

wood, water, air, or by any other body, or be even supposed vacant, because 

This makes us consider extension in general. 

We think that the same extension is common to stones, wood, water, air, and other bodies, even to a vacuum itself, provided it:
- be of the same magnitude and shape as before, and 
- preserve the same situation among the external bodies which determine this space. -->



## 13. What is external place?


We think of extension as length, width, and height in a general way because the words "place" and "space":
- merely indicate a body's size, shape, and location among other bodies.
- do not differ from the body which occupies a place

To determine that location, we must observe other immobile bodies. 

Depending on which moving bodies we use as a fixed reference point, we say that the reference point does not move. But it moves after we switch to a new reference point. 

And so the same thing both changes place and does not.

<!-- For instance, suppose we observe a man seated at the stern of a ship being carried out of port by the wind. If we pay attention only to the ship, it will seem that the man does not change place, since he remains in the same position relative to the parts of the ship. But if we observe the surrounding land, it will seem that the man is constantly changing place, because he is moving away from some parts and approaching others.

Now suppose we imagine the Earth rotating on its axis, and moving west to east in exactly the same way the ship moves east to west. Once again, it will seem that the man seated at the stern does not change place—because we define place in terms of certain fixed points that we imagine to be in the heavens. -->


For example, imagine a ship being carried out to sea with a person sitting at the stern.
- From the perspective of the ship [with the ship as the reference], he is not moving since he has the same location with respect to the ship.. 
- From the perspective of the neighbouring shores [with the shores as the reference], he is constantly changing place from one shore towards the other.
- From the perspective of the immovable points in the heavens [with the heavens as the reference] where the earth moves from west to east exactly as the ship moves from east to west, he does not change his place.


But all points in the entire universe are moving. 

And so nothing in the world has a place that is fixed and stationary, unless we mentally assign it one.


{{< n n="So 'internal place' (space to Descartes) is the space (i.e. objective) within the external place. But 'external place' is the relativistic or external view based on a mentally-assigned reference point (i.e. subjective)" >}}



<!-- I create the concept of 'external place' because the words 'place' [spot] and 'space' [area]
- [do not differentiate the metaphysical aspects of the body]
- only indicates the body's size, shape, and how it is situated among other bodies.

To use these words to determine this situation, we must note some other motionless bodies.

But I have said that the same thing changes place and does not change place at the same time, from different perspectives.  -->

<!-- As we look to different bodies, we see that the original body at the same time:
- changes its place, from one perspective
- does not change its place, from another perspective.  -->



## 14. What is the difference between 'place' and 'space'?

Place more expressly indicates position.

Space makes us think more of size and shape.

{{< n n="Places are points in space which have an arbitrary reference point. Space is the volume of a thing." >}}

For example, we say that Body A has taken the place of Body B, even if Body A does not match the Body B's exact dimensions or form.
- We do not mean that Body A occupies the exact same dimensions as Body B. 

Likewise, when an object’s position changes, we say that its place has changed.
- This is even if the new space it occupies has the same size and shape. 

So, when we say a thing is in a certain place, we mean only that it is situated in relation to other things. 

But if we also say that it occupies a certain space or place, we mean in addition that it has such size and shape that it fully fills it.


<!-- The terms 'place' and 'space' have different meanings. 
- 'Place' [spot] expressly designates location instead of size or shape [i.e. point]
 situation than magnitude or figure. -->
<!-- - 'Space' expressly designates size and shape [i.e. area] -->
<!-- magnitude or figure. -->

<!-- We often say that a thing succeeds to the place [spot] of another, although it is not exactly of the same shape or size.


But we do not therefore admit that it occupies the same space as the other.

When the location is changed, we say that the place [spot] also is changed, although there are the same shape and size as before. 


So when we say that a thing is in a particular place, we mean merely that it is situated in a determinate way with respect to  other objects.

When we add that it occupies such a space or place, we understand besides that it is of such determinate size and shape as exactly to fill this space. -->


## 15. The surface around a body is its "external place"


We never truly distinguish space from extension in length, width, and heigth.

But sometimes, we regard place as internal to the object.

At other times, we regard place as something external to it.

The interior is in no way different from space. 

“Surface” does not include any part of the surrounding body.

Surface is simply the boundary between the boday and the surrounding body. 
- It is a mere mode or condition, not a substance.


However, we sometimes treat the exterior as either:
- the surface that immediately surrounds the placed object, or
- a general surface that belongs to no body. 

 <!-- not belonging more to one body than another—which seems always the same as long as it retains the same size and shape. -->

Even if the surrounding body moves elsewhere with its surface, we do not say that the object it surrounded has changed place, as long as it remains in the same position relative to our fixed reference point. 

<!-- the other bodies we consider immobile.  -->

Imagine a boat that is carried in one direction by the current of a stream. It is blown by the wind in the opposite direction with an equal force, causing its location with respect to the banks to not change.*

{{< n n="One force is Yang or positive. Another force is Yin or Negative. Their interaction creates a 'surface' which seems static even if both forces are very dynamic." >}}

The boat remains in the same place even if the whole 'surface'* which surrounds it is incessantly changing.


{{< n n="Here, the surface is the boundary beteen the boat and the stream and the boat and the wind, as one unit. This will make sense in explaining sun spots, solar flares, stellar and galactic halos, universe expansion via red-shift, etc" >}}



<!-- Thus, we never distinguish space [i.e. area] from length, width, and height.

We sometimes, however, consider place [spot] as in the thing placed and at other times as out of it. 

**Internal place is the same as space.**  -->
<!-- differs in no way from -->

<!-- But external place may be taken for the surfaces that immediately surrounds the thing placed. 

'Surfaces' here does not mean any part of the surrounding body, but only **the boundary between the surrounding and surrounded bodies**, which is nothing more than a mode.

'Surfaces' in general make no part of one body or another body, but is always considered the same, provided it retains the same size and shape. 

A body can stay in the same place even if it changed its shape.  -->

<!-- If all of a body's surfaces were changed, it does not mean that its body had changed its place if it stayed in the same location. -->

<!-- situation with respect to the other bodies that are regarded as immovable.  -->
