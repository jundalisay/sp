## 62. The distinction made by thought

<!-- The distinction of reason  -->

<!-- All attributes that give rise to diverse thoughts about one and the same thing—such as the extension of a body and its property of being divisible into parts—differ from the body itself (and from each other) only because we sometimes think confusedly about one without considering the other.

I recall having mixed the distinction made by thought with the modal distinction at the end of the responses I gave (Le Gras, p. 46) to the first objections that were sent to me regarding the Meditations on First Philosophy—but this is not contrary to what I write here, because at that time I did not intend to treat the subject at great length. It was sufficient to distinguish both kinds from the real distinction. -->


We sometimes distinguish a substance from one of its attributes.
- Without those attributes, it would be impossible for us to understand that substance

We attempt to separate 2 such attributes of a substance by thinking of one without thinking of the other.

We cannot have a clear and distinct idea of such a substance if we remove a particular attribute

We cannot conceive one of two or more attributes clearly if we separate it from the others.

For example, no substance can continue to exist once it stops enduring.

Time [duration] is distinct from substance only by thought. 

The attributes of a body can lead to diverse thoughts about that body.

Examples of such attributes are:
- the length, width, height of a body
- the divisibility of a body

These attributes differ from the body itself and from each other.
- This is only because we sometimes think confusedly about one without considering the other.


My *Meditations on First Philosophy* received objections.
- So I clarified it by mixing the distinction made by thought with the modal distinction.
- But this is not contrary to what I write here because back then, I did not intend to treat the subject at great length. 
- So back then, I merely distinguished both kinds from the real distinction.


<!-- Without its attributes, it is impossible for us to have a distinct conception of the substance itself.

The distinction of reason can also be between two such attributes of a common substance.
- The one of which we essay to think without the other. 

This distinction is manifest from our inability to form a clear and distinct idea of such substance, if we separate from it such attribute; or to have a clear perception of the one of two such attributes if we separate it from the other. For example, because any substance which ceases to endure ceases also to exist, duration is not distinct from substance except in thought (RATIONE).

In general, all the modes of thinking which we consider as in objects differ only in thought, as well from the objects of which they are thought as from each other in a common object.

f f="and generally all the attributes that lead us to entertain different thoughts of the same thing, such as, for example, the extension of body and its property of divisibility, do not differ from the body which is to us the object of them, or from each other, unless as we sometimes confusedly think the one without thinking the other.'—FRENCH."

It occurs, indeed, to me that I have elsewhere classed this kind of distinction with the modal (viz., towards the end of the Reply to the First Objections to the Meditations on the First Philosophy).

But there it was only necessary to treat of these distinctions generally, and it was sufficient for my purpose at that time simply to distinguish both of them from the real. -->



## 63. Thought [aether] is the nature of mind, extension [aetherspace] is the nature of body


- Thought [aether] is the principal attribute of intelligent substances, as souls.
- Extension [aetherspace] is the principal attribute of physical substances, as bodies.

<!-- They are the very substance that thinks and that is extended as the soul and the body.  -->

<!-- For we know them in this way very clearly and distinctly. -->

It is easier to know a thinking substance or an extended substance than to know a substance by itself without its attributes of thought or length, width, height.

 <!-- considered apart from whether it thinks or is extended.   there is some difficulty in separating the idea we have of -->

This is because substance is a very abstract concept, more abstract than thought and length, width, height.

This is beause we sometimes consider thought or length, width, height without reflecting on the thing that has those attributes.

Our conception of substance is abstract not because it has less details, but because it is hard to identify it without its attributes.

   <!-- carefully discern what it contains and take care not to confuse it with other notions that would make it less clear. -->


<!-- Thought and extension [metaphysical space] may be regarded as constituting the natures of intelligent and corporeal substance.

They must not be otherwise conceived than as the thinking and extended substances themselves, that is, as mind and body, which in this way are conceived with the greatest clearness and distinctness.

Moreover, we more easily conceive extended or thinking substance than substance by itself, or with the omission of its thinking or extension. 

There is some difficulty in abstracting the notion of substance from the notions of thinking and extension, which, in truth, are only diverse in thought itself (i.e., logically different).

A concept is not more distinct because it comprehends fewer properties, but because we accurately distinguish what is comprehended in it from all other notions.

## 64. How the attributes of thought [aether] and extension [aetherspace] may be distinctly conceived as modes of substance.


A soul can have many different thoughts.

A single body, while maintaining the same size, can be extended in various ways—sometimes more in length and less in width or depth, and sometimes vice versa.

We distinguish thought from the soul, and extension from the body only as dependent features of that soul or body.


We then understand them as clearly and distinctly as we do their corresponding substances.
- This is provided we do not suppose that they exist independently, but only as dependencies of those substances.

When we consider them as properties of their substances, we can easily:
- distinguish them from those substances and
- treat them as what they truly are.

Whereas, if we considered them apart from substance, we might think that they exist by themselves.
- We would then confuse our idea of substance with the idea of its properties.


## 65. How we also conceive the properties or attributes of the modes of thinking and body.

The different modes of thinking are understanding, imagining, remembering, willing, etc.

The various modes of extension are shapes, the arrangement of parts, and their movements.

We can conceive these provided we consider them as dependencies of their substances.

As for movement, we can regard it as another mode dependent on substance that has length, width, height. as long as we think only of the motion that occurs from one place to another without investigating the force that produces it.
