## 57. Some attributes exist in things inherently. Other attributes exist only in our thought. 


For example, we distinguish time from general duration.
- We use time as the measure of movement.
- Time is nothing but a particular way in which we think about that duration.

We do not conceive that the duration of moving things differs from that of non-moving things. 

Assume 2 bodies move for 1 hour:
1. Body `A` moves quickly
2. Body `B` moves slowly

They have the same time even if Body `B` moves faster .

<!-- We do not count more time in one than in the other, even though we suppose there is more movement in the faster one. -->

In order to comprehend the duration of all things under a common measure, we rely on the duration of regular movements.
- Examples are days and years.

We call this measure time, after having made the comparison. 

But in truth, time is nothing outside the actual duration of things—it is merely a way of thinking.

### Superphysics Note on External Versus Internal

To Descartes, the only thing external to us is the aetherspace (spatial dimensions) of external bodies. 

The rest, such as time, number, colors, temperature, our feelings, are all in our minds and therefore self-made. 

This is why Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism can manipulate these things, manifesting as occult powers. 

George Berkeley also had a similar idea, but did not explain it with Descartes' clarity.

<!-- An example is timespan and time. -->

<!-- Of these attributes or modes, there are some which exist in the things themselves, and others that have only an existence in our thought. -->

<!-- - Time is general.
- Timespan is taken from that generality, and call it as the measure of motion.

Time is a certain mode. Under time is timespan itself. The timespan of moving things is the same as that of non-moving things.

For example, 2 bodies are in motion for 1 hour.
- `Body A` is moving quickly.
- `Body B` is moving slowly.

They both have the same time even if `Body A` has much more motion. -->

<!-- One body does not have more time than the other, although there may be  in one of the bodies than in the other.  -->

<!-- We aggregate all the timespans under a common measure called 'time' when we compare them to the the greatest and most regular motions that give rise to years and days. -->

<!-- But the "duration" of all things we put under a common measure and compare with that of  -->

<!-- Hence, "time" is just a mode of thinking. 
- It is not superadded to duration, taken in its generality. -->


## 58. **Numbers and universals exists only in our thought**

<!-- **Number and all universals are only modes of thought.** -->

<!-- In the same way, an abstract or general number is just a mode of thinking.
- The same is true of all those general ideas we call universals. -->
<!-- , when it is not considered as in created things, but merely in the abstract or in general, ;  -->

In the same way, the general abstract notion of number, exists only in our thought just like other general ideas called universals in scholastic philosophy.

<!-- when considered without reflecting on any particular created thing,  -->

<!-- Just like all those  that, in , are classified under the name of universals, they are not external to our minds. -->


## 59. How are universals formed? What are the 5 common universals?

They are formed when we use the same idea to think about multiple things that share a certain relation.

When we group those things under a single name that is represented by the idea, that name also becomes universal.

For example, we see 2 stones.
- Without thinking further about their specific nature, we notice only that there are 2.

We form in ourselves the idea of called 2. 

We then see 2 birds or 2 trees, without considering their nature.

We note that there are 2.

We reapply the same idea of 2 and make it universal.

 <!-- and the number, which we now call with a universal name, is the number two. -->

Likewise, we see a shape with 3 sides and form the idea of a triangle.

  <!-- a particular idea that we call the idea of  -->

We then use that idea to represent all shapes that have only 3 sides.

But when we see a triangle with a right angle and others with none, we form in a universal idea of a right triangle, as a species of a triangle.

The right angle universally differentiates it from other triangles.

<!-- Furthermore, if we observe that the square of the side opposite the right angle is equal to the sum of the squares of the two other sides—and that this property applies only to this species of triangle—we may call it a universal property of right triangles. -->

Finally, if some of these triangles move while others remain still, we consider this a universal accident of those triangles.

This is how we commonly classify five kinds of universals:

1. Genus
2. Species
3. Difference
4. Property
5. Accident


<!-- Universals happen when we use one idea in thinking of all individual objects that have a certain likeness. -->
<!-- are similar to each other. 
 between which there subsists a . -->

<!-- When we comprehend all the objects represented by this idea under one name, this term likewise becomes universal.

For example, we see 2 stones. We form the idea of `2` which we call the binary. -->
<!-- , and do not regard their nature farther than to remark that there are two of them, we form the idea of `2`,  -->
<!-- - When we afterwards see 2 birds or 2 trees, we also form the idea of `2` which becomes universal and call it "binary". -->


## 60. 1. Real Distinctions 

<!-- On distinctions, and first of all, the real kind. As for the number we notice in things themselves, it comes from the distinction between them.  -->


There are 3 types of distinctions: real, modal, of reason (or what is made by thought).

1. Real

This is properly found between two or more substances.

Two substances are really distinct from each other simply because we can conceive of one clearly and distinctly without thinking of the other. 

This is because God can make everything that we have a clear and distinct idea of.

Assume we have an idea of a physical substance with length, width, and height. 
- But we are not sure it really exists. 
- But still we know that it possibly can exist.
- If it does exist, our idea of it is really distinct from its other parts.

Similarly, each of us perceives that we think.

In thinking, we can exclude from our soul any other substance, whether thinking or non-thinking.
<!-- extended. -->

This means that we are really distinct:
- from any other thinking substance and
- from any physical substance.

Assume that God joined a body so closely to a soul to form a compound from these 2 substances.
- We would still conceive that they remain distinct despite this union.

This is because whatever bond God has placed between them, He could still separate them. 
- He would still preserve both of them distinctly.



## 61. 2. Modal Distinctions


There are 2 kinds of modal distinction:

1. The distinction between the mode and the substance which the mode modifies

We can clearly perceive the substance without its mode.
- But we cannot have a distinct idea of such a mode without thinking of its substance.

For example, there is a modal distinction between:
- shape or motion and
- the corporeal substance which has shape or motion 

Likewise, there is a modal distinction between:
- affirming or remembering and
- the mind that affirms of remembers


2. The distinction between 2 modes of the same substance. 

We can know one of these modes without knowing the other.

Examples are shape without motion, or motion without shape.

However, we cannot conceive of shape or motion distinctly unless we recognize that both depend on the same substance.

<!-- For instance, a square stone is moving.

From th and square, we can understand its square shape without knowing it is moving—and vice versa, we can know that it moves without knowing its shape. 

 But we cannot have a distinct understanding of both the movement and the shape without knowing they are both present in the substance of the stone. -->

There is a distinction where a mode of one substance differs from:
- another substance or
- the mode of another substance

Examples are the motion of one body being different from:
- the motion of another body or
- the thought or the doubt of a thinking being

This type of distinction should be called real rather than modal. 

This is because:
- we cannot know these modes without the substances which they depend on.
- substances themselves are really distinct from each other.
