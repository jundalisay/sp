Do material things exist?

I perceive them clearly as the subject matter of pure mathematics, and so they can exist. <!-- ; so I at least know that they could exist, because --> 

Anything that I perceive in that way could only be created by God.

If something else created a thing not created by God, then that would be a contradiction in my perceiving it distinctly.

<!-- The only reason I have ever accepted for thinking that something could not be made by him is that there would be )  -->

I use my imagination when I turn my mind to material things.
- My imagination also suggests that they really exist. 

<!-- For when I think harder about what imagination is, it seems to be simply an application of the faculty of knowing to a body that is intimately present to it – and that has to be a body that exists. -->

How does imagination differ from pure understanding?

When I imagine a triangle <!-- , for example, I don’t merely understand that it is a three-sided figure, but I also --> I see its 3 lines with my mind’s eye as if they were present. 

But if I think of a chiliagon (a shape with 1,000 sides), I do not imagine 1,000 sides.
- This is because my imagination is incapable of creating a chiliagon. 

<!--  the thousand sides or see them as if they were present to me. -->  

Yet I understand what a chiliagon is. 

<!-- When I think of a body, I usually form some kind of image; so in thinking of a chiliagon I may construct in my mind – strictly speaking, in my imagination – a confused representation of some figure.  -->

<!-- But obviously it won’t be a chiliagon, for it is the very same image that I would form if I were thinking of, say, a figure with ten thousand sides. So it wouldn’t help me to recognize the properties that distinguish a chiliagon from other many-sided figures. In the case of a pentagon, the situation is different. -->

<!-- I can of course understand this figure without the help of the imagination (just as I can understand a chiliagon); but I can also imagine a pentagon, by applying my mind’s eye to its five sides and the area they enclose. This imagining, I find, takes more mental effort than understanding does; and that is enough to show that imagination is different from pure understanding. -->


## Imagining Versus Understanding

**Being able to understand is more essential than being able to imagine.** 

Even if I had no power of imagination, I would still be the same person. 

This implies that my power of imagining depends on something other than myself. 

If my body exists – that is, if my mind is joined to a body so that my mind can contemplate that body whenever it wants to – then it means that:
- my body enables me to imagine physical things.
- imagining differs from pure understanding in this way. 

When the mind understands, it somehow:
- turns in on itself and
- inspects one of its own ideas. 

But when the mind imagines, it:
- turns away from itself and
- looks at something in the body (something that conforms to an idea – either one understood by the mind or one perceived by the senses). 

This might be how imagination comes about if the body exists. 

Since there is no other way to explain what imagination is, I can conjecture that the body exists.

**But this is only a probability.** 

Even after careful enquiry, I still cannot see how on the basis of the idea of physical nature, that my imagination proves that some body exists.

Physical nature is the subject-matter of pure mathematics.

I also imagine colours, sounds, tastes, pain and so on – though not so distinctly. 

I perceive these much better through the senses, which is how (helped by memory) they reach my imagination. 

<!-- So to deal with them more fully, I must attend to the senses – that is, to the kind of thinking that I call -->

This leads me to explain ‘sensory perception’. 

I want to know whether the things that are perceived through the senses prove the existence of bodies.

 <!-- provide me with any sure argument for  -->

<!-- To begin with, I will (1) go back over everything that I originally took to be perceived by the senses, and reckoned to be true; and I will go over my reasons for thinking this. Next, I will (2) set out my reasons for later doubting these things. Finally, I will (3) consider what I should now believe about them. -->



## External Bodies Exist Only In the Mind

### 1. Our ideas come from sensations

I perceive my head, hands, feet and other limbs making up my body through my senses.

 <!-- that I regarded as part of myself, or perhaps even as my whole self. -->

My senses also perceive that this body is among many other bodies that could harm or help it.

I detected:
- the favourable effects by a sensation of pleasure
- the unfavourable ones by pain. 

Aside from pain and pleasure, I also had sensations of:
- hunger, thirst, and other such appetites, and
- bodily states tending towards cheerfulness, sadness, anger and similar emotions.

Outside myself, besides the size [extension], shapes and movements of bodies, I also had sensations of:
- their hardness and heat, and of the other qualities that can be known by touch. 
- light, colours, smells, tastes and sounds.

The differences amongst these enabled me to sort out the sky, the earth, the seas and other bodies from one another. 

All of these perceptions were my ideas.
- But they were from external bodies that created ideas through my senses. 

These ideas came to me without my consent.

I could not have an idea of an object that I wanted if that object was not detected by my sense organs.

 <!-- and I couldn’t avoid having the idea when the object was present.  -->

The ideas that came through my senses were much more lively, vivid and sharp than the ones in my imagination and my memory. 

So it means that those sensory ideas were not coming from within me.

I conclude that they came from external things. 

My only way of knowing about these things was through the ideas themselves, so it was bound to occur to me that the things might resemble the ideas. 

It also means that used my senses even before I had the use of reason.

The ideas that I formed were mostly made up of elements of sensory ideas. 

This convinced me that all my ideas came from sensations.

 <!-- I had nothing at all in my intellect that I had not previously had in   -->

My body belongs to me in a way that no other body did. 

 <!-- that by some special right I called ‘mine’ I had reason to think that it belonged to me -->

There were 3 reasons for this.

1. I could never be separated from it, as I could from other bodies.

2. I felt all my appetites and emotions in it and because of it.

3. I was aware of pain and pleasurable ticklings in this body but not in any other body. 

But why should that sensation of pain create a distress of mind?

Why should a kind of delight follow a tickling sensation? 

Why does:
- hunger tell me to eat?
- thirst tell me to drink?

I could only explain it as nature teaching me so. 

For there is no connection between:
- hunger and the decision to eat
- pain and the distress that it causes  

<!-- the tugging sensation , or between the sensation of something causing pain and the mental distress that arises from it. -->

Nature taught me to make these judgments about sensory objects before I had any arguments to support them.


### 2. Our Senses Can be Mistaken 

Later on, however, my experiences gradually undermined my faith in my senses. 

- A tower that had looked round from a distance appeared square from close up. 
- An enormous statue standing on a high column didn’t look large from the ground. 

In countless such cases, I found that the judgments of the external and internal senses were mistaken.

What can be more internal than pain? 

Yet I heard that an amputee might occasionally seem to feel pain in the missing limb. 

So even in my own case, I had to conclude, it was not certain that a particular limb was hurting, even if I felt pain in it.

I recently added 2 very general reasons for doubting: 

1. Every sensory experience when awake can be had while asleep.

Whatever I perceive in sleep comes from within me. 

Then why should I I didn’t see why I should be any more inclined to believe this of what I think I perceive while awake. 


2.  for all I knew to the contrary I might be so constituted that I am liable to error even in matters that seem to me most true. 

I could not rule this out, because I did not know – or at least was pretending not to know – who made me.

 And it was easy to refute the reasons for my earlier confidence about the truth of what I perceived by the senses. 

 Since I seemed to be naturally drawn towards many things that reason told me to avoid, I reckoned that I should not place much confidence in what I was taught by nature. 

 Also, I decided, the mere fact that the perceptions of the senses didn’t depend on my will was not enough to show that they came from outside me; for they might have been produced by some faculty of mine that I didn’t yet know.


### 3. I am not my body

But now, when I am beginning to know myself and my maker better, I can selectively accept my sensory perceptions. 

<!-- although I don’t think I should recklessly accept everything I seem to have got from the senses, neither do I think it should all be called into doubt. -->


Whenever I have a clear and distinct thought of something, it means that God created it in a way that exactly corresponds to my thought.

So the fact that I can clearly and distinctly think of one thing apart from another means that the 2 things are distinct.
- They are separated by God.

 <!-- from one another – that is, that they are two – since they can be   -->

Never mind how they could be separated.
- That does not affect the judgment that they are distinct.

So my mind is a distinct thing from my body.

Furthermore, my mind is me because I know that:
- I exist and
- nothing else belongs to my nature or essence except me being a thinking thing


It follows that my essence consists solely in my being a thinking thing, even though there may be a body that is very closely joined to me. 

I have a clear and distinct idea of:
- myself as something that thinks and isn’t extended, and
- my body as something that [has size] is extended and does not think. 

It means that I am really distinct from my body and can exist without it.

I find that I am capable of certain special kinds of thinking, namely:
- imagination and
- sensory perception. 

I can clearly and distinctly understand myself as a whole without these faculties. 

But I cannot understand them without me, that is, without an intellectual substance for them to belong to. 

A faculty or capacity essentially involves acts, so it involves some thing that acts.

So I see that I differ from my faculties as a thing differs from its properties. 

There are other faculties – such as those of moving around, changing shape, and so on – which also need a substance to belong to.

But it must be a bodily or extended substance and not a thinking one, because those faculties essentially involve extension but not thought.

I have a passive faculty of sensory perception -- an ability to receive and recognize ideas of perceptible objects.

But I would have no use for this unless something (myself or something else) had an active faculty for producing those ideas in the first place. 

But this faculty cannot be in me, since:
- it does not presuppose any thought on my part, and
- sensory ideas are produced without my cooperation and often even against my will.
