I find it utterly impossible to form an idea about either how, for
example, my own conscious mind (that I feel to be one)
should have originated by integration of the conscious-
nesses of the cells (or some of them) that form my body,
or how it should at every moment of my life be, as it
were, their resultant. One would think that such a 'com-
monwealth of cells' as each of us is would be the occasion
par excellence for mind to exhibit plurality if it were at all
able to do so. The expression 'commonwealth' or 'state of
cells' (2ellstaat) is nowadays no longer to be regarded as a
metaphor. Listen to Sherrington:

To declare that, of the component cells that go to make us up, each
one is an individual self-centred life is no mere phrase. I t is not a
mere convenience for descriptive purposes. The cell as a component
of the body is not only a visibly demarcated unit but a unit-life
centred on itself. I t leads its own life ... The cell is a unit-life, and
our life which in its turn is a unitary life consists utterly of the
cell-lives.

But this story can be followed up in more detail and more
concretely. Both the pathology of the brain and physiological
investigations on sense perception speak unequivocally in
favour of a regional separation of the sensorium into domains
whose far-reaching independence is amazing because it would
let us expect to find these regions associated with independent
domains of the mind; but they are not. A particularly
characteristic instance is the following. If you look at a distant
landscape first in the ordinary way with both eyes open, then
with the right eye alone, shutting the left, then the other way
round, you find no noticeable difference. The psychic visional
space is in all three cases identically the same. Now this might
very well be due to the fact that from corresponding nerve-
ends on the retina the stimulus is transferred to the same
centre in the brain where 'the perception is manufactured' -
just as, for example, in my house the knob at the entrance
door and the one in my wife's bedroom activate the same bell,
situated above the kitchen door. This would be the easiest
explanation; but it is wrong.

Sherri~gton tells us of very interesting experiments on the
thresnold frequency of flickering. I shall try to give you as
brief an account as possible. Think of a miniature lighthouse
set up in the laboratory and giving off a great many flashes per
second, say 40 or 60 or 80 or 100. As you increase the
frequency of the flashes the flickering disappears at a definite
frequency, depending on the experimental details; and the
onlooker, whom we suppose to watch with both eyes in the
ordinary way, sees then a continuous light. 2 Let this threshold
frequency be 60 per second in given circumstances.

2In this way the fusion of successive pictures is produced in the cinema. -->

In a second experiment, with nothing else changed, a suitable
contraption allows only every second flash to reach the right
eye, every other flash to reach the left eye, so that every eye
receives only 30 flashes per second. If the stimuli were conducted to the same physiological centre, this should make no
difference: if I press the button before my entrance door, say
every two seconds, and my wife does the same in her bedroom,
but alternately with me, the kitchen bell will ring every second,
just the same as if one of us had pressed his button every second
or both of us had done so synchronously every second. 

However, in the second flicker experiment this is not so. Thirty
flashes to the right eye plus alternating 30 flashes to the left are
far from sufficient to remove the sensation of flickering; double
the frequency is required for that, namely, 60 to the right and 60
to the left, if both eyes are open. Let me give you the main
conclusion in Sherrington's own words:

It is not spatial conjunction of cerebral mechanism which combines
the two reports . . . I t is much as though the right-and left-eye
images were seen each by one of two observers and the minds of the
two observers were combined to a single mind. It is as though the
right-eye and left-eye perceptions are elaborated singly and then
psychically combined to one ... I t is as if each eye had a separate
sensorium of considerable dignity proper to itself, in which mental
processes based on that eye were developed up to even full percep-
tual levels. Such would amount physiologically to a visual sub-
brain. There would be two such sub··brains, one for the right eye and
one for the left eye. Contemporaneity of action rather than structural
union seems to provide their mental collaboration. 

This is followed by very general considerations, of which I
shall again pick out only the most characteristic passages:
Are there thus quasi-independent sub-brains based on the several
modalities of sense? In the roof-brain the old 'five' senses instead of
being merged inextricably in one another and further submerged
under mechanism of higher order are still plain to find, each
demarcated in its separate sphere. How far is the mind a collection
of quasi-independent perceptual minds integrated psychically in
large measure by temporal concurrence of experience? ... When it is a question of 'mind' the nervous system does not integrate itself
by centralization upon a pontifical cell. Rather it elaborates a
millionfold democracy whose each unit is a cell ... the concrete life
compounded of sublives reveals, although integrated, its additive
nature and declares itself an affair of minute foci of life acting
together ... When however we turn to the mind there is nothing of
all this. The single nerve-cell is never a miniature brain. The
cellular constitution of the body need not be for any hint of it from
'mind' ... A single pontifical brain-cell could not assure to the
mental reaction a character more unified, and non-atomic than
does the roof-brain's multitudinous sheet of cells. Matter and
energy seem granular in structure, and so does 'life', but not so
mind.

1 have quoted you the passages which have most
impressed me. Sherrington, with his superior knowledge of
what is actually going on in a living body, is seen struggling
with a paradox which in his candidness and absolute intellectual sincerity he does not try to hide away or explain away
(as many others would have done, nay have done), but he almost brutally exposes it, knowing very well that this is the
only way of driving any problem in science or philosophy nearer towards its solution, while by plastering it over with
'nice' phrases you prevent progress and make the antinomy
perennial (not forever, but until someone notices your fraud).
