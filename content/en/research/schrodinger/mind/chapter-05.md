Can science vouchsafe information on matters of religion? Can
the results of scientific research be of any help in gaining a
reasonable and satisfactory attitude towards those burning
questions which assail everyone at times? Some of us, in
particular healthy and happy youth, succeed in shoving them
aside for long periods; others, in advanced age, have satisfied
themselves that there is no answer and have resigned them-
selves to giving up looking for one, while others again are
haunted throughout their lives by this incongruity of our
intellect, haunted also by serious fears raised by time-
honoured popular superstition. I mean mainly the questions
concerned with the 'other world', with 'life after death', and
all that is connected with them. Notice please that I shall not,
of course, attempt to answer these questions, but only the much
more modest one, whether science can give any information
about them or aid our - to many of us unavoidable - thinking
about them.

To begin with, in a very primitive way it certainly can, and
has done so without much ado. I remember seeing old prints,
geographical maps of the world, so I believe, including hell,
purgatory and heaven, the former being placed deep under-
ground, the latter high above in the skies. Such representa-
tions were not meant purely allegorically (as they might be in
later periods, for example, in Durer's famous All-Saints pic-
ture); they testify to a crude belief quite popular at the time.
Today no church requests the faithful to interpret its dogmas
in this materialistic fashion, nay it would seriously discourage
such an attitude. This advancement has certainly been aided by our knowledge of the interior of our planet (scanty though
it be), of the nature of volcanoes, of the composition of our
atmosphere, of the probable history of the solar system and of
the structure of the galaxy and the universe. 

No cultured
person would expect to find these dogmatic figments in any
region of that part of space which is accessible to our
investigation, I daresay not even in a region continuing that
space but inaccessible to research; he would give them, even if
convinced of their reality, a spiritual standing. I will not say
that with deeply religious persons such enlightenment had to
await the aforesaid findings of science, but they have certainly
helped in eradicating materialistic superstition in those
matters.

However, this refers to a rather primitive state of mind.
There are points of greater interest. The most important
contributions from science to overcome the baffiing questions
'Who are we really? Where have I come from and where am I
going?' - or at least to set our minds at rest - I say, the most
appreciable help science has offered us in this is, in my view,
the gradual idealization of time. In thinking of this the names
of three men obtrude themselves upon us, though many
others, including non-scientists, have hit on the same groove,
such as St Augustine of Hippo and Boethius; the three are
Plato, Kant and Einstein.
The first two were not scientists, but their keen devotion to
philosophic questions, their absorbing interest in the world,
originated from science. In Plato's case it came from math-
ematics and geometry (the 'and' would be out of place today,
but not, I think, in his time). What has endowed Plato's
life-work with such unsurpassed distinction that it shines in
undiminished splendour after more than two thousand years?
For all we can tell, no special discovery about numbers or
geometrical figures is to his credit. His insight in to the
material world of physics and life is occasionally fantastic and
altogether inferior to that of others (the sages from Thales to
Democritus) who lived, some of them more than a century,
before his time; in knowledge of nature he was widely
surpassed by his pupil Aristotle and by Theophrastus. To all
ERWIN SCHRODINGER
but his ardent worshippers long passages in his dialogues give
the impression of a gratuitous quibbling on words, with no
desire to define the meaning ofa word, rather in the belief that
the word itself will display its content if you turn it round and
round long enough. His social and political Utopia, which
failed and put him into grave danger when he tried to promote
it practically, finds few admirers in our days, that have sadly
experienced the like. So what made his fame?
In my opinion it was this, that he was the first to envisage
the idea of timeless existence and to emphasize it - against
reason - as a reality, more real than our actual experience;
this, he said, is but a shadow of the former, from which all
experienced reality is borrowed. I am speaking of the theory of
forms (or ideas). How did it originate? There is no doubt that
it was aroused by his becoming acquainted with the teaching
of Parmenides and the Eleatics. But it is equally obvious that
this met in Plato with an alive congenial vein, an occurrence
very much on the line of Plato's own beautiful simile that
learning by reason has the nature of remembering knowledge,
previously possessed but at the time latent, rather than that of
discovering entirely new verities. However, Parmenides' ever-
lasting, ubiquitous and changeless One has in Plato's mind
turned into a much more powerful thought, the Realm of
Ideas, which appeals to the imagination, though, of necessity,
it remains a mystery. But this thought sprang, as I believe,
from a very real experience, namely, that he was struck with
admiration and awe by the revelations in the realm of
numbers and geometrical figures - as many a man was after
him and the Pythagoreans were before. He recognized and
absorbed deeply into his mind the nature of these revelations,
that they unfold themselves by pure logical reasoning, which
makes us acquainted with true relations whose truth is not
only unassailable, but is obviously there, forever; the relations
held and will hold irrespective of our inquiry into them. A
mathematical truth is timeless, it does not come into being
when we discover it. Yet its discovery is a very real event, it
may be an emotion like a great gift from a fairy.
The three heights of a triangle (ABC) meet at one point (0).

(Height is the perpendicular, dropped from a 'corner onto the
side opposite to it, or onto its prolongation.) At first sight one
does not see why they should; any three lines do not, they
usually form a triangle. Now draw through every corner the
parallel to the opposite side, to form the bigger triangle
A' B' C'. I t consists of four congruent triangles. The three
heights of ABC are in the bigger triangle the perpendiculars
erected in the middle of its sides, their 'symmetry lines'. Now
the one erected at C must contain all the points that have the
144 ERWIN SCHRODINGER
same distance from A' as from B'; the one erected at B contains
all those points that have the same distance from A' as from C'.
The point where these two perpendiculars meet has therefore
the same distance from all three corners A') B') C', and must
therefore lie also on the perpendicular erected at A because this
one contains all points that have the same distance from B' as
from C'. Q.E.D.
Every integer, except I and 2, is 'in the middle' of two prime
numbers, or is their arithmetical mean; for instance
8 == ! (5 + I I) == !(3 + 13)
17==! (3+3 1) ==!(29+ 5) ==!(23+ II)
20 ==! (I I + 29) == !(3 + 37)·
As you see, there is usually more than one solution. The
theorem is called Goldbach's and is thought to be true, though
it has not been proved.
By adding the consecutive odd numbers, thus first tak-
ing just I, then I + 3 == 4, then 1 + 3 + 5 == 9, then
I + 3 + 5 + 7 == 16, you always get a square number, indeed
you get in this way all square numbers, always the square of the
number of odd numbers you have added. To grasp the genera-
lity of this relation one may replace in the sum the summands of
every pair that is equidistant from the middle (thus: the first
and the last, then the first but one and the last but one, etc.) by
their arithmetic mean, which is obviously just equal to the
number of summands; thus, in the last of the above examples:
4 + 4- + 4 + 4 == 4 X 4·
Let us now turn to Kant. It has become a commonplace that
he taught the ideality of space and time and that this was a
fundamental, ifnot the most fundamental part of his teaching.
Like most of it, it can be neither verified nor falsified, but it does
not lose interest on this account (rather it gains; if it could be
proved or disproved it would be trivial). The meaning is that, to
be spread out in space and to happen in a well-defined temporal
order of 'before and after' is not a quality of the world that we
perceive, but pertains to the perceiving mind which, in its
Mind and Matter 145
present situation anyhow, cannot help registering anything
that is offered to it according to these two card-indexes, space
and time. It does not mean that the mind comprehends these
order-schemes irrespective of, and before, any experience, but
that it cannot help developing them and applying them to
experience when this comes along, and particularly that this
fact does not prove or suggest space and time to be an
order-scheme inherent in that 'thing-in-itself which, as some
believe, causes our experience.
I t is not difficul t to make a case that this is hum bug. No
single man can make a distinction between the realm of his
perceptions and the realm of things that cause it since,
however detailed the knowledge he may have acquired about
the whole story, the story is occurring only once not twice.
The duplication is an allegory, suggested mainly by commu-
nication with other human beings and even with animals;
which shows that their perceptions in the same situation seem
to be very similar to his own apart from insignificant differ-
ences in the point of view - in the literal meaning of 'point of
projection'. But even supposing that this compels us to
consider an objectively existing world the cause of our percep-
tions, as most people do, how on earth shall we decide that a
common feature of all our experience is due to the constitution
of our mind rather than a quality shared by all those
objectively existing things? Admittedly our sense perceptions
constitute our sole knowledge about things. This objective
world remains a hypothesis, however natural. If we do adopt
it, is it not by far the most natural thing to ascribe to that
external world, and not to ourselves, all the characteristics
that our sense perceptions find in it?
However, the supreme importance of Kant's statement does
not consist in justly distributing the roles of the mind and its
object - the world - between them in the process of 'mind
forming an idea of the world', because, as I just pointed out, it
is hardly possible to discriminate the two. The great thing was
to form the idea that this one thing - mind or world - may well
be capable of other forms of appearance that we cannot grasp
and that do not imply the notions of space and time. This
ERWIN SCHRODINGER
means an imposing liberation from our inveterate prejudice.
There probably are other orders of appearance than the
space-time-like. It was, so I believe, Schopenhauer who first
read this from Kant. This liberation opens the way to belief, in
the religious sense, without running all the time against the
clear results which experience about the world as we know it
and plain thought unmistakably pronounce. For instance - to
speak of the most momentous example - experience as we
know it unmistakably obtrudes the conviction that it cannot
survive the destruction of the body, with whose life, as we
know life, it is inseparably bound up. So is there to be nothing
after this life? No. Not in the way of experience as we know it
necessarily to take place in space and time. But, in an order of
appearance in which time plays no part, this notion of 'after' is
meaningless. Pure thinking cannot, of course, procure us a
guarantee that there is that sort of thing, But it can remove the
apparent obstacles to conceiving it as possible. That is what
Kant has done by his analysis, and that, to my mind, is his
philosophical importance.
I now come to speak about Einstein in the same context.
Kant's attitude towards science was incredibly naIve, as you
will agree if you turn the leaves of his Metaphysical Foundations
oj Science (Metaphysische AnJangsgriinde der Naturwissenschaft). He
accepted physical science in the form it had reached during
his lifetime (1724-1804) as something more or less final and
he busied himself to account for its statements philosophi-
cally. This happening to a great genius ought to be a warning
to philosophers ever after. He would show plainly that space
was necessarily infinite and believed firmly that it was in the
nature of the human mind to endow it with the geometrical
properties summarized by Euclid. In this Euclidean space a
mollusc of matter moved, that is, changed its configuration as
time went on. To Kant, as to any physicist of his period, space
and time were two entirely different conceptions, so he had no
qualms in calling the former the form of our external intuition,
and time the form of our internal intuition (Anschauung). The
recognition that Euclid's infinite space is not a necessary way
of looking at the world of our experience and that space and
Mind and Matter 147
time are better looked upon as one continuum of four
dimensions seemed to shatter Kant's foundation - but
actually did no harm to the more valuable part of his
philosophy.
This recognition was left to Einstein (and several others,
H. A. Lorentz, Poincare, Minkowski, for example). The
mighty impact of their discoveries on philosophers, men-in-
the-street, and ladies in the drawing-room is due to the fact
that they brought it to the fore: even in the domain of our
experience the spatio-temporal relations are much more intri-
cate than Kant dreamed them to be, following in this all
previous physicists, men-in-the-street and ladies in the
drawing-room.
The new view has its strongest impact on the previous
notion of time. Time is the notion of 'before and after'. The
new attitude springs from the following two roots:
(i) The notion of 'before and after' resides on the 'cause and
effect' relation. We know, or at least we have formed the idea,
that one event A can cause, or at least modify, another event
B, so that if A were not, then B were not, at least not in this
modified form. For instance when a shell explodes, it kills a
man who was sitting on it; moreover the explosion is heard at
distant places. The killing may be simultaneous to the
explosion, the hearing of the sound at a distant place will be
later; but certainly none of the effects can be earlier. This is a
basic notion, indeed it is the one by which also in everyday life
the question is decided which of two events was later or at
least not earlier. The distinction rests entirely on the idea that
the effect cannot precede the cause. If we have reasons to
think that B has been caused by A, or that it at least shows
vestiges of A, or even if (from some circumstantial evidence) it
is conceivable that it shows vestiges, then B is deemed to be
certainly not earlier than A.
(2) Keep this in mind. The second root is the experimental
and observational evidence that effects do not spread with
arbitrarily high velocity. There is an upper limit, which
incidentally is the velocity of light in empty space. In human
measure it is very high, it would go round the equator about

seven times in one second. Very high, but not infinite, call it c.
Let this be agreed upon as a fundamental fact of nature. It
then follows that the above-mentioned discrimination
between 'before and after' or 'earlier and later' (based on- the
cause-and-effect relation) is not universally applicable, it
breaks down in some cases. This is not as easily explained in
non-mathematical language. Not that the mathematical
scheme is so complicated. But everyday language is preju-
dicial in that it is so thoroughly imbued with the notion of
time - you cannot use a verb (verbum, 'the' word, Germ.
Zeitwort) without using it in one or the other tense.
The simplest but, as will turn out, not fully adequate
consideration runs thus. Given an event A. Contemplate at
any later time an event B outside the sphere of radius ct
around A. Then B cannot exhibit any 'vestige' of A; nor, of
course can A from B. ~rhus our criterion breaks down. By the
language we used we have, of course, dubbed B to be the later.
But are we right in this, since the criterion breaks down either
way?
Contemplate at a time earlier (by t) an event B' outside that
same sphere. In this case, just as before, no vestige of B' can
have reached A (and, of course, none from A can be exhibited
onB').
Thus in both cases there is exactly the saOle relationship of
mutial non-interference. There is no conceptual difference
Mind and J.\1atter 149
between the classes Band B' with regard to their cause-effect
relation to A. So if we want to make this relation, and not a
linguistic prejudice, the basis of the 'before and after', then the
Band B' form one class of events that are neither earlier nor
later than A. The region of space-time occupied by this class is
called the region of 'potential simultaneity' (with respect to
event A). This expression is used, because a space-time frame
can always be adopted that makes A simultaneous with a
selected particular B or a particular B'. This was Einstein's
discovery (which goes under the name of The Theory of
Special Relativity, 1905).
Now these things have become very concrete reality to us
physicists, we use them in everyday work just as we use the
multiplication table or Pythagoras' theorem on right-angled
triangles. I have sometimes wondered why they made such a
great stir both among the general public and among philos-
ophers. I suppose it is this, that it meant the dethronement of
time as a rigid tyrant imposed on us from outside, a liberatton
from the unbreakable rule of 'before and after'. For indeed
time is our most severe master by ostensibly restricting the
existence of each of us to narrow limits - seventy or eighty
years, as the Pentateuch has it. To be allowed to play about
with such a master's programme believed unassailable until
then, to play about with it albeit in a small way, seems to be a
great relief, it seems to encourage the thought that the whole
'timetable' is probably not quite as serious as it appears at
first sight. And this thought is a religious thought, nay I
should call it the religious though t.
Einstein has not - as you sometimes hear - given the lie to
Kant's deep thoughts on the idealization of space and time; he
has, on the contrary, made a large step towards its accom-
plishment.
I have spoken of the impact of Plato, Kant and Einstein on
the philosophical and religious outlook. Now between Kant
and Einstein, about a generation before the latter, physical
science had witnessed a momentous event which might have
seemed calculated to stir the thoughts of philosophers, men-
in-the-street and ladies in the drawing-room at least as much
ERWIN SCHRODINGER
as the theory of relativity, ifnot more so. That this was not the
case is, I believe, due to the fact that this turn of thought is
even more difficult to understand and was therefore grasped
by very few among the three categories of persons, at the best
by one or another p~lilosopher. This event is attached to the
names of the American Willard Gibbs and the Austrian
Ludwig Boltzmann. I will now say something about it.
With very few exceptions (that really are exceptions) the
course of events in nature is irreversible. Ifwe try to imagine a
time-sequence of phenomena exactly opposite to one that is
actually observed - as in a cinema film projected in reversed
order - such a reversed sequence, though it can easily be
imagined, would nearly always be in gross contradiction to
well-established laws of physical science.
The general 'directedness' of all happening was explained
by the mechanical or statistical theory of heat, and this
explanation was duly hailed as its most admirable achieve-
men t. I cannot enter here on the details of the physical theory,
and this is not necessary for grasping the gist of the explana-
tion. This would have been very poor, had irreversibility been
stuck in as a fundamental property of the microscopic mech-
anism of atoms and molecules. This would not have been
better than many a medieval purely verbal explanation such
as: fire is hot on account of its fiery quality. No. According to
Boltzmann we are faced with the natural tendency of any state
of order to turn on its own into a less orderly state, but not the
other way round. Take as a simile a set of playing cards that
you have carefully arranged, beginning with 7,8,9, 10, knave,
queen, king, ace of hearts, then the same in diamonds, etc. If
this well-ordered set is shuffled once, twice or three times it
will gradually turn into a random set. But this is not an
intrinsic property of the process of shuffling. Given the
resulting disorderly set, a process of shuffling is perfectly
thinkable that would exactly cancel the effect of the first
shuffling and restore the original order. Yet everybody will
expect the first course to take place, nobody the second -
indeed he might have to wait pretty long for it to happen by
chance.
Mind and Matter
Now this is the gist of Boltzmann's explanation of the
unidirectional character of everything that happens in nature
(including, of course, the life-history of an organism from
birth to death). Its very virtue is that the 'arrow of time' (as
Eddington called it) is not worked into the mechanisms of
interaction, represented in our simile by the mechanical act of
shuffiing. This act, this mechanism is as yet innocent of any
notion of past and future, it is in itself completely reversible,
the 'arrow' - the very notion of past and future - results from
statistical considerations. In our simile with the cards the
point is this, that there is only one, or a very few, well-ordered
arrangements of the cards, but billions of billions of disorderly
ones.
Yet the theory has been opposed, again and again,
occasionally by very clever people. The opposition boils down
to this: the theory is said to be unsound on logical grounds.
For, so it is said, if the basic mechanisms do not distinguish
between the two directions of time, but work perfectly sym-
metrically in this respect, how should there from their co-
operation result a behaviour of the whole, an integrated
behaviour, that is strongly biased in one direction? Whatever
holds for this direction must hold equally well for the opposite
one.
If this argument is sound, it seems to be fatal. For it is
aimed at the very point which was regarded as the chief virtue
of the theory: to derive irreversible events from reversible
basic mechanisms.
The argument is perfectly sound, yet it is not fatal. The
argument is sound in asserting that what holds for one
direction also holds for the opposite direction of time, which
from the outset is introduced as a perfectly symmetrical
variable. But you must not jump to the conclusion that it
holds quite in general for both directions. In the most cautious
wording one has to say that in any particular case it holds for
either the one or the other direction. To this one must add: in
the particular case of the world as we know it, the 'running
down' (to use a phrase that has been occasionally adopted)
takes place in one direction and this we call the direction from
ERWIN SCHRODINGER
past to future. In other words the statistical theory of heat
must be allowed to decide by itself high-handedly, by its own
definition, in which direction time flows. (This has a momen-
tous consequence for the methodology of the physicist. He
must never introduce anything that decides independently
upon the arrow of time, else Boltzmann's beautiful building
collapses. )
I t might be feared that in different physical systems the
statistical definition of time might not always result in the
same time-direction. Boltzmann boldly faced this eventuality;
he maintained that if the universe is sufficiently extended
and/or exists for a sufficiently long period, time might actually
run in the opposite direction in distant parts of the world. The
point has been argued, but it is hardly worthwhile arguing
any longer. Boltzmann did not know what to us is at least
extremely likely, namely that the universe, as we know it, is
neither large enough nor old enough to give rise to such
reversions on a large scale. I beg to be allowed to add without
detailed explanations that on a very small scale, both in space
and in time, such reversions have been observed (Brownian
movement, Smoluchowski).
To my view the 'statistical theory of time' has an even
stronger bearing on the philosophy of time than the theory of
relativity. The latter, however revolutionary, leaves
untouched the undirectional flow of time, which it presup-
poses, while the statistical theory constructs it from the order
of the events. This means a liberation from the tyranny of old
Chronos. What we in our minds construct ourselves cannot,
so I feel, have dictatorial power over our mind, neither the
power of bringing it to the fore nor the power of annihilating
it. But some of you, I am sure, will call this mysticism. So with
all due acknowledgment to the fact that physical theory is at
all times relative, in that it depends on certain basic assump-
tions, we may, or so I believe, assert that physical theory in its
present stage strongly suggests the indestructibility of Mind
by Time.
