<!-- Can science vouchsafe information on matters of religion? 

Can
the results of scientific research be of any help in gaining a
reasonable and satisfactory attitude towards those burning
questions which assail everyone at times? 

Some of us, in
particular healthy and happy youth, succeed in shoving them
aside for long periods; others, in advanced age, have satisfied
themselves that there is no answer and have resigned themselves to giving up looking for one, while others again are
haunted throughout their lives by this incongruity of our
intellect, haunted also by serious fears raised by time-honoured popular superstition. I mean mainly  -->

There are questions about the 'other world' with 'life after death' and all that is connected with them. 

<!-- Notice please that I shall not,
of course, attempt to answer these questions, but only the much
more modest one, whether science can give any information
about them or aid our - to many of us unavoidable - thinking
about them.


In a very primitive way it certainly can, and has done so without much ado.  -->

I remember seeing old prints, geographical maps of the world that includes hell, purgatory and heaven.
- Hell was placed deep underground
- Heaven and purgatory were high above in the skies. 

<!-- Such representations were not meant purely allegorically (as they might be in later periods, for example, in Durer's famous All-Saints pic- ture); they testify to a crude belief quite popular at the time. 

Today no church requests the faithful to interpret its dogmas in this materialistic fashion, nay it would seriously discourage such an attitude. 

This advancement has certainly been aided by our knowledge of the interior of our planet (scanty though it be), of the nature of volcanoes, of the composition of our atmosphere, of the probable history of the solar system and of the structure of the galaxy and the universe.

No cultured person would expect to find these dogmatic figments in any region of that part of space which is accessible to our investigation, I daresay not even in a region continuing that space but inaccessible to research; he would give them, even if convinced of their reality, a spiritual standing. 

I will not say that with deeply religious persons such enlightenment had to await the aforesaid findings of science, but they  -->

Science has certainly helped in eradicating materialistic superstition in those matters.

However, this refers to a rather primitive state of mind.

There are points of greater interest. The most important contributions from science to overcome the baffiing questions

'Who are we really? Where have I come from and where am I going?'

<!--  - or at least to set our minds at rest - I say, the most
appreciable help science has offered us in this is, in my view, -->
the gradual idealization of time. 


## Plato, Kant and Einstein.

In thinking of this the names of three men obtrude themselves upon us, though many
others, including non-scientists, have hit on the same groove,
such as St Augustine of Hippo and Boethius; the 3 are
Plato, Kant and Einstein.

<!-- The first two were not scientists, but their keen devotion to
philosophic questions, their absorbing interest in the world,
originated from science.  -->

<!-- In Plato's case it came from mathematics and geometry (the 'and' would be out of place today,
but not, I think, in his time). 

What has endowed Plato's life-work with such unsurpassed distinction that it shines in
undiminished splendour after more than two thousand years?

For all we can tell, no special discovery about numbers or
geometrical figures is to his credit. 

His insight in to the material world of physics and life is occasionally fantastic and altogether inferior to that of others (the sages from Thales to Democritus) who lived, some of them more than a century, before his time; in knowledge of nature he was widely surpassed by his pupil Aristotle and by Theophrastus.

To all but his ardent worshippers long passages in  -->

## Plato

Plato's long dialogues are a gratuitous quibbling on words, with no desire to define the meaning of a word.

Rather it pushes the belief that the word itself will display its content if you turn it round and round long enough. 

His social and political Utopia failed. It put him into grave danger when he tried to promote it practically.

He is famous for his theory of forms (or ideas).

It is about a timeless existence or reality that goes against reason.

It was more real than our actual experience. This is but a shadow of the former, from which all experienced reality is borrowed. 

How did it originate? 

It was aroused by his becoming acquainted with the teaching of Parmenides and the Eleatics. 

But it is equally obvious that this met in Plato with an alive congenial vein, an occurrence very much on the line of Plato's own beautiful simile that learning by reason has the nature of remembering knowledge, previously possessed but at the time latent, rather than that of discovering entirely new verities. 

However, Parmenides' ever- lasting, ubiquitous and changeless One has in Plato's mind turned into a much more powerful thought, the Realm of Ideas, which appeals to the imagination, though, of necessity, it remains a mystery. 

But this thought sprang, as I believe, from a very real experience, namely, that he was struck with admiration and awe by the revelations in the realm of numbers and geometrical figures - as many a man was after him and the Pythagoreans were before.

He recognized and absorbed deeply into his mind the nature of these revelations, that they unfold themselves by pure logical reasoning, which makes us acquainted with true relations whose truth is not only unassailable, but is obviously there, forever; the relations held and will hold irrespective of our inquiry into them. 

A mathematical truth is timeless, it does not come into being when we discover it. Yet its discovery is a very real event, it may be an emotion like a great gift from a fairy.

The 3 heights of a triangle (ABC) meet at one point (0).

<!-- c

(Height is the perpendicular, dropped from a 'corner onto the side opposite to it, or onto its prolongation.) 

At first sight one does not see why they should; any three lines do not, they usually form a triangle. Now draw through every corner the parallel to the opposite side, to form the bigger triangle A' B' C'.

It consists of 4 congruent triangles.

The 3 heights of `ABC` are in the bigger triangle the perpendiculars erected in the middle of its sides, their 'symmetry lines'.

The one erected at C must contain all the points that have the same distance from A' as from B'; the one erected at B contains all those points that have the same distance from A' as from C'. The point where these two perpendiculars meet has therefore the same distance from all three corners A') B') C', and must therefore lie also on the perpendicular erected at A because this one contains all points that have the same distance from B' as from C'. Q.E.D.

Every integer, except I and 2, is 'in the middle' of two prime
numbers, or is their arithmetical mean; for instance

8 == ! (5 + I I) == !(3 + 13)
17==! (3+3 1) ==!(29+ 5) ==!(23+ II)
20 ==! (I I + 29) == !(3 + 37)·

As you see, there is usually more than one solution. The theorem is called Goldbach's and is thought to be true, though
it has not been proved.

By adding the consecutive odd numbers, thus first taking just I, then I + 3 == 4, then 1 + 3 + 5 == 9, then
I + 3 + 5 + 7 == 16, you always get a square number, indeed
you get in this way all square numbers, always the square of the
number of odd numbers you have added. 

To grasp the generality of this relation one may replace in the sum the summands of every pair that is equidistant from the middle (thus: the first and the last, then the first but one and the last but one, etc.) by their arithmetic mean, which is obviously just equal to the number of summands; thus, in the last of the above examples:

4 + 4- + 4 + 4 == 4 X 4·
