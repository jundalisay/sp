<!-- In the world of physics we watch a shadowgraph performance of
familiar life. The shadow of my elbow rests on the shadow table as
the shadow ink flows over the shadow paper ... The frank realization that  -->

Physical science is concerned with a world of shadows.

<!--  is
one of the most significant of recent advances.  -->

The very recent advance does not lie in the world of physics itself having acquired this shadowy character.

it had it ever since Democritus of Abdera and even before, but we were not aware of it; we thought we were dealing with the world itself; expressions like model or picture for the conceptual constructs of science canle up in the second half of the nineteenth century, and not earlier, as far as I know.

Sir Charles Sherrington published his momentous Man on his Nature.2 

The book is pervaded by the honest search for objective evidence of the interaction between matter and mind. I stress the epithet 'honest', because it does need a very serious and sincere endeavour to look for some- thing which one is deeply convinced in advance cannot be found, because (in the teeth of popular belief) it does not exist. 

A brief summary of the result of this search is on p. 357: Mind, the anything perception can compass, goes therefore in our spatial world more ghostly than a ghost. 

Invisible, intangible, it is a thing not even of outline; it is not a 'thing'. I t remains without sens ual confirmation and remains wi thou tit forever.

Mind has erected the objective outside world of the natural philosopher out of its own stuff. 

Mind could not cope with this gigantic task otherwise than by the simplifying device of excluding itself - withdrawing from its conceptual creation. Hence the latter does not contain its creator.

I cannot convey the grandeur of Sherrington's immortal
book by quoting sentences; one has to read it oneself. Still, I
will mention a few of the more particularly characteristic.
Physical science ... faces us with the impasse that mind per se
cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand


Then the impasse meets us. The blank of the 'how' of mind's
leverage on matter. The inconsequence staggers us. Is it a misunderstanding? (p. 232).

Hold these conclusions drawn by an experimental physiologist of the twentieth century against the simple statement of
the greatest philosopher of the seventeenth century: B.

<!-- Spinoza (Ethics, Pt III, Prop. 2):
Nec corpus mentem ad cogitandum, nec mens corpus ad motum,
neque ad quietem, nec ad aliquid (si quid est) aliud determinare
potest.

[Neither can the body determine the mind to think, nor the mind
determine the body to motion or rest or anything else (if such there
be).] -->

The impasse is an impasse. 

Are we thus not the doers of our deeds? Yet we feel responsible for them, we are punished or praised for them, as the case may be. It is a horrible antinomy. I maintain that it cannot be solved on the level of present-day science which is still entirely engulfed in the 'exclusion principle' - without knowing it - hence the antinomy. To realize this is valuable, but it does not solve the problem. You cannot remove the 'exclusion principle' by act of parliament as it were. Scientific attitude would have to be rebuilt, science must be made anew.

So we are faced with the following remarkable situation.

While the stuff from which our world picture is built is yielded
exclusively from the sense organs as organs of the mind, so
that every man's world picture is and always remains a
construct of his mind and cannot be proved to have any other
existence, yet the conscious mind itself remains a stranger
within that construct, it has no living space in it, you can spot
it nowhere in space. We do not usually realize this fact,
because we have entirely taken to thinking of the personality
of a human being, or for that matter also that of an animal, as
located in the interior of its body. 

To learn that it cannot
really be found there is so amazing that it meets with doubt
and hesitation, we are very loath to admit it. We have got used
to localizing the conscious personality inside a person's head -

I should say an inch or two behind the midpoint of the eyes.
From there it gives us, as the case may be, understanding or
loving or tender - or suspicious or angry looks. I wonder has it
ever been noted that the eye is the only sense organ whose
purely receptive character we fail to recognize in naIve
thought. Reversing the actual state of affairs, we are much
more inclined to think of 'rays of vision', issuing from the eye,
than of the 'rays of light' that hit the eyes from outside. You
quite frequently find such a 'ray of vision' represented in a
drawing in a comic paper, or even in some older schematic
sketch intended to illustrate an optic instrunlent or law, a
dotted line emerging from the eye and pointing to the object,
the direction being indicated by an arrowhead at the far end. -
Dear reader or, or better still, dear lady reader, recall the
bright, joyful eyes with which your child beams upon you
when you bring him a new toy, and then let the physicist tell
you that in reality nothing emerges from these eyes; in reality
their only objectively detectable function is, continually to be
hit by and to receive light quanta. In reality! A strange reality!
Something seems to be missing in it.

It is very difficult for us to take stock of the fact that the
localization of the personality, of the conscious mind, inside
the body is only symbolic, just an aid for practical use. Let us,
with all the knowledge we have about it, follow such a 'tender
look' inside the body. We do hit there on a supremely
interesting bustle or, if you like, machinery. We find millions
of cells of very specialized build in an arrangement that is
unsurveyably intricate but quite obviously serves a very
far-reaching and highly consummate mutual communication
and collaboration; a ceaseless hammering of regular electro-
chemical pulses which, however, change rapidly in their
configuration, being conducted from nerve cell to nerve cell,
tens of thousands of con tacts being opened and blocked wi thin
every split second, chemical transformations being induced
and maybe other changes as yet undiscovered. All this we
meet and, as the science of physiology advances, we may trust
that we shall come to know more and more about it. 

But now
let us assume that in a particular case 

Assume we observe several efferent bundles of pulsating currents which come from the brain.

Through long cellular protrusions (motor nerve fibres), are conducted to certain muscles of the arm,
which, as a consequence, tends a hesitating, trembling hand
to bid you farewell - for a long, heart-rending separation; 

at
the same time you may find that some other pulsating bundles
produce a certain glandular secretion so as to veil the poor sad
eye with a crape of tears. 

But nowhere along this way from the
eye through the central organ to the arm muscles and the tear
glands - nowhere, you may be sure, however far physiology
advances, will you ever meet the personality, will you ever
meet the dire pain, the bewildered worry within this soul,
though their reality is to you so certain as though you suffered
them yourself - as in actual fact you do! 

The picture that physiological analysis vouchsafes to us of any other human
being, be it our most intimate friend, strikingly recalls to me
Edgar Allan Poe's masterly story, which I am sure many a
reader remembers well; I mean The Masque oj'the Red Death. 

A princeling and his retinue have withdrawn to an isolated
castle to escape the pestilence of the red death that rages in the
land. After a week or so of retirement they arrange a great
dancing feast in fancy dress and mask. 

One of the masks, tall,
entirely veiled, clad all in red and obviously intended to
represent the pestilence allegorically, makes everybody shudder, both for the wantonness of the choice and for the
suspicion that it might be an intruder. At last a bold young
man approaches the red mask and with a sudden jolt tears off
veil and head-gear. It is found empty.

Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in
spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held
against the life and the emotions of the soul.

To become aware of this may in the first moment upset one.

To me it seems, on deeper thought, rather a consolation. If
you have to face the body of a deceased friend whom you
sorely miss, is it not soothing to realize that this body was
never really the seat of his personality but only symbolically
'for practical reference'?
