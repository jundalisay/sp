In the world of physics we watch a shadowgraph performance of
familiar life. The shadow of my elbow rests on the shadow table as
the shadow ink flows over the shadow paper ... The frank reali-
zation that physical science is concerned with a world of shadows is
one of the most significant of recent advances. 

Please note that the very recent advance does not lie in the
world of physics itself having acquired this shadowy character; it had it ever since Democritus of Abdera and even before,
but we were not aware of it; we thought we were dealing with
the world itself; expressions like model or picture for the
conceptual constructs of science canle up in the second half of
the nineteenth century, and not earlier, as far as I know.

Not much later Sir Charles Sherrington published his
momentous Man on his Nature. 2 The book is pervaded by the
honest search for objective evidence of the interaction between
matter and mind. I stress the epithet 'honest', because it does
need a very serious and sincere endeavour to look for some-
thing which one is deeply convinced in advance cannot be
found, because (in the teeth of popular belief) it does not exist.
A brief summary of the result of this search is found on p. 357:
Mind, the anything perception can compass, goes therefore in our
spatial world more ghostly than a ghost. Invisible, intangible, it is a
thing not even of outline; it is not a 'thing'. I t remains without
sens ual confirmation and remains wi thou tit forever.

In my own words I would express this by saying: Mind has
erected the objective outside world of the natural philosopher
out of its own stuff. Mind could not cope with this gigantic
task otherwise than by the simplifying device of excluding
itself - withdrawing from its conceptual creation. Hence the
latter does not contain its creator.

I cannot convey the grandeur of Sherrington's immortal
book by quoting sentences; one has to read it oneself. Still, I
will mention a few of the more particularly characteristic.
Physical science ... faces us with the impasse that mind per se
cannot play the piano - mind per se cannot move a finger of a hand

Then the impasse meets us. The blank of the 'how' of mind's
leverage on matter. The inconsequence staggers us. Is it a misunder-
standing? (p. 232).

Hold these conclusions drawn by an experimental physiol-
ogist of the twentieth century against the simple statement of
the greatest philosopher of the seventeenth century: B.

Spinoza (Ethics, Pt III, Prop. 2):
Nec corpus mentem ad cogitandum, nec mens corpus ad motum,
neque ad quietem, nec ad aliquid (si quid est) aliud determinare
potest.

[Neither can the body determine the mind to think, nor the mind
determine the body to motion or rest or anything else (if such there
be).]

The impasse is an impasse. Are we thus not the doers of our
deeds? Yet we feel responsible for them, we are punished or
praised for them, as the case may be. It is a horrible antinomy.
I maintain that it cannot be solved on the level of present-day
science which is still entirely engulfed in the 'exclusion
principle' - without knowing it - hence the antinomy. To
realize this is valuable, but it does not solve the problem. You
cannot remove the 'exclusion principle' by act of parliament
as it were. Scientific attitude would have to be rebuilt, science
must be made anew. 


So we are faced with the following remarkable situation.
While the stuff from which our world picture is built is yielded
exclusively from the sense organs as organs of the mind, so
that every man's world picture is and always remains a
construct of his mind and cannot be proved to have any other
existence, yet the conscious mind itself remains a stranger
within that construct, it has no living space in it, you can spot
it nowhere in space. We do not usually realize this fact,
because we have entirely taken to thinking of the personality
of a human being, or for that matter also that of an animal, as
located in the interior of its body. To learn that it cannot
really be found there is so amazing that it meets with doubt
and hesitation, we are very loath to admit it. We have got used
to localizing the conscious personality inside a person's head -

I should say an inch or two behind the midpoint of the eyes.
From there it gives us, as the case may be, understanding or
loving or tender - or suspicious or angry looks. I wonder has it
ever been noted that the eye is the only sense organ whose
purely receptive character we fail to recognize in naIve
thought. Reversing the actual state of affairs, we are much
more inclined to think of 'rays of vision', issuing from the eye,
than of the 'rays of light' that hit the eyes from outside. You
quite frequently find such a 'ray of vision' represented in a
drawing in a comic paper, or even in some older schematic
sketch intended to illustrate an optic instrunlent or law, a
dotted line emerging from the eye and pointing to the object,
the direction being indicated by an arrowhead at the far end. -
Dear reader or, or better still, dear lady reader, recall the
bright, joyful eyes with which your child beams upon you
when you bring him a new toy, and then let the physicist tell
you that in reality nothing emerges from these eyes; in reality
their only objectively detectable function is, continually to be
hit by and to receive light quanta. In reality! A strange reality!
Something seems to be missing in it.

It is very difficult for us to take stock of the fact that the
localization of the personality, of the conscious mind, inside
the body is only symbolic, just an aid for practical use. Let us,
with all the knowledge we have about it, follow such a 'tender
look' inside the body. We do hit there on a supremely
interesting bustle or, if you like, machinery. We find millions
of cells of very specialized build in an arrangement that is
unsurveyably intricate but quite obviously serves a very
far-reaching and highly consummate mutual communication
and collaboration; a ceaseless hammering of regular electro-
chemical pulses which, however, change rapidly in their
configuration, being conducted from nerve cell to nerve cell,
tens of thousands of con tacts being opened and blocked wi thin
every split second, chemical transformations being induced
and maybe other changes as yet undiscovered. All this we
meet and, as the science of physiology advances, we may trust
that we shall come to know more and more about it. 

But now
let us assume that in a particular case you eventually observe several efferent bundles of pulsating currents, which issue
from the brain and through long cellular protrusions (motor
nerve fibres), are conducted to certain muscles of the arm,
which, as a consequence, tends a hesitating, trembling hand
to bid you farewell - for a long, heart-rending separation; at
the same time you may find that some other pulsating bundles
produce a certain glandular secretion so as to veil the poor sad
eye with a crape of tears. But nowhere along this way from the
eye through the central organ to the arm muscles and the tear
glands - nowhere, you may be sure, however far physiology
advances, will you ever meet the personality, will you ever
meet the dire pain, the bewildered worry within this soul,
though their reality is to you so certain as though you suffered
them yourself - as in actual fact you do! The picture that
physiological analysis vouchsafes to us of any other human
being, be it our most intimate friend, strikingly recalls to me
Edgar Allan Poe's masterly story, which I am sure many a
reader remembers well; I mean The Masque oj'the Red Death. 

A princeling and his retinue have withdrawn to an isolated
castle to escape the pestilence of the red death that rages in the
land. After a week or so of retirement they arrange a great
dancing feast in fancy dress and mask. One of the masks, tall,
entirely veiled, clad all in red and obviously intended to
represent the pestilence allegorically, makes everybody shud-
der, both for the wantonness of the choice and for the
suspicion that it might be an intruder. At last a bold young
man approaches the red mask and with a sudden jolt tears off
veil and head-gear. It is found empty.
Now our skulls are not empty. But what we find there, in
spite of the keen interest it arouses, is truly nothing when held
against the life and the emotions of the soul.
To become aware of this may in the first moment upset one.
To me it seems, on deeper thought, rather a consolation. If
you have to face the body of a deceased friend whom you
sorely miss, is it not soothing to realize that this body was
never really the seat of his personality but only symbolically
'for practical reference'?

As an appendix to these considerations, those strongly
interested in the physical sciences might wish to hear me
pronounce on a line of ideas, concerning subject and object,
that has been given great prominence by the prevailing school
of thought in quantum physics, the protagonists being Niels
Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born and others. Let me first
give you a very brief description of their ideas. I t runs as
follows: I

We cannot make any factual statement about a given
natural object (or physical system) without 'getting in touch'
with it. This 'touch' is a real physical interaction. Even if it
consists only in our 'looking at the object' the latter must be
hit by light-rays and reflect them into the eye, or into some
instrument of observation. This means that the object is
affected by our observation. You cannot obtain any know-
ledge about an object while leaving it strictly isolated. The
theory goes on to assert that this disturbance is neither
irrelevant nor completely surveyable. Thus after any number
of painstaking observations the object is left in a state of which
some features (the last observed) are known, but others (those
interfered with by the last observation) are not known, or not
accurately known. This state of affairs is offered as an
explanation why no complete, gapless description of any
physical object is ever possible.

If this has to be granted - and possibly it has to be granted -
then it flies in the face of the principle of unders tanda bili ty of
nature. This in itself is no opprobrium. I told you at the outset
that my two principles are not meant to be binding on science,
that they only express what we had actually kept to in
physical science for many, many centuries and what cannot
easily be changed. Personally I do not feel sure that our
present knowledge as yet vindicates the change. I consider it
possible that our models can be modified in such a fashion
that they do not exhibit at any mornent properties that cannot
in principle be observed simultaneously - models poorer in
simultaneous properties but richer in adaptability to changes
in the environment. 

However, this is an internal question of physics, not to be decided here and now. But from the theory
as explained before, from the unavoidable and unsurveyable
interference of the measuring devices with the object under
observation, lofty consequences of an epistemological nature
have been drawn and brought to the fore, concerning the
relation between subject and object. It is maintained that
recent discoveries in physics have pushed forward to the
mysterious boundary between the subject and the object. This
boundary, so we are told, is not a sharp boundary at all. We
are given to understand that we never observe an object
without its being modified or tinged by our own activity in
observing it. We are given to understand that under the
impact of our refined methods of observation and of thinking
about the results of our experiments that mysterious boundary
between the subject and the object has broken down.
In order to criticize these contentions let me at first accept
the time-hallowed distinction or discrimination between
object and subject, as many thinkers both in olden times have
accepted it and in recent times still accept it. Among the
philosophers who accepted it - from Democritus of Abdera
down to the 'Old Man of Konigs berg' - there were few, if any
who did not emphasize that all our sensations, perceptions
and observations have a strong, personal, subjective tinge and
do not convey the nature of the 'thing-in-itself, to use Kant's
term. While some of these thinkers might have in mind only a
more or less strong or slight distortion, Kant landed us with a
complete resignation: never to know anything at all about his
'thing-in-itself. Thus the idea of subjectivity in all appearance
is very old and familiar. What is new in the present setting is
this: that not only would the impressions we get from our
environment largely depend on the nature and the contingent
state of our sensorium, but inversely the very environment
that we wish to take in is modified by us, notably by the
devices we set up in order to observe it.
Maybe this is so - to some extent it certainly is. 

May be that
from the newly discovered laws of quantum physics this
modification cannot be reduced below certain well-ascertained limits. Still I would not like to call this a direct influence of the subject on the object. For the subject, if
anything, is the thing that senses and thinks. Sensations and
thoughts do not belong to the 'world of energy', they cannot
produce any change in this world of energy as we know from
Spinoza and Sir Charles Sherrington.
All this was said from the point of view that we accept the
time-hallowed discrimination between subject and object.
Though we have to accept it in everyday life 'for practical
reference', we ought, so I believe, to abandon it in philosophi-
cal thought. I ts rigid logical consequence has been revealed by
Kant: the sublime, but empty, idea of the 'thing-in-itself
about which we forever know nothing.
It is the same elements that go to compose my mind and the
world. This situation is the same for every mind and its world,
in spite of the unfathomable abundance of 'cross-references'
between them. The world is given to me only once, not one
existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one.
The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken
down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences,
for this barrier does not exist.
