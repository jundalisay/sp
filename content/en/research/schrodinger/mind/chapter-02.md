A BIOLOGICAL BLIND ALLEY?

We may, I believe, regard it as extremely improbable that our
understanding of the world represents any definite or final
stage, a maximum or optimum in any respect. 

By this I do not mean merely that the continuation of our research in the
various sciences, our philosophical studies and religious
endeavour are likely to enhance and improve our present
outlook. 

What we are likely to gain in this way in the next,
say, two and a half millennia - estimating from what we have
gained since Protagoras, Democritus and Antisthenes - is
insignificant compared with what I am here alluding to.
There is no reason whatever for believing that our brain is the
supreme ne plus ultra of an organ of thought in which the world
is reflected. I t is more likely than not that a species could
acquire a similar contraption whose corresponding imagery
compares with ours as ours with that of the dog, or his in turn
with that of a snail.

If this be so, then - though it is not relevant in principle - it
interests us, as it were for personal reasons, whether anything
of the sort could be reached on our globe by our own offspring
or the offspring of some of us. The globe is all right. I t is a fine
young leasehold, still to run under acceptable conditions of
living for about the time it took us (say 1,000 million years) to
develop from the earliest beginnings into what we are now.

But are we ourselves all right? If one accepts the present
theory of evolution - and we have no better - it might seem
that we have been very nearly cut off from future develop-
ment. Is there still physical evolution to be expected in man, I
mean to say relevant changes in our physique that become
gradually fixed as inherited features, just as our present bodily
self is fixed by inheritance - genotypical changes, to use the
technical term of the biologist? This question is difficult to
answer. We may be approaching the end of a blind alley, we
may even have reached it. This would not be an exceptional
event and it would not mean that our species would have to
become extinct very soon. From the geological records we
know that some species or even large groups seem to have
reached the end of their evolutionary possibilities a very long
time ago, yet they have not died out, but have remained
unchanged, or without significant change, for many millions
of years. The tortoises, for instance, and the crocodiles are in
this sense very old groups, relics of a far remote past; we are
also told that the whole large group of insects are more or less
in the same boat - and they comprise a greater number of
separate species than all the rest of the animal kingdom taken
together. But they have changed very little in millions of
years, while the rest of the living surface of the earth has
during this time undergone change beyond recognition. What
barred further evolution in the insects was probably this - that
they had adopted the plan (you will not misunderstand this
figurative expression) - that they had adopted the plan of
wearing their skeleton outside instead of inside as we do. Such
an outside armour, while affording protection in addition to
mechanical stability, cannot grow as the bones of a mammal
do between birth and maturity. This circumstance is bound to
render gradual adaptive changes in the life-history of the
individual very difficult.

In the case of man several arguments seem to militate against
further evolution. The spontaneous inheritable changes - now
called mutations - from which, according to Darwin's theory,
the 'profitable' ones are automatically selected, are as a rule
only small evolutionary steps, affording, if any, only a slight advantage. That is why in Darwin's deductions an important
part is attributed to the usually enormous abundance of
offspring, of which only a very small fraction can possibly
survive. For only thus does a small amelioration in the chance
of survival seem to have a reasonable likelihood of being
realized.

This whole mechanism appears to be blocked in
civilized man - in some respects even reversed. We are,
generally speaking, not willing to see our fellow-creatures
suffer and perish, and so we have gradually introduced legal
and social institutions which on the one hand protect life,
condemn systematic infanticide, try to help every sick or frail
human being to survive, while on the other hand they have to
replace the natural elimination of the less fit by keeping the
offspring within the limits of the available livelihood. This is
achieved partly in a direct way, by birth control, partly by
preventing a considerable proportion of females from mating.
Occasionally - as this generation knows all too well - the
insanity of war and all the disasters and blunders that follow
in its wake contribute their share to the balance. Millions of
adults and children of both sexes are killed by starvation,
exposure, epidemics. While in the far remote past warfare
be'tween small tribes or clans is supposed to have had a
positive selection value, it seems doubtful whether it ever had
in historical times, and doubtless war at present has none. It
means an indiscriminate killing, just as the advances in
medicine and surgery result in an indiscriminate saving of
lives. While justly and diametrically opposite in our esteem,
both war and medical art seem to be of no selection value
whatever.
