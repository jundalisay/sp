The reason why our sentient, percipient and thinking ego is
met nowhere within our scientific world picture can easily be
indicated in seven words: because it is itself that world
picture. I t is identical with the whole and therefore cannot be
contained in it as a part of it. But, of course, here we knock
against the arithmetical paradox; there appears to be a great
multitude of these conscious egos, the world however is only
one. This comes from the fashion in which the world-concept
produces itself. The several domains of 'private' conscious-
nesses partly overlap. The region common to all where they
all overlap is the construct of the 'real world around us'. With
all that an uncomfortable feeling remains, prompting such
questions as: Is my world really the same as yours? Is there one
real world to be distinguished from its pictures introjected by
way of perception into everyone of us? And if so, are these
pictures like unto the real world or is the latter, the world 'in
itself, perhaps very different from the one we perceive?
Such questions are ingenious, but in my opinion very apt to
confuse the issue. They have no adequate answers. They all
are, or lead to, antinomies springing from the one source,
which I called the arithmetical paradox; the many conscious
egos from whose mental experiences the one world is concoc-
ted. The solution of this paradox of numbers would do away
with all the questions of the aforesaid kind and reveal them, I
dare say, as sham questions.

There are two ways out of the number paradox, both
appearing rather lunatic from the point of view of present
scientific thought (based on ancient Greek thought and thus thoroughly 'Western'). One way out is the multiplication of
the world in Leibniz's fearful doctrine of monads: every
monad to be a world by itself, no communication between
them; the monad 'has no windows', it is 'incommunicado'.

That none the less they all agree with each other is called
'pre-established harmony'. I think there are few to whom this
suggestion appeals, nay who would consider it as a mitigation
at all of the numerical antinomy.

There is obviously only one alternative, namely the unifica-
tion of minds or consciousnesses. Their multiplicity is only
apparent, in truth there is only one mind. This is the doctrine
of the Upanishads. And not only of the Upanishads. The
mystically experienced union with God regularly entails this
attitude unless it is opposed by strong existing prejudices; and
this means that it is less easily accepted in the West than in
the East. Let me quote as an example outside the Upanishads
an Islamic Persian mystic of the thirteenth century, Aziz
Nasafi. I am taking it from a paper by Fritz Meyer! and
translating from his German translation:
On the death of any living creature the spirit returns to the spiritual
world, the body to the bodily world. In this however only the bodies
are subject to change. The spiritual world is one single spirit who
stands like unto a light behind the bodily world and who, when any
single creature comes into being, shines through it as through a
window. According to the kind and size of the window less or more
light enters the world. The light itself however remains unchanged.
Ten years ago Aldous Huxley published a precious volume
which he called The Perennial Philosophy2 and which is an
anthology from the mystics of the most various periods and
the most various peoples. Open it where you will and you find
many beautiful utterances of a similar kind. You are struck by
the miraculous agreement between humans of different race,
different religion, knowing nothing about each other's exist-
ence, separated by centuries and millennia, and by the
greatest distances that there are on our globe.

Still, it must be said that to Western thought this doctrine has little appeal, it is unpalatable, it is dubbed fantastic,
unscientific. Well, so it is because our science - Greek science
- is based on objectivation, whereby it has cut itself off from
an adequate understanding of the Subject of Cognizance, of
the mind. But I do believe that this is precisely the point
where our present way of thinking does need to be amended,
perhaps by a bit of blood-transfusion from Eastern thought.

That will not be easy, we must beware of blunders -
blood-transfusion always needs great precaution to prevent
clotting. We do "not wish to lose the logical precision that our
scientific thought has reached, and that is unparalleled any-
where at any epoch.

Still, one thing can be claimed in favour of the mystical
teaching of the 'identity' of all minds with each other and with
the supreme mind - as against the fearful monadology of
Leibniz. 

The doctrine of identity can claim that it is clinched
by the empirical fact that consciousness is never experienced
in the plural, only in the singular. Not only has none of us ever
experienced more than one consciousness, but there is also no
trace of circumstantial evidence of this ever happening any-
where in the world. If I say that there cannot be more than
one consciousness in the same mind, this seems a blunt
tautology - we are quite unable to imagine the contrary.
Yet there are cases or situations where we would expect and
nearly require this unimaginable thing to happen, if it can
happen at all. This is the point that I should like to discuss
now in some detail, and to clinch it by quotations from Sir
Charles Sherrington, who was at the same time (rare event!) a
man of highest genius and a sober scientist. For all I know he
had no bias towards the philosophy of the Upanishads. My
purpose in this discussion is to contribute perhaps to clearing
the way for a future assimilation of the doctrine of identity
with our own scientific world view, without having to pay for
it by a loss of soberness and logical precision.
I said just now that we are not able even to imagine a plurality
of consciousnesses in one mind. We can pronounce these
words all right, but they are not the description of any thinkable experience. Even in the pathological cases of a 'split
personality' the two persons alternate, they never hold the
field jointly; nay this is just the characteristic feature, that
they know nothing about each other.

When in the puppet-show of dream we hold in hand the
strings of quite a number of actors, controlling their actions
and their speech, we are not aware of this being so. Only one
of them is myself, the dreamer. In him I act and speak
immediately, while I may be awaiting eagerly and anxiously
what another one will reply, whether he is going to fulfil my
urgent request. That I could really let him do and say
whatever I please does not occur to me - in fact it is not quite
the case. 

For in a dream of this kind the 'other one' is, I dare
say, mostly the impersonation of some serious obstacle that
opposes me in waking life and of which I have actually no
control. The strange state of affairs, described here, is quite
obviously the reason why most people of old firmly believed
that they were truly in communication with the persons, alive
or deceased, or, maybe, gods or heroes, whom they met in
their dreams. It is a superstition that dies hard. On the verge
of the sixth century B.C. Heraclitus of Ephesus definitely
pronounced against it, with a clarity not often met with in his
sometimes very obscure fragments. But Lucretius Carus, who
believed himself to be the protagonist of enlightened thought,
still holds on to this superstition in the first century B.C. In our
days it is probably rare, but I doubt that it is entirely extinct.
Let me turn to something quite different.
