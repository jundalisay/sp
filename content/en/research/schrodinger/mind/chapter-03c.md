<!-- As an appendix to these considerations, those strongly
interested in the physical sciences might wish to hear me
pronounce on a line of ideas, concerning ,
that has been given great prominence by the prevailing school
of thought in quantum physics, the protagonists being  -->

Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born etc have pushed for the topic of subject and object in quantum physics.

1. We cannot make any factual statement about a given natural object (or physical system) without 'getting in touch' with it. 

This 'touch' is a real physical interaction. Even if it
consists only in our 'looking at the object' the latter must be
hit by light-rays and reflect them into the eye, or into some
instrument of observation. This means that the object is
affected by our observation. 

You cannot obtain any knowledge about an object while leaving it strictly isolated. The
theory goes on to assert that this disturbance is neither
irrelevant nor completely surveyable. Thus after any number
of painstaking observations the object is left in a state of which
some features (the last observed) are known, but others (those
interfered with by the last observation) are not known, or not
accurately known. This state of affairs is offered as an
explanation why no complete, gapless description of any
physical object is ever possible.

If this has to be granted - and possibly it has to be granted -
then it flies in the face of the principle of unders tanda bili ty of
nature. This in itself is no opprobrium. I told you at the outset
that my two principles are not meant to be binding on science,
that they only express what we had actually kept to in
physical science for many, many centuries and what cannot
easily be changed. 

Personally I do not feel sure that our
present knowledge as yet vindicates the change. I consider it
possible that our models can be modified in such a fashion
that they do not exhibit at any mornent properties that cannot
in principle be observed simultaneously - models poorer in
simultaneous properties but richer in adaptability to changes
in the environment. 

However, this is an internal question of physics, not to be decided here and now. But from the theory
as explained before, from the unavoidable and unsurveyable
interference of the measuring devices with the object under
observation, lofty consequences of an epistemological nature
have been drawn and brought to the fore, concerning the
relation between subject and object. It is maintained that
recent discoveries in physics have pushed forward to the
mysterious boundary between the subject and the object. This
boundary, so we are told, is not a sharp boundary at all. We
are given to understand that we never observe an object
without its being modified or tinged by our own activity in
observing it. We are given to understand that under the
impact of our refined methods of observation and of thinking
about the results of our experiments that mysterious boundary
between the subject and the object has broken down.

In order to criticize these contentions let me at first accept
the time-hallowed  or discrimination between

Some philosophers accepted the distinction between subject and object.

<!-- , as many thinkers both in olden times have
accepted it and in recent times still accept it. Among the
 it - from Democritus of Abdera
down to the 'Old Man of Konigs berg' - there were  -->

Few people did not emphasize that all our sensations, perceptions and observations:
- have a strong, personal, subjective tinge
- do not convey the nature of the 'thing-in-itself to use Kant's term. 

While some of these thinkers might have in mind only a
more or less strong or slight distortion, 

Kant gave us with a complete resignation: never to know anything at all about his 'thing-in-itself. 

Thus the idea of subjectivity in all appearance is very old and familiar. What is new in the present setting is
this: that not only would the impressions we get from our
environment largely depend on the nature and the contingent
state of our sensorium, but inversely the very environment
that we wish to take in is modified by us, notably by the
devices we set up in order to observe it.

Maybe this is so - to some extent it certainly is. 

May be that from the newly discovered laws of quantum physics this modification cannot be reduced below certain well-ascertained limits. Still I would not like to call this a direct influence of the subject on the object. For the subject, if anything, is the thing that senses and thinks. 

Sensations and thoughts do not belong to the 'world of energy', they cannot produce any change in this world of energy as we know from Spinoza and Sir Charles Sherrington. 

All this was said from the point of view that we accept the time-hallowed discrimination between subject and object. Though we have to accept it in everyday life 'for practical reference', we ought, so I believe, to abandon it in philosophi- cal thought. I ts rigid logical consequence has been revealed by Kant: the sublime, but empty, idea of the 'thing-in-itself about which we forever know nothing.

It is the same elements that go to compose my mind and the world. This situation is the same for every mind and its world, in spite of the unfathomable abundance of 'cross-references' between them. The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.
