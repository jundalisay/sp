<!-- That would be a very trivial remark if it were meant only to
stimulate the hope of achieving in the future what has not
been achieved in the past. But the meaning is very much more
positive, viz. that the inability, up to the present moment, is
amply accounted for. -->

Today, thanks to the ingenious work of biologists, mainly of
geneticists, during the last thirty or forty years, enough is
known about the actual material structure of organisms and
about their functioning to state that, and to tell precisely why,
present-day physics and chemistry could not possibly account
for what happens in space and time within a living organism.

The arrangements of the atoms in the most vital parts of an
organism and the interplay of these arrangements differ in a
fundamental way from all those arrangements of atoms which
physicists and chemists have hitherto made the object of their
experimental and theoretical research. Yet the difference
which I have just termed fundamental is of such a kind that it
might easily appear slight to anyone except a physicist who is
thoroughly imbued with the knowledge that the laws of
physics and chemistry are statistical throughout. 

I For it is in
relation to the statistical point of view that the structure of the
vital parts of living organisms differs so entirely from that of
any piece of matter that we physicists and chemists have ever
handled physically in our laboratories or mentally at our writing desks. 

I I t is well-nigh unthinkable that the laws and
regularities thus discovered should happen to apply imme-
diately to the behaviour of systems which do not exhibit the
structure on which those laws and regularities are based.

The non-physicist cannot be expected even to grasp - let
alone to appreciate the relevance of - the difference in
'statistical structure' stated in terms so abstract as I have just
used. To give the statement life and colour, let me anticipate
what will be explained in much more detail later, namely, that
the most essential part of a living cell - the chromosome fibre
- may suitably be called an aperiodic crystal. In physics we have
dealt hitherto only with periodic crystals. 

To a humble physicist's mind, these are very interesting and complicated
objects; they constitute one of the most fascinating and
complex material structures by which inanimate nature
puzzles his wits. Yet, compared with the aperiodic crystal,
they are rather plain and dull. The difference in structure is of
the same kind as that between an ordinary wallpaper in which
the same pattern is repeated again and again in regular
periodicity and a masterpiece of embroidery, say a Raphael
tapestry, which shows no dull repetition, but an elaborate,
coherent, meaningful design traced by the great master.
In calling the periodic crystal one of the most complex
objects of his research, I had in mind the physicist proper.
Organic chemistry, indeed, in investigating more and more
complicated molecules, has come very much nearer to that
'aperiodic crystal' which, in my opinion, is the material
carrier of life. And therefore it is small wonder that the organic
chemist has already made large and important contributions
to the problem of life, whereas the physicist has made next to
none.


## THE NAIVE PHYSICIST'S APPROACH 

After having thus indicated very briefly the general idea - or rather the ultimate scope - of our investigation, let me describe the line of attack.

I propose to develop first what you might call 'a naive physicist's ideas about organisms', that is, the ideas which might arise in the mind of a physicist who, after having learnt his physics and, more especially, the statistical foundation of his science, begins to think about organisms and about the way they behave and function and who comes to ask himself conscientiously whether he, from what he has learnt, from the point of view of his comparatively simple and clear and humble science, can make any relevant contributions to the question.

It will turn out that he can. The next step must be to compare his theoretical anticipations with the biological facts. I t will then turn out that - though on the whole his ideas seem quite sensible - they need to be appreciably amended. In this way we shall gradually approach the correct view - or, to put it more modestly, the one that I propose as the correct one. Even if I should be right in this, I do not know whether my way of approach is really the best and simplest. But, in short, it was mine. The 'naive physicist' was myself. And I could not find any better or clearer way towards the goal than my own crooked one.


## WHY ARE THE ATOMS SO SMALL?

A good method of developing 'the naive physicist's ideas' is to start from the odd, almost ludicrous, question: Why are atoms so small? To begin with, they are very small. 

Every little piece of matter handled in everyday life contains an enormous number of them. Many examples have been devised to bring this fact home to an audience, none of them more impressive than the one used by Lord Kelvin: Suppose that you could mark the molecules in a glass of water; then pour the contents of the glass into the ocean and stir the latter thoroughly so as to distribute the marked molecules uniformly throughout the seven seas; if then you took a glass of water anywhere out of the ocean, you would find in it about a hundred of your marked molecules.

I
The actual sizes of atoms 2 lie between about 50
1
00 and 20
1
00 of the wave-length of yellow light. The comparison is significant,
because the wave-length roughly indicates the dimensions of
the smallest grain still recognizable in the microscope. Thus it
will be seen that such a grain still contains thousands of
millions of atoms.


Clearly, the question is an evasion. For it is not really aimed at the size of the atoms. I t is concerned with the size of organisms, more particularly with the size of our own corporeal selves. Indeed, the atom is small, when referred to our civic unit of length, say the yard or the metre. In atomic physics one is accustomed to use the so-called Angstrom (abbr. A), which is the 1 oIoth part of a metre, or in decimal notation 0.0000000001 metre. Atomic diameters range between I and 2A. Now those civic units (in relation to which the atoms are so small) are closely related to the size of our bodies. 

There is a story tracing the yard back to the humour of an English king whom his councillors asked what unit to adopt - and he stretched out his arm sideways and said: 'Take the distance from the middle of my chest to my fingertips, that will do all right.' True or not, the story is significant for our purpose. 

The king would naturally indicate a length comparable with that of his own body, knowing that anything else would be very inconvenient. With all his predilection for the Angstrom unit, the physicist prefers to be told that his new sujt will require six and a half yards of
tweed - rather than sixty-five thousand millions of Angstroms of tweed.

<!-- I You would not, of course, find exactly 100 (even if that were the exact result of the
computation). You might find 88 or 95 or 107 or 112, but very improbably as few as
50 or as many as 150. A 'deviation' or 'fluctuation' is to be expected of the order of
the square root of 100, i.e. 10. The statistician expresses this by stating that you
would find I ooÂ± 10. This remark can be ignored for the moment, but will be referred
to later, affording an example of the statistical V n law.
2According to present-day views an atom has no sharp boundary, so that 'size' of an
atom is not a very well-defined conception. But we may identify it (or, if you please,
replace it) by the distance between their centres in a solid or in a liquid - not, of
course, in the gaseous state, where that distance is, under normal pressure and
temperature, roughly ten times as great. -->

It thus being settled that our question really aims at the ratio of two lengths - that of our body and that of the atom - with an incontestable priority of independent existence on the side of the atom, the question truly reads: Why must our bodies be so large compared with the atom?

I can imagine that many a keen student of physics or chemistry may have deplored the fact that everyone of our sense organs, forming a more or less substantial part of our body and hence (in view of the magnitude of the said ratio) being itself composed of innumerable atoms, is much too coarse to be affected by the impact of a single atom. We cannot see or feel or hear the single atoms. ()ur hypotheses with regard to them differ widely from the immediate findings of our gross sense organs and cannot be put to the test of direct inspection.

Must that be so? Is there an intrinsic reason for it? Can we trace back this state of affairs to some kind of first principle, in order to ascertain and to understand why nothing else is compatible with the very laws of Nature?

Now this, for once, is a problem which the physicist is able to clear up completely. The answer to all the queries is in the
affirmative.
