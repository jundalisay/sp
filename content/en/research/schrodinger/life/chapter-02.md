## The Classical Physicist'S Expectation Is Wrong

An organism and all the biologically relevant processes that it experiences must:
- have an extremely 'many-atomic' structure 
- be safeguarded against haphazard, 'single-atomic' events attaining too great importance. 

The 'naive physicist' tells us, is
essential, so that the organism may, so to speak, have
sufficiently accurate physical laws on which to draw for
setting up its marvellously regular and well-ordered working.

How do these conclusions, reached, biologically speaking, a
priori (that is, from the purely physical point of view), fit in
with actual biological facts?

At first sight one is inclined to think that the conclusions are
little more than trivial. 


30 years ago, a biologist could say that, although it was quite suitable for a
popular lecturer to emphasize the importance, in the organ-
ism as elsewhere, of statistical physics, the point was, in fact,
rather a familiar truism. 

For, naturally, not only the body of
an adult individual of any higher species, but every single cell
composing it contains a 'cosmical' number of single atoms of

Universe draws for beauty. -->

every kind. And every particular physiological process that we
observe, either within the cell or in its interaction with the
environment, appears - or appeared thirty years ago - to
involve such enormous numbers of single atoms and single
atomic processes that all the relevant laws of physics and
physical chemistry would be safeguarded even under the very
exacting demands of statistical physics in respect of 'large
numbers'; this demand I illustratedjust now by the Yn rule.

Today, we know that this is wrong.

Small groups of atoms, much too small to display exact statistical laws, do
play a dominating role in the very orderly and lawful events
within a living organism. 

They have control of the observable
large-scale features which the organism acquires in the course
of its development, they determine important characteristics
of its functioning; and in all this very sharp and very strict
biological laws are displayed.
