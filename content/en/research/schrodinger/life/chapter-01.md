## Preface


A scientist is supposed to have a complete and thorough knowledge of some subjects.

He is usually expected not to write on any topic of which he is not a master. This is regarded as a matter of noblesse oblige. For the present purpose I beg to renounce the noblesse, if any, and to be freed of the ensuing obligation. My excuse is as follows: W e have inherited from our forefathers the keen longing for unified, all-embracing knowledge. The very name given to the highest institutions of learning reminds us, that from antiquity and throughout many centuries the universal aspect has been the only one to be given full credit. But the spread, both in width and depth, of the multifarious branches of knowledge during the last hundred odd years has confronted us with a queer dilemma. We feel clearly that we are only now begin- ning to acquire reliable material for welding together the sum total of all that is known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it has become next to impossible for a single mind fully to command more than a small specialized portion of it. I can see no other escape from this dilemma (lest our true aim be lost for ever) than that some of us should venture to embark on a synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of them - and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.

The difficulties of language are not negligible. One's native
speech is a closely fitting garment, and one never feels quite at
ease when it is not immediately available and has to be replaced by another. My thanks are due to Dr Inkster (Trinity
College, Dublin), to Dr Padraig Browne (St Patrick's College,
Maynooth) and, last but not least, to Mr S. C. Roberts. They
were put to great trouble to fit the new garment on me and to
even greater trouble by my occasional reluctance to give up
some 'original' fashion of my own. Should some of it have
survived the mitigating tendency of my friends, it is to be put
at my door, not at theirs.

The head-lines of the numerous sections were originally
intended to be marginal summaries, and the text of every
chapter should be read in continuo.

## THE PURPOSE OF THE INVESTIGATION

This little book arose from a course of public lectures,
delivered by a theoretical physicist to an audience of about
four hundred which did not substantially dwindle, though
warned at the outset that the subject-matter was a difficult
one and that the lectures could not be termed popular, even
though the physicist's most dreaded weapon, mathematical
deduction, would hardly be utilized. The reason for this was
not that the subject was simple enough to be explained
without mathematics, but rather that it was much too
involved to be fully accessible to mathematics. Another
feature which at least induced a semblance of popularity was
the lecturer's intention to make clear the fundamental idea,
which hovers between biology and physics, to both the
physicist and the biologist.

For actually, in spite of the variety of topics involved, the
whole enterprise is intended to convey one idea only - one
small comment on a large and important question. In order
not to lose our way, it may be useful to outline the plan very
briefly in advance.

The large and important and very much discussed question is:
How can the events in space and time which take place within
the spatial boundary of a living organism be accounted for by
physics and chemistry?

The preliminary answer which this little book will endeav-
our to expound and establish can be summarized as follows:
The obvious inability of present-day physics and chemistry
to account for such events is no reason at all for doubting that
they can be accounted for by those sciences.
