I lived far apart from my best friend, actually the only close
friend I ever had, for the greater part of my life. (Maybe that
is why I have often been accused of flirtatiousness instead of
true friendship.) He studied biology (botany to be exact); I
physics. And many a night we would stroll back and forth
between Gluckgasse and Schliisselgasse engrossed in philo-
sophical conversation. Little did we know then that what
seemed original to us had occupied great minds for centuries
already. Don't teachers always do their best to avoid these
topics for fear that they might conflict with religious doctrines
and cause uncomfortable questions? This is the main reason
for my turning against religion, which has never done me any
harm.

I am not sure whether it was right after the First World
War or during the time I spent in Zurich (1921-7) or even
later in Berlin (1927-33) that Franzel and I spent a long
evening together again. The small hours of the morning found
us still talking in a cafe on the outskirts of Vienna. He seemed
to have changed a lot with the years. After all, our letters had
been few and far between and of very little substance.
I might have added earlier that we also spent our time
together reading Richard Semon. Never before or after did I
read a serious book with anyone else. Richard Semon was
soon banned by the biologists, since his views, as they saw
them, were based on the inheritance of acquired characteris-
tics. So his name was forgotten. Many years later I encoun-
tered him in a book (Human Knowledge?) by Bertrand Russell,
who devoted a thorough study to this genial biologist, stress-
ing the significance of his Mneme theory.
Franzel and I did not see each other again until 1956. This
time it was a very brief encounter in our flat in Vienna,
Pasteurgasse 4, while others were present, so that those fifteen
minutes are hardly worth mentioning. Franzel and his wife
lived across the border, our northern one, unhampered by the
authorities, it seemed; nevertheless, leaving the country had
become rather difficult. We never met again: two years later
he died very suddenly.
Today I am still friends with his charming nephew and
168 ERWIN SCHRODINGER
niece, his favourite brother Silvio's children. Silvio, the
youngest in the family, was a doctor in Krems, where I went
to see him when I returned to Austria in Ig56. He must have
been seriously ill already, for he died not long afterwards. One
of Franzel's brothers, E., is still alive. He is a respected
surgeon in Klagenfurt. E. once took me up the Einser
(Sextener Dolomites) and, what's more, saw me safely down
again. I am afraid we have lost contact, driven apart by our
different views of the world.
Shortly before I entered the University of Vienna in I g06, the
only university I was ever enrolled in, the great Ludwig
Boltzmann met his sad end in Duino. To this day I have not
forgotten the clear, precise and yet still enthusiastic words with
which Fritz Hasenohrl described Boltzmann's work to us.
Boltzmann's scholar and successor held his inaugural address
in autumn I g07 in the primitive lecture hall of the old Tiirken-
strasse building without any pomp or ceremony. I was deeply
impressed by his introduction, and no perception in physics has
ever seemed more important to me than that of Boltzmann -
despite Planck and E:instein. Incidentally, Einstein's early
work (before Ig05) shows how fascinated he too was by Boltz-
mann's work. He was the only one who took a major step
beyond it by inverting Boltzmann's equation S == k 19 W. No
other human being had a greater influence on me than Fritz
Hasenohrl - except perhaps my father Rudolph, who in the
course of those many years we lived together drew me into
conversations concerning his many interests. But more about
that later.
While still a student I made friends with Hans Thirring.
This turned out to be a lasting relationship. When Hasenohrl
was killed in action in I 9 I 6, Hans Thirring became his
successor; he retired at seventy, forgoing the privilege of
remaining for the honorary year and leaving Boltzmann's
professorial chair to his son, W al tel'.
After Igl I, while I was assistant to Exner, I met K. W. F.
Kohlrausch, and yet another lasting friendship began. Kohl-
rausch had made his name by proving experimentally the
existence of the so-called 'Schweidle Fluctuations'. In the year
Autobiographical Sketches 16g
before the outbreak of the war we worked together on the
research of 'secondary radiations', which produced - at the
smallest possible angle on small plates of varying material- a
(mixed) beam of gamma rays. I learnt two things in those
years: firstly that I was not suited to experimental work, and
secondly that my surroundings and the people who were part of
them were no longer capable of making experimental progress
on a big scale. There were many reasons for this, one of them
being that in charming old Vienna well-meaning blunderers
were placed, often according to seniority, in key positions, thus
impeding all progress. If only it had been realized that per-
sonalities with great mental capacities were needed, even if it
meant bringing them in from afar! The theories of atmospheric
electricity and radio activity were both originally developed in
Vienna, but anyone who felt really dedicated to their work had
to follow those theories wherever they had been passed on. Lise
Meitner, for instance, left Vienna and went to Berlin.
But back to myself: in retrospect I am very grateful that
because of my reserve officer's training in Iglo/I I I was
appointed assistant to Fritz Exner and not to Hasenohrl. It
meant that I was able to experiment with K. W. F. Kohlrausch
and make use of a number of beautiful instruments, take them
to my room, especially the optical ones, and dabble with them
to my heart's content. Thus I could set the interferometer,
admire the spectra, mix colours, etc. This was also how I
discovered - through the Rayleigh equation - the deuter
anomaly of my eyes. Moreover I was committed to do the long
practical course, so that I learnt to appreciate the significance
of measuring. I wish there were more theoretical physicists who
did.
In Igl8 we had a kind of revolution. The Emperor Karl
abdicated and Austria became a republic. Our everyday life
remained much the same. However, my life was affected by the
breaking up of the Empire. I had accepted a post as a lecturer in
theoretical physics in Czernowitz and had already envisaged
spending all my free time acquiring a deeper knowledge of
philosophy, having just discovered Schopenhauer, who intro-
duced me to the Unified Theory of the Upanishads.

For us Viennese the war and its consequences meant that
we could no longer satisfy our basic needs. Hunger was the
punishment the victorious Entente had chosen in retaliation
for the unlimited V-boat war of their enemies, a war so
atrocious that Prince Bismarck's heir and his followers could
only outdo it in quantity, and not in quality, in the Second
World War. Hunger prevailed throughout the country except
on the farms, where our poor women were sent to ask for eggs,
butter and milk. Despite the goods with which they paid -
knitted garments, pretty petticoats, etc. - they were sneered at
and treated like beggars.
In Vienna it had become virtually impossible to socialize
and entertain friends. There was simply nothing to ofTer, and
even the simplest dishes were reserved for Sunday lunch. In
some ways this lack of social activities was compensated by
the daily visit to the community kitchens. The Gemein-
schaflskuchen were often referred to as Gemeinheitskuchen (Gemein-
schafl == 'community'; Gemeinheit == 'a mean trick'). There
we met for lunch. We had to be grateful to the women who
considered it their responsibility to create meals out of
nothing. I t is no doubt easier to do this for 30 or 50 people
than for three. Besides, relieving others of a burden must in
itselfbe rewarding.
My parents and I met a number of people with similar
interests there and some of them, the Radons, for example,
both of them mathematicians, became great friends of our
family.
I believe that in one way my parents and I were particularly
disadvantaged. At that time we lived in a large flat (actually
two flats made into one) on the fifth floor of a rather valuable
building in the city, which belonged to my mother's father. It
had no electric light, partly because my grandfather did not
want to pay for having it installed and also because my father,
in particular, had become so used to the excellent gas light at
a time when light bulbs were still very expensive and ineffi-
cient that we really saw no need for them. And we had the old
tiled stoves removed and replaced by solid gas stoves with
copper reflectors - servants were hard to come by in those
Autobiographical Sketches
days, and we had hoped to make things easier for ourselves.
Gas was also used for cooking, although we did still have an
enormous old wood-burning stove standing in the kitchen.
This was all very well until one day one of the higher
bureaucratic offices, probably the city council, decreed that
gas was to be rationed. From that day on every household was
allowed one cubic metre per day regardless of how the fuel
had to be used. If anyone was found using more, they were
simply cut off.
In the summer of 1919 we went to Millstadt, Carinthia, and
my father, who was sixty-two, sho\ved the first signs of ageing
and of what was to be his final illness, a fact we did not
become aware of at the time. Whenever we went for a walk he
would lag behind, especially where it got steep, and he would
feign botanical curiosity to mask his exhaustion. From about
1902 on Father's main interest was botany. During the
summer months he collected material for his studies, not for
setting up a herbarium of his own, but for experimenting with
his microscope and microtome. He had become a mor-
phogeneticist and phylogeneticist and had abandoned his
dedication to I taly's great painters and also his own artistic
interests, which consisted of sketching innumerable land-
scapes. Father's rather bored reaction to our coaxing: 'Oh,
Rudolph, do come on' and 'Mr Schrodinger, it's getting rather
late', did not alarm us either; we were actually used to that; so
we put it down to his absorbed concentration.
After our return to Vienna the signs became more apparent,
but still we did not take them seriously as a warning: frequent
and heavy bleeding from his nose and retina, and finally fluid
in his legs. I think he knew long before everyone else that his
end was near. Unfortunately this was just the time of the gas
calamity mentioned above. We acquired carbon lamps, and
he insisted on tending them himself. A dreadful stench spread
from his beautiful library, which he had turned into a carbide
laboratory. Twenty years earlier, when he had learnt to etch
with Schmutzer, he had used the room to soak his copper and
zinc plates in acids and chlorinated water; I was still at school
then, and had shown great interest in his activities. But now I
ERWIN SCHRODINGER
left him to his own devices. I was glad to be back at my
beloved physics institute after serving in the war for almost
four years. Besides, in autumn 1919 I became engaged to the
girl who has been my wife for forty years now. I do not know
whether my father had adequate medical treatment, but what
I do kriow is that I should have looked after him better. I
should have asked Richard von Wettstein, who was after all a
good friend of his, to seek help at the medical faculty. Would
better advice have slowed down his arteriosclerosis? And if so,
would it have been to the advantage of a sick man? Only
Father was fully aware of our financial situation after the
closing down of our oilcloth and linoleum store on the
Stephansplatz in 1917 (due to lack of stock).
He died peacefully on Christmas Eve 1919, in his old
armchair.
The following year was that of rampant inflation, which
meant the depreciation of Father's meagre bank account,
which would never have kept my parents' heads above water
anyway. The proceeds of the Persian rugs he had sold (with
my consent!) dissolved into nothing; gone for ever were the
microscopes, the microtome and a good part of his library,
which I gave away for a song after his death. His greatest
worry during the last months had been that at the ripe old age
of thirty-two I was earning virtually nothing - 1,000 Austrian
kronen (before tax, that is, for I am sure he listed it in his tax
declaration except when I was an officer during the war). The
only success of his son that he lived to see was that I had been
offered (and had also accepted) a better-paid post as private
lecturer and assistant to Max Wi en inJena.
My wife and I moved to Jena in April 1920, leaving my
mother to fend for herself, in fact which I am not at all proud
of today. She had to bear the burden of packing and clearing
the flat. Oh, how blind we all were! Her father, who owned the
house, was rather worried after my father's death about who
would pay the rent. We were in no position to do so, and
Mother had to make room for a more affluent tenant. My
future father-in-law kindly turned up with the man, a Jewish
businessman working for the Phoenix, a prosperous insurance
Autobiographical Sketches 173
company. So Mother had to leave, where to I do not know. Had
we not been so blind we would have foreseen - and thousands of
similar cases would have proved us right - what an excellent
source of money the big, well-furnished flat could have proved
for my mother had she lived longer. She died in the autumn of
1921 of cancer of the spine after what we believed had been a
successful operation on her breast cancer in 1917.
I rarely remember dreams, and I seldom had nasty ones -
except maybe in my early childhood. For a long time after my
father's death, however, a nightmare kept recurring again and
again: my father was still alive and I knew I had given away all
his beautiful instruments and botanical books. What was he to
do now that I had rashly and irretrievably destroyed the basis
of his intellectual life? I am sure it was my guilty conscience that
caused the dream, as I had cared so little for my parents
between 1919 and 1921. This can be the only explanation, as I
am not normally bothered with nightmares or a guilty con-
science ei ther.
My childhood and adolescence (1887-1910 or thereabouts)
was mainly influenced by my father, not in the usual educa-
tional manner, but in a more ordinary way. This was due to his
spending a lot more time at home than most men who work for
a living and to my being at home, too. In my early years of
learning I was taught by a private teacher who came to see me
twice a week, and at grammar school we still had the blessed
tradition of attending for twenty-five hours a week, mornings
only. (On two afternoons only we had to attend for protestant
religious education.)
I learnt a great deal on those occasions, although the result
was not always related to the subject of religion. Time limita-
tions concerning school commitments are a great asset. If a
pupil feels inclined, he has time for thinking, and he can also
take private lessons in the subjects which are not part of the
curriculum. I can only find words of praise for myoid school
(Akademisches Gymnasium): I was rarely bored there, and
when it did happen (our preparatory philosophical course was
really bad), I would turn my attention to some other subject,
my French translation, for example.

At this point I should like to add a remark of a more general
kind. The discovery of chromosomes as the decisive factors in
heredity seems to have given society the right to overlook
other better-known but equally important factors such as
communication, education and tradition. It is assumed that
these were not so important because from the point of view of
genetics they are not stable enough. This is quite true.
However, there are cases such as that of Kaspar Hauser, for
example, and that of a small group of Tasmanian 'Stone Age'
children who were only recently brought to live in English
surroundings and granted a first-class English upbringing,
with the effect that they reached the educational level of
upper-class Englishmen. Does this not prove to us that it takes
both a code of chromosomes and civilized human surround-
ings to produce people of our kind? In other words, the
intellectual level of every individual is bred by 'nature' and by
'nurture'. Schools are therefore (not as our Empress Maria
Theresa liked to see it) invaluable for human guidance, and
much less for political purposes. And a sound family back-
ground is just as important for preparing the soil for the seed
the schools will sow. This is unfortunately a fact overlooked by
those who claim that only the children of the less educated
should attend schools for higher education (will their children
be excluded for the same reasons?) and also by British High
Society, where it is deemed upper class to replace family life
by boarding school and considered a sign of nobility to leave
home early. So even the present Queen had to part with her
first-born and send him to such an institution. None of this is
strictly speaking any of my concern. I t only came to my mind
when I once again realized how much I gained from the time I
spent with my father as a young boy and how little I would
have profited from school had he not been there. He actually
knew far more than they had to offer, not because he had been
forced to study it thirty years earlier, but because he was still
interested. If I went into detail here, I should end up telling a
long story.
Later on, when he had taken up botany and I had virtually
devoured The Origin oj Species, our discussions took on a
Autobiographical Sketches 175
different character, certainly different from that conveyed at
school, where the theory of evolution was still banned from
our biology lessons and teachers of religious education were
advised to call it heresy. Of course I soon became an ardent
follower of Darwinism (and still am today, for that matter),
while Father, influenced by his friends, urged caution. The
link between natural selection and the survival of the fittest on
the one hand and Mendel's law and de Vries's theory of
mutation on the other had yet to be fully discovered. Even
today I don't know why zoologists have always tended to
swear by Darwin, while botanists appear to be rather more
reticent. However, one thing we all agreed on - and when I
say 'all', I particularly remember Hofrat Anton Handlisch,
who was a zoologist at the museum of natural history and the
one I knew and liked best of all my father's friends - we were
all unanimous in holding that the basis of evolutionary theory
was causal rather than finalistic; and that no special laws of
nature, such as vis viva, or an entelechy, or a force of
orthogenesis, etc., were at \vork in living organisms to abro-
gate or to counteract the universal laws of inanimate matter.
My religious teacher would not have been happy about this
view, but he did not concern me anyway.

Our family was accustomed to travelling in the summer.
This not only brightened my life, but also helped whet my
intellectual appetite. I remember one visit to England a year
before I started intermediate school (Mittelschule) , when I
stayed with relatives of my mother at Ramsgate. The long,
wide beach was ideally suited for donkey rides and learning to
handle a bicycle. The strong tidal changes claimed my full
attention. Little bathing huts on wheels were set up along the
beach, and a man and his horse were always busy moving
these cabins up or down according to the tide. On the
Channel I first noticed that one could make out the funnel
smoke of distant boats on the horizon long before they
themselves appeared, a result of the curvature of the water-
surface.

In Leamington I met my great-grandmother at Madeira
Villa, and as she was called Russell and the street she lived in was called 'Russell', I was convinced it was named after my
late great-grandfather. An aunt of my mother's also lived
there with her husband, Alfred Kirk, and six Angora cats. (In
later years there were said to be twenty.) In addition she had
an ordinary tomcat who would very often come home from his
nocturnal adventures in a sad state, so he was given the name
Thomas Becket (referring to the Archbishop of Canterbury
who was killed in office by order of King Henry II) - not that.
this meant a great deal to me then, nor was it very appro-
priate.
It is thanks to my Aunt Minnie, Mother's youngest sister,
who moved from Leamington to Vienna when I was five, that
I learnt to speak fluent English long before I could write in
German, let alone English. When I was finally introduced to
the spelling and reading of the language I thought I knew so
well, I was in for a surprise. It was thanks to my mother that
half-days of English practice were launched. I was not too
pleased about that at the time. We would walk from the
Weiherburg down to the pretty and in those years still quiet
little town of Innsbruck together, and Mother would say:
'Now we are going to speak English to each other the whole
way - not another word of German.' And that is just what we
did. I only realized later how much I profited from it to this
day. Though forced to leave the country of my birth, I never
felt a stranger abroad.
I seem to remember visiting Kenilworth and Warwick on
our bicycle tours round Leamington. And on the way back to
Innsbruck from England I remernber seeing Bruges, Cologne,
Coblenz - a steamboat took us up the Rhine - I remember
Riidesheim, Frankfurt, Munich, I think; then Innsbruck. I
can recall the little boarding house which belonged to Richard
Attlmayr.

From there I went to school for the first time, down to St
Nikolaus, where I had private tuition, as my parents were
afraid I had forgotten my ABC and my sums during the
holiday and would fail my entrance exam in the autumn. In
later years we nearly always went to the South Tyrol or
Carinthia, and sometimes we would go to Venice for a few
Autobiographical Sketches 177
days in September. There is no end to the list of beautiful
things I was given the chance to see in those days, things that
no longer exist, due to the motor car, 'development' and new
borders. I think few people then, let alone today, experienced
such a happy childhood and adolescence as I did, even though
I was an only child. Everyone was friendly towards me and we
were all on good terms with each other. If only all teachers,
including parents, would take to heart the necessity of mutual
understanding! We cannot exert any lasting influence over
those en trus ted to us wi thou tit.
Maybe I ought to say something about my years at
university between 19°6 and 19 I 0, as there might not be any
chance of doing so later on. I mentioned earlier that
Hasenohrl and his carefully conceived four-year course (five
hours a week!) influenced me more than anything else.
Unfortunately I missed the last year (19 I 0/ I I), as I could no
longer postpone my national service. As it turned out this was
not quite as unpleasant as I had anticipated, for I was sent to
the beautiful old town of Cracow and I also spent a memor-
able summer near the Carinthian border (near Malborghet).
Apart from Hasenohrl's, I attended all the other mathemat-
ics lectures I could. Gustav Kohn gave his talks on projective
geometry. His style, so severe and clear, left a lasting impres-
sion. Kohn would alternate from a pure synthetic method one
year - without any formulas - to an analytical approach the
next. There is in fact no better example for the existence of
axiomatic systems. Through him duality in particular turned
out to be a breathtaking phenomenon, differing somewhat in
two- and three-dimensional geometry. He also proved to us
the profound influence of Felix Klein's group theory on the
development of mathematics. The fact that the existence of a
fourth harmonic element has to be accepted as an axiom in a
two-dimensional structure while it can easily be proved in a
three-dimensional was to him the simplest illustration of
Goedel's great theorem. There were so many things I learnt
from Kohn which I would never have had the time to learn
later on.

I attended Jerusalem's lectures on Spinoza - a memorable experience for whoever listened to him. He talked about so
many things, about Epicurus' 6 3civato<; OUbEV npo<; l1Jlci<;
('Death is not man's enemy') and his DUbEV 3aUJlu<;E1V ('to
wonder at nothing'), which Epicurus always kept in mind when
philosophizing.
In my first year I also did qualitative chemical analysis, and
certainly gained a lot from it. Skraup's lectures on inorganic
chemical analysis were rather good; those on organic chemical
analysis, which I read during the summer term, poor in
comparison. They could have been ten times as good and still
they would hardly have improved my understanding of nucleic
acids, enzymes, antibodies and the like. As it was I could only
feel my way ahead, led by intuition, which was none the less
productive.
On 31 July 19 14 my father turned up at my little office in the
Boltzmanngasse to break the news that I had been called up.
The Predilsattel in Carinthia was to be my first destination. We
went off to buy two guns, a small one and a large one.
Fortunately I was never forced to use them on either man or
animal, and in 1938 during a search of my flat in Graz I handed
them over to the good-natured official,just to be sure.
A few words about the war itself: my first posting, Predilsat-
tel, was uneventful. Once, though, we had a false alarm. Our
commanding officer, Captain Reindl, had arranged with confi-
dants that in the event of Italian troops advancing up the wide
valley towards the lake (Raiblersee), we were to be warned by
smoke signals. I t so happened that someone was baking pota-
toes or burning weeds just along the border. We were told to
man the two watchposts and I was put in charge of the one on
the left. We spent ten days up there before someone remem-
bered to call us back down. Up there I learnt that springy
floorboards (with only a sleeping-bag and blanket) are much
more comfortable to sleep on than a solid floor. My other
observation was of a different nature, something I never came
across before or after. One night the guard on duty woke me up
to report that he could see a number of lights moving up the
slope opposite us, obviously heading toward our position.

(Incidentally, this part of the mountain (Seekopf) had no paths
Autobiographical Sketches 179
at all.) I got out of my sleeping-bag and made my way through
the connecting passage to the post to take a closer look. The
guard was right about the lights, but they were St Elmo's fire on
the top of our own wire abatis a couple of yards away, and the
displacement against the background was only parallactic.
This was because the observer himself was moving. When I
stepped out of our spacious dug-out at night I would watch
these pretty little fires on the tips of the grass that covered the
roof. This was the only time I came across the phenomenon.
After spending much idle time there I was posted to Fran-
zensfeste, then to Krems and then to Komorn. For a short time
I had to serve at the front. I joined a small unit first at Gorizia,
then at Duino. They were equipped with an odd naval gun. We
eventually retired to Sistiana, and from there I was sent to a
rather boring but none the less beautiful observation post near
Prosecco, 900 feet above Trieste, where we had an even odder
gun. My future wife Annemarie came to see me there, and on
one occasion Prince Sixtus of Bourbon, the brother of the
Empress Zita, visited our positions. He was not in uniform, and
later I learnt that he was in fact our enemy as he was serving in
the Belgian army. The reason for this was that the French did
not allow any member of the Bourbon family to join their army.
The aim of his visit at the time was to bring about a separate
peace agreement between Austria-Hungary and the Entente
Cordiale, which, of course, meant high treason against Ger-
many. Unfortunately his plan never materialized.
My first encounter with Einstein's theory of 1916 was at
Prosecco. I had so much time at my disposal, yet had great
difficulties in understanding it. Nevertheless a number of
marginal notes I made then still appear reasonably intelligenL
to me even now. As a rule Einstein would present a new theory
in an unnecessarily complicated form, and never more so than
in 1945, when he introduced the so-called 'asymmetric' unitary
field theory. But perhaps that is not just characteristic of that
great man, but nearly always happens when someone postu-
lates a new idea. In the case of the above-mentioned theory
Pauli told him there and then that it was unnecessary to
introduce the complex quantities, because each of his tensor equations consisted of both a symmetric and a sheer symme-
tric part anyway. Only in 1952, in an article he wrote together
with Mme B. Kaufman for a volume published to celebrate
Louis de Broglie's sixtieth birthday, did he agree with my
much simpler version by ingeniously excluding the so-called
'strong' version. This was a very important move indeed.
The last year or so of the war I spent as a 'meteorologist'
first in Vienna, then Villach, then Wiener Neustadt and
finally in Vienna again. This was a great asset to me, as I was
spared the disastrous retreat of our badly torn front lines.
In March/April 1920 Annemarie and I got married. We
moved soon after to J ena, where we took furnished lodgings. I
was expected to add some up-to-date theoretical physics to
Professor Auerbach's set lectures. We enjoyed the friendship
and cordiality of both the Auerbachs, who were Jews, and of
my boss Max Wien and his wife (they were anti-Semites by
tradition, but bore no personal malice). Being on such good
terms with them all was a great help to me. In 1933, the
Auerbachs, I am told, saw no means of escape from the
oppression and humiliation which Hitler's taking over (Mach-
tergreifung) held in store for them but suicide. Eberhard
Buchwald, a young physicist who had just lost his wife, and a
couple called Eller with their two little sons were also amongst
our friends inJena. Mrs Eller came to see me here in Alpbach
last summer (1959), a poor bereaved woman whose three
men-folk had lost their lives fighting for a cause they did not
believe in.
A chronological account of someone's life is one of the most
boring things I can think of. Whether you are recalling
incidents of your own life or that of someone else, you will
rarely find more than the occasional experience or observation
worth recounting - even if the historical order of events seems
important to you at the time. That is why I am now going to
give a short summary of the periods of my life, so that I can
refer to them later without having to watch the chronological
order.

The first period ( 1887- 1920) ends with my marrying
Annemarie and leaving Germany. I shall call it my first
Autobiographical Sketches
Viennese Period. The second period (1920-7) I shall call 'My
First Years of Roaming', as I was taken to J ena, Stuttgart,
Breslau and finally to Zurich (in 1921). This period ends with
my call to Berlin as Max Planck's successor. I had discovered
wave mechanics during my stay in Arosa in 1925. My paper
had been published in 1926. As a result of this I went on a
two-month lecturing tour of North America, which prohibition
had dried up successfully. The third period (1927-33) was a
rather nice one. I shall call it 'My Teaching and Learning'. It
ended with Hitler's assumption of power, the so-called Machter-
greifung, in 1933. While completing the summer term of that
year I was already busy sending my belongings to Switzerland.
At the end ofJ uly I left Berlin to spend my holidays in the South
Tyrol. The South Tyrol had become I talian under the Treaty of
St Germain, so it was still accessible to us with our German
passports, whereas Austria was not. Prinz Bismarck's great
successor had succeeded in imposing a blockade in Austria
which became known as the Tausendmarksperre. (My wife, for
instance, could not visit her mother on her seventieth birthday.
His Excellency's authorities did not give her permission). I did
not go back to Berlin after the summer, but instead handed in
my resignation, which remained unanswered for a long time. In
fact they then denied ever having received it, and when they
learnt I had been awarded the Nobel Prize for physics, they
flatly refused to accept it.
The fourth period (1933-9) I shall call 'My Later Years of
Roaming'. As early as spring 1933 F. A. Lindemann (later Lord
Cherwell) offered me a 'living' in Oxford. This was on the
occasion of his first visit to Berlin, when I happened to mention
my distaste for the present situation. He faithfully kept his
word. And so my wife and I took to the road in a little BMW
acquired for the occasion. We left Malcesine and via Bergamo,
Lecco, St Gotthard, Zurich and then Paris we reached
Brussels, where a Solvay Congress was being held. From there
we went to Oxford; we did not travel together. Lindemann had
already taken the necessary steps to make me a fellow of
Magdalen College, though I received the greater part of my pay
from ICI.

When, in 1936, I was offered a chair at Edinburgh Univer-
sity and another at Graz, I chose the latter, an extremely
foolish thing to do. Both the choice and the outcome were
unexampled, though the outcome was a lucky one. Of course I
was more or less undermined by the Nazis in 1938, but by
then I had already accepted a call to Dublin, where de Valera
was about to found the Institute for Advanced Studies.
Loyalty towards his own university would never have allowed
Edinburgh's E.T. Whittaker, de Valera's former teacher, to
suggest me for the post had I gone to Edinburgh in 1936. As it
was, Max Born was appointed in my stead. Dublin proved a
hundred times better for me. Not only would the work in
Edinburgh have been a great burden to me, but so would the
position of enemy alien in Great Britain throughout the war.
Our second 'escape' took us from Graz, via Rome, Geneva
and Zurich to Oxford where our dear friends, the Whiteheads,
put us up for two months. This time we had to leave our good
little BMW, 'Grauling', behind, as it would have been too
slow, and besides, I no longer possessed a driving licence. The
Dublin Institute was not yet 'ready', and so my wife, Hilde,
Ruth and I went to Belgium in December 1938. First I held
lectures (in German!) at the University of Ghent as guest
professor; this was for the 'fondation Franqui-Seminar'. Later
on we spent about four months in Lapanne by the sea. It was
a lovely time - despite the jellyfish. I t was also the only time I
ever came across the phosphorescence of the sea. In Septem-
ber 1939, the first month of the Second World War, we left for
Dublin via England. With our German passports we were still
enemy aliens to the British, but obviously thanks to de
Valera's letters of reference we were granted transit. Perhaps
Lindemann pulled a few strings on that occasion too, despite
the rather unpleasant encounter we had had a year before. He
was after all a very decent man, and I am convinced that as
his friend Winston's advisor in matters of physics he proved
invaluable in the defence of Britain during the war.
The fifth period (1939-56) I shall call 'My Long Exile', but
without the bitter associations of the word, as it was a
wonderful time. I would never have got to know this remote
Autobiographical Sketches
and beautiful island otherwise. Nowhere else could we have
lived through the Nazi war so untouched by problems that it
is almost shameful. I can't imagine spending seventeen years
in Graz 'treading water', with or without the Nazis, with or
without the war. Sometimes we would quietly say amongst
ourselves: 'Wir danken's unserem Fuhrer' ('We owe it to our
Fuhrer') .

The sixth period (19S6-?) I shall call 'My Late Viennese
Period'. As early as 1946 I had been offered an Austrian chair
again. When I told de Valera about it he urgently advised me
against it, pointing to the unsettled political situation in
Central Europe. He was quite right in that respect. But while
he was so kindly disposed towards me in many ways, he
showed no concern for my wife's future should anything
happen to me. All he could say was that he wasn't sure what
would happen to his wife in such a situation either. So I told
them in Vienna that I was keen on going back, but that I
wanted to wait for matters to return to normal. I told them
that because of the Nazis I had been forced to interrupt my
work twice already and start all over again elsewhere; a third
time would certainly put an end to it altogether.
Looking back, I can see that my decision was right. Poor
Austria had been raped and was a sad place to live in those
days. 

My petition addressed to the Austrian authorities for a
pension for my wife as a kind of reparation was in vain in spite
of the fact that they seemed keen to make amends. The
poverty was too great then (and still is today in 1960, for that
matter) to make allowances for certain individuals and deny
them to almost all others. Thus I spent ten more years in
Dublin, which turned out to be of great value to me. I wrote
quite a number of short books in English (published by
Cambridge University Press) and continued my studies on the
'asymmetric' general theory of gravitation, which appears to
be disappointing. And last but not least there were the two
successful operations in 1948 and 1949 by Mr Werner, who
removed the cataracts from both my eyes. When the time had
come, Austria very generously restored me to my former
position. I also received a new appointment to Vienna University (extra status), although at my age I could only
expect two and a half years in office. lowe all this mainly to
my friend Hans Thirring, and to the Minister of Education,
Dr Drimmel. At the same time my colleague Robracher
successfully pushed the new law for the status of Professor
Emeritus and thus also supported my cause.
