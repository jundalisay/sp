If you fill the lower part of a closed glass vessel with fog,
consisting of minute droplets, you will find that the upper
boundary of the fog gradually sinks, with a well-defined
velocity, determined by the viscosity of the air and the size of a sinking droplet.

and the specific gravity of the droplets. But if you look at one
of the droplets under the microscope you find that it does not
permanently sink with constant velocity, but performs a very
irregular movement, the so-called Brownian movement,
which corresponds to a regular sinking only on the average.
Now these droplets are not atoms, but they are sufficiently
small and light to be not entirely insusceptible to the impact of
one single molecule of those which hammer their surface in
perpetual impacts. They are thus knocked about and can only
on the average follow the influence of gravity.


Fig. 4. Diffusion from left to right in a solution of varying concentration.

This example shows what funny and disorderly experience
we should have if our senses were susceptible to the impact of a few molecules only. There are bacteria and other organisms
so small that they are strongly affected by this phenomenon.

Their movements are determined by the thermic whims of the
surrounding medium; they have no choice. If they had some
locomotion of their own they might nevertheless succeed in
getting from one place to another - but with some difficulty,
since the heat motion tosses them like a small boat in a rough
sea.

A phenomenon very much akin to Brownian movement is
that of difJusion~ Imagine a vessel filled with a fluid, say water,
with a small amount of some coloured substance dissolved in
it, say potassium permanganate, not in uniform concentra-
tion, but rather as in Fig. 4, where the dots indicate the
molecules of the dissolved substance (permanganate) and the
concentration diminishes from left to right. If you leave this
system alone a very slow process of 'diffusion' sets in, the
permanganate spreading in the direction from left to right,
that is, from the places of higher concentration towards the
places of lower concentration, until it is equally distributed
through the water.

The remarkable thing about this rather simple and appar-
ently not particularly interesting process is that it is in no way
due, as one might think, to any tendency or force driving the
permanganate molecules away from the crowded region to the
less crowded one, like the population of a country spreading to
those parts where there is more elbow-room. Nothing of the sort happens with our permanganate molecules. Everyone of
them behaves quite independently of all the others, which it
very seldom meets. Everyone of them, whether in a crowded
region or in an empty one, suffers the same fate of being
continually knocked about by the impacts of the water
molecules and thereby gradually moving on in an unpredictable direction - sometimes towards the higher, sometimes
towards the lower, concentrations, sometimes obliquely. 

The
kind of motion it performs has often been compared with that
of a blindfolded person on a large surface imbued with a
certain desire of 'walking', but without any preference for any
particular direction, and so changing his line continuously.
That this random walk of the permanganate molecules, the
same for all of them, should yet produce a regular flow
towards the smaller concentration and ultimately make for
uniformity of distribution, is at first sight perplexing - but
only at first sight. 

If you contemplate in Fig. 4 thin slices of
approximately constant concentration, the permanganate
molecules which in a given moment are contained in a
particular slice will, by their random walk, it is true, be
carried with equal probability to the right or to the left. But
precisely in consequence of this, a plane separating two
neighbouring slices will be crossed by more molecules coming
from the left than in the opposite direction, simply because to
the left there are more molecules engaged in random walk
than there are to the right. And as long as that is so the
balance will show up as a regular flow from left to right, until
a uniform distribution is reached.

When these considerations are translated into mathematical language the exact law of diffusion is reached in the form
of a partial differential equation

which I shall not trouble the reader by explaining, though its meaning in ordinary language is again simple enough. I The
reason for mentioning the stern 'mathematically exact' law here, is to emphasize that its physical exactitude must nevertheless be challenged in every particular application. 

Being
based on pure chance, its validity is only approximate. If it is,
as a rule, a very good approximation, that is only due to the
enormous number of molecules that co-operate in the
phenomenon. The smaller their number, the larger the quite
haphazard deviations we must expect - and they can be
observed under favourable circumstances.

THIRD EXAMPLE (LIMITS OF ACCURACY OF MEASURING)

The last example we shall give is closely akin to the second
one, but has a particular interest. A light body, suspended by
a long thin fibre in equilibrium orientation, is often used by
physicists to measure weak forces which deflect it from that
position of equilibrium, electric, magnetic or gravitational
forces being applied so as to twist it around the vertical axis.
(The light body must, of course, be chosen appropriately for
the particular purpose.) The continued effort to improve the
accuracy of this very commonly used device of a 'torsional
balance', has encountered a curious limit, most interesting in
itself. In choosing lighter and lighter bodies and thinner and
longer fibres - to make the balance susceptible to weaker and
weaker forces - the limit was reached when the suspended
body became noticeably susceptible to the impacts of the heat
motion of the surrounding molecules and began to perform an
incessant, irregular 'dance' about its equilibrium position,
much like the trembling of the droplet in the second example.
Though this behaviour sets no absolute limit to the accuracy
of measurements obtained with the balance, it sets a practical
one. The uncontrollable effect of the heat motion competes
'To wit: the concentration at any given point increases (or decreases) at a time rate
proportional to the comparative surplus (or deficiency) of concentration in its
infinitesimal environment. The law of heat conduction is, by the way, of exactly the
same form, 'concentration' having to be replaced by 'temperature'.

with the effect of the force to be measured and makes the
single deflection observed insignificant. You have to multiply
observations, in order to eliminate the effect of the Brownian
movement of your instrument. This example is, I think,
particularly illuminating in our present investigation. For our
organs of sense, after all, are a kind of instrument. We can see
how useless they would be if they became too sensi tive.
TH E Vn RULE
So much for examples, for the present. I will merely add that
there is not one law of physics or chemistry, of those that are
reI evan t wi thin an organism or in its in teractions wi th its
environment, that I might not choose as an example. The
detailed explanation might be more complicated, but the
salient point would always be the same and thus the descrip-
tion would become monotonous.
But I should like to add one very important quantitative
statement concerning the degree of inaccuracy to be expected
in any physical law, the so-called Y n law. I will first illustrate
it by a simple example and then generalize it.
If I tell you that a certain gas under certain conditions of
pressure and temperature has a certain density, and if I
expressed this by saying that within a certain volume (of a size
relevant for some experiment) there are under these conditions
just n molecules of the gas, then you might be sure that if you
could test my statement in a particular moment of time, you
would find it inaccurate, the departure being of the order ofYn.
Hence if the number n == 100, you would find a departure of
about 10, thus relative error == 10% • But if n == I million, you
would be likely to find a departure of about 1,000, thus relative
error == lo °10. Now, roughly speaking, this statistical law is
quite general. The laws of physics and physical chemistry are
inaccurate within a probable relative error of the order of I Ivn,
where n is the number of molecules that co-operate to bring
about that law - to produce its validity within such regions of
space or time (or both) that matter, for some considerations or
for some particular experiment.
18 ERWIN SCHRODINGER
You see from this again that an organism must have a
comparatively gross structure in order to enjoy the benefit of
fairly accurate laws, both for its internal life and for its
interplay with the external world. For otherwise the number
of co-operating particles would be too small, the 'law' too
inaccurate. The particularly exigent demand is the square
root. For though a million is a reasonably large number, an
accuracy of just I in 1,000 is not overwhelmingly good, if a
thing claims the dignity of being a 'Law of Nature'.
