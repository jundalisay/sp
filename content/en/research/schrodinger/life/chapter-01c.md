If it were not so, if we were organisms so sensitive that a single atom, or even a few atoms, could make a perceptible impres- sion on our senses - Heavens, what would life be like! To stress one point: an organism of that kind would most certainly not be capable of developing the kind of orderly thought which, after passing through a long sequence of earlier stages, ultimately results in forming, among many other ideas, the idea of an atom.

Even though we select this one point, the following considerations would essentially apply also to the functioning of organs other than the brain and the sensorial system. 

Nevertheless, the one and only thing of paramount interest to us in ourselves is, that we feel and think and perceive. To the physiological process which is responsible for thought and sense all the others play an auxiliary part, at least from the human point of view, if not from that of purely objective biology. 

Moreover, it will greatly facilitate our task to choose for investigation the process which is closely accompanied by subjective events, even though we are ignorant of the true nature of this close parallelism. Indeed, in my view, it lies outside the range of natural science and very probably of human understanding altogether.

We are thus faced with the following question: Why should an organ like our brain, with the sensorial system attached to it, of necessity consist of an enormous number of atoms, in order that its physically changing state should be in close and intimate correspondence with a highly developed thought? 

On what grounds is the latter task of the said organ incompatible with being, as a whole or in some of its peripheral parts which interact directly with the environment, a mechanism suffi- ciently refined and sensitive to respond to and register the impact of a single atom from outside?

The reason for this is, that what we call thought (I) is itself
an orderly thing, and (2) can only be applied to material, i.e.
to perceptions or experiences, which have a certain degree of
orderliness. This has two consequences. First, a physical
organization, to be in close correspondence with thought (as
my brain is with my thought) must be a very well-ordered
organization, and that means that the events that happen
within it must obey strict physical laws, at least to a very high
degree of accuracy. Secondly, the physical impressions made
upon that physically well-organized system by other bodies
from outside, obviously correspond to the perception and
experience of the corresponding thought, forming its material, as I have called it. Therefore, the physical interactions
between our system and others must, as a rule, themselves
possess a certain degree of physical orderliness, that is to say,
they too must obey strict physical laws to a certain degree of
accuracy.

## PHYSICAL LAWS REST ON ATOMIC STATISTICS AND ARE THEREFORE ONLY APPROXIMATE

And why could all this not be fulfilled in the case of an
organism composed of a moderate number of atoms only and
sensitive already to the impact of one or a few atoms only?
Because we know all atoms to perform all the time a
completely disorderly heat motion, which, so to speak,
opposes itself to their orderly behaviour and does not allow
the events that happen between a small number of atoms to
enrol themselves according to any recognizable laws. Only in
the co-operation of an enormously large number of atoms do
statistical laws begin to operate and control the behaviour of
these assemblies with an accuracy increasing as the number of
atoms involved increases. I t is in that way that the events
acquire truly orderly features. All the physical and chemical
laws that are known to play an important part in the life of
organisms are of this statistical kind; any other kind of
lawfulness and orderliness that one might think of is being
perpetually disturbed and made inoperative by the unceasing
heat motion of the atoms.

THEIR PRECISION IS BASED ON THE LARGE NUMBER OF ATOMS INTERVENING.

FIRST EXAMPLE (PARAMAGNETISM)

Let me try to illustrate this by a few examples, picked
somewhat at random out of thousands, and possibly not just
the best ones to appeal to a reader who is learning for the first
time about this condition of things - a condition which in
modern physics and chemistry is as fundamental as, say, the
fact that organisms are composed of cells is in biology, or as

Newton's Law in astronomy, or even as the series of integers,
I, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... in mathematics. An entire newcomer should
not expect to obtain from the following few pages a full
understanding and appreciation of the subject, which is
associated with the illustrious names of Ludwig Boltzmann
and Willard Gibbs and treated in textbooks under the name of
'statistical thermodynamics'.

If you fill an oblong quartz tube with oxygen gas and put it
into a magnetic field, you find that the gas is magnetized. I
The magnetization is due to the fact that the oxygen molecules
are little magnets and tend to orientate themselves parallel to
the field, like a compass needle. But you must not think that
they actually all turn parallel. For if you double the field, you
get double the magnetization in your oxygen body, and that
proportionality goes on to extremely high field strengths, the
magnetization increasing at the rate of the field you apply.
This is a particularly clear example of a purely statistical
law. The orientation the field tends to produce is continually
counteracted by the heat motion, which works for random
orientation. The effect of this striving is, actually, only a small
preference for acute over obtuse angles between the dipole
axes and the field. Though the single atoms change their orientation incessantly, they produce on the average (owing to
their enormous number) a constant small preponderance of
orien ta tion in the direction of the field and proportional to it.
This ingenious explanation is due to the French physicist P.
Langevin. It can be checked in the following way. If the
observed weak magnetization is really the outcome of rival
tendencies, namely, the magnetic field, which aims at comb-
ing all the molecules parallel, and the heat motion, which
makes for random orientation, then it ought to be possible to
increase the magnetization by weakening the heat motion,
that is to say, by lowering the temperature, instead of
reinforcing the field. That is confirmed by experiment, which
gives the magnetization inversely proportional to the absolute
temperature, in quantitative agreement with theory (Curie's
law). Modern equipment even enables us, by lowering the
temperature, to reduce the heat motion to such insignificance
that the orientating tendency of the magnetic field can assert
itself, if not completely, at least sufficiently to produce a
substantial fraction of 'complete magnetization'. In this case
we no longer expect that double the field strength will double
the magnetization, but that the latter will increase less and
less with increasing field, approaching what is called 'satura-
tion'. This expectation too is quantitatively confirmed by
experiment.

<!-- I A gas is chosen, because it is simpler than a solid or a liquid; the fact that the
magnetization is in this case extremely weak, will not impair the theoretical
considerations. -->

Notice that this behaviour entirely depends on the large
numbers of molecules which co-operate in producing the
observable magnetization. Otherwise, the latter would not be
constant at all, but would, by fluctuating quite irregularly
from one second to the next, bear witness to the vicissitudes of
the contest between heat motion and field.
