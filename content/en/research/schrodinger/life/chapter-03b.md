THE HARMFUL EFFECT OF CLOSE-BREEDING

Recessive mutations, as long as they are only heterozygous,
are of course no working-ground for natural selection. If they
are detrimental, as mutations very often are, they will never-
theless not be eliminated, because they are latent. Hence quite
a host of unfavourable mutations may accumulate and do no
immediate damage. But they are, of course, transmitted to
half of the offspring, and that has an important application to
man, cattle, poultry or any other species, the good physical
qualities of which are of immediate concern to us. In Fig. 9 it
is assumed that a male individual (say, for concreteness,
myself) carries such a recessive detrimental mutation hetero-
zygously, so that it does not show up. Assume that my wife is
free of it. Then half of our children (second line) will also carry
it - again heterozygously. If all of them are again mated with
non-mutated partners (omitted from the diagram, to avoid
confusion), a quarter of our grandchildren, on the average,
will be affected in the same way.

No danger of the evil ever becoming manifest arises, unless
equally affected individuals are crossed with each other,
when, as an easy reflection shows, one-quarter of their
children, being homozygous, would manifest the damage.
Next to self-fertilization (only possible in hermaphrodite
plants) the greatest danger would be a marriage between a
son and a daughter of mine. Each of them standing an even
chance of being latently affected or not, one-quarter of these
incestuous unions would be dangerous inasmuch as one-
quarter of its children would manifest the damage. The
danger factor for an incestuously bred child is thus I: 16.
In the same way the danger factor works out to be I :64 for
the offspring of a union between two ('clean-bred') grand-
children of mine who are first cousins. 

These do not seem to be
overwhelming odds, and actually the second case is usually
tolerated. But do not forget that we have analysed the
consequences of only one possible latent injury in one partner
of the ancestral couple ('me and my wife'). Actually both of them are quite likely to harbour more than one latent
deficiency of this kind. If you know that you yourself harbour
a definite one, you have to reckon with lOUt of8 of your first
cousins sharing it! Experiments with plants and animals seem
to indicate that in addition to comparatively rare deficiencies
of a serious kind, there seem to be a host of minor ones whose
chances combine to deteriorate the offspring of close-breeding
as a whole. Since we are no longer inclined to eliminate
failures in the harsh way the Lacedemonians used to adopt in
the Taygetos mountain, we have to take a particularly serious
view about these t~hings in the case of man, where natural
selection of the fittest is largely retrenched, nay, turned to the
contrary. The anti-selective effect of the modern mass slaugh-
ter of the healthy youth of all nations is hardly outweighed by
the consideration that in more primitive conditions war may
have had a positive value in letting the fittest tribe survive.

GENERAL AND HISTORICAL REMARKS

The fact that the recessive allele, when heterozygous, is
completely overpowered by the dominant and produces no
visible effect at all, is amazing. I t ought at least to be
mentioned that there are exceptions to this behaviour. When
homozygous white snapdragon is crossed with, equally homo-
zygous, crimson snapdragon, all the immediate descendants
are intermediate in colour, i.e. they are pink (not crimson, as
might be expected). A much more important case of two
alleles exhibiting their influence simultaneously occurs in
blood-groups - but we cannot enter into that here. I should
not be astonished if at long last recessivity should turn out to
be capable of degrees and to depend on the sensitivity of the
tests we apply to examine the 'phenotype'.
This is perhaps the place for a word on the early history of
genetics. The backbone of the theory, the law of inheritance,
to successive generations, of properties in which the parents
differ, and more especially the important distinction recessive-
dominant, are due to the now world-famous Augustinian
Abbot Gregor Mendel (1822-84). Mendel knew nothing about mutations and chromosomes. In his cloister gardens in
Brunn (Brno) he made experiments on the garden pea, of
which he reared different varieties, crossing them and watching their offspring in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, ... , generation. You
might say, he experimented with mutants which he found ready-made in nature. The results he published as early as
1866 in the Proceedings of the Naturforschender Verein in Brunn.

Nobody seems to have been particularly interested in the
abbot's hobby, and nobody, certainly, had the faintest idea
that his discovery would in the twentieth century become the
lodestar of an entirely new branch of science, easily the most
interesting of our days. His paper was forgotten and was only
rediscovered in 1900, simultaneously and independently, by
Correns (Berlin), de Vries (Amsterdam) and Tschermak
(Vienna).


THE NECESSITY OF MUTATION BEING A RARE EVENT

So far we have tended to fix our attention on harmful
mutations, which may be the more numerous; but it must be
definitely stated that we do encounter advantageous muta-
tions as well. If a spontaneous mutation is a small step in the
development of the species, we get the impression that some
change is 'tried out' in rather a haphazard fashion at the risk
of its being injurious, in which case it is automatically
eliminated. This brings out one very important point. In order
to be suitable material for the work of natural selection,
mutations must be rare events, as they actually are. If they
were so frequent that there was a considerable chance of, say,
a dozen of different mutations occurring in the same individ-
ual, the injurious ones would, as a rule, predominate over the
advantageous ones and the species, instead of being improved
by selection, would remain unimproved, or would perish. The
comparative conservatism which results from the high degree
of permanence of the genes is essential. An analogy might be
sought in the working of a large manufacturing plant in a
factory. For developing better methods, innovations, even if as yet unproved, must be tried out. But in order to ascertain
whether the innovations improve or decrease the output, it is
essential that they should be introduced one at a time, while
all the other parts of the mechanism are kept constant.

MUTATIONS INDUCED BY X-RAYS

The percentage of mutations in the offspring, the so-called
mutation rate, can be increased to a high multiple of the small
natural mutation rate by irradiating the parents with X-rays
or y-rays. The mutations produced in this way differ in no way
(except by being more numerous) from those occurring
spontaneously, and one has the impression that every
'natural' mutation can also be induced by X-rays. In Droso-
phila many special mutations recur spontaneously again and
again in the vast cultures; they have been located in the
chromosome, as described on pp. 26-9, and have been given
special names. There have been found even what are called
'multiple alleles', that is to say, two or more different 'ver-
sions' and 'readings' - in addition to the normal, non-mutated
one - of the same place in the chromosome code; that means
not only two, but three or more alternatives in that particular
'locus', any two of which are to each other in the relation
'dominant-recessive' when they occur simultaneously in their
corresponding loci of the two homologous chromosomes.
The experiments on X-ray-produced mutations give the
impression that every particular 'transition', say from the
normal individual to a particular mutant, or conversely, has
its individual 'X-ray coefficient', indicating the percentage of
the offspring which turns out to have mutated in that
particular way, when a unit dosage of X-ray has been applied
to the parents, before the offspring was engendered.

FIRST LAW. MUTATION IS A SINGLE EVENT

Furthermore, the laws governing the induced mutation rate
are extremely simple and extremely illuminating. I follow here
the report of N. W. Timofeeff, in Biological Reviews, vol. IX,
1934. To a considerable extent it refers to that author's own
beautiful work. The first law is
( I) The increase is exactly proportional to the dosage of rays, so that
one can actually speak [as I did} of a coefJicient of increase.
We are so used to simple proportionality that we are liable
to underrate the far-reaching consequences of this simple law.
To grasp them, we may remember that the price of a
commodity, for example, is not always proportional to its
amount. In ordinary times a shopkeeper may be so much
impressed by your having bought six oranges from him, that,
on your deciding to take after all a whole dozen, he may give it
to you for less than double the price of the six. In times of
scarcity the opposite may happen. In the present case, we
conclude that the first half-dosage of radiation, while causing,
say, one out of a thousand descendants to mutate, has not
influenced the rest at all, either in the way of predisposing
them for, or of immunizing them against, mutation. For
otherwise the second half-dosage would not cause again just
one out of a thousand to mutate. Mutation is thus not an
accumulated effect, brought about by consecutive small por-
tions of radiation reinforcing each other. I t must consist in
some single event occurring in one chromosome during
irradiation. What kind of event?

SECOND LAW. LOCALIZATION OF THE EVENT

This is answered by the second law, viz.
(2) Ifyou vary the quality of the rays (wave-length) within wide
limits, from soft X-rays to fairly hard y-rays, the coefJicient remains
constant, provided you give the same dosage in so-called r-units, that is
to say, provided you measure the dosage by the total amount
of ions produced per unit volume in a suitably chosen standard substance during the time and at the place where the
parents are exposed to the rays.

As standard substance one chooses air not only for convenience, but also for the reason that organic tissues are com-
posed of elements of the same atomic weight as air. A lower limit for the amount of ionizations or allied processes I (excita-
tions) in the tissue is obtained simply by multiplying the 
number of ionizations in air by the ratio of the densities. 

It is thus fairly obvious, and is confirmed by a more critical
investigation, that the single event, causing a mutation, is just
an ionization (or similar process) occurring within some
'critical' volume of the germ cell. What is the size of this
critical volume? I t can be estimated from the observed
mutation rate by a consideration of this kind: if a dosage of
50,000 ions per cm 3 produces a chance of only I: 1000 for any
particular gamete (that finds itself in the irradiated district) to
mutate in that particular way, we conclude that the critical
volume, the 'target' which has to be 'hit' by an ionization for
that mutation to occur, is only lloo of 5oAoo of a cm 3 , that is to
say, one fifty-millionth of a cm 3 . The numbers are not the
right ones, but are used only by way of illustration. In the
actual estimate we follow M. Delbriick, in a paper by
Delbriick, N.W. Timofeeffand K.G. Zimmer,2 which will also
be the principal source of the theory to be expounded in the
following two chapters. He arrives there at a size of only about
ten average atomic distances cubed, containing thus only
about 10 3 == a thousand atoms. The simplest interpretation of
this result is that there is a fair chance of producing that
mutation when an ionization (or excitation) occurs not more
than about' 10 atoms away' from some particular spot in the
chromosome. We shall discuss this in more detail presently.
The Timofeeff report contains a practical hint which I
cannot refrain from mentioning here, though it has, of course,
no bearing on our present investigation. 

There are plenty of
occasions in modern life when a human being has to be
I A lower limit, because these other processes escape the ionization measurement, but
may be efficient in producing mutations.

exposed to X-rays. The direct dangers involved, as burns,
X-ray cancer, sterilization, are well known, and protection by
lead screens, lead-loaded aprons, etc., is provided, especially
for nurses and doctors who have to handle the rays regularly.
The point is, that even when these imminent dangers to the
individual are successfully warded off, there appears to be the
indirect danger of small detrimental mutations being pro-
duced in the germ cells - mutations of the kind envisaged
when we spoke of the unfavourable results of close-breeding.
To put it drastically, though perhaps a little naIvely, the
injuriousness of a marriage between first cousins might very
well be increased by the fact that their grandmother had
served for a long period as an X-ray nurse. I t is not a point
that need worry any individual personally. But any possibility
of gradually infecting the human race with unwanted latent
mutations ought to be a matter of concern to the community.
