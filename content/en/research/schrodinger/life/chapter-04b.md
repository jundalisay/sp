Among the discrete set of states of a given selection of atoms there need not necessarily but there may be a lowest level, implying a close approach of the nuclei to each other. Atoms I I am adopting the version which is usually given in popular treatment and which suffices for our present purpose. But I have the bad conscience of one who perpetuates a convenient error. The true story is much more complicated, inasn1uch as it includes the occasional indeterminateness with regard to the state the system is in such a state form a molecule. 

The point to stress here is, that the molecule will of necessity have a certain stability;
the configuration cannot change, unless at least the energy
difference, necessary to 'lift' it to the next higher level, is
supplied from outside. Hence this level difference, which is a
well-defined quantity, determines quantitatively the degree
of stability of the molecule. I t will be observed how inti-
mately this fact is linked with the very basis of quantum
theory, viz. with the discreteness of the level scheme.
I must beg the reader to take it for granted that this order
of ideas has been thoroughly checked by chemical facts; and
that it has proved successful in explaining the basic fact of
chemical valency and many details about the structure of
molecules, their binding-energies, their stabilities at different
temperatures, and so on. I am speaking of the Heitler-
London theory, which, as I said, cannot be examined in
detail here.

THEIR STABILITY DEPENDENT ON TEMPERATURE

We must content ourselves with examining the point which is
of paramount interest for our biological question, namely, the
stability of a molecule at different temperatures. Take our
system of atoms at first to be actually in its state of lowest
energy. The physicist would call it a molecule at the absolute
zero of temperature. To lift it to the next higher state or level a
definite supply of energy is required. The simplest way of
trying to supply it is to 'heat up' your molecule. You bring it
into an environment of higher temperature ('heat bath'), thus
allowing other systems (atoms, molecules) to ilnpinge upon it.
Considering the entire irregularity of heat motion, there is no
sharp temperature limit at which the 'lift' will be brought
about with certainty and immediately. Rather, at any temper-
ature (different from absolute zero) there is a certain smaller
or greater chance for the lift to occur, the chance increasing of
course with the temperature of the heat bath. The best way to
express this chance is to indicate the average time you will
have to wait until the lift takes place, the 'time of expectation'.

From an investigation, due to M. Polanyi and E. Wigner,1
the 'time of expectation' largely depends on the ratio of two
energies, one being just the energy difference itself that is
required to effect the lift (let us write W for it), the other one
characterizing the intensity of the heat motion at the temper-
ature in question (let us write T for the absolute tempt:rature
and kTfor the characteristic energy).2 It stands to reason that
the chance for effecting the lift is smaller, and hence that the
time of expectation is longer, the higher the lift itself compared
with the average heat energy, that is to say, the greater the
ratio W:kT. What is amazing is how enormously the time of
expectation depends on comparatively small changes of the
ratio W:kT. To give an example (following Delbriick): for W
30 times kT the time of expectation might be as short as los.,
but would rise to 16 months when W is 50 times kT, and to
30,000 years when W is 60 times kT!

MATHEMATICAL INTERLUDE

I t might be as well to point out in mathematical language - for
those readers to whom it appeals - the reason for this
enormous sensitivity to changes in the level step or temperature, and to add a few physical remarks of a similar kind.
The reason is that the time of expectation, call it t, depends on
the ratio W/kTby an exponential function, thus

t == re W/ kT .
r is a certain small constant of the order of 10- 13 or 10-14 S .

This particular exponential function is not an accidental
feature. 

It recurs again and again in the statistical theory of
heat, forming, as it were, its backbone. I t is a measure of the
improbability of an energy amount as large as W gathering
accidentally in some particular part of the system, and it is
this improbability which increases so enormously when a
considerable multiple of the 'average energy' kTis required.

2k is a numerically known constant, called Boltzmann's constant; ~kT is the average
kinetic energy of a gas atom at temperature T.

Actually a W == 30kT (see the example quoted above) is
already extremely rare. That it does not yet lead to an
enormously long time of expectation (only lo s. in our exam-
ple) is, of course, due to the smallness of the factor T. This
factor has a physical meaning. I t is of the order of the period of
the vibrations which take place in the system all the time. You
could, very broadly, describe this factor as meaning that the
chance of accumulating the required amount W, though very
small, recurs again and again 'at every vibration', that is to
say, about 10 13 or 10 14 times during every second.

FIRST AMENDMENT

In offering these considerations as a theory of the stability of
the molecule it has been tacitly assumed that the quantum
jump which we called the 'lift' leads, if not to a complete
disintegration, at least to an essentially different configuration
of the same atoms - an isomeric molecule, as the chemist
would say, that is, a molecule composed of the same atoms in
a different arrangement (in the application to biology it is
going to represent a different 'allele' in the same 'locus' and
the quantumjump will represent a mutation).
To allow of this interpretation two points must be amended
in our story, which I purposely simplified to make it at all
intelligible. From the way I told it, it might be imagined that
only in its very lowest state does our group of atoms form what
we call a molecule and that already the next higher state is
'something else'. That is not so. Actually the lowest level is
followed by a crowded series of levels which do not involve
any appreciable change in the configuration as a whole, but
only correspond to those small vibrations among the atoms
which we have mentioned above. They, too, are 'quantized',
but with comparatively small steps from one level to the next.
Hence the impacts of the particles of the 'heat bath' may
suffice to set them up already at fairly low temperature. If the
molecule is an extended structure, you may conceive these
vibrations as high-frequency sound waves, crossing the mole-
cule without doing it any harm.

So the first amendment is not very serious: we have to
disregard the 'vibrational fine-structure' of the level scheme.
The term 'next higher level' has to be understood as meaning
the next level that corresponds to a relevant change of
configuration.
SECOND AMENDMENT
The second amendment is far more difficult to explain,
because it is concerned with certain vital, but rather compli-
cated, features of the scheme of relevantly different levels. The
free passage between two of them may be obstructed, quite
apart from the required energy supply; in fact, it may be
obstructed even from the higher to the lower state.
Let us start from the empirical facts. I t is known to the
chemist that the same group of atoms can unite in more than
one way to form a molecule. Such molecules are called isomeric
('consisting of the same parts'; laOe; == same, JlÂ£pOe; == part).
Isomerism is not an exception, it is the rule. The larger

the molecule, the more isomeric alternatives are offered. Fig.
I I shows one of the simplest cases, the two kinds of propyl-
alcohol, both consisting of 3 carbons (C), 8 hydrogens (H),
I oxygen (0). I The latter can be interposed between any
hydrogen and its carbon, but only the two cases shown in our
figure are different substances. And they really are. All their
physical and chemical constants are distinctly different. Also
their energies are differen t, they represen t 'different levels' .
The remarkable fact is that both molecules are perfectly
stable, both behave as though they were 'lowest states'. There
are no spontaneous transitions from either state towards the
other.

The reason is that the two configurations are not neighbouring configurations. The transition from one to the other
can only take place over intermediate configurations which
have a greater energy than either of them. To put it crudely,
the oxygen has to be extracted from one position and has to be
inserted into the other. There does not seem to be a way of
doing that without passing through configurations of con-
siderably higher energy. 

The state of affairs is sometimes

respectively, were exhibited at the lecture. I have not reproduced them here, because
their likeness to the actual molecules is not appreciably greater than that of Fig. I I.
figuratively pictured as in Fig. 12, in which 1 and 2 represent
the two isomers, 3 the 'threshold' between them, and the two
arrows indicate the 'lifts', that is to say, the energy supplies
required to produce the transition from state 1 to state 2 or
from state 2 to state I, respectively.

We can give our 'second amendment', which is that
transitions of this 'isomeric' kind are the only ones in which
we shall be interested in our biological application. It was
these we had in mind when explaining 'stability' on pp. 4g-51 .
The 'quantum jump' which we mean is the transition from
one relatively stable molecular configuration to another. The
energy supply required for the transition (the quantity
denoted by HI) is not the actual level difference, but the step
from the initial level up to the threshold (see the arrows in Fig.12).

Transitions with no threshold interposed between the initial
and the final state are entirely uninteresting, and that not only
in our biological application. They have actually nothing to
contribute to the chemical stability of the molecule. Why?
They have no lasting effect, they remain unnoticed. For, when
they occur, they are almost immediately followed by a relapse
into the initial state, since nothing prevents their return.
