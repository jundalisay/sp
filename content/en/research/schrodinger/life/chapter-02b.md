## THE HEREDITARY CODE-SCRIPT (CHROMOSOMES)


I use 'pattern' as 'the four-dimensional pattern'.


meaning not only the structure and functioning of that
organism in the adult, or in any other particular stage, but the whole of its ontogenetic development from the fertilized egg
cell to the stage of maturity, when the organism begins to
reproduce itself. 

This whole 4D pattern is determined by the structure of that one cell, the
fertilized egg. 

Moreover, we know that it is essentially determined by the structure of only a small part of that cell, its nucleus. This nucleus, in the ordinary 'resting state' of the cell, usually appears as a network of chromatine, I distributed over the cell. But in the vitally important processes of cell division (mitosis and meiosis, see below) it is seen to consist of a set of particles, usually fibre-shaped or rod-like, called the chromosomes, which number 8 or 12 or, in man, 48.

But I should really to have written these illustrative numbers as
2 X 4, 2 X 6, ... , 2 X 24, ... , and I ought-to have spoken of
two sets, in order to use the expression in the customary
meaning of the biologist. For though the single chromosomes
are sometimes clearly distinguished and individualized by
shape and size, the two sets are almost entirely alike. 

One set comes from the mother (egg
cell), one from the father (fertilizing s perma tozoon). I t is these
chromosomes, or probably only an axial skeleton fibre of what
we actually see under the microscope as the chromosome, that
contain in some kind of code-script the entire pattern of the
individual's future development and of its functioning in the
mature state. 

Every complete set of chromosomes contains the
full code; so there are, as a rule, two copies of the la tter in the
fertilized egg cell, which forms the earliest stage of the future
individ ual.

In calling the structure of the chromosome fibres a code-
script we mean that the all-penetrating mind, once conceived
by Laplace, to which every causal connection lay immediately
open, could tell from their structure whether the egg would
develop, under suitable conditions, into a black cock or into a
speckled hen, into a fly or a maize plant, a rhododendron, a
beetle, a mouse or a woman. To which we may add, that the
appearances of the egg cells are very often remarkably similar;

<!-- IThe word means 'the substance which takes on colour', viz. in a certain dyeing
process used in microscopic technique. -->

and even when they are not, as in the case of the compara-
tively gigantic eggs of birds and reptiles, the difference is not
so much in the relevant structures as in the nutritive material
which in these cases is added for obvious reasons.


But the term code-script is, of course, too narrow. The
chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in
bringing about the development they foreshadow. They are
law-code and executive power - or, to use another simile, they
are architect's plan and builder's craft - in one.

GROWTH OF THE BODY BY CELL DIVISION (MITOSIS)

How do the chromosomes behave in ontogenesis?


The growth of an organism is effected by consecutive cell
divisions. Such a cell division is called mitosis. I t is, in the life
of a cell, not such a very frequent event as one might expect,
considering the enormous number of cells of which our body is
composed. In the beginning the growth is rapid. The egg
divides into two 'daughter cells' which, at the next step, will
prod uce a genera tion of four, then of 8, 16, 32, 64, ... , etc.
The frequency of division will not remain exactly the same in
all parts of the growing body, and that will break the
regularity of these numbers. But from their rapid increase we
infer by an easy computation that on the average as few as 50
or 60 successive divisions suffice to produce the number of
cells2 in a grown man - or, say, ten times the number,2 taking
into account the exchange of cells during lifetime. Thus, a
body cell of mine is, on the average, only the 50th or 60th
'descendant' of the egg that was I.

IN MITOSIS EVERY CHROMOSOME IS DUPLICATED

How do the chromosomes behave on mitosis? They duplicate
'Ontogenesis is the development of the individual, during its lifetime, as opposed to
phylogenesis, the development of species within geological periods.
2Very roughly, a hundred or a thousand (English) billions.

- both sets, both copies of the code, duplicate. The process has
been intensively studied under the microscope and is of
paramount interest, but much too involved to describe here in
detail. The salient point is that each of the two 'daughter cells'
gets a dowry of two further complete sets of chromosomes
exactly similar to those of the parent cell. So all the body cells
are exactly alike as regards their chromosome treasure. I
However little we understand the device we cannot but
think that it must be in some way very relevant to the
functioning of the organism, that every single cell, even a less
important one, should be in possession ofa complete (double)
copy of the code-script. Some time ago we were told in the
newspapers that in his African campaign General Mont-
gomery made a point of having every single soldier of his army
meticulously informed of all his designs. If that is true (as it
conceivably might be, considering the high intelligence and
reliability of his troops) it provides an excellent analogy to our
case, in which the corresponding fact certainly is literally true.
The most surprising fact is the doubleness of the chromosome
set, maintained throughout the mitotic divisions. That it is the
outstanding feature of the genetic mechanism is most strik-
ingly revealed by the one and only departure from the rule,
which we have now to discuss.
