THE HEREDITARY CODE-SCRIPT (CHROMOSOMES)

Let me use the word 'pattern' of an organism in the sense in
which the biologist calls it 'the four-dimensional pattern',
meaning not only the structure and functioning of that
organism in the adult, or in any other particular stage, but the whole of its ontogenetic development from the fertilized egg
cell to the stage of maturity, when the organism begins to
reproduce itself. 

This whole four-dimensional pattern is
known to be determined by the structure of that one cell, the
fertilized egg. 

Moreover, we know that it is essentially deter-
mined by the structure of only a small part of that cell, its
nucleus. This nucleus, in the ordinary 'resting state' of the
cell, usually appears as a network of chromatine, I distributed
over the cell. But in the vitally important processes of cell
division (mitosis and meiosis, see below) it is seen to consist of
a set of particles, usually fibre-shaped or rod-like, called the
chromosomes, which number 8 or 12 or, in man, 48. 

But I
ought really to have written these illustrative numbers as
2 X 4, 2 X 6, ... , 2 X 24, ... , and I ought-to have spoken of
two sets, in order to use the expression in the customary
meaning of the biologist. For though the single chromosomes
are sometimes clearly distinguished and individualized by
shape and size, the two sets are almost entirely alike. 

One set comes from the mother (egg
cell), one from the father (fertilizing s perma tozoon). I t is these
chromosomes, or probably only an axial skeleton fibre of what
we actually see under the microscope as the chromosome, that
contain in some kind of code-script the entire pattern of the
individual's future development and of its functioning in the
mature state. 

Every complete set of chromosomes contains the
full code; so there are, as a rule, two copies of the la tter in the
fertilized egg cell, which forms the earliest stage of the future
individ ual.

In calling the structure of the chromosome fibres a code-
script we mean that the all-penetrating mind, once conceived
by Laplace, to which every causal connection lay immediately
open, could tell from their structure whether the egg would
develop, under suitable conditions, into a black cock or into a
speckled hen, into a fly or a maize plant, a rhododendron, a
beetle, a mouse or a woman. To which we may add, that the
appearances of the egg cells are very often remarkably similar;

<!-- IThe word means 'the substance which takes on colour', viz. in a certain dyeing
process used in microscopic technique. -->

and even when they are not, as in the case of the compara-
tively gigantic eggs of birds and reptiles, the difference is not
so much in the relevant structures as in the nutritive material
which in these cases is added for obvious reasons.


But the term code-script is, of course, too narrow. The
chromosome structures are at the same time instrumental in
bringing about the development they foreshadow. They are
law-code and executive power - or, to use another simile, they
are architect's plan and builder's craft - in one.

GROWTH OF THE BODY BY CELL DIVISION (MITOSIS)

How do the chromosomes behave in ontogenesis?


The growth of an organism is effected by consecutive cell
divisions. Such a cell division is called mitosis. I t is, in the life
of a cell, not such a very frequent event as one might expect,
considering the enormous number of cells of which our body is
composed. In the beginning the growth is rapid. The egg
divides into two 'daughter cells' which, at the next step, will
prod uce a genera tion of four, then of 8, 16, 32, 64, ... , etc.
The frequency of division will not remain exactly the same in
all parts of the growing body, and that will break the
regularity of these numbers. But from their rapid increase we
infer by an easy computation that on the average as few as 50
or 60 successive divisions suffice to produce the number of
cells2 in a grown man - or, say, ten times the number,2 taking
into account the exchange of cells during lifetime. Thus, a
body cell of mine is, on the average, only the 50th or 60th
'descendant' of the egg that was I.

IN MITOSIS EVERY CHROMOSOME IS DUPLICATED

How do the chromosomes behave on mitosis? They duplicate
'Ontogenesis is the development of the individual, during its lifetime, as opposed to
phylogenesis, the development of species within geological periods.
2Very roughly, a hundred or a thousand (English) billions.

- both sets, both copies of the code, duplicate. The process has
been intensively studied under the microscope and is of
paramount interest, but much too involved to describe here in
detail. The salient point is that each of the two 'daughter cells'
gets a dowry of two further complete sets of chromosomes
exactly similar to those of the parent cell. So all the body cells
are exactly alike as regards their chromosome treasure. I
However little we understand the device we cannot but
think that it must be in some way very relevant to the
functioning of the organism, that every single cell, even a less
important one, should be in possession ofa complete (double)
copy of the code-script. Some time ago we were told in the
newspapers that in his African campaign General Mont-
gomery made a point of having every single soldier of his army
meticulously informed of all his designs. If that is true (as it
conceivably might be, considering the high intelligence and
reliability of his troops) it provides an excellent analogy to our
case, in which the corresponding fact certainly is literally true.
The most surprising fact is the doubleness of the chromosome
set, maintained throughout the mitotic divisions. That it is the
outstanding feature of the genetic mechanism is most strik-
ingly revealed by the one and only departure from the rule,
which we have now to discuss.

REDUCTIVE DIVISION (MEIOSIS) AND FERTILIZATION (SYNGAMY)

Very soon after the development of the individual has set in, a
group of cells is reserved for producing at a later stage the
so-called gametes, the sperma cells or egg cells, as the case
may be, needed for the reproduction of the individual in
maturity. 'Reserved' means that they do not serve other
purposes in the meantime and suffer many fewer mitotic
divisions. The exceptional or reductive division (called meio-
sis) is the one by which eventually, on maturity, the gametes
are produced from these reserved cells, as a rule only a short
'The biologist will forgive me for disregarding in this brief summary the exceptional
case of mosaics.

time before syngamy is to take place. In meiosis the double
chromosome set of the parent cell simply separates into two
single sets, one of which goes to each of the two daughter cells,
the gametes. In other words, the mitotic doubling of the
number of chromosomes does not take place in meiosis, the
number remains constant and thus every gamete receives only
half - that is, only one complete copy of the code, not two, e.g.
in man only 24, not 2 X 24 == 48.
Cells with only one chromosome set are called haploid
(from Greek a1tAoG~, single). Thus the gametes are haploid,
the ordinary body cells diploid (from Greek 817tAOG~, double).
Individuals with three, four, ... or generally speaking with
many chromosome sets in all their body cells occur occasion-
ally; the latter are then called triploid, tetraploid, ... , poly-
ploid.
In the act of syngamy the male gamete (spermatozoon)
and the female gamete (egg), both haploid cells, coalesce to
form the fertilized egg cell, which is thus diploid. One of its
chromosome sets comes from the mother, one from the
father.

HAPLOID INDIVIDUALS

One other point needs rectification. Though not indispensable
for our purpose it is of real in teres t, since it shows that actually
a fairly complete code-script of the 'pattern' is contained in
every single set of chromosomes.
There are instances of meiosis not being followed shortly
after by fertilization, the haploid cell (the 'gamete') under-
going meanwhile numerous mitotic cell divisions, which result
in building up a complete haploid individual. This is the case
in the male bee, the drone, which is produced parthenogen-
etically, that is, from non-fertilized and therefore haploid eggs
of the queen. The drone has no father! All its body cells are
haploid. If you please, you may call it a grossly exaggerated
spermatozoon; and actually, as everybody knows, to function
as such happens to be its one and only task in life. However,
that is perhaps a ludicrous point of view. For the case is not
quite unique. There are families of plants in which the haploid
gamete which is produced by meiosis and is called a spore in
such cases falls to the ground and, like a seed, develops into a
true haploid plant comparable in size with the diploid. Fig. 5
is a rough sketch of a moss, well known in our forests. The
leafy lower part is the haploid plant, called the gametophyte,
because at its upper end it develops sex organs and gametes,
which by mutual fertilization produce in the ordinary way the
diploid plant, the bare stem with the capsule at the top. This
is called the sporophyte, because it produces, by meiosis, the
spores in the capsule at the top. When the capsule opens, the
spores fall to the ground and develop into a leafy stem, etc.
The course of events is appropriately called alternation of
generations. You may, if you choose, look upon the ordinary
case, man and the animals, in the same way. But the
'gametophyte' is then as a rule a very short-lived, unicellular
generation, spermatozoon or egg cell as the case may be. Our
body corresponds to the sporophyte. Our 'spores' are the
reserved cells from which, by meiosis, the unicellular genera-
tion springs.

THE OUTSTANDING RELEVANCE OF THE REDUCTIVE DIVISION

The important, the really fateful event in the process of
reproduction of the individual is not fertilization but meiosis.
One set of chromosomes is from the father, one from the
mother. Neither chance nor destiny can interfere with that.
Every man lowes just half of his inheritance to his mother,
halfofit to his father. That one or the other strain seems often
to prevail is due to other reasons which we shall come to later.
(Sex itself is, of course, the simplest instance of such preva-
lence. )
But when you trace the origin of your inheritance back to
your grandparents, the case is different. Let me fix attention
on my paternal set of chromosomes, in particular on one of
them, say NO.5. It is a faithful replica either of the NO.5 my
father received from his father or of the NO.5 he had received
from his mother. The issue was decided by a 50:50 chance in
the meiosis taking place in my father's body in November
1886 and producing the spermatozoon which a few days later
was to be effective in begetting me. Exactly the same story
could be repeated about chromosomes Nos. 1,2,3, ... , 24 of
my paternal set, and mutatis mutandis about everyone of my
maternal chromosomes. Moreover, all the 48 issues are
entirely independent. Even if it were known that my paternal
chromosome No. 5 came from my grandfather Josef
Schrodinger, the NO.7 still stands an equal chance of being
either also from him, or from his wife Marie, nee Bogner.
CROSSING-OVER. LOCATION OF PROPERTIES
But pure chance has been given even a wider range in mixing
the grandparental inheritance in the offspring than would
appear from the preceding description, in which it has been
'At any rate, every woman. To avoid prolixity, I have excluded from this summary the
highly interesting sphere of sex determination and sex-linked properties (as, for
example, so-called colour blindness).

tacitly assumed, or even explicitly stated, that a particular
chromosome as a whole was either from the grandfather or
from the grandmother; in other words that the single chromo-
somes are passed on undivided. In actual fact they are not, or
not always. Before being separated in the reductive division,
say the one in the father's body, any two 'homologous'
chromosomes come into close contact with each other, during
which they sometimes exchange entire portions in the way
illustrated in Fig. 6. By this process, called 'crossing-over',
two properties situated in the respective parts of that chromo-
some will be separated in the grandchild, who will follow the
grandfather in one of them, the grandmother in the other one.
The act of crossing-over, being neither very rare nor very
frequent, has provided us with invaluable information regard-
ing the location of properties in the chromosomes. For a full
account we should have to draw on conceptions not intro-
duced before the next chapter (e.g. heterozygosy, dominance,
etc.); but as that would take us beyond the range of this little
book, let me indicate the salient point right away.
If there were no crossing-over, two properties for which the
same chromosome is responsible would always be passed on
together, no descendant receiving one of them without receiv-
ing the other as well; but two properties, due to different
chromosomes, would either stand a 50:5° chance of being
separated or they would invariably be separated - the latter
when they were situated in homologous chromosomes of the
same ancestor, which could never go together.
ERWIN SCHRODINGER
These rules and chances are interfered with by crossing-
over. Hence the probability of this event can be ascertained by
registering carefully the percentage composition of the off-
spring in extended breeding experiments, suitably laid out for
the purpose. In analysing the statistics, one accepts the
suggestive working hypothesis that the 'linkage' between two
properties situated in the same chromosome, is the less
frequently broken by crossing-over, the nearer they lie to each
other. For then there is less chance of the point of exchange
lying between them, whereas properties located near the
opposite ends of the chromosomes are separated by every
crossing-over. (Much the same applies to the recombination
of properties located in homologous chromosomes of the same
ancestor.) In this way one may expect to get from the
'statistics of linkage' a sort of 'map of properties' within every
chromosome.
These anticipations have been fully confirmed. In the cases
to which tests have been thoroughly applied (mainly, but not
only, Drosophila) the tested properties actually divide into as
many separate groups, with no linkage from group to group,
as there are different chromosomes (four in Drosophila).
Within every group a linear map of properties can be drawn
up which accounts quantitatively for the degree of linkage
between any two out of that group, so that there is little doubt
that they actually are located, and located along a line, as the
rod-like shape of the chromosome suggests.
Of course, the scheme of the hereditary mechanism, as
drawn up here, is still rather empty and colourless, even
slightly naIve. For we have not said what exactly we under-
stand by a property. It seems neither adequate nor possible to
dissect into discrete 'properties' the pattern of an organism
which is essentially a unity, a 'whole'. Now, what we actually
state in any particular case is, that a pair of ancestors were
different in a certain well-defined respect (say, one had blue
eyes, the other brown), and that the offspring follows in this
respect either one or the other. What we locate in the
chromosome is the seat of this difference. (We call it, in
technical language, a 'locus', or, if we think of the hypothetical
What is Life?
material structure underlying it, a 'gene'.) Difference of
property, to my view, is really the fundamental concept rather
than property itself, notwithstanding the apparent linguistic
and logical contradiction of this statement. The differences of
properties actually are discrete, as will emerge in the next
chapter when we have to speak of mutations and the dry
scheme hitherto presented will, as I hope, acquire more life
and colour.
MAXIMUM SIZE OF A GENE
We have just introduced the term gene for the hypothetical
material carrier of a definite hereditary feature. We must now
stress two points which will be highly relevant to our
investigation. The first is the size - or, better, the maximum
size - of such a carrier; in other words, to how small a volume
can we trace the location? The second point will be the
permanence of a gene, to be inferred from the durability of the
hereditary pattern.
As regards the size, there are two entirely independent
estimates, one resting on genetic evidence (breeding experi-
ments), the other on cytological evidence (direct microscopic
inspection). The first is, in principle, simple enough. After
having, in the way described above, located in the chromo-
some a considerable number of different (large-scale) features
(say of the Drosophila fly) within a particular one of its
chromosomes, to get the required estimate we need only
divide the measured length of that chromosome by the
number of features and multiply by the cross-section. For, of
course, we count as different only such features as are
occasionally separated by crossing-over, so that they cannot
be due to the same (microscopic or molecular) structure. On
the other hand, it is clear that our estimate can only give a
maximum size, because the number of features isolated by
genetic analysis is continually increasing as work goes on.
The other estimate, though based on microscopic
inspection, is really far less direct. Certain cells of Drosophila
(namely, those of its salivary glands) are, for some reason,

enormously enlarged, and so are their chromosomes. In them
you distinguish a crowded pattern of transverse dark bands
across the fibre. C. D. Darlington has remarked that the
number of these bands (2,000 in the case he uses) is, though
considerably larger, yet roughly of the same order of magni-
tude as the number of genes located in that chromosome by
breeding experiments. He inclines to regard these bands as
indicating the actual genes (or separations of genes). Dividing
the length of the chromosome, measured in a normal-sized cell
by their number (2,000), he finds the volulne of a gene equal
to a cube of edge 300 A. Considering the roughness of the
estimates, we may regard this to be also the size obtained by
the first method.

SMALL NUMBERS

A full discussion of the bearing of statistical physics on all the
facts I am recalling - or perhaps, I ought to say, of the bearing
of these facts on the use of statistical physics in the living cell-
will follow later. But let me draw attention at this point to the
fact that 300 A is only about 100 or 150 atomic distances in a
liquid or in a solid, so that a gene contains certainly not more
than about a million or a few million atoms. That number is
much too small (from the Yn point of view) to entail an
orderly and lawful behaviour according to statistical physics -
and that means according to physics. I t is too small, even if all
these atoms played the same role, as they do in a gas or in a
drop of liquid. And the gene is most certainly not just a
homogeneous drop of liquid. I t is probably a large protein
molecule, in which every atom, every radical, every heterocy-
clic ring plays an individual role, more or less different from
that played by any of the other similar atoms, radicals, or
rings. This, at any rate, is the opinion of leading geneticists
such as Haldane and Darlington, and we shall soon have to
refer to genetic experiments which come very near to proving
it.

PERMANENCE

What degree of permanence do we encounter in hereditary properties and what must we therefore attribute to the
material structures which carry them?

The answer to this can really be given without any special
investigation. The mere fact that we speak of hereditary
properties indicates that we recognize the permanence to be
almost absolute. For we must not forget that what is passed on
by the parent to the child is not jus t this or that peculiarity, a
hooked nose, short fingers, a tendency to rheumatism, haemo-
philia, dichromasy, etc. Such features we may conveniently
select for studying the laws of heredity. But actually it is the
whole (four-dimensional) pattern of the 'phenotype', the
visible and manifest nature of the individual, which is repro-
duced without appreciable change for generations, permanent
within centuries - though not within tens of thousands of
years - and borne at each transmission by the material
structure of the nuclei of the two cells which unite to form the
fertilized egg cell. That is a marvel - than which only one is
greater; one that, if intimately connected with it, yet lies on a
different plane. I mean the fact that we, whose total being is
entirely based on a marvellous interplay of this very kind, yet
possess the power of acquiring considerable knowledge about
it. I think it possible that this knowledge may advance to little
short of a complete understanding - of the first marvel. The
second may well be beyond human understanding.
