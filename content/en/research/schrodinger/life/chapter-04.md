PERMANENCE UNEXPLAINABLE BY CLASSICAL PHYSICS

X-rays revealed 30 years ago the detailed atomic lattice structures of crystals.

 the united
efforts of biologists and physicists have of late succeeded in
reducing the upper limit for the size of the microscopic
structure, being responsible for a definite large-scale feature of
the individual- the 'size of a gene' - and reducing it far below
the estimates obtained on pp. 29-30. 

We are now seriously
faced with the question: How can we, from the point of view of
statistical physics, reconcile the facts that the gene structure
seems to involve only a comparatively small number of atoms
(of the order of 1,000 and possibly much less), and that
nevertheless it displays a most regular and lawful activity -
with a durability or permanence that borders upon the
miraculous?

The Habsburg dynasty has a disfigurement of the lower lip ('Habsburger Lippe').

Its inheritance has been studied carefully and published, complete with historical portraits, by the Imperial Academy
of Vienna, under the auspices of the family. 

<!-- I And thy spirit's fiery flight of imagination acquiesces in an image, in a parable. -->

The feature proves to be a genuinely Mendelian 'allele' to the normal form
of the lip. Fixing our attention on the portraits of a member of
the family in the sixteenth century and of his descendant,
living in the nineteenth, we may safely assume that the
material gene structure, responsible for the abnormal feature,
has been carried on from generation to generation through the
centuries, faithfully reproduced at everyone of the not very
numerous cell divisions that lie between. Moreover, the
number of atoms involved in the responsible gene structure is
likely to be of the same order of magnitude as in the cases
tested by X-rays. The gene has been kept at a temperature
around g8Â°F during all that time. How are we to understand
that it has remained unperturbed by the disordering tendency
of the heat motion for centuries?

A physicist at the end of the last century would have been at
a loss to answer this question, ifhe was prepared to draw only
on those laws of Nature which he could explain and which he
really understood. Perhaps, indeed, after a short reflection on
the statistical situation he would have answered (correctly, as
we shall see): These material structures can only be mole-
cules. Of the existence, and sometimes very high stability, of
these associations of atoms, chemistry had already acquired a
widespread knowledge at the time. But the knowledge was
purely empirical. The nature of a molecule was not under-
stood - the strong mutual bond of the atoms which keeps a
molecule in shape was a complete conundrum to everybody.
Actually, the answer proves to be correct. But it is of limited
value as long as the enigmatic biological stability is traced
back only to an equally enigmatic chemical stability. The
evidence that two features, similar in appearance, are based
on the same principle, is always precarious as long as the
principle itselfis unknown.

EXPLICABLE BY QUANTUM THEORY

In this case it is supplied by quantum theory. In the light of
present knowledge, the mechanism of heredity is closely
related to, nay, founded on, the very basis of quantum theory.

This theory was discovered by Max Planck in Igoo. Modern
genetics can be dated from the rediscovery of Mendel's paper
by de Vries, Correns and Tschermak (I goo) and from de
Vries's paper on mutations (IgOI-3). Thus the births of the two
great theories nearly coincide, and it is small wonder that both
of them had to reach a certain maturity before the connection
could emerge. On the side of quantum theory it took more than
a quarter of a century till in I 926-7 the quantum theory of the
chemical bond was outlined in its general principles by W.
Heitler and F. London. The Heitler-London theory involves
the most subtle and intricate conceptions of the latest develop-
ment of quantum theory (called 'quantum mechanics' or 'wave
mechanics'). A presentation without the use of calculus is well-
nigh impossible or would at least require another little volume
like this. But fortunately, now that all work has been done and
has served to clarify our thinking, it seems to be possible to
point out in a more direct manner the connection between
'quantumjumps' and mutations, to pick out at the moment the
most conspicuous item. rfhat is what we attempt here.

QUANTUM THEORY - DISCRETE STATES - QUANTUM JUMPS

The great revelation of quantum theory was that features of
discreteness were discovered in the Book of Nature, in a
context in which anything other than continuity seemed to be
absurd according to the views held until then.

The first case of this kind concerned energy. A body on the
large scale changes its energy continuously. A pendulum, for
instance, that is set swinging is gradually slowed down by the
resistance of the air. Strangely enough, it proves necessary to
admit that a system of the order of the atomic scale behaves
differently. On grounds upon which we cannot enter here, we
have to assume that a small system can by its very nature
possess only certain discrete amounts of energy, called its
peculiar energy levels. The transition from one state to
another is a rather mysterious event, which is usually called a
'quantumjump'.

But energy is not the only characteristic of a system. Take
again our pendulum, but think of one that can perform
different kinds of movement, a heavy ball suspended by a
string from the ceiling. I t can be made to swing in a
north-south or east-west or any other direction or in a circle
or in an ellipse. By gently blowing the ball with a bellows, it
can be made to pass continuously from one state of motion to
any other.

For small-scale sys tems mos t of these or similar characteristics - we cannot enter into details - change discontinuously.
They are 'quantized',just as the energy is.

The result is that a number of atomic nuclei, including their
bodyguards of electrons, when they find themselves close to
each other, forming 'a system', are unable by their very nature
to adopt any arbitrary configuration we might think of. Their
very nature leaves them only a very numerous but discrete
series of 'states' to choose from. I We usually call them levels
or energy levels, because the energy is a very relevant part of
the characteristic. But it must be understood that the com-
plete description includes much more thanjust the energy. It
is virtually correct to think of a state as meaning a definite
configura tion of all the corpuscles.
The transition from one of these configurations to another is
a quantumjump. If the second one has the greater energy ('is
a higher level'), the system must be supplied from outside
with at least the difference of the two energies to make the
transition possible. To a lower level it can change spontan-
eously, spending the surplus of energy in radiation.
