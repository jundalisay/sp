### 'JUMP-LIKE' MUTATIONS - THE WORKING-GROUND OF NATURAL SELECTION

The general facts which we have just put forward in evidence
of the durability claimed for the gene structure, are perhaps
too familiar to us to be striking or to be regarded as
convincing. Here, for once, the common saying that exceptions prove the rule is actually true. If there were no exceptions to the likeness between children and parents, we should
have been deprived not only of all those beautiful experiments
which have revealed to us the detailed mechanism of heredity,
but also of that grand, million-fold experiment of Nature,
which forges the species by natural selection and survival of
the fittest.

Let me take this last important subject as the starting-point
for presenting the relevant facts - again with an apology and a reminder that I am not a biologist:
We know definitely, today, that Darwin was mistaken in
regarding the small, continuous, accidental variations, that
are bound to occur even in the most homogeneous population,
as the material on which natural selection works. For it has
been proved that they are not inherited. The fact is important
enough to be illustrated briefly. If you take a crop of
r And what in fluctuating appearance hovers,
Ye shall fix by lasting thoughts.

~ Length of awns

be selected for sowing. (The details are not from an actual experiment,
but arejust set up for illustration.)

pure-strain barley, and measure, ear by ear, the length of its
awns and plot the result of your statistics, you will get a
bell-shaped curve as shown in Fig. 7, where the number of
ears with a definite length of awn is plotted against the length.
In other words: a definite medium length prevails, and
deviations in either direction occur with certain frequencies.
Now pick out a group of ears (as indicated by blackening)
with awns noticeably beyond the average, but sufficient in
number to be sown in a field by themselves and give a new
crop. In making the same statistics for this, Darwin would
have expected to find the corresponding curve shifted to the
right. In other words, he would have expected to produce by
selection an increase of the average length of the awns. That is
not the case, if a truly pure-bred strain of barley has been
used. The new statistical curve, obtained from the selected
crop, is identical with the first one, and the same would be the
case if ears with particularly short awns had been selected for
seed. Selection has no effect - because the small, continuous
variations are not inherited. They are obviously not based on
the structure Qf the hereditary substance, they are accidental.


But about forty years ago the Dutchman de Vries discovered that in the offspring even of thoroughly pure-bred stocks, a
very small number of individuals, say two or three in tens of
thousands, turn up with small but 'jump-like' changes, the
expression 'jump-like' not meaning that the change is so very
considerable, but that there is a discontinuity inasmuch as
there are no intermediate forms between the unchanged and
the few changed. De Vries called that a mutation. The
significant fact is the discon tin ui ty. I t reminds a physicis t of
quantum theory - no intermediate energies occurring between
two neighbouring energy levels. He would be inclined to call
de Vries's mutation theory, figuratively, the quantum theory
of biology. We shall see later that this is much more than
figurative. The mutations are actually due to quantum jumps
in the gene molecule. But quantum theory was but two years
old when de Vries first published his discovery, in 1902. Small
wonder that it took another generation to discover the inti-
mate connection!

THEY BREED TRUE, THAT IS, THEY ARE PERFECTLY INHERITED

Mutations are inherited as perfectly as the original,
unchanged characters were. To give an example, in the first
crop of barley considered above a few ears might turn up with
awns considerably outside the range of variability shown in
Fig. 7, say with no awns at all. They might represent a de
Vries mutation and would then breed perfectly true, that is to
say, all their descendants would be equally awnless.
Hence a mutation is definitely a change in the hereditary
treasure and has to be accounted for by some change in the
hereditary substance. Actually most of the important breeding
experiments, which have revealed to us the mechanism of
heredity, consisted in a careful analysis of the offsp'ring
obtained by crossing, according to a preconceived plan,
mutated (or, in many cases, multiply mutated) with non-
mutated or with differently mutated individuals. On the other
hand, by virtue of their breeding true, mutations are a suitable
material on which natural selection may work and produce

the species as described by Darwin, by eliminating the unfit
and letting the fittest survive. In Darwin's theory, you just
have to substitute 'mutations' for his 'slight accidental varia-
tions' Gust as quantum theory substitutes 'quantum jump' for
'continuous transfer of energy'). In all other respects little
change was necessary in Darwin's theory, that is, if I am
correctly interpreting the view held by the majority of biol-
ogists. I

LOCALIZATION. RECESSIVITY AND DOMINANCE

We must now review some other fundamental facts and
notions about mutations, again in a slightly dogmatic manner,
without showing directly how they spring, one by one, from
experimental evidence.
We should expect a definite observed mutation to be caused
by a change in a definite region in one of the chromosomes.
I Ample discussion has been given to the question, whether natural selection be aided
(if not superseded) by a marked inclination of mutations to take place in a useful or
favourable direction. My personal view about this is of no moment; but it is
necessary to state that the eventuality of 'directed mutations' has been disregarded
in all the following. Moreover, I cannot enter here on the interplay of 'switch' genes
and 'polygenes', however important it be for the actual mechanism of selection and
evolution.

Fig. g. Inheritance of a mutation. The straight lines across indicate the
transfer ofa chromosome, the double ones that of the mutated chromosome.
The unaccounted-for chromosomes of the third generation come from the
mates of the second generation, which are not included in the diagram.

They are supposed to be non-relatives, free of the mutation.

And so it is. It is important to state that we know definitely
that it is a change in one chromosome only, but not in the
corresponding 'locus' of the homologous chromosome. Fig. 8
indicates this schematically, the cross denoting the mutated
locus. The fact that only one chromosome is affected is
revealed when the mutated individual (often called 'mutant')
is crossed with a non-mutated one. For exactly half of the
offspring exhibit the mutant character and half the normal
one. That is what is to be expected as a consequence of the
separation of the two chromosomes on meiosis in the mutant-
as shown, very schematically, in Fig. g. This is a 'pedigree',
representing every individual (of three consecutive genera-
tions) simply by the pair of chromosomes in question. Please
realize that if the mutant had both its chromosomes affected,
all the children would receive the same (mixed) inheritance,
different from that of either parent.
But experimenting in this domain is not as simple as would
appear from what has just been said. It is complicated by the
second important fact, viz. that mutations are very often
latent. What does that mean?
In the mutant the two 'copies of the code-script' are no

or from crossing two of them.

longer identical; they present two different 'readings' or
'versions', at any rate in that one place. Perhaps it is well to
point out at once that, while it might be tempting, it would
nevertheless be entirely wrong to regard the original version
as 'orthodox', and the mutant version as 'heretic'. We have to
regard them, in principle, as being of equal right - for the
normal characters have also arisen from mutations.
What actually happens is that the 'pattern' of the individ-
ual, as a general rule, follows either the one or the other
version, which may be the normal or the mutant one. The
version which is followed is called dominant, the other
recessive; in other words, the mutation is called dominant or
recessive, according to whether it is immediately effective in
changing the pattern or not.

Recessive mutations are even more frequent than dominant
ones and are very important, though at first they do not show
up at all. To affect the pattern, they have to be present in both
chromosomes (see Fig. 10). Such individuals can be produced
when two equal recessive mutants happen to be crossed with
each other or when a mutant is crossed with itself; this is
possible in hermaphroditic plants and even happens spontaneously. 

An easy reflection shows that in these cases about one-quarter of the offspring will be of this type and thus
visibly exhibit the mutated pattern.

INTRODUCING SOME TECHNICAL LANGUAGE

I think it will make for clarity to explain here a few technical
terms. For what I called 'version of the code-script' - be it the
original one or a mutant one - the term 'allele' has been
adopted. When the versions are different, as indicated in Fig.
8, the individual is called heterozygous, with respect to that
locus. When they are equal, as in the non-mutated individual
or in the case of Fig. 10, they are called homozygous. Thus a
recessive allele influences the pattern only when homozygous,
whereas a dominant allele produces the same pattern,
whether homozygous or only heterozygous.

Colour is very often dominant over lack of colour (or white).
Thus, for example, a pea will flower white only when it has the
'recessive allele responsible for white' in both chromosomes in
question, when it is 'homozygous for white'; it will then breed
true, and all its descendants will be white. But one 'red allele'
(the other being white; 'heterozygous') will make it flower red,
and so will two red alleles ('homozygous'). The difference of
the latter two cases will only show up in the offspring, when
the heterozygous red will produce some white descendants,
and the homozygous red will breed true.

The fact that two individuals may be exactly alike in their
outward appearance, yet differ in their inheritance, is so
important that an exact differentiation is desirable. The
geneticist says they have the same phenotype, but different
genotype. The contents of the preceding paragraphs could
thus be summarized in the brief, but highly technical
statement:

A recessive allele influences the phenotype only when the
genotype is homozygous.
We shall use these technical expressions occasionally, bu t
shall recall their meaning to the reader where necessary.
