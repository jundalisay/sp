## TWO WAYS OF PRODUCING ORDERLINESS

The orderliness encountered in the unfolding of life springs
from a different source. I t appears that there are two
different 'mechanisms' by which orderly events can be
produced: the 'statistical mechanism' which produces 'order
from disorder' and the new one, producing 'order from
order'. To the unprejudiced mind the second principle
appears to be much simpler, much more plausible. 

That is why physicists were so proud to have
fallen in with the other one, the 'order-from-disorder'
principle, which is actually followed in Nature and which
alone conveys an understanding of the great line of natural
events, in the first place of their irreversibility. But we
cannot expect that the 'laws of physics' derived from it
suffice straightaway to explain the behaviour of living
matter, whose most striking features are visibly based to a
large extent on the 'order-from-order' principle. You would
not expect two entirely different mechanisms to bring about
the same type of law - you would not expect your latch-key
to open your neighbour's door as well.

We must therefore not be discouraged by the difficul ty of
interpreting life by the ordinary laws of physics. For that is
just what is to be expected from the knowledge we have
gained of the structure of living matter. We must be
prepared to find a new type of physical law prevailing in it.
Or are we to term it a non-physical, not to say a super-
physical, law?


## THE NEW PRINCIPLE IS NOT ALIEN TO PHYSICS

No. I do not think that. For the new principle that is involved
is a genuinely physical one: it is, in my opinion, nothing else
than the principle of quantum theory over again. To explain
this, we have to go to some length, including a refinement, not
to sayan amendment, of the assertion previously made,
namely, that all physical laws are based on statistics.
This assertion, made again and again, could not fail to
arouse contradiction. For, indeed, there are phenomena
whose conspicuous features are visibly based directly on the
'order-from-order' principle and appear to have nothing to do
with statistics or molecular disorder.

The order of the solar system, the motion of the planets, is
maintained for an almost indefinite time. The constellation of
this moment is directly connected with the constellation at
any particular moment in the times of the Pyramids; it can be
traced back to it, or vice versa. Historical eclipses have been
calculated and have been found in close agreement with
historical records or have even in some cases served to correct
the accepted chronology. These calculations do not imply any
statistics, they are based solely on Newton's law of universal
attraction.

Nor does the regular motion of a good clock or of any
similar mechanism appear to have anything to do with
statistics. In short, all purely mechanical events seem to follow
distinctly and directly the 'order-from-order' principle. And if
we say 'mechanical', the term must be taken in a wide sense.
A very useful kind of clock is, as you know, based on the
regular transmission of electric pulses from the power station.
I remember an interesting little paper by Max Planck on
the topic 'The Dynamical and the Statistical Type of Law'
('Dynamische und Statistische Gesetzmassigkeit'). The dis-
tinction is precisely the one we have here labelled as 'order
from order' and 'order from disorder'. 

The object of that paper was to show how the interesting statistical type of law, controlling large-scale events, is constituted from the 'dynamical' laws supposed to govern the small-scale events, the interaction of the single atoms and molecules. The latter type is illustrated by large-scale mechanical phenomena, as the motion of the planets or of a clock, etc. Thus it would appear that the 'new' principle, the order- from-order principle, to which we have pointed with great solemnity as being the real clue to the understanding of life, is not at all new to physics. Planck's attitude even vindicates priority for it. We seem to arrive at the ridiculous conclusion that the clue to the understanding of life is that it is based on a pure mechanism, a 'clock-work' in the sense of Planck's paper. The conclusion is not ridiculous and is, in my opinion, not entirely wrong, but it has to be taken 'with a very big grain of salt'.


## THE MOTION OF A CLOCK

Let us analyse the motion of a real clock accurately. I t is not at
all a purely mechanical phenomenon. A purely mechanical
clock would need no spring, no winding. Once set in motion, it
would go on for ever. A real clock without a spring stops after
a few beats of the pendulum, its mechanical energy is turned
into heat. This is an infinitely complicated atomistic process.
The general picture the physicist forms of it compels him,to
admit that the inverse process is not entirely impossible: a
springless clock might suddenly begin to move, at the expense
of the heat energy of its own cog wheels and of the environ-
ment. The physicist would have to say: The clock experiences
an exceptionally intense fit of Brownian movement. We have
seen in chapter 2 (p. 16) that with a very sensitive torsional
balance (electrometer or galvanometer) that sort of thing
happens all the time. In the case of a clock it is, of course,
infinitely unlikely.

Whether the motion of a clock is to be assigned to the
dynamical or to the statistical type of lawful events (to use
Planck's expressions) depends on our attitude. In calling it a
dynamical phenomenon we fix attention on the regular going
that can be secured by a comparatively weak spring, which overcomes the small disturbances by heat motion, so that we
may disregard them. But if we remember that without a
spring the clock is gradually slowed down by friction, we find
that this process can only be understood as a statistical
phenomenon.

However insignificant the frictional and heating effects in a
clock may be from the practical point of view, there can be no
doubt that the second attitude, which does not neglect them,
is the more fundamental one, even when we are faced with the
regular motion of a clock that is driven by a spring. For it
must not be believed that the driving mechanism really does
away with the statistical nature of the process. The true
physical picture includes the possibility that even a regularly
going clock should all at once invert its motion and, working
backward, rewind its own spring - at the expense of the heat
of the environment. The event is just 'still a little less likely'
than a 'Brownian fit' of a clock without driving mechanism.
