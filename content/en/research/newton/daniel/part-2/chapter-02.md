The Apocalypse of John is written in the same style and language with the Prophecies of Daniel.

It has the same relation to them which they have to one another, so that all of them together make but one complete Prophecy.

It also consists of 2 parts:

1. An introductory Prophecy
2. An Interpretation of it.

The Prophecy has 7 successive parts according to the opening of the seven seals of the book which Daniel was commanded to seal up.

Hence, it is called the Apocalypse or Revelation of Jesus Christ. 

The time of the seventh seal is sub-divided into eight successive parts by the silence in heaven for half an hour, and the sounding of seven trumpets successively: 

The seventh trumpet sounds to the battle of the great day of God Almighty, whereby the kingdoms of this world become the kingdoms of the Lord and of his Christ, and those are destroyed that destroyed the earth.

The Interpretation begins with the words, And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the Ark of his Testament: and it continues to the end of the Prophecy. 

The Temple is the scene of the visions, and the visions in the Temple relate to the feast of the seventh month: for the feasts of the Jews were typical of things to come. 

The Passover related to the first coming of Christ, and the feasts of the seventh month to his second coming: his first coming being therefore over before this Prophecy was given, the feasts of the seventh month are here only alluded unto.

On the first day of that month, in the morning, the High-Priest dressed the lamps: and in allusion hereunto, this Prophecy begins with a vision of one like the Son of man in the High-Priest's habit, appearing as it were in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, or over against the midst of them, dressing the lamps, which appeared like a rod of seven stars in his right hand: and this dressing was perform'd by the sending seven Epistles to the Angels or Bishops of the seven Churches of Asia, which in the primitive times illuminated the Temple or Church Catholic. 

These Epistles contain admonitions against the approaching Apostacy, and therefore relate to the times when the Apostacy began to work strongly, and before it prevailed. It began to work in the Apostles days, and was to continue working till the man of sin should be revealed. 

It began to work in the disciples of Simon, Menander, Carpocrates, Cerinthas, and such sorts of men as had imbibed the metaphysical philosophy of the Gentiles and Cabalistical Jews, and were thence called Gnosticks. 

John calls them Antichrists, saying that in his days there were many Antichrists. But these being condemned by the Apostles, and their immediate disciples, put the Churches in no danger during the opening of the first four seals. 

The visions at the opening of these seals relate only to the civil affairs of the heathen Roman Empire. So long the Apostolic traditions prevailed, and preserved the Church in its purity: and therefore the affairs of the Church do not begin to be considered in this Prophecy before the opening of the fifth seal. 

She began then to decline, and to want admonitions; and therefore is admonished by these Epistles, till the Apostacy prevailed and took place, which was at the opening of the seventh seal. The admonitions therefore in these seven Epistles relate to the state of the Church in the times of the fifth and sixth seals. At the opening of the fifth seal, the Church is purged from hypocrites by a great persecution.

At the opening of the sixth, that which letted is taken out of the way, namely the heathen Roman Empire. At the opening of the seventh, the man of sin is revealed. And to these times the seven Epistles relate.

The seven Angels, to whom these Epistles were written, answer to the seven Amarc-holim, who were Priests and chief Officers of the Temple, and had jointly the keys of the gates of the Temple, with those of the Treasuries, and the direction, appointment and oversight of all things in the Temple.

After the lamps were dresed, John saw the door of the Temple opened; and by the voice as it were of a trumpet, was called up to the eastern gate of the great court, to see the visions: and behold a throne was set, viz. the mercy-seat upon the Ark of the Testament, which the Jews respected as the throne of God between the Cherubims, Exod. xxv. 2. Psal. xcix. 1. 

And he that sat on it was to look upon like Jasper and Sardine stone, that is, of an olive colour, the people of Judea being of that colour. 

The Sun being then in the East, a rainbow was about the throne, the emblem of glory. And round about the throne were four and twenty seats; answering to the chambers of the four and twenty Princes of the Priests, 12 on the south side, and 12 on the north side of the Priests Court. 

On the seats were four and twenty Elders sitting, clothed in white rayment, with crowns on their heads; representing the Princes of the four and twenty courses of the Priests clothed in linen. And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings, and voices, viz. the flashes of the fire upon the Altar at the morning-sacrifice, and the thundering voices of those that sounded the trumpets, and sung at the Eastern gate of the Priests Court; for these being between John and the throne appeared to him as proceeding from the throne. 

There were seven lamps of fire burning, in the Temple, before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God, or Angels of the seven Churches, represented in the beginning of this Prophecy by seven stars.

Before the throne was a sea of glass clear as chrystal; the brazen sea between the porch of the Temple and the Altar, filled with clear water. 

In the midst of the throne, and round about the throne, were 4 Beasts full of eyes before and behind.

One Beast before the throne and one behind it, appearing to John as in the midst of the throne.

One was on either side in the circle about it, to represent by the multitude of their eyes the people standing in the four sides of the peoples court.

The first Beast was like a lion.

The second was like a calf.

The third had the face of a man.

The fourth was like a flying eagle. 

The people of Israel in the wilderness encamped round about the tabernacle.

- On the east side were 3 tribes under the standard of Judah
- On the west were 3 tribes under the standard of Ephraim
- On the south were 3 tribes under the standard of Reuben
- On the north were 3 tribes under the standard of Dan, Numb. ii.

The standard of:
- Judah was a Lion
- Ephraim an Ox
- Reuben a Man
- Dan an Eagle

Whence were framed the hieroglyphicks of Cherubims and Seraphims, to represent the people of Israel. 

A Cherubim had one body with 4 faces, the faces of a Lion, an Ox, a Man and an Eagle.
- These look to the 4 winds of heaven, without turning about, as in Ezekiel's vision, chap. i.

Four Seraphims had the same four faces with four bodies, one face to every body. 

The 4 Beasts are therefore 4 Seraphims standing in the 4 sides of the peoples court:

1. The first in the eastern side with the head of a Lion
2. The second in the western side with the head of an Ox
3. The third in the southern side with the head of a Man
4. The fourth in the northern side with the head of an Eagle

All 4 signify together the 12 tribes of Israel, out of whom the 144,000 were sealed, Apoc. vii. 4.

The 4 Beasts had each of them 6 wings, 2 to a tribe, in all 24 wings, answering to the 24 stations of the people.

They were full of eyes within, or under their wings.

They rest not day and night, or at the morning and evening-sacrifices, saying, holy, holy, holy Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come. 

These animals are therefore the Seraphims, which appeared to Isaiah [1] in a vision like this of the Apocalypse.

For there also the Lord sat upon a throne in the temple; and the Seraphims each with six wings cried, Holy, holy, holy Lord God of hosts.

When those animals give glory and honour and thanks to him that sitteth upon the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, the four and twenty Elders go into the Temple, and there fall down before him that sitteth on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created.

At the morning and evening-sacrifices, so soon as the sacrifice was laid upon the Altar, and the drink-offering began to be poured out, the trumpets sounded, and the Levites sang by course three times.

Every time when the trumpets sounded, the people fell down and worshiped. Three times therefore did the people worship; to express which number, the Beasts cry Holy, holy, holy: and the song being ended, the people prayed standing, till the solemnity was finished. In the mean time the Priests went into the Temple, and there fell down before him that sat upon the throne, and worshiped.
