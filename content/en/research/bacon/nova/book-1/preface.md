<!-- EDITED BY JOSEPH DEVEY, M.A. -->
<!-- TRUE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF NATURE -->


Those who have dogmatized on nature <!-- , as on some well investigated subject, either --> from self-conceit or arrogance <!-- , and in the professorial style, --> have inflicted the greatest injury on philosophy and learning. 
- They have stifled and interrupted inquiry exactly in proportion as they have prevailed in bringing others to their opinion.
- Their own activity has not counterbalanced the mischief they have occasioned by corrupting and destroying that of others. 


On the other hand, those who think on the contrary are not contemptible. 
- These assert that nothing can be known
- They either:
  - hate the ancient sophists 
  - have unsure minds or
  - had an exuberance of learning
- They however, have not derived their opinion from true sources
- Their zeal was excessive

<!-- , and, hurried on by their zeal and some affectation, have certainly exceeded due moderation. But the more --> The ancient Greeks were more prudent, being <!-- b (whose writings have perished), held a more prudent mean, --> between:
- the arrogance of dogmatism, and
- the despair of skepticism

<!-- ; and though too frequently intermingling complaints and indignation[6] at the difficulty of inquiry, and the obscurity of things, and champing, as it were, the bit, have still persisted in pressing their point, and pursuing their intercourse with nature; thinking, as it seems, that the better method was not to dispute upon the very point of the possibility of anything being known, but to put it to the test of experience.  -->

Yet they <!-- themselves, by only employing the power of the understanding, --> have not adopted a fixed rule.
- Instead, they put importance on:
  - <!-- but have laid their whole stress upon --> intense meditation, and
  - a continual exercise and perpetual agitation of the mind.

Our method is difficult, but easily explained. 
- It consists in determining the degrees of certainty, while we restore the senses to their former rank. 
- We reject that operation of the mind which follows near the senses. 
- We open and establish a new course for the mind from the first actual perceptions of the senses themselves. 

This was the view of those who have assigned so much to logic.
- They sought some support for the mind
- They suspected its natural and spontaneous mode of action. 

The mind has come prepossessed with corrupted doctrines in daily life filled with the vainest idols.
- Such a technique of logic can no longer be used, as it came too late. 
<!-- But this is now employed too late as a remedy, when all is clearly lost, and after the mind, by the daily habit and intercourse of life, ha -->

The art of logic therefore does not remedy [7] the matter. 
- It has really just confirmed errors instead of  disclosing the truth.

Our only remaining hope is to begin the whole labor of the mind again. 
- We should not leave it to itself.
- Instead, we direct it perpetually from the very first, and attain our end like by mechanical aid. 

If men had attempted mechanical labors with their hands alone, without the aid of instruments, they would not be able to do much even if they used all their strength. 

<!-- as they have not hesitated to carry on the labors of their understanding with the unaided efforts of their mind, they would have been able to move and overcome but little, though they had exerted their utmost and united powers. -->

It would be madness to move an obelisk with our bare hands.

<!-- And just to pause awhile on this comparison, and look into it as a mirror; let us ask, if any obelisk of a remarkable size were perchance required to be moved, for the purpose of gracing a triumph or any similar pageant, and men were to attempt it with their bare hands, would not any sober spectator avow it to be an act of the greatest madness? -->

<!-- If they should increase the number of workmen, and imagine that they could thus succeed, would he not think so still more? But if they chose to make a selection, and to remove the weak, and only employ the strong and vigorous, thinking by this means, at any rate, to achieve their object, would he not say that they were more fondly deranged? 

If  they were to determine on consulting the athletic art, and were to give orders for all to appear with their hands, arms, and muscles regularly oiled and prepared, would he not exclaim that they were taking pains to rave by method and design?  -->

Yet men go with the same senseless energy in intellectual matters without achieving anything.

<!-- , as long as they expect great results either from the number and agreement, or the excellence and acuteness of their wits; or even[8] strengthen their minds with logic, which may be considered as an athletic preparation, but yet do not desist (if we rightly consider the matter) from applying their own understandings merely with all this zeal and effort. While nothing is more clear, than that in every great work executed by the hand of man without machines or implements, it is impossible for the strength of individuals to be increased, or for that of the multitude to combine. -->

I lay down 2 points on which I admonish mankind:

1. We should  keep our honor and reverence to the ancients untouched and undiminished

 <!-- so that we can perform our intended work, and yet enjoy the benefit of our respectful moderation.  -->

This relates to persons, the next to things.

If we offer something better than the ancients, yet pursue the same course as they did, then we would have rivalries.

 <!-- done, we could never, by any artifice, contrive to avoid the imputation of having engaged in a contest or rivalry as to our respective wits, excellences, or talents; which, though neither inadmissible nor new (for why should we not blame and point out anything that is imperfectly discovered or laid down by them, of our own right, a right common to all?), yet however just and allowable, would perhaps be scarcely an equal match, on account of the disproportion of our strength.  -->

But my present plan opens a course entirely:
- different to the understanding
- unattempted and unknown to the ancients

And so the case is altered. 

Party zeal ends.

I only become a guide.

<!-- , which requires a moderate share of authority and good fortune,[9] rather than talents and excellence.  -->

We make no attempt to disturb the system of philosophy that now prevails, or any other which may or will exist, either more correct or more complete. 

For we deny not that the received system of philosophy, and others of a similar nature, encourage discussion, embellish harangues, are employed, and are of service in the duties of the professor, and the affairs of civil life. 

We openly express and declare that the philosophy we offer will not be very useful in such respects. It is not obvious, nor to be understood in a cursory view, nor does it flatter the mind in its preconceived notions, nor will it descend to the level of the generality of mankind unless by its advantages and effects.

Let there be 2 sources or distributions of learning.

These are like 2 friendly tribes.

1. One cultivates the sciences

This is the interpretation of nature

2. Another discovers them

This is "anticipation of the mind"

<!-- And as for those who prefer and more readily receive the former, on account of their haste or from motives arising from their ordinary life, or because they are unable from weakness of mind to comprehend and embrace the other (which must necessarily be the case with by far the greater number), let us wish that they may prosper as they desire in their undertaking, and attain what they pursue. 

But if any individual desire, and is anxious not merely to adhere to, and make use of present discoveries, but to penetrate still further, and not to overcome his adversaries in disputes, but nature by labor, not in short to give elegant[10] and specious opinions, but to know to a certainty and demonstration, let him, as a true son of science (if such be his wish), join with us; that when he has left the antechambers of nature trodden by the multitude, an entrance may at last be discovered to her inner apartments. -->


I had taken pains to render my propositions:
- true
- easily understandable

Yet it is but just that we should obtain this favor from mankind (especially in so great a restoration of learning and the sciences), that whoever wants to comment on my work should follow a course I set describe and maintain.

 <!-- will be accustomed to the subtilty of things which is manifested by experience; and will correct the depraved and deeply rooted habits of his mind by a seasonable, and, as it were, just hesitation: and then, finally (if he will), use his judgment when he has begun to be master of himself. -->

<!-- FOOTNOTE
[1] Because it was idle to draw a logical conclusion from false principles, error being propagated as much by false premises, which logic does not pretend to examine, as by illegitimate inference. Hence, as Bacon says further on, men being easily led to confound legitimate inference with truth, were confirmed in their errors by the very subtilty of their genius.—Ed.
