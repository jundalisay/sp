### Malebranche’s theory, refuted by experience

Wallis was the first to believe that the long interposition of land, and even of clouds, makes the sun and the moon appear larger at the horizon than at the meridian. 

Malebranche reinforced this opinion which Régis disputed.

Régis attributed it to **refractions** occurring in the vapors of the earth.

He was mistaken, because refractions actually produce the **opposite** effect of what Régis attributed to them. 

But Father Malebranche was no less mistaken in maintaining that the imagination, struck by the long stretch of land and clouds at our horizon, represents the same star as larger at the end of these lands and clouds than when, having reached its highest point, it is seen without any interposition.

The simplest experiments refute Malebranche’s theory. 

A few years ago, I examined this phenomenon directly.

I had cardboard tubes made, 7-8 feet long and half a foot in diameter. 

I had children look at the sun on the horizon through these tubes — children whose imagination was not at all accustomed to judge the size of the sun by the expanse appearing between the star and their eyes. 

They did not even see either the ground or the clouds. The tube left them only the view of the sun, and all saw it — as I did — much **larger** than at noon.

This experiment and several others led me to imagine another cause.

I had already begun, unfortunately, to form a “system,” when I cane upon the **mathematical solution** by Mr. Smith and spared me the errors of a hypothesis.

First, we must establish that, according to the rules of optics, the sky **must appear to us as a flattened vault**. 

Here is a simple proof.

Our sight extends distinctly only to the point where objects form in our eye an angle of at least **one eight-thousandth of an inch**, according to Hooke’s observations.

A man **OP** (figure 20) five feet tall looks at object **AB**, also five feet tall and 25,000 feet away: he sees it under angle **AB**; but since this angle **AB** is not within the one eight-thousandth of an inch threshold in his eye, he does not see it distinctly.

If he looks at object **C**, the angle is even smaller; he sees it as if this object were in **AD**; thus everything behind **C** becomes even less distinct.

The houses and clouds behind **C** must appear to skim the horizon near **G**; therefore, **all clouds sink** for us toward the horizon at the distance of 25,000 feet — that is, about a league and two-thirds of 3,000 paces — and they sink **gradually**.

Consequently, all clouds that rise to **G** (figure 21), about three-quarters of a league high, must appear to skim our horizon.

Thus, instead of seeing the clouds at **G** as high as the cloud **N**, we see the clouds at **G** touch the earth, and the cloud **N** rise about three-quarters of a league above our head.

We therefore should see the sky neither as a ceiling nor as a circular arch, but as a **flattened dome**, whose large diameter **BB** is about six times larger than its small one **AD**.


We therefore see the sky in this manner **BAB**; and when the sun or moon are at **B** on the horizon, they appear **farther away** (to us who are at **D**) by about one-third more than when these stars are at **A**.

Now, we must see them under the angles that come to our eyes from **B** and **A**; it remains to examine those angles (figure 22).

At first it might seem that these angles should be **smaller** when the object is farther away, and **larger** when it is closer; but here the opposite is true.

The **real star**, the tangible star, moves in **BDRE**; but the **apparent star** follows the curve **BAGG**.

Now, the **angles** are formed by the **apparent object**.

Draw, therefore, lines of sight from the eye at **P** to the real positions of the star **D** — these lines necessarily graze the apparent positions of the stars.

You see, for example, that the angle is considerably **larger** at the horizon at **G**, and becomes quite **small** at **C**; the difference is greater at the meridian.

The star at the **meridian** has its disk like **3**, and at the **horizon** roughly like **9**; because the diameters of the star are proportional to its apparent distances:

* the **apparent distance** of the star is about 9 at the horizon, and 3 at the meridian — so is its **apparent size**.



This truth is confirmed by another experiment of a similar kind: look at two stars actually **one-tenth of a degree** apart; they appear **much farther apart** at the horizon, and **much closer** toward the meridian.

These two stars, always equally distant, are seen under angle **FCD** toward the horizon (figure 23), which is much **larger** than angle **FAB** at the meridian: you see that this apparent difference comes precisely from the same reason I have just reported.

Thus, according to this rule and to the observations that confirm it, here are the proportions of the **apparent sizes** and **distances** of the sun and the moon:

- At the **horizon**, these stars are seen as size **100**
- At **15 degrees** above, size **68**;
- At **30 degrees**, size **50**;
- At **90 degrees**, size **30**.

Similarly, two stars that always maintain between them their true distance appear at the horizon as separated by **100**, and at the meridian as **30** — which, as you see, is always the proportion of about **9 to 3**.

This theory is confirmed by another observation. The **moon** appears considerably larger at certain times of the year than at others.

The **sun** also appears larger in **winter** than in summer; and the differences in this apparent size, being more noticeable toward the horizon than at the meridian, are more easily perceived.

The reason for this increase in size is that when the diameters of the moon and sun **appear larger**, these stars are indeed **closer** to us: the sun is closer to the earth in **winter** than in summer by about **1.2 million leagues**; thus in winter it appears larger — but the width of its disk is somewhat diminished by the **refractions** of thick winter air.

The moon, in summer, is in its **perigee**; thus it appears under a larger diameter, and the width of its disk at the horizon is less diminished in summer than in winter, because the air, in summer, is finer and thinner.


This phenomenon, therefore, belongs entirely to **geometry** and **optics**.

Dr. Smith has found the **solution** to a problem on which the greatest minds had built useless systems.
