CHAPTER V. Natural Religion.

Leibniz’s unjust reproach of Newton. Refutation of a notion of Locke. The good of society. Natural religion. Humanity.

Leibniz, in his dispute with Newton, reproached him for giving God very lowly ideas and for annihilating natural religion.

He claimed that Newton made God corporeal, and this accusation, as we have seen, was founded on the phrase sensorium organum. He added that Newton’s God had made this world into a very poor machine which needed to be “scoured” (this is the very word Leibniz used). Newton had said: Manum emendatricem desideraret (“it would require the correcting hand”).

This reproach stems from Newton saying that, over time, motions would diminish, the irregularities of the planets would increase, and the universe would either perish or be restored by its author.

It is quite clear from experience that God has made machines destined to be destroyed. We are the work of His wisdom, and we perish; why should it not be the same with the world? Leibniz wants this world to be perfect; but if God only formed it to last for a certain time, then its perfection consists in lasting only until the moment fixed for its dissolution.

As for natural religion, no man was ever a greater partisan of it than Newton, except perhaps Leibniz himself, his rival in science and in virtue. I mean by natural religion the principles of morality common to humankind. Newton, in truth, admitted no innate notions within us—neither ideas, nor feelings, nor principles. He was persuaded, with Locke, that all ideas come to us through the senses as the senses develop; but he believed that since God gave the same senses to all men, the same needs and the same feelings result in them, and therefore the same rough notions which everywhere form the foundation of society.

It is certain that God has given bees and ants something to make them live in community, which He has not given to wolves or hawks; it is likewise certain, since all men live in society, that there is in their being a secret bond by which God willed to attach them to one another. Now, if, at a certain age, the ideas coming through the same senses to men all organized in the same manner did not gradually give them the same principles necessary to all society, it is also very certain that these societies would not subsist. That is why, from Siam to Mexico, truth, gratitude, friendship, etc., are honored.

I have always been surprised that the wise Locke, at the beginning of his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, while so well refuting innate ideas, nevertheless claimed that there is no notion of good and evil that is common to all men. I think he fell into an error there.

He based this on the reports of travelers, who say that in certain countries the custom is to eat the children, and also to eat the mothers when they can no longer bear children; that in others they honor, under the name of saints, certain fanatics who use she-asses in place of women. But should not a man like the wise Locke have considered these travelers suspect? Nothing is so common among them as to see badly, to report badly what they have seen, to take, especially in a nation whose language they do not know, the abuse of a law for the law itself, and finally to judge the customs of an entire people by a particular fact of which they still ignore the circumstances.

Let a Persian come to Lisbon, Madrid, or Goa on the day of an auto-da-fé; he will believe, not without apparent reason, that Christians sacrifice men to God. If he reads the almanacs that are sold throughout Europe to the common people, he will think that we all believe in the effects of the moon; and yet we laugh at them instead of believing in them.

Likewise, every traveler who tells me, for example, that savages eat their father and mother out of pity must allow me to respond that, first of all, the fact is very doubtful; secondly, if it is true, far from destroying the idea of the respect owed to one’s parents, it is probably a barbarous way of showing tenderness, a horrible abuse of the natural law: for apparently one only kills one’s father and mother out of a sense of duty, to deliver them either from the inconveniences of old age or from the rage of the enemy; and if one then gives them a tomb in a child’s bosom, instead of leaving them to be eaten by the victors, this custom—however appalling it is to the imagination—must nevertheless come necessarily from a certain goodness of heart.

Natural religion is nothing but this law known throughout the universe: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Now the barbarian who kills his father to save him from his enemy, and who buries him in his own breast for fear that he will have his enemy for a tomb, wishes that his own son would treat him the same in a similar case.

This law of treating one’s neighbor as oneself flows naturally from the roughest notions and is heard, sooner or later, in the heart of all men: for, all having the same reason, the fruits of this tree must eventually resemble each other; and they do in fact resemble each other, in that in every society one calls “virtue” that which one believes useful to society.

Let anyone find me a country, a company of ten people on the earth, where that which is useful to the common good is not esteemed—and then I will admit that there is no natural rule. This rule certainly varies infinitely; but what can one conclude from that, except that it exists? Matter everywhere takes on different forms, but everywhere retains its nature.

They tell us, for example, that at Lacedaemon (Sparta) theft was ordered: this is nothing but an abuse of words. The very thing we call theft was not commanded in Lacedaemon; but in a city where everything was common, the permission granted to take skillfully what individuals appropriated against the law was a way of punishing the spirit of private ownership, forbidden among those people. Mine and thine was a crime, for which what we call theft was the punishment; and among them and among us there was still the same rule for which God made us, as He made ants to live together.

Newton therefore thought that this disposition which we all have to live in society is the foundation of the natural law, which Christianity perfects.

There is above all in man a disposition to compassion as generally widespread as our other instincts: Newton cultivated this sentiment of humanity, and he extended it even to animals. He was strongly convinced, with Locke, that God gave to animals (which seem to be only matter) a measure of ideas and the same feelings as to us. He could not think that God, who makes nothing in vain, had given animals organs of sensation so that they would have no sensation.

He found it a most dreadful contradiction to believe that animals feel, and yet to make them suffer. His morality was in accord at this point with his philosophy: he yielded only with repugnance to the barbarous custom of nourishing ourselves with the blood and flesh of beings similar to us, whom we caress every day; and he never allowed in his household that they should be killed by slow and contrived deaths to make the food more delicate.

This compassion which he had for animals turned into true charity for men. In fact, without humanity—a virtue which comprises all the virtues—one would hardly deserve the name of philosopher.
