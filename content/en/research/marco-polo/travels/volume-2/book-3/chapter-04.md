The Idols of Cathay, and of Manzi, and of this Island, are all of the same class.

There are some Idols that have the head of an ox, some that have the head of a pig, some of a dog, some of a sheep, and some of divers other kinds.

Some of them have four heads, whilst some have three, one growing out of either shoulder. There are also some that have four hands, some ten, some a thousand!

They do put more faith in those Idols that have a thousand hands than in any of the others.{1} 

When any Christian asks them why they make their Idols in so many different guises, and not all alike, they reply that just so their forefathers were wont to have them made, and just so they will leave them to their children, and these to the after generations. 

And so they will be handed down for ever. And you must understand that the deeds ascribed264 to these Idols are such a parcel of devilries as it is best not to tell. So let us have done with the Idols, and speak of other things.

If the natives take prisoner an enemy who cannot pay a ransom, he who hath the prisoner summons all his friends and relations, and they put the prisoner to death, and then they cook him and eat him, and they say there is no meat in the world so good!—But now we will have done with that Island and speak of something else.

You must know the Sea in which lie the Islands of those parts is called the Sea of Chin, which is as much as to say “The Sea over against Manzi.” 

For, in the language of those Isles, when they say Chin, ’tis Manzi they mean. And I tell you with regard to that Eastern Sea of Chin, according to what is said by the experienced pilots and mariners of those parts, there be 7459 Islands in the waters frequented by the said mariners; and that is how they know the fact, for their whole life is spent in navigating that sea.

There is not one of those Islands but produces valuable and odorous woods like the lignaloe, aye and better too.

They also produce a great variety of spices. 

For example in those Islands grows pepper as white as snow, as well as the black in great quantities. 

In fact, the riches of those Islands is in gold, precious stones, or spicery.

But they lie so far off from the main land that it is hard to get to them.

When the ships of Zayton and Kinsay go there they make vast profits by their venture.{2}

It takes them a whole year for the voyage, going in winter and returning in summer. 

For in that Sea there are but 2 winds that blow:
- one that carries them soutward
- the other that brings them homeward.

The one of these winds blows all the winter, and the other all the summer.

These regions are so far from India that it takes a long time also for the voyage thence.

That Sea is called the Sea of Chin. Yet it is part of the Ocean Sea all the same.

But just as in these parts people talk of the Sea of England and the Sea of Rochelle, so in those countries they speak of the Sea of Chin and the Sea of India, and so on, though they all are but parts of the Ocean.{3}

<!-- Now let us have done with that region which is very inaccessible and out of the way. Moreover,  -->

Marco Polo never was there.

The Great Kaan has nothing to do with them, nor do they render him any tribute or service.

<!-- So let us go back to Zayton and take up the order of our book from that point.{4} -->


## CHAPTER 5. The Great Country called Chamba

On leaving the port of Zayton you sail west-south-west for 1500 miles to a country called Chamba,{1} a very rich region, having a king of its own.

The people are Idolaters and pay a yearly tribute to the Great Khan, which consists only of elephants.

In 1278, the Great Kaan sent his Baron called Sagatu with a great force of horse and foot against this King of Chamba

King Accambale was a very aged man, nor had he such a force as the Baron had.

When he saw what havoc the Baron was making with his kingdom he was grieved to the heart. So he bade messengers get ready and despatched them to the Great Kaan. 

They said to the Kaan: 

{{< q >}}
The King of Chamba salutes you as his liege-lord. He is stricken in years and long hath held his realm in peace. He is willing to be your liegeman, and will send you every year a tribute of as many elephants as you please. He prays you in all gentleness and humility that you would send word to your Baron to desist from harrying his kingdom and to quit his territories. These shall henceforth be at your absolute disposal, and the King shall hold them of you.
{{< /q >}}


When the Great Kaan had heard the King’s ambassage he was moved with pity. He sent word to that Baron of his to quit that kingdom with his army, and to carry his arms to the conquest of some other country.

As soon as this command reached them they obeyed it. Thus it was then that this King became vassal of the Great Kaan, and paid him every year a tribute of 20 of the greatest and finest elephants that were to be found in the country.

But now we will leave that matter, and tell you other particulars about the King of Chamba.

In that kingdom no woman is allowed to marry until the King has seen her.

If the woman pleases him then he takes her to wife; if she does not, he gives her a dowry to get her a husband withal.

In 1285, Marco Polo was in that country. At that time the King had, between sons and daughters, 326 children, of whom at least 150 were men fit to carry arms.{2}

There are many elephants in this kingdom. They have lignaloes in great abundance. 

They have also extensive forests of the wood called Bonús, which is jet-black, and of which chessmen and pen-cases are made.

 <!-- But there is nought more to tell, so let us proceed.{3} -->
