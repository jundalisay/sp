## CHAPTER 36. The Province of Aden

In the province of Aden, the Prince is called the Soldan [Sultan].

The people are all Saracens and adorers of Mahommet, and have a great hatred of Christians. There are many towns and villages in the country.

This Aden is the port to which many of the ships of India come with their cargoes; and from this haven the merchants carry the goods a distance of seven days further in small vessels. 

At the end of those seven days they land the goods and load them on camels, and so carry them a land journey of 30 days. 

This brings them to the river of Alexandria, and by it they descend to the latter city. It is by this way through Aden that the Saracens of Alexandria receive all their stores of pepper and other spicery; and there is no other route equally good and convenient by which these goods could reach that place.

The Soldan of Aden receives a large amount in duties from the ships that traffic between India and his country, importing different kinds of goods.

From the exports also he gets a revenue, for there are despatched from the port of Aden to India a very large number of Arab chargers, and palfreys, and stout nags adapted for all work, which are a source of great profit to those who export them.

For horses fetch very high prices in India, there being none bred there, as I have told you before; insomuch that a charger will sell there for 100 marks of silver and more. 

On these also the Soldan of Aden receives heavy payments in port charges, so that ’tis said he is one of the richest princes in the world.

When the Soldan of Babylon went against the city of Acre and took it, this Soldan of Aden sent to his assistance 30,000 horsemen and full 40,000 camels, to the great help of the Saracens and the grievous injury of the Christians. 

He did this a great deal more for the hate he bears the Christians than for any love he bears the Soldan of Babylon; for these two do hate one another heartily.{4}

Now we will have done with the Soldan of Aden, and I will tell you of a city which is subject to Aden, called Esher.


## CHAPTER 37. The City of Esher.

Esher is a great city lying in a north-westerly direction from the last, and 400 miles distant from the Port of Aden. It has a king, who is subject to the Soldan of Aden. He has a number of towns and villages under him, and administers his territory well and justly.

The people are Saracens. The place has a very good haven, wherefore many ships from India come thither with various cargoes; and they export many good chargers thence to India.

A great deal of white incense grows in this country, and brings in a great revenue to the Prince.

No one dares sell it to anyone else. He buys it from the people at 10 livres of gold for the hundredweight, and sells it to the merchants at 60 livres, so his profit is immense.

Dates also grow very abundantly here. 

The people have no corn but rice, and very little of that; but plenty is brought from abroad, for it sells here at a good profit. 

They have fish in great profusion, and notably plenty of tunny of large size; so plentiful indeed that you may buy two big ones for a Venice groat of silver. 

The natives live on meat and rice and fish. They have no wine of the vine, but they make good wine from sugar, from rice, and from dates also.

Their sheep have no ears, but where the ear ought to be they have a little horn! They are pretty little beasts.

All their cattle, including horses, oxen, and camels, live on small fish and nought besides, for ’tis all they get to eat.

There is no grass or forage of any kind. It is the driest country on earth.

The fish which are given to the cattle are very small, and during March, April, and May, are caught in such quantities as would astonish you. They are then dried and stored, and the beasts are fed on them from year’s end to year’s end. The cattle will also readily eat these fish all alive and just out of the water.

The people here have likewise many other kinds of fish of large size and good quality, exceedingly cheap; these they cut in pieces of about a pound each, and dry them in the sun, and then store them, and eat them all the year through, like so much biscuit.{5}



### CHAPTER 38. The City of Dufar

Dufar is a great and noble and fine city, and lies 500 miles to the north-west of Esher.

The people are Saracens, and have a Count for their chief, who is subject to the Soldan of Aden.

This city still belongs to the Province of Aden.

It stands upon the sea and has a very good haven, so that there is a great traffic of shipping between this and India; and the merchants take hence great numbers of Arab horses to that market, making great profits thereby. This city has under it many other towns and villages.

Much445 white incense is produced here, and I will tell you how it grows. The trees are like small fir-trees; these are notched with a knife in several places, and from these notches the incense is exuded. Sometimes also it flows from the tree without any notch; this is by reason of the great heat of the sun there.{2}



## CHAPTER 39. The Gulf and City of Calatu

Calatu is a great city, within a gulf which bears the name of the Gulf of Calatu.

It is a noble city, and lies 600 miles from Dufar towards the north-west, upon the sea-shore. 

The people are Saracens, and are subject to Hormos. 

Whenever the Melic of Hormos is at war with some prince more potent than himself, he betakes himself to this city of Calatu, because it is very strong, both from its position and its fortifications.

They grow no corn here, but get it from abroad.

Every merchant-vessel that comes brings some. 

The haven is very large and good, and is frequented by numerous ships with goods from India, and from this city the spices and other merchandize are distributed among the cities and towns of the interior. They also export many good Arab horses from this to India.

The number of horses exported from this and the other cities to India yearly is something astonishing. 

One reason is that no horses are bred there, and another that they die as soon as they get there, through ignorant handling; 

For the people there do not know how to take care of them, and they feed their horses with cooked victuals and all sorts of trash, as I have told you fully heretofore; and besides all that they have no farriers.

This City of Calatu stands at the mouth of the Gulf, so that no ship can enter or go forth without the will of the chief. 

When the Melic of Hormos, who is Melic of Calatu also, and is vassal to the Soldan of Kerman, fears anything at the hand of the latter, he gets on board his ships and comes from Hormos to Calatu. 

And then he prevents any ship from entering the Gulf. This causes great injury to the Soldan of Kerman; for he thus loses all the duties that he is wont to receive from merchants frequenting his territories from India or elsewhere; 

For ships with cargoes of merchandize come in great numbers, and a very large revenue is derived from them. In this way he is constrained to give way to the demands of the Melic of Hormos.

This Melic has also a castle which is still stronger than the city, and has a better command of the entry to the Gulf.{3}

The people of this country live on dates and salt fish, which they have in great abundance; the nobles, however, have better fare.



## CHAPTER 40. The City of Hormos

When you leave the City of Calatu, and go for 300 miles between north-west and north, you come to the city of Hormos.

It is a great and noble city on the sea.

It has a Melic, which is as much as to say a King, and he is under the Soldan of Kerman.

There are a good many cities and towns belonging to Hormos, and the people are Saracens. 

The heat is tremendous. This is why their houses are built with ventilators to catch the wind.

These ventilators are placed on the side from which the wind comes, and they bring the wind down into the house to cool it. But for this the heat would be utterly unbearable.

<!-- I have already told you all about this city and Kerman. -->

When you leave the City of Calatu and go between west and north-west, a distance of 500 miles, you come to the city of Kis.
