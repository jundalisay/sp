I did not start either from the object or the subject.

I started from the idea which contains and presupposes them both.

For the antithesis of object and subject is its primary, universal and essential form. 

I have therefore first considered this form as such.

Then (though in this respect reference has for the most part been made to the introductory essay) the subordinate forms
of time, space and causality. 

The latter belong exclusively to the object, and yet, as they are essential to the object as such, and as
the object again is essential to the subject as such, they may be
discovered from the subject, i.e., they may be known a priori,
and so far they are to be regarded as the common limits of both.
But all these forms may be referred to one general expression,
the principle of sufficient reason, as we have explained in the
introductory essay.


This procedure distinguishes our philosophical method from
that of all former systems. For they all start either from the
object or from the subject, and therefore seek to explain the one
from the other, and this according to the principle of sufficient
reason. 

We, on the contrary, deny the validity of this principle
with reference to the relation of subject and object, and confine
it to the object. It may be thought that the philosophy of identity,
which has appeared and become generally known in our own
day, does not come under either of the alternatives we have
named, for it does not start either from the subject or from
the object, but from the absolute, known through “intellectual
intuition,” which is neither object nor subject, but the identity of
the two. I will not venture to speak of this revered identity, and
this absolute, for I find myself entirely devoid of all “intellectual
intuition.” But as I take my stand merely on those manifestoes of
the “intellectual intuiter” which are open to all, even to profane
persons like myself, I must yet observe that this philosophy is
not to be excepted from the alternative errors mentioned above.
For it does not escape these two opposite errors in spite of its [033]
identity of subject and object, which is not thinkable, but only
“intellectually intuitable,” or to be experienced by a losing of
oneself in it. On the contrary, it combines them both in itself;

for it is divided into two parts, firstly, transcendental idealism,
which is just Fichte's doctrine of the ego, and therefore teaches
that the object is produced by the subject, or evolved out of it in
accordance with the principle of sufficient reason; secondly, the
philosophy of nature, which teaches that the subject is produced
little by little from the object, by means of a method called
construction, about which I understand very little, yet enough
to know that it is a process according to various forms of the
principle of sufficient reason. The deep wisdom itself which
that construction contains, I renounce; for as I entirely lack
“intellectual intuition,” all those expositions which presuppose it
must for me remain as a book sealed with seven seals. This is
so truly the case that, strange to say, I have always been unable
to find anything at all in this doctrine of profound wisdom but
atrocious and wearisome bombast.
The systems starting from the object had always the whole
world of perception and its constitution as their problem; yet the
object which they take as their starting-point is not always this
whole world of perception, nor its fundamental element, matter.
On the contrary, a division of these systems may be made, based
on the four classes of possible objects set forth in the introductory
essay. Thus Thales and the Ionic school, Democritus, Epicurus,
Giordano Bruno, and the French materialists, may be said to have
started from the first class of objects, the real world: Spinoza (on
account of his conception of substance, which is purely abstract,
and exists only in his definition) and, earlier, the Eleatics, from
the second class, the abstract conception: the Pythagoreans and
Chinese philosophy in Y-King, from the third class, time, and
consequently number: and, lastly, the schoolmen, who teach a[034]
creation out of nothing by the act of will of an extra-mundane
personal being, started from the fourth class of objects, the act of
will directed by knowledge.
Of all systems of philosophy which start from the object,
the most consistent, and that which may be carried furthest,
55
is simple materialism. It regards matter, and with it time and
space, as existing absolutely, and ignores the relation to the
subject in which alone all this really exists. It then lays hold
of the law of causality as a guiding principle or clue, regarding
it as a self-existent order (or arrangement) of things, veritas
aeterna, and so fails to take account of the understanding, in
which and for which alone causality is. It seeks the primary
and most simple state of matter, and then tries to develop all the
others from it; ascending from mere mechanism, to chemism,
to polarity, to the vegetable and to the animal kingdom. And
if we suppose this to have been done, the last link in the chain
would be animal sensibility—that is knowledge—which would
consequently now appear as a mere modification or state of matter
produced by causality. Now if we had followed materialism thus
far with clear ideas, when we reached its highest point we would
suddenly be seized with a fit of the inextinguishable laughter
of the Olympians. As if waking from a dream, we would all
at once become aware that its final result—knowledge, which
it reached so laboriously, was presupposed as the indispensable
condition of its very starting-point, mere matter; and when we
imagined that we thought matter, we really thought only the
subject that perceives matter; the eye that sees it, the hand that
feels it, the understanding that knows it. Thus the tremendous
petitio principii reveals itself unexpectedly; for suddenly the last
link is seen to be the starting-point, the chain a circle, and the
materialist is like Baron Münchausen who, when swimming in
water on horseback, drew the horse into the air with his legs,
and himself also by his cue. The fundamental absurdity of [035]
materialism is that it starts from the objective, and takes as the
ultimate ground of explanation something objective, whether it
be matter in the abstract, simply as it is thought, or after it has
taken form, is empirically given—that is to say, is substance, the
chemical element with its primary relations. Some such thing
it takes, as existing absolutely and in itself, in order that it may evolve organic nature and finally the knowing subject from it,
and explain them adequately by means of it; whereas in truth
all that is objective is already determined as such in manifold
ways by the knowing subject through its forms of knowing, and
presupposes them; and consequently it entirely disappears if we
think the subject away. Thus materialism is the attempt to explain
what is immediately given us by what is given us indirectly. All
that is objective, extended, active—that is to say, all that is
material—is regarded by materialism as affording so solid a
basis for its explanation, that a reduction of everything to this
can leave nothing to be desired (especially if in ultimate analysis
this reduction should resolve itself into action and reaction).
But we have shown that all this is given indirectly and in the
highest degree determined, and is therefore merely a relatively
present object, for it has passed through the machinery and
manufactory of the brain, and has thus come under the forms of
space, time and causality, by means of which it is first presented
to us as extended in space and ever active in time. From such
an indirectly given object, materialism seeks to explain what
is immediately given, the idea (in which alone the object that
materialism starts with exists), and finally even the will from
which all those fundamental forces, that manifest themselves,
under the guidance of causes, and therefore according to law,
are in truth to be explained. To the assertion that thought is a
modification of matter we may always, with equal right, oppose
the contrary assertion that all matter is merely the modification[036]
of the knowing subject, as its idea. Yet the aim and ideal of
all natural science is at bottom a consistent materialism. The
recognition here of the obvious impossibility of such a system
establishes another truth which will appear in the course of our
exposition, the truth that all science properly so called, by which
I understand systematic knowledge under the guidance of the
principle of sufficient reason, can never reach its final goal, nor
give a complete and adequate explanation: for it is not concerned

with the inmost nature of the world, it cannot get beyond the
idea; indeed, it really teaches nothing more than the relation of
one idea to another.

Every science must start from two principal data. One of
these is always the principle of sufficient reason in some form or
another, as organon; the other is its special object as problem.
Thus, for example, geometry has space as problem, and the
ground of existence in space as organon. Arithmetic has time as
problem, and the ground of existence in time as organon. Logic
has the combination of concepts as such as problem, and the
ground of knowledge as organon. History has the past acts of
men treated as a whole as problem, and the law of human motives
as organon. Natural science has matter as problem, and the law of
causality as organon. Its end and aim is therefore, by the guidance
of causality, to refer all possible states of matter to other states,
and ultimately to one single state; and again to deduce these states
from each other, and ultimately from one single state. Thus two
states of matter stand over against each other in natural science
as extremes: that state in which matter is furthest from being the
immediate object of the subject, and that state in which it is most
completely such an immediate object, i.e., the most dead and
crude matter, the primary element, as the one extreme, and the
human organism as the other. Natural science as chemistry seeks
for the first, as physiology for the second. But as yet neither [037]
extreme has been reached, and it is only in the intermediate
ground that something has been won. The prospect is indeed
somewhat hopeless. The chemists, under the presupposition that
the qualitative division of matter is not, like quantitative division,
an endless process, are always trying to decrease the number of
the elements, of which there are still about sixty; and if they
were to succeed in reducing them to two, they would still try to
find the common root of these. For, on the one hand, the law of
homogeneity leads to the assumption of a primary chemical state
of matter, which alone belongs to matter as such, and precedes
58 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
all others which are not essentially matter as such, but merely
contingent forms and qualities. On the other hand, we cannot
understand how this one state could ever experience a chemical
change, if there did not exist a second state to affect it. Thus the
same difficulty appears in chemistry which Epicurus met with in
mechanics. For he had to show how the first atom departed from
the original direction of its motion. Indeed this contradiction,
which develops entirely of itself and can neither be escaped nor
solved, might quite properly be set up as a chemical antinomy.
Thus an antinomy appears in the one extreme of natural science,
and a corresponding one will appear in the other. There is just as
little hope of reaching this opposite extreme of natural science,
for we see ever more clearly that what is chemical can never be
referred to what is mechanical, nor what is organic to what is
chemical or electrical. 

Those who in our own day are entering
anew on this old, misleading path, will soon slink back silent and
ashamed, as all their predecessors have done before them. We
shall consider this more fully in the second book. Natural science
encounters the difficulties which we have cursorily mentioned,
in its own province. Regarded as philosophy, it would further
be materialism; but this, as we have seen, even at its birth, has
death in its heart, because it ignores the subject and the forms of[038]
knowledge, which are presupposed, just as much in the case of
the crudest matter, from which it desires to start, as in that of the
organism, at which it desires to arrive. For, “no object without a
subject,” is the principle which renders all materialism for ever
impossible. Suns and planets without an eye that sees them, and
an understanding that knows them, may indeed be spoken of in
words, but for the idea, these words are absolutely meaningless.
On the other hand, the law of causality and the treatment and
investigation of nature which is based upon it, lead us necessarily
to the conclusion that, in time, each more highly organised state
of matter has succeeded a cruder state: so that the lower animals
existed before men, fishes before land animals, plants before fishes, and the unorganised before all that is organised; that,
consequently, the original mass had to pass through a long series
of changes before the first eye could be opened. And yet, the
existence of this whole world remains ever dependent upon the
first eye that opened, even if it were that of an insect. For such an
eye is a necessary condition of the possibility of knowledge, and
the whole world exists only in and for knowledge, and without
it is not even thinkable. The world is entirely idea, and as such
demands the knowing subject as the supporter of its existence.
This long course of time itself, filled with innumerable changes,
through which matter rose from form to form till at last the
first percipient creature appeared,—this whole time itself is only
thinkable in the identity of a consciousness whose succession
of ideas, whose form of knowing it is, and apart from which, it
loses all meaning and is nothing at all. Thus we see, on the one
hand, the existence of the whole world necessarily dependent
upon the first conscious being, however undeveloped it may
be; on the other hand, this conscious being just as necessarily
entirely dependent upon a long chain of causes and effects which
have preceded it, and in which it itself appears as a small link. [039]
These two contradictory points of view, to each of which we are
led with the same necessity, we might again call an antinomy
in our faculty of knowledge, and set it up as the counterpart
of that which we found in the first extreme of natural science.
The fourfold antinomy of Kant will be shown, in the criticism
of his philosophy appended to this volume, to be a groundless
delusion. But the necessary contradiction which at last presents
itself to us here, finds its solution in the fact that, to use Kant's
phraseology, time, space, and causality do not belong to the
thing-in-itself, but only to its phenomena, of which they are the
form; which in my language means this: The objective world,
the world as idea, is not the only side of the world, but merely
its outward side; and it has an entirely different side—the side of
its inmost nature—its kernel—the thing-in-itself. 

This we shall consider in the second book, calling it after the most immediate
of its objective manifestations—will. But the world as idea,
with which alone we are here concerned, only appears with the
opening of the first eye. Without this medium of knowledge it
cannot be, and therefore it was not before it. But without that eye,
that is to say, outside of knowledge, there was also no before, no
time. Thus time has no beginning, but all beginning is in time.
Since, however, it is the most universal form of the knowable, in
which all phenomena are united together through causality, time,
with its infinity of past and future, is present in the beginning of
knowledge. The phenomenon which fills the first present must at
once be known as causally bound up with and dependent upon a
sequence of phenomena which stretches infinitely into the past,
and this past itself is just as truly conditioned by this first present,
as conversely the present is by the past. Accordingly the past
out of which the first present arises, is, like it, dependent upon
the knowing subject, without which it is nothing. It necessarily
happens, however, that this first present does not manifest itself[040]
as the first, that is, as having no past for its parent, but as
being the beginning of time. It manifests itself rather as the
consequence of the past, according to the principle of existence
in time. In the same way, the phenomena which fill this first
present appear as the effects of earlier phenomena which filled
the past, in accordance with the law of causality. Those who
like mythological interpretations may take the birth of Kronos
(«¡øΩø¬), the youngest of the Titans, as a symbol of the moment
here referred to at which time appears, though, indeed it has
no beginning; for with him, since he ate his father, the crude
productions of heaven and earth cease, and the races of gods and
men appear upon the scene.
This explanation at which we have arrived by following the
most consistent of the philosophical systems which start from the
object, materialism, has brought out clearly the inseparable and
reciprocal dependence of subject and object, and at the same time
61
the inevitable antithesis between them. And this knowledge leads
us to seek for the inner nature of the world, the thing-in-itself,
not in either of the two elements of the idea, but in something
quite distinct from it, and which is not encumbered with such a
fundamental and insoluble antithesis.
Opposed to the system we have explained, which starts from
the object in order to derive the subject from it, is the system
which starts from the subject and tries to derive the object from
it. The first of these has been of frequent and common occurrence
throughout the history of philosophy, but of the second we find
only one example, and that a very recent one; the “philosophy
of appearance” of J. G. Fichte. In this respect, therefore, it must
be considered; little real worth or inner meaning as the doctrine
itself had. It was indeed for the most part merely a delusion,
but it was delivered with an air of the deepest earnestness, with
sustained loftiness of tone and zealous ardour, and was defended [041]
with eloquent polemic against weak opponents, so that it was
able to present a brilliant exterior and seemed to be something.

But the genuine earnestness which keeps truth always steadfastly
before it as its goal, and is unaffected by any external influences,
was entirely wanting to Fichte, as it is to all philosophers who,
like him, concern themselves with questions of the day. In his
case, indeed, it could not have been otherwise. A man becomes
a philosopher by reason of a certain perplexity, from which he
seeks to free himself. This is Plato's ∏±≈º±æμπΩ, which he calls
a º±ª± ∆πªø√ø∆π∫øΩ ¿±∏ø¬. But what distinguishes the false
philosopher from the true is this: the perplexity of the latter
arises from the contemplation of the world itself, while that of
the former results from some book, some system of philosophy
which is before him. Now Fichte belongs to the class of the false
philosophers. He was made a philosopher by Kant's doctrine
of the thing-in-itself, and if it had not been for this he would
probably have pursued entirely different ends, with far better
results, for he certainly possessed remarkable rhetorical talent.

If he had only penetrated somewhat deeply into the meaning of
the book that made him a philosopher, “The Critique of Pure
Reason,” he would have understood that its principal teaching
about mind is this. The principle of sufficient reason is not,
as all scholastic philosophy maintains, a veritas aeterna—that
is to say, it does not possess an unconditioned validity before,
outside of, and above the world. It is relative and conditioned,
and valid only in the sphere of phenomena, and thus it may
appear as the necessary nexus of space and time, or as the law
of causality, or as the law of the ground of knowledge. 

The
inner nature of the world, the thing-in-itself can never be found
by the guidance of this principle, for all that it leads to will be
found to be dependent and relative and merely phenomenal, not
the thing-in-itself. Further, it does not concern the subject, but[042]
is only the form of objects, which are therefore not things-in-themselves. The subject must exist along with the object, and
the object along with the subject, so that it is impossible that
subject and object can stand to each other in a relation of reason
and consequent. But Fichte did not take up the smallest fragment
of all this. 

All that interested him about the matter was that
the system started from the subject. Now Kant had chosen this
procedure in order to show the fallacy of the prevalent systems,
which started from the object, and through which the object had
come, to be regarded as a thing-in-itself. Fichte, however, took
this departure from the subject for the really important matter,
and like all imitators, he imagined that in going further than Kant
he was surpassing him. Thus he repeated the fallacy with regard
to the subject, which all the previous dogmatism had perpetrated
with regard to the object, and which had been the occasion of
Kant's “Critique”. 

Fichte then made no material change, and the
fundamental fallacy, the assumption of a relation of reason and
consequent between object and subject, remained after him as
it was before him. The principle of sufficient reason possessed
as before an unconditioned validity, and the only difference was that the thing-in-itself was now placed in the subject instead of,
as formerly, in the object. The entire relativity of both subject
and object, which proves that the thing-in-itself, or the inner
nature of the world, is not to be sought in them at all, but
outside of them, and outside everything else that exists merely
relatively, still remained unknown. Just as if Kant had never
existed, the principle of sufficient reason is to Fichte precisely
what it was to all the schoolmen, a veritas aeterna. As an eternal
fate reigned over the gods of old, so these aeternæ veritates,
these metaphysical, mathematical and metalogical truths, and in
the case of some, the validity of the moral law also, reigned
over the God of the schoolmen. 

These veritates alone were
independent of everything, and through their necessity both God [043]
and the world existed. According to the principle of sufficient
reason, as such a veritas aeterna, the ego is for Fichte the ground
of the world, or of the non-ego, the object, which is just its
consequent, its creation. He has therefore taken good care to
avoid examining further or limiting the principle of sufficient
reason. If, however, it is thought I should specify the form of
the principle of sufficient reason under the guidance of which
Fichte derives the non-ego from the ego, as a spider spins its
web out of itself, I find that it is the principle of sufficient
reason of existence in space: for it is only as referred to this
that some kind of meaning and sense can be attached to the
laboured deductions of the way in which the ego produces and
fabricates the non-ego from itself, which form the content of the
most senseless, and consequently the most wearisome book that
was ever written. This philosophy of Fichte, otherwise not worth
mentioning, is interesting to us only as the tardy expression of
the converse of the old materialism. For materialism was the
most consistent system starting from the object, as this is the
most consistent system starting from the subject. Materialism
overlooked the fact that, with the simplest object, it assumed the
subject also; and Fichte overlooked the fact that with the subject

(whatever he may call it) he assumed the object also, for no
subject is thinkable without an object. Besides this he forgot that
all a priori deduction, indeed all demonstration in general, must
rest upon some necessity, and that all necessity is based on the
principle of sufficient reason, because to be necessary, and to
follow from given grounds are convertible conceptions.10 

But
the principle of sufficient reason is just the universal form of the
object as such. Thus it is in the object, but is not valid before[044]
and outside of it; it first produces the object and makes it appear
in conformity with its regulative principle. We see then that the
system which starts from the subject contains the same fallacy
as the system, explained above, which starts from the object; it
begins by assuming what it proposes to deduce, the necessary
correlative of its starting-point.

The method of our own system is toto genere distinct from
these two opposite misconceptions, for we start neither from the
object nor from the subject, but from the idea, as the first fact
of consciousness. Its first essential, fundamental form is the
antithesis of subject and object. 

The form of the object again is
the principle of sufficient reason in its various forms. Each of
these reigns so absolutely in its own class of ideas that, as we
have seen, when the special form of the principle of sufficient
reason which governs any class of ideas is known, the nature of
the whole class is known also: for the whole class, as idea, is no
more than this form of the principle of sufficient reason itself;
so that time itself is nothing but the principle of existence in it,
i.e., succession; space is nothing but the principle of existence
in it, i.e., position; matter is nothing but causality; the concept
(as will appear immediately) is nothing but relation to a ground
of knowledge. This thorough and consistent relativity of the
world as idea, both according to its universal form (subject and
object), and according to the form which is subordinate to this


<!-- 10 On this see “The Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason,” §
49. -->

(the principle of sufficient reason) warns us, as we said before,
to seek the inner nature of the world in an aspect of it which is
quite different and quite distinct from the idea; and in the next
book we shall find this in a fact which is just as immediate to
every living being as the idea.

But we must first consider that class of ideas which belongs to
man alone. The matter of these is the concept, and the subjective
correlative is reason, just as the subjective correlative of the ideas
we have already considered was understanding and sensibility, [045]
which are also to be attributed to all the lower animals.
