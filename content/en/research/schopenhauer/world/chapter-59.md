If we have so far convinced ourselves a priori, by
the most general consideration, by investigation of the primary
and elemental features of human life, that in its whole plan
it is capable of no true blessedness, but is in its very nature
suffering in various forms, and throughout a state of misery, we
might now awaken this conviction much more vividly within
us if, proceeding more a posteriori, we were to turn to more
definite instances, call up pictures to the fancy, and illustrate by
examples the unspeakable misery which experience and history
present, wherever one may look and in whatever direction one
may seek. But the chapter would have no end, and would carry
us far from the standpoint of the universal, which is essential to
philosophy; and, moreover, such a description might easily be
taken for a mere declamation on human misery, such as has often
been given, and, as such, might be charged with one-sidedness,
because it started from particular facts. From such a reproach and
suspicion our perfectly cold and philosophical investigation of the inevitable suffering which is founded in the nature of life is
free, for it starts from the universal and is conducted a priori. 

But
confirmation a posteriori is everywhere easily obtained. Every
one who has awakened from the first dream of youth, who has
considered his own experience and that of others, who has studied
himself in life, in the history of the past and of his own time,
and finally in the works of the great poets, will, if his judgment
is not paralysed by some indelibly imprinted prejudice, certainly
arrive at the conclusion that this human world is the kingdom
of chance and error, which rule without mercy in great things
and in small, and along with which folly and wickedness also
wield the scourge. Hence it arises that everything better only struggles through with difficulty; what is noble and wise seldom
attains to expression, becomes effective and claims attention, but
the absurd and the perverse in the sphere of thought, the dull
and tasteless in the sphere of art, the wicked and deceitful in the
sphere of action, really assert a supremacy, only disturbed by
short interruptions. On the other hand, everything that is excellent
is always a mere exception, one case in millions, and therefore,
if it presents itself in a lasting work, this, when it has outlived the
enmity of its contemporaries, exists in isolation, is preserved like
a meteoric stone, sprung from an order of things different from
that which prevails here. But as far as the life of the individual is
concerned, every biography is the history of suffering, for every
life is, as a rule, a continual series of great and small misfortunes,
which each one conceals as much as possible, because he knows
that others can seldom feel sympathy or compassion, but almost
always satisfaction at the sight of the woes from which they are
themselves for the moment exempt. But perhaps at the end of
life, if a man is sincere and in full possession of his faculties,
he will never wish to have it to live over again, but rather than
this, he will much prefer absolute annihilation. 

The essential
content of the famous soliloquy in “Hamlet” is briefly this: Our
state is so wretched that absolute annihilation would be decidedly preferable. If suicide really offered us this, so that the alternative
“to be or not to be,” in the full sense of the word, was placed
before us, then it would be unconditionally to be chosen as “a
consummation devoutly to be wished.” But there is something in
us which tells us that this is not the case: suicide is not the end;
death is not absolute annihilation. In like manner, what was said
by the father of history71 has not since him been contradicted,
that no man has ever lived who has not wished more than once
that he had not to live the following day. 

According to this, the brevity of life, which is so constantly lamented, may be the
best quality it possesses. If, finally, we should bring clearly
to a man's sight the terrible sufferings and miseries to which
his life is constantly exposed, he would be seized with horror;
and if we were to conduct the confirmed optimist through the
hospitals, infirmaries, and surgical operating-rooms, through the
prisons, torture-chambers, and slave-kennels, over battle-fields
and places of execution; if we were to open to him all the dark
abodes of misery, where it hides itself from the glance of cold
curiosity, and, finally, allow him to glance into the starving
dungeon of Ugolino, he, too, would understand at last the nature
of this “best of possible worlds.” For whence did Dante take the
materials for his hell but from this our actual world? And yet
he made a very proper hell of it.

When, on the other hand,
he came to the task of describing heaven and its delights, he had
an insurmountable difficulty before him, for our world affords
no materials at all for this. Therefore there remained nothing
for him to do but, instead of describing the joys of paradise, to
repeat to us the instruction given him there by his ancestor, by
Beatrice, and by various saints. But from this it is sufficiently
clear what manner of world it is. Certainly human life, like all
bad ware, is covered over with a false lustre: what suffers always
conceals itself; on the other hand, whatever pomp or splendour any one can get, he makes a show of openly, and the more
inner contentment deserts him, the more he desires to exist as
fortunate in the opinion of others: to such an extent does folly
go, and the opinion of others is a chief aim of the efforts of
every one, although the utter nothingness of it is expressed in
the fact that in almost all languages vanity, vanitas, originally
signifies emptiness and nothingness. But under all this false
show, the miseries of life can so increase—and this happens
every day—that the death which hitherto has been feared above
all things is eagerly seized upon. 

If fate will show its[420]
whole malice, even this refuge is denied to the sufferer, and,
in the hands of enraged enemies, he may remain exposed to
terrible and slow tortures without remedy. In vain the sufferer
then calls on his gods for help; he remains exposed to his fate
without grace. But this irremediableness is only the mirror of
the invincible nature of his will, of which his person is the
objectivity. As little as an external power can change or suppress
this will, so little can a foreign power deliver it from the miseries
which proceed from the life which is the phenomenal appearance
of that will. In the principal matter, as in everything else, a man
is always thrown back upon himself. In vain does he make to
himself gods in order to get from them by prayers and flattery
what can only be accomplished by his own will-power. 

The
Old Testament made the world and man the work of a god, but
the New Testament saw that, in order to teach that holiness and
salvation from the sorrows of this world can only come from the
world itself, it was necessary that this god should become man.
It is and remains the will of man upon which everything depends
for him. Fanatics, martyrs, saints of every faith and name, have
voluntarily and gladly endured every torture, because in them
the will to live had suppressed itself; and then even the slow
destruction of its phenomenon was welcome to them. But I do
not wish to anticipate the later exposition. For the rest, I cannot
here avoid the statement that, to me, optimism, when it is not
419
merely the thoughtless talk of such as harbour nothing but words
under their low foreheads, appears not merely as an absurd, but
also as a really wicked way of thinking, as a bitter mockery of
the unspeakable suffering of humanity. Let no one think that
Christianity is favourable to optimism; for, on the contrary, in
the Gospels world and evil are used as almost synonymous.
