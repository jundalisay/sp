Perception arises through the knowledge of causality.

This makes us think that the relation of subject and object is that of cause and effect. 

Cause and effect subsists only between objects 
- It is between the immediate object and the other objects known indirectly.

Subject-object being thought of as cause-effect is the cause of errors on the reality of the outer world.

These errors leads to dogmatism and scepticism which oppose each oher.*

{{< n n="Schopenhauer has to disconnect subject-object from cause-effect because he is Kantian and negates reality and instead enshrines the mind as a God or creator of a fantasy universe" >}}


Dogmatism is now realism and idealism.
- Realism treats the object as cause, and the subject as its effect.
- Fichte's idealism puts the object as the effect, and the subject as its cause.*

{{< n n="This is correct" >}}




According to my principle of sufficient reason [flow of cognition] there is absolutely no relation between subject and object*.

{{< n n="This means that his flow is only the logic flow from idea to idea, not a positional [ontological] or existential-positional flow" >}}

And so none of these views could be proven.

This is why scepticism attacked them both successfully.

Cause and effect precedes perception and experience as their condition.

But Hume thought the opposite -- that perception and experience precedes cause and effect. 

This is why I assert that cause and effect cannot be derived from experience. 

Likewise, object and subject precede:
- all knowledge
- the [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason as its first condition

For this [flow] principle is merely the form of all objects, the whole nature and possibility of their existence
as phenomena.

But the object always presupposes the subject.

Therefore, between subject-object there can be no relation of reason and cause-effect. 

My [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason explains the content of that [flow] principle is:
- the essential form of every object
- the universal nature of all objective existence
- something which pertains to the object as such

But the object always presupposes the subject.

Therefore, the subject remains always outside the [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason.

The controversy of the reality of the outer world is from this false extension of the [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason to the subject.

This creates the mistake that the subject can never understand itself. 


Realistic dogmatism:
- believes that idea is the effect of the object
- wants to separate idea and object
- assumes a cause different from the idea, independent of the subject, 
  - This is inconceivable.

 for even as object it presupposes subject,
and so remains its idea. 

Opposed to this doctrine is scepticism.

It wrongly believes that the idea is the effect, never the cause.

Therefore, the idea is never a real being.

We always know merely the action of the object.

But this object might have no resemblance to its effect and can be erroneously thought of as the cause.

This is because cause and effect come from experience.

The reality of experience is then made to rest on cause and effect.

I fix both of these views by stating:

1. Object and idea are the same.

2. The essence and reality of the perceived object is its action

It is contradictory to demand:
- an existence of the object outside the idea of the subject
- for an essence of the actual thing different from its action

The knowledge of the nature of the effect of any perceived object, exhausts such an object itself, so far as it is an object-idea.

This is because beyond the object-idea, there is nothing. 

The perceived world in space and time:
- makes itself known via cause and effect. 
- is entirely real
- is idea bound together by cause and effect
  - This is its empirical reality.

On the other hand, all causality is in and for the [mind] understanding alone.

The whole actual, active world is determined as such by the [mind] understanding.

Without the [mind] understanding, the world is nothing.

This is why I deny the reality of the outer world.

The dogmatist explains the reality of the outer world from its independence of the subject. 

I also deny it because no object apart from a subject can be conceived without contradiction.

The whole world of objects is and remains idea, and therefore wholly and forever determined by the subject.

This gives it a transcendental ideality.

But it is not therefore illusion or mere appearance.

It manifests as a series of ideas bound by the [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason.

<!-- It is according to its inmost
meaning quite comprehensible to the healthy understanding, and
speaks a language quite intelligible to it. To dispute about its
reality can only occur to a mind perverted by over-subtilty, and
such discussion always arises from a false application of the
principle of sufficient reason, which binds all ideas together of
whatever kind they may be, but by no means connects them with
the subject, nor yet with a something which is neither subject
nor object, but only the ground of the object; an absurdity, for
only objects can be and always are the ground of objects.  -->

Is the outer world real?

This question comes from the false application of the [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason to:
- what is beyond cognition
- a connection with the subject

Physical objects only have [movement in space and time] ground of being.

This wrong use of the abstract [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason into physical objects demands the ground of knowing on those physical objects.

<!-- Among the abstract ideas, the concepts
united in the judgment, 


the [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason appears
in such a way that each of these has its worth, its validity, and its
whole existence, here called truth, simply and solely through the
relation of the judgment to something outside of it, its ground of
knowledge, to which there must consequently always be a return.

Among real objects, the [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason appears not as the principle of the ground of knowing, but of being, as cause and effect.

Every real object has paid its debt to it, inasmuch as it has come to
be, i.e., has appeared as the effect of a cause. 

The demand for a ground of knowing has therefore here no application and no
meaning, but belongs to quite another class of things. 

Thus the world of perception raises in the observer no question or doubt
so long as he remains in contact with it: there is here neither
error nor truth, for these are confined to the province of the
abstract—the province of reflection. 

But here the world lies
open for sense and understanding; presents itself with naive truth
as that which it really is—ideas of perception which develop
themselves according to the law of causality. -->
