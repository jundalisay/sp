Perception arises through the knowledge of causality.

This makes us think that the relation of subject and object is that of cause and effect. 

This relation subsists only between the immediate object and objects known indirectly, thus always between objects alone.

It is this false supposition that has given rise to the foolish
controversy about the reality of the outer world; a controversy
in which dogmatism and scepticism oppose each other, and the
former appears, now as realism, now as idealism. Realism treats
the object as cause, and the subject as its effect. The idealism
of Fichte reduces the object to the effect of the subject. 

Since
however, and this cannot be too much emphasised, there is
absolutely no relation according to the principle of sufficient
reason between subject and object, neither of these views could
be proved, and therefore scepticism attacked them both with
success. 

Just as the law of causality precedes perception
and experience as their condition, and therefore cannot (as Hume
thought) be derived from them, so object and subject precede
all knowledge, and hence the principle of sufficient reason in
general, as its first condition; for this principle is merely the form
of all objects, the whole nature and possibility of their existence
as phenomena: but the object always presupposes the subject; and
therefore between these two there can be no relation of reason[017]
and consequent. 

My essay on the principle of sufficient reason
accomplishes just this: it explains the content of that principle as
the essential form of every object—that is to say, as the universal
nature of all objective existence, as something which pertains to
the object as such; but the object as such always presupposes
the subject as its necessary correlative; and therefore the subject
remains always outside the province in which the principle of
sufficient reason is valid. 

The controversy as to the reality of
the outer world rests upon this false extension of the validity of
the principle of sufficient reason to the subject also, and starting
with this mistake it can never understand itself. On the one side
realistic dogmatism, looking upon the idea as the effect of the
object, desires to separate these two, idea and object, which are really one, and to assume a cause quite different from the idea,
an object in itself, independent of the subject, a thing which is
quite inconceivable; for even as object it presupposes subject,
and so remains its idea. Opposed to this doctrine is scepticism,
which makes the same false presupposition that in the idea we
have only the effect, never the cause, therefore never real being;
that we always know merely the action of the object. 

But this
object, it supposes, may perhaps have no resemblance whatever
to its effect, may indeed have been quite erroneously received
as the cause, for the law of causality is first to be gathered from
experience, and the reality of experience is then made to rest
upon it. 

Thus both of these views are open to the correction,
firstly, that object and idea are the same; secondly, that the true
being of the object of perception is its action, that the reality of
the thing consists in this, and the demand for an existence of the
object outside the idea of the subject, and also for an essence
of the actual thing different from its action, has absolutely no
meaning, and is a contradiction: and that the knowledge of the
nature of the effect of any perceived object, exhausts such an [018]
object itself, so far as it is object, i.e., idea, for beyond this
there is nothing more to be known. So far then, the perceived
world in space and time, which makes itself known as causation
alone, is entirely real, and is throughout simply what it appears
to be, and it appears wholly and without reserve as idea, bound
together according to the law of causality. This is its empirical
reality. On the other hand, all causality is in the understanding
alone, and for the understanding. The whole actual, that is,
active world is determined as such through the understanding,
and apart from it is nothing. This, however, is not the only
reason for altogether denying such a reality of the outer world
as is taught by the dogmatist, who explains its reality as its
independence of the subject. We also deny it, because no object
apart from a subject can be conceived without contradiction.

The whole world of objects is and remains idea, and therefore wholly and for ever determined by the subject; that is to say,
it has transcendental ideality. But it is not therefore illusion
or mere appearance; it presents itself as that which it is, idea,
and indeed as a series of ideas of which the common bond is
the principle of sufficient reason. It is according to its inmost
meaning quite comprehensible to the healthy understanding, and
speaks a language quite intelligible to it. 

To dispute about its
reality can only occur to a mind perverted by over-subtilty, and
such discussion always arises from a false application of the
principle of sufficient reason, which binds all ideas together of
whatever kind they may be, but by no means connects them with
the subject, nor yet with a something which is neither subject
nor object, but only the ground of the object; an absurdity, for
only objects can be and always are the ground of objects. If we
examine more closely the source of this question as to the reality
of the outer world, we find that besides the false application of
the principle of sufficient reason generally to what lies beyond[019]
its province, a special confusion of its forms is also involved; for
that form which it has only in reference to concepts or abstract
ideas, is applied to perceived ideas, real objects; and a ground of
knowing is demanded of objects, whereas they can have nothing
but a ground of being. Among the abstract ideas, the concepts
united in the judgment, the principle of sufficient reason appears
in such a way that each of these has its worth, its validity, and its
whole existence, here called truth, simply and solely through the
relation of the judgment to something outside of it, its ground of
knowledge, to which there must consequently always be a return.
Among real objects, ideas of perception, on the other hand, the
principle of sufficient reason appears not as the principle of the
ground of knowing, but of being, as the law of causality: every
real object has paid its debt to it, inasmuch as it has come to
be, i.e., has appeared as the effect of a cause. The demand for
a ground of knowing has therefore here no application and no
meaning, but belongs to quite another class of things. 

Thus the world of perception raises in the observer no question or doubt
so long as he remains in contact with it: there is here neither
error nor truth, for these are confined to the province of the
abstract—the province of reflection. But here the world lies
open for sense and understanding; presents itself with naive truth
as that which it really is—ideas of perception which develop
themselves according to the law of causality.

So far as we have considered the question of the reality of the
outer world, it arises from a confusion which amounts even to
a misunderstanding of reason itself, and therefore thus far, the
question could be answered only by explaining its meaning. After
examination of the whole nature of the principle of sufficient
reason, of the relation of subject and object, and the special
conditions of sense perception, the question itself disappeared
because it had no longer any meaning. There is, however, one [020]
other possible origin of this question, quite different from the
purely speculative one which we have considered, a specially
empirical origin, though the question is always raised from a
speculative point of view, and in this form it has a much more
comprehensible meaning than it had in the first. We have dreams;
may not our whole life be a dream? or more exactly: is there
a sure criterion of the distinction between dreams and reality?
between phantasms and real objects? 

The assertion that what is
dreamt is less vivid and distinct than what we actually perceive is
not to the point, because no one has ever been able to make a fair
comparison of the two; for we can only compare the recollection
of a dream with the present reality. Kant answers the question
thus: “The connection of ideas among themselves, according to
the law of causality, constitutes the difference between real life
and dreams.” But in dreams, as well as in real life, everything
is connected individually at any rate, in accordance with the
principle of sufficient reason in all its forms, and this connection
is broken only between life and dreams, or between one dream
and another. Kant's answer therefore could only run thus:—the long dream (life) has throughout complete connection according
to the principle of sufficient reason; it has not this connection,
however, with short dreams, although each of these has in itself
the same connection: the bridge is therefore broken between the
former and the latter, and on this account we distinguish them.

But to institute an inquiry according to this criterion, as to
whether something was dreamt or seen, would always be difficult
and often impossible. For we are by no means in a position to trace
link by link the causal connection between any experienced event
and the present moment, but we do not on that account explain it
as dreamt. Therefore in real life we do not commonly employ that
method of distinguishing between dreams and reality. 

The only
sure criterion by which to distinguish them is in fact the entirely empirical one of awaking, through which at any rate the causal
connection between dreamed events and those of waking life, is
distinctly and sensibly broken off. This is strongly supported by
the remark of Hobbes in the second chapter of Leviathan, that
we easily mistake dreams for reality if we have unintentionally
fallen asleep without taking off our clothes, and much more so
when it also happens that some undertaking or design fills all
our thoughts, and occupies our dreams as well as our waking
moments. We then observe the awaking just as little as the falling
asleep, dream and reality run together and become confounded.
In such a case there is nothing for it but the application of Kant's
criterion; but if, as often happens, we fail to establish by means
of this criterion, either the existence of causal connection with
the present, or the absence of such connection, then it must for
ever remain uncertain whether an event was dreamt or really
happened. Here, in fact, the intimate relationship between life
and dreams is brought out very clearly, and we need not be
ashamed to confess it, as it has been recognised and spoken of by
many great men. The Vedas and Puranas have no better simile
than a dream for the whole knowledge of the actual world, which
they call the web of Mâyâ, and they use none more frequently.


Plato often says that men live only in a dream; the philosopher
alone strives to awake himself. Pindar says (ii. ∑. 135): √∫π±¬
øΩ±¡ ±Ω∏¡…¿ø¬ (umbræ somnium homo), and Sophocles:—
HΩ… ≥≈Ω !º±¬ ø≈¥μΩ øΩƒ±¬ ±ªªø, ¿ª∑Ω
£π¥…ªΩ A√øπ¿μ¡ ∂…ºμΩ, t ∫ø≈∆∑Ω √∫π±Ω.—Ajax, 125.
(Nos enim, quicunque vivimus, nihil aliud esse comperio
quam simulacra et levem umbram.) Beside which most worthily
stands Shakespeare:—
“We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.”—Tempest, Act iv. Sc. 1.


Lastly, Calderon was so deeply impressed with this view
of life that he sought to embody it in a kind of metaphysical
drama—“Life a Dream.”

After these numerous quotations from the poets, perhaps I
also may be allowed to express myself by a metaphor. Life and
dreams are leaves of the same book. The systematic reading of
this book is real life, but when the reading hours (that is, the
day) are over, we often continue idly to turn over the leaves, and
read a page here and there without method or connection: often
one we have read before, sometimes one that is new to us, but
always in the same book. Such an isolated page is indeed out
of connection with the systematic study of the book, but it does
not seem so very different when we remember that the whole
continuous perusal begins and ends just as abruptly, and may
therefore be regarded as merely a larger single page.

Thus although individual dreams are distinguished from real
life by the fact that they do not fit into that continuity which runs
through the whole of experience, and the act of awaking brings
this into consciousness, yet that very continuity of experience
belongs to real life as its form, and the dream on its part can point to a similar continuity in itself. If, therefore, we consider
the question from a point of view external to both, there is no
distinct difference in their nature, and we are forced to concede
to the poets that life is a long dream.

Let us turn back now from this quite independent empirical
origin of the question of the reality of the outer world, to its
speculative origin. We found that 

The origin of the outer world consisted in:

1. The false application of the principle of sufficient reason to the relation of
subject and object

2. The confusion of its forms, inasmuch as the principle of sufficient reason of knowing was
extended to a province in which the principle of sufficient reason
of being is valid. 

But the question could hardly have occupied
philosophers so constantly if it were entirely devoid of all real
content, and if some true thought and meaning did not lie at
its heart as its real source. 

Accordingly, we must assume that
when the element of truth that lies at the bottom of the question
first came into reflection and sought its expression, it became
involved in these confused and meaningless forms and problems.

This at least is my opinion, and I think that the true expression
of that inmost meaning of the question, which it failed to find, is
this:—What is this world of perception besides being my idea?
Is that of which I am conscious only as idea, exactly like my own
body, of which I am doubly conscious, in one aspect as idea, in
another aspect as will? The fuller explanation of this question
and its answer in the affirmative, will form the content of the
second book, and its consequences will occupy the remaining
portion of this work.
