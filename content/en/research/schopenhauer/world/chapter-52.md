<!--  52. Now that we have considered all the fine arts in the
general way that is suitable to our point of view, beginning
with architecture, the peculiar end of which is to elucidate the
objectification of will at the lowest grades of its visibility, in
which it shows itself as the dumb unconscious tendency of the
mass in accordance with laws, and yet already reveals a breach
of the unity of will with itself in a conflict between gravity
and rigidity—and ending with the consideration of tragedy,
which presents to us at the highest grades of the objectification
of will this very conflict with itself in terrible magnitude and
distinctness; we find that there is still another fine art which has

been excluded from our consideration, and had to be excluded,
for in the systematic connection of our exposition there was no
fitting place for it—I mean music.  -->

Music stands alone, quite cut off
from all the other arts. In it we do not recognise the copy or
repetition of any Idea of existence in the world. Yet it is such a
great and exceedingly noble art, its effect on the inmost nature of
man is so powerful, and it is so entirely and deeply understood
by him in his inmost consciousness as a perfectly universal
language, the distinctness of which surpasses even that of the
perceptible world itself, that we certainly have more to look[331]
for in it than an exercitum arithmeticæ occultum nescientis se
numerare animi,62 which Leibnitz called it. Yet he was perfectly
right, as he considered only its immediate external significance,
its form. But if it were nothing more, the satisfaction which it
affords would be like that which we feel when a sum in arithmetic
comes out right, and could not be that intense pleasure with which
we see the deepest recesses of our nature find utterance. From
our standpoint, therefore, at which the æsthetic effect is the
criterion, we must attribute to music a far more serious and
deep significance, connected with the inmost nature of the world
and our own self, and in reference to which the arithmetical
proportions, to which it may be reduced, are related, not as the
thing signified, but merely as the sign. That in some sense music
must be related to the world as the representation to the thing
represented, as the copy to the original, we may conclude from
the analogy of the other arts, all of which possess this character,
and affect us on the whole in the same way as it does, only
that the effect of music is stronger, quicker, more necessary and
infallible. Further, its representative relation to the world must
be very deep, absolutely true, and strikingly accurate, because it
is instantly understood by every one, and has the appearance of a
certain infallibility, because its form may be reduced to perfectly
62 Leibnitii epistolæ, collectio Kortholti, ep. 154.
335
definite rules expressed in numbers, from which it cannot free
itself without entirely ceasing to be music. Yet the point of
comparison between music and the world, the respect in which
it stands to the world in the relation of a copy or repetition,
is very obscure. Men have practised music in all ages without
being able to account for this; content to understand it directly,
they renounce all claim to an abstract conception of this direct
understanding itself.
I gave my mind entirely up to the impression of music in all its [332]
forms, and then returned to reflection and the system of thought
expressed in the present work, and thus I arrived at an explanation
of the inner nature of music and of the nature of its imitative
relation to the world—which from analogy had necessarily to
be presupposed—an explanation which is quite sufficient for
myself, and satisfactory to my investigation, and which will
doubtless be equally evident to any one who has followed me
thus far and has agreed with my view of the world. Yet I
recognise the fact that it is essentially impossible to prove this
explanation, for it assumes and establishes a relation of music, as
idea, to that which from its nature can never be idea, and music
will have to be regarded as the copy of an original which can
never itself be directly presented as idea. I can therefore do no
more than state here, at the conclusion of this third book, which
has been principally devoted to the consideration of the arts,
the explanation of the marvellous art of music which satisfies
myself, and I must leave the acceptance or denial of my view
to the effect produced upon each of my readers both by music
itself and by the whole system of thought communicated in this
work. Moreover, I regard it as necessary, in order to be able to
assent with full conviction to the exposition of the significance
of music I am about to give, that one should often listen to music
with constant reflection upon my theory concerning it, and for
this again it is necessary to be very familiar with the whole of
my system of thought.

The (Platonic) Ideas are the adequate objectification of will.
To excite or suggest the knowledge of these by means of the
representation of particular things (for works of art themselves
are always representations of particular things) is the end of all
the other arts, which can only be attained by a corresponding
change in the knowing subject. Thus all these arts objectify the
will indirectly only by means of the Ideas; and since our world is
nothing but the manifestation of the Ideas in multiplicity, though[333]
their entrance into the principium individuationis (the form of
the knowledge possible for the individual as such), music also,
since it passes over the Ideas, is entirely independent of the
phenomenal world, ignores it altogether, could to a certain extent
exist if there was no world at all, which cannot be said of the other
arts. Music is as direct an objectification and copy of the whole
will as the world itself, nay, even as the Ideas, whose multiplied
manifestation constitutes the world of individual things. 

Music
is thus by no means like the other arts, the copy of the Ideas,
but the copy of the will itself, whose objectivity the Ideas are.
This is why the effect of music is so much more powerful and
penetrating than that of the other arts, for they speak only of
shadows, but it speaks of the thing itself. Since, however, it is the
same will which objectifies itself both in the Ideas and in music,
though in quite different ways, there must be, not indeed a direct
likeness, but yet a parallel, an analogy, between music and the
Ideas whose manifestation in multiplicity and incompleteness is
the visible world. The establishing of this analogy will facilitate,
as an illustration, the understanding of this exposition, which is
so difficult on account of the obscurity of the subject.
I recognise in the deepest tones of harmony, in the bass, the
lowest grades of the objectification of will, unorganised nature,
the mass of the planet. It is well known that all the high
notes which are easily sounded, and die away more quickly, are
produced by the vibration in their vicinity of the deep bass-notes.
When, also, the low notes sound, the high notes always sound
337
faintly, and it is a law of harmony that only those high notes
may accompany a bass-note which actually already sound along
with it of themselves (its sons harmoniques) on account of its
vibration. This is analogous to the fact that the whole of the
bodies and organisations of nature must be regarded as having
come into existence through gradual development out of the mass
of the planet; this is both their supporter and their source, and [334]
the same relation subsists between the high notes and the bass.
There is a limit of depth, below which no sound is audible. This
corresponds to the fact that no matter can be perceived without
form and quality, i.e., without the manifestation of a force which
cannot be further explained, in which an Idea expresses itself,
and, more generally, that no matter can be entirely without will.
Thus, as a certain pitch is inseparable from the note as such,
so a certain grade of the manifestation of will is inseparable
from matter. Bass is thus, for us, in harmony what unorganised
nature, the crudest mass, upon which all rests, and from which
everything originates and develops, is in the world. 

Now,
further, in the whole of the complemental parts which make up
the harmony between the bass and the leading voice singing
the melody, I recognise the whole gradation of the Ideas in
which the will objectifies itself. Those nearer to the bass are
the lower of these grades, the still unorganised, but yet manifold
phenomenal things; the higher represent to me the world of plants
and beasts. The definite intervals of the scale are parallel to the
definite grades of the objectification of will, the definite species
in nature. The departure from the arithmetical correctness of the
intervals, through some temperament, or produced by the key
selected, is analogous to the departure of the individual from the
type of the species. Indeed, even the impure discords, which
give no definite interval, may be compared to the monstrous
abortions produced by beasts of two species, or by man and
beast. But to all these bass and complemental parts which make
up the harmony there is wanting that connected progress which belongs only to the high voice singing the melody, and it alone
moves quickly and lightly in modulations and runs, while all
these others have only a slower movement without a connection
in each part for itself. The deep bass moves most slowly, the
representative of the crudest mass. Its rising and falling occurs[335]
only by large intervals, in thirds, fourths, fifths, never by one
tone, unless it is a base inverted by double counterpoint. This
slow movement is also physically essential to it; a quick run or
shake in the low notes cannot even be imagined. The higher
complemental parts, which are parallel to animal life, move more
quickly, but yet without melodious connection and significant
progress. The disconnected course of all the complemental parts,
and their regulation by definite laws, is analogous to the fact
that in the whole irrational world, from the crystal to the most
perfect animal, no being has a connected consciousness of its
own which would make its life into a significant whole, and
none experiences a succession of mental developments, none
perfects itself by culture, but everything exists always in the
same way according to its kind, determined by fixed law. Lastly,
in the melody, in the high, singing, principal voice leading
the whole and progressing with unrestrained freedom, in the
unbroken significant connection of one thought from beginning
to end representing a whole, I recognise the highest grade of
the objectification of will, the intellectual life and effort of man.
As he alone, because endowed with reason, constantly looks
before and after on the path of his actual life and its innumerable
possibilities, and so achieves a course of life which is intellectual,
and therefore connected as a whole; corresponding to this, I say,
the melody has significant intentional connection from beginning
to end. It records, therefore, the history of the intellectually
enlightened will. This will expresses itself in the actual world
as the series of its deeds; but melody says more, it records the
most secret history of this intellectually-enlightened will, pictures
every excitement, every effort, every movement of it, all that
339
which the reason collects under the wide and negative concept
of feeling, and which it cannot apprehend further through its
abstract concepts. Therefore it has always been said that music
is the language of feeling and of passion, as words are the [336]
language of reason. Plato explains it as ! ƒ…Ω ºμª…Ω ∫πΩ∑√π¬
ºμºπº∑ºμΩ∑, μΩ ƒøπ¬ ¿±∏∑º±√πΩ Aƒ±Ω »≈«∑ ≥πΩ∑ƒ±π (melodiarum
motus, animi affectus imitans), De Leg. vii.; and also Aristotle
says: ¥π± ƒπ ø1 ¡≈∏ºøπ ∫±π ƒ± ºμª∑, ∆…Ω∑ ø≈√±, ∑∏μ√πΩ μøπ∫μ
(cur numeri musici et modi, qui voces sunt, moribus similes sese
exhibent?): Probl. c. 19.
Now the nature of man consists in this, that his will strives,
is satisfied and strives anew, and so on for ever. Indeed, his
happiness and well-being consist simply in the quick transition
from wish to satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new wish.
For the absence of satisfaction is suffering, the empty longing
for a new wish, languor, ennui. And corresponding to this the
nature of melody is a constant digression and deviation from
the key-note in a thousand ways, not only to the harmonious
intervals to the third and dominant, but to every tone, to the
dissonant sevenths and to the superfluous degrees; yet there
always follows a constant return to the key-note. In all these
deviations melody expresses the multifarious efforts of will, but
always its satisfaction also by the final return to an harmonious
interval, and still more, to the key-note. The composition of
melody, the disclosure in it of all the deepest secrets of human
willing and feeling, is the work of genius, whose action, which is
more apparent here than anywhere else, lies far from all reflection
and conscious intention, and may be called an inspiration. The
conception is here, as everywhere in art, unfruitful. The composer
reveals the inner nature of the world, and expresses the deepest
wisdom in a language which his reason does not understand; as a
person under the influence of mesmerism tells things of which he
has no conception when he awakes. Therefore in the composer,
more than in any other artist, the man is entirely separated and
340 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
distinct from the artist. Even in the explanation of this wonderful
art, the concept shows its poverty and limitation. I shall try,[337]
however, to complete our analogy. As quick transition from wish
to satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new wish, is happiness
and well-being, so quick melodies without great deviations are
cheerful; slow melodies, striking painful discords, and only
winding back through many bars to the keynote are, as analogous
to the delayed and hardly won satisfaction, sad. The delay of the
new excitement of will, languor, could have no other expression
than the sustained keynote, the effect of which would soon be
unbearable; very monotonous and unmeaning melodies approach
this effect. The short intelligible subjects of quick dance-music
seem to speak only of easily attained common pleasure. On the
other hand, the Allegro maestoso, in elaborate movements, long
passages, and wide deviations, signifies a greater, nobler effort
towards a more distant end, and its final attainment. The Adagio
speaks of the pain of a great and noble effort which despises
all trifling happiness. But how wonderful is the effect of the
minor and major! How astounding that the change of half a tone,
the entrance of a minor third instead of a major, at once and
inevitably forces upon us an anxious painful feeling, from which
again we are just as instantaneously delivered by the major. The
Adagio lengthens in the minor the expression of the keenest pain,
and becomes even a convulsive wail. Dance-music in the minor
seems to indicate the failure of that trifling happiness which
we ought rather to despise, seems to speak of the attainment
of a lower end with toil and trouble. The inexhaustibleness of
possible melodies corresponds to the inexhaustibleness of Nature
in difference of individuals, physiognomies, and courses of life.
The transition from one key to an entirely different one, since it
altogether breaks the connection with what went before, is like
death, for the individual ends in it; but the will which appeared in
this individual lives after him as before him, appearing in other
individuals, whose consciousness, however, has no connection[338]
341
with his.
But it must never be forgotten, in the investigation of all
these analogies I have pointed out, that music has no direct,
but merely an indirect relation to them, for it never expresses
the phenomenon, but only the inner nature, the in-itself of
all phenomena, the will itself. It does not therefore express
this or that particular and definite joy, this or that sorrow,
or pain, or horror, or delight, or merriment, or peace of
mind; but joy, sorrow, pain, horror, delight, merriment, peace
of mind themselves, to a certain extent in the abstract, their
essential nature, without accessories, and therefore without their
motives. Yet we completely understand them in this extracted
quintessence. Hence it arises that our imagination is so easily
excited by music, and now seeks to give form to that invisible
yet actively moved spirit-world which speaks to us directly, and
clothe it with flesh and blood, i.e., to embody it in an analogous
example. This is the origin of the song with words, and finally
of the opera, the text of which should therefore never forsake
that subordinate position in order to make itself the chief thing
and the music a mere means of expressing it, which is a great
misconception and a piece of utter perversity; for music always
expresses only the quintessence of life and its events, never these
themselves, and therefore their differences do not always affect
it. It is precisely this universality, which belongs exclusively to
it, together with the greatest determinateness, that gives music
the high worth which it has as the panacea for all our woes. Thus,
if music is too closely united to the words, and tries to form itself
according to the events, it is striving to speak a language which is
not its own. No one has kept so free from this mistake as Rossini;
therefore his music speaks its own language so distinctly and
purely that it requires no words, and produces its full effect when
rendered by instruments alone. [339]
According to all this, we may regard the phenomenal world,
or nature, and music as two different expressions of the same
342 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
thing, which is therefore itself the only medium of their analogy,
so that a knowledge of it is demanded in order to understand
that analogy. Music, therefore, if regarded as an expression of
the world, is in the highest degree a universal language, which
is related indeed to the universality of concepts, much as they
are related to the particular things. Its universality, however,
is by no means that empty universality of abstraction, but quite
of a different kind, and is united with thorough and distinct
definiteness. In this respect it resembles geometrical figures and
numbers, which are the universal forms of all possible objects of
experience and applicable to them all a priori, and yet are not
abstract but perceptible and thoroughly determined. All possible
efforts, excitements, and manifestations of will, all that goes on
in the heart of man and that reason includes in the wide, negative
concept of feeling, may be expressed by the infinite number of
possible melodies, but always in the universal, in the mere form,
without the material, always according to the thing-in-itself, not
the phenomenon, the inmost soul, as it were, of the phenomenon,
without the body. This deep relation which music has to the
true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable music
played to any scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to
disclose to us its most secret meaning, and appears as the most
accurate and distinct commentary upon it. This is so truly the
case, that whoever gives himself up entirely to the impression
of a symphony, seems to see all the possible events of life and
the world take place in himself, yet if he reflects, he can find no
likeness between the music and the things that passed before his
mind. For, as we have said, music is distinguished from all the
other arts by the fact that it is not a copy of the phenomenon,
or, more accurately, the adequate objectivity of will, but is the
direct copy of the will itself, and therefore exhibits itself as[340]
the metaphysical to everything physical in the world, and as the
thing-in-itself to every phenomenon. We might, therefore, just
as well call the world embodied music as embodied will; and
343
this is the reason why music makes every picture, and indeed
every scene of real life and of the world, at once appear with
higher significance, certainly all the more in proportion as its
melody is analogous to the inner spirit of the given phenomenon.
It rests upon this that we are able to set a poem to music as a
song, or a perceptible representation as a pantomime, or both
as an opera. Such particular pictures of human life, set to the
universal language of music, are never bound to it or correspond
to it with stringent necessity; but they stand to it only in the
relation of an example chosen at will to a general concept. In
the determinateness of the real, they represent that which music
expresses in the universality of mere form. For melodies are to
a certain extent, like general concepts, an abstraction from the
actual. This actual world, then, the world of particular things,
affords the object of perception, the special and individual, the
particular case, both to the universality of the concepts and to the
universality of the melodies. But these two universalities are in
a certain respect opposed to each other; for the concepts contain
particulars only as the first forms abstracted from perception,
as it were, the separated shell of things; thus they are, strictly
speaking, abstracta; music, on the other hand, gives the inmost
kernel which precedes all forms, or the heart of things. This
relation may be very well expressed in the language of the
schoolmen by saying the concepts are the universalia post rem,
but music gives the universalia ante rem, and the real world the
universalia in re. To the universal significance of a melody to
which a poem has been set, it is quite possible to set other equally
arbitrarily selected examples of the universal expressed in this
poem corresponding to the significance of the melody in the [341]
same degree. This is why the same composition is suitable to
many verses; and this is also what makes the vaudeville possible.
But that in general a relation is possible between a composition
and a perceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon
the fact that both are simply different expressions of the same
344 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
inner being of the world. When now, in the particular case, such
a relation is actually given, that is to say, when the composer
has been able to express in the universal language of music the
emotions of will which constitute the heart of an event, then the
melody of the song, the music of the opera, is expressive. But the
analogy discovered by the composer between the two must have
proceeded from the direct knowledge of the nature of the world
unknown to his reason, and must not be an imitation produced
with conscious intention by means of conceptions, otherwise the
music does not express the inner nature of the will itself, but
merely gives an inadequate imitation of its phenomenon. All
specially imitative music does this; for example, “The Seasons,”
by Haydn; also many passages of his “Creation,” in which
phenomena of the external world are directly imitated; also all
battle-pieces. Such music is entirely to be rejected.
The unutterable depth of all music by virtue of which it floats
through our consciousness as the vision of a paradise firmly
believed in yet ever distant from us, and by which also it is so
fully understood and yet so inexplicable, rests on the fact that it
restores to us all the emotions of our inmost nature, but entirely
without reality and far removed from their pain. So also the
seriousness which is essential to it, which excludes the absurd
from its direct and peculiar province, is to be explained by the
fact that its object is not the idea, with reference to which alone
deception and absurdity are possible; but its object is directly the
will, and this is essentially the most serious of all things, for it
is that on which all depends. How rich in content and full of[342]
significance the language of music is, we see from the repetitions,
as well as the Da capo, the like of which would be unbearable in
works composed in a language of words, but in music are very
appropriate and beneficial, for, in order to comprehend it fully,
we must hear it twice.
In the whole of this exposition of music I have been trying
to bring out clearly that it expresses in a perfectly universal
345
language, in a homogeneous material, mere tones, and with the
greatest determinateness and truth, the inner nature, the in-itself
of the world, which we think under the concept of will, because
will is its most distinct manifestation. Further, according to my
view and contention, philosophy is nothing but a complete and
accurate repetition or expression of the nature of the world in
very general concepts, for only in such is it possible to get a view
of that whole nature which will everywhere be adequate and
applicable. Thus, whoever has followed me and entered into my
mode of thought, will not think it so very paradoxical if I say, that
supposing it were possible to give a perfectly accurate, complete
explanation of music, extending even to particulars, that is to
say, a detailed repetition in concepts of what it expresses, this
would also be a sufficient repetition and explanation of the world
in concepts, or at least entirely parallel to such an explanation,
and thus it would be the true philosophy. Consequently the
saying of Leibnitz quoted above, which is quite accurate from a
lower standpoint, may be parodied in the following way to suit
our higher view of music: Musica est exercitium metaphysices
occultum nescientis se philosophari animi; for scire, to know,
always means to have fixed in abstract concepts. But further, on
account of the truth of the saying of Leibnitz, which is confirmed
in various ways, music, regarded apart from its æsthetic or
inner significance, and looked at merely externally and purely
empirically, is simply the means of comprehending directly and
in the concrete large numbers and complex relations of numbers, [343]
which otherwise we could only know indirectly by fixing them
in concepts. Therefore by the union of these two very different
but correct views of music we may arrive at a conception of the
possibility of a philosophy of number, such as that of Pythagoras
and of the Chinese in Y-King, and then interpret in this sense
the saying of the Pythagoreans which Sextus Empiricus quotes
(adv. Math., L. vii.): ƒÛ ±¡π∏ºÛ ¥μ ƒ± ¿±ΩƒΩ μ¿μøπ∫μΩ (numero
cuncta assimilantur). And if, finally, we apply this view to
346 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
the interpretation of harmony and melody given above, we
shall find that a mere moral philosophy without an explanation
of Nature, such as Socrates wanted to introduce, is precisely
analogous to a mere melody without harmony, which Rousseau
exclusively desired; and, in opposition to this mere physics and
metaphysics without ethics, will correspond to mere harmony
without melody. Allow me to add to these cursory observations
a few more remarks concerning the analogy of music with the
phenomenal world. We found in the second book that the highest
grade of the objectification of will, man, could not appear alone
and isolated, but presupposed the grades below him, as these
again presupposed the grades lower still. In the same way music,
which directly objectifies the will, just as the world does, is
complete only in full harmony. In order to achieve its full effect,
the high leading voice of the melody requires the accompaniment
of all the other voices, even to the lowest bass, which is to be
regarded as the origin of all. The melody itself enters as an
integral part into the harmony, as the harmony enters into it, and
only thus, in the full harmonious whole, music expresses what it
aims at expressing. Thus also the one will outside of time finds
its full objectification only in the complete union of all the steps
which reveal its nature in the innumerable ascending grades of
distinctness. The following analogy is also very remarkable. We
have seen in the preceding book that notwithstanding the self-[344]
adaptation of all the phenomena of will to each other as regards
their species, which constitutes their teleological aspect, there
yet remains an unceasing conflict between those phenomena as
individuals, which is visible at every grade, and makes the world
a constant battle-field of all those manifestations of one and the
same will, whose inner contradiction with itself becomes visible
through it. In music also there is something corresponding to
this. A complete, pure, harmonious system of tones is not
only physically but arithmetically impossible. The numbers
themselves by which the tones are expressed have inextricable
347
irrationality. There is no scale in which, when it is counted, every
fifth will be related to the keynote as 2 to 3, every major third
as 4 to 5, every minor third as 5 to 6, and so on. For if they are
correctly related to the keynote, they can no longer be so to each
other; because, for example, the fifth must be the minor third to
the third, &c. For the notes of the scale may be compared to
actors who must play now one part, now another. Therefore a
perfectly accurate system of music cannot even be thought, far
less worked out; and on this account all possible music deviates
from perfect purity; it can only conceal the discords essential to
it by dividing them among all the notes, i.e., by temperament.
On this see Chladni's “Akustik,” § 30, and his “Kurze Uebersicht
der Schall- und Klanglehre.”63
I might still have something to say about the way in which
music is perceived, namely, in and through time alone, with
absolute exclusion of space, and also apart from the influence
of the knowledge of causality, thus without understanding; for
the tones make the æsthetic impression as effect, and without
obliging us to go back to their causes, as in the case of perception.
I do not wish, however, to lengthen this discussion, as I have
perhaps already gone too much into detail with regard to [345]
some things in this Third Book, or have dwelt too much on
particulars. But my aim made it necessary, and it will be the less
disapproved if the importance and high worth of art, which is
seldom sufficiently recognised, be kept in mind. For if, according
to our view, the whole visible world is just the objectification,
the mirror, of the will, conducting it to knowledge of itself, and,
indeed, as we shall soon see, to the possibility of its deliverance;
and if, at the same time, the world as idea, if we regard it in
isolation, and, freeing ourselves from all volition, allow it alone
to take possession of our consciousness, is the most joy-giving
and the only innocent side of life; we must regard art as the higher
63 Cf. Ch. xxxix. of Supplement.
348 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
ascent, the more complete development of all this, for it achieves
essentially just what is achieved by the visible world itself, only
with greater concentration, more perfectly, with intention and
intelligence, and therefore may be called, in the full significance
of the word, the flower of life. If the whole world as idea is only
the visibility of will, the work of art is to render this visibility
more distinct. It is the camera obscura which shows the objects
more purely, and enables us to survey them and comprehend
them better. It is the play within the play, the stage upon the
stage in “Hamlet.”
The pleasure we receive from all beauty, the consolation which
art affords, the enthusiasm of the artist, which enables him to
forget the cares of life,—the latter an advantage of the man of
genius over other men, which alone repays him for the suffering
that increases in proportion to the clearness of consciousness,
and for the desert loneliness among men of a different race,—all
this rests on the fact that the in-itself of life, the will, existence
itself, is, as we shall see farther on, a constant sorrow, partly
miserable, partly terrible; while, on the contrary, as idea alone,
purely contemplated, or copied by art, free from pain, it presents
to us a drama full of significance. This purely knowable side of
the world, and the copy of it in any art, is the element of the artist.[346]
He is chained to the contemplation of the play, the objectification
of will; he remains beside it, does not get tired of contemplating
it and representing it in copies; and meanwhile he bears himself
the cost of the production of that play, i.e., he himself is the will
which objectifies itself, and remains in constant suffering. That
pure, true, and deep knowledge of the inner nature of the world
becomes now for him an end in itself: he stops there. Therefore
it does not become to him a quieter of the will, as, we shall see in
the next book, it does in the case of the saint who has attained to
resignation; it does not deliver him for ever from life, but only at
moments, and is therefore not for him a path out of life, but only
an occasional consolation in it, till his power, increased by this contemplation and at last tired of the play, lays hold on the real.
The St. Cecilia of Raphael may be regarded as a representation
of this transition. To the real, then, we now turn in the following
book.
