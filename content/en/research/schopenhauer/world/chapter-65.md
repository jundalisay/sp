<!-- In all the preceding investigations of human action, we
have been leading up to the final investigation, and have to a
considerable extent lightened the task of raising to abstract and
philosophical clearness, and exhibiting as a branch of our central
thought that special ethical significance of action which in life is
with perfect understanding denoted by the words good and bad. -->

I wish to trace back to their real meaning
those conceptions of good and bad which have been treated
by the philosophical writers of the day, very extraordinarily, as
simple conceptions, and thus incapable of analysis; so that the
reader may not remain involved in the senseless delusion that
they contain more than is actually the case, and express in and
for themselves all that is here necessary. 

I am in a position to
do this because in ethics I am no more disposed to take refuge behind the word good than formerly behind the words beautiful
and true, in order that by the adding a “ness,” which at the
present day is supposed to have a special √μºΩøƒ∑¬, and therefore
to be of assistance in various cases, and by assuming an air of
solemnity, I might induce the belief that by uttering three such
words I had done more than denote three very wide and abstract,
and consequently empty conceptions, of very different origin
and significance. 

Who is there, indeed, who has made himself
acquainted with the books of our own day to whom these three
words, admirable as are the things to which they originally refer,
have not become an aversion after he has seen for the thousandth
time how those who are least capable of thinking believe that
they have only to utter these three words with open mouth and
the air of an intelligent sheep, in order to have spoken the greatest
wisdom?

The explanation of the concept true has already been given in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, chap. v. § 29 et
seq. The content of the concept beautiful found for the first time
its proper explanation through the whole of the Third Book of the
present work. We now wish to discover the significance of the
concept good, which can be done with very little trouble. 

This
concept is essentially relative, and signifies the conformity of an
object to any definite effort of the will. Accordingly everything
that corresponds to the will in any of its expressions and fulfils
its end is thought through the concept good, however different
such things may be in other respects. Thus we speak of good
eating, good roads, good weather, good weapons, good omens,
and so on; in short, we call everything good that is just as we
wish it to be; and therefore that may be good in the eyes of
one man which is just the reverse in those of another. The
conception of the good divides itself into two sub-species—that
of the direct and present satisfaction of any volition, and that of
its indirect satisfaction which has reference to the future, i.e., the
agreeable and the useful. 

The conception of the opposite, so long as we are speaking of unconscious existence, is expressed by the
word bad, more rarely and abstractly by the word evil, which
thus denotes everything that does not correspond to any effort
of the will. 

Like all other things that can come into relation to
the will, men who are favourable to the ends which happen to
be desired, who further and befriend them, are called good, in
the same sense, and always with that relative limitation, which
shows itself, for example, in the expression, “I find this good,
but you don't.” 

Those, however, who are naturally disposed not
to hinder the endeavours of others, but rather to assist them,
and who are thus consistently helpful, benevolent, friendly, and
charitable, are called good men, on account of this relation of
their conduct to the will of others in general. 

In the case of
conscious beings (brutes and men) the contrary conception is
denoted in German, and, within the last hundred years or so,[466]
in French also, by a different word from that which is used in
speaking of unconscious existence; in German, böse; in French,
méchant; while in almost all other languages this distinction does
not exist; and ∫±∫ø¬, malus, cattivo, bad, are used of men, as
of lifeless things, which are opposed to the ends of a definite
individual will. Thus, having started entirely from the passive
element in the good, the inquiry could only proceed later to the
active element, and investigate the conduct of the man who is
called good, no longer with reference to others, but to himself;
specially setting itself the task of explaining both the purely
objective respect which such conduct produces in others, and
the peculiar contentment with himself which it clearly produces
in the man himself, since he purchases it with sacrifices of
another kind; and also, on the other hand, the inner pain which
accompanies the bad disposition, whatever outward advantages
it brings to him who entertains it. It was from this source
that the ethical systems, both the philosophical and those which
are supported by systems of religion, took their rise. 

Both seek
constantly in some way or other to connect happiness with virtue, the former either by means of the principle of contradiction or that
of sufficient reason, and thus to make happiness either identical
with or the consequence of virtue, always sophistically; the latter,
by asserting the existence of other worlds than that which alone
can be known to experience.79 In our system, on the contrary, [467]
virtue will show itself, not as a striving after happiness, that is,
well-being and life, but as an effort in quite an opposite direction.
It follows from what has been said above, that the good
is, according to its concept, ƒ…Ω ¿¡…¬ ƒπ; thus every good
is essentially relative, for its being consists in its relation to
a desiring will. Absolute good is, therefore, a contradiction
in terms; highest good, summum bonum, really signifies the
same thing—a final satisfaction of the will, after which no new
desire could arise,—a last motive, the attainment of which would
afford enduring satisfaction of the will. But, according to the
investigations which have already been conducted in this Fourth
79 Observe, in passing, that what gives every positive system of religion its
great strength, the point of contact through which it takes possession of the
soul, is entirely its ethical side. Not, however, the ethical side directly as such,
but as it appears firmly united and interwoven with the element of mythical
dogma which is present in every system of religion, and as intelligible only by
means of this. So much is this the case, that although the ethical significance
of action cannot be explained in accordance with the principle of sufficient
reason, yet since every mythus follows this principle, believers regard the
ethical significance of action as quite inseparable, and indeed as absolutely
identical, and regard every attack upon the mythus as an attack upon right and
virtue. 

This goes so far that among monotheistic nations atheism or godlessness
has become synonymous with the absence of all morality. To the priests such
confusions of conceptions are welcome, and only in consequence of them
could that horrible monstrosity fanaticism arise and govern, not merely single
individuals who happen to be specially perverse and bad, but whole nations,
and finally embody itself in the Western world as the Inquisition (to the honour
of mankind be it said that this only happened once in their history), which,
according to the latest and most authentic accounts, in Madrid alone (in the rest
of Spain there were many more such ecclesiastical dens of murderers) in 300
years put 300,000 human beings to a painful death at the stake on theological
grounds—a fact of which every zealot ought to be reminded whenever he

Book, such a consummation is not even thinkable. The will can
just as little cease from willing altogether on account of some
particular satisfaction, as time can end or begin; for it there is
no such thing as a permanent fulfilment which shall completely
and for ever satisfy its craving. It is the vessel of the Danaides;
for it there is no highest good, no absolute good, but always
a merely temporary good. If, however, we wish to give an
honorary position, as it were emeritus, to an old expression,
which from custom we do not like to discard altogether, we
may, metaphorically and figuratively, call the complete self-
effacement and denial of the will, the true absence of will, which
alone for ever stills and silences its struggle, alone gives that
contentment which can never again be disturbed, alone redeems
the world, and which we shall now soon consider at the close
of our whole investigation—the absolute good, the summum[468]
bonum—and regard it as the only radical cure of the disease of
which all other means are only palliations or anodynes. In this
sense the Greek ƒμªø¬ and also finis bonorum correspond to the
thing still better. So much for the words good and bad; now for
the thing itself.

If a man is always disposed to do wrong whenever the
opportunity presents itself, and there is no external power to
restrain him, we call him bad. According to our doctrine of
wrong, this means that such a man does not merely assert the will
to live as it appears in his own body, but in this assertion goes
so far that he denies the will which appears in other individuals.
This is shown by the fact that he desires their powers for the
service of his own will, and seeks to destroy their existence
when they stand in the way of its efforts. The ultimate source
of this is a high degree of egoism, the nature of which has been
already explained. Two things are here apparent. In the first
place, that in such a man an excessively vehement will to live
begins to make himself heard.

expresses itself, extending far beyond the assertion of his own
body; and, in the second place, that his knowledge, entirely
given up to the principle of sufficient reason and involved in
the principium individuationis, cannot get beyond the difference
which this latter principle establishes between his own person
and every one else. Therefore he seeks his own well-being alone,
completely indifferent to that of all others, whose existence is
to him altogether foreign and divided from his own by a wide
gulf, and who are indeed regarded by him as mere masks with no
reality behind them. And these two qualities are the constituent
elements of the bad character.
This great intensity of will is in itself and directly a constant
source of suffering. In the first place, because all volition as
such arises from want; that is, suffering. (Therefore, as will be
remembered, from the Third Book, the momentary cessation of [469]
all volition, which takes place whenever we give ourselves up to
æsthetic contemplation, as pure will-less subject of knowledge,
the correlative of the Idea, is one of the principal elements in our
pleasure in the beautiful.) Secondly, because, through the causal
connection of things, most of our desires must remain unfulfilled,
and the will is oftener crossed than satisfied, and therefore much
intense volition carries with it much intense suffering. For all
suffering is simply unfulfilled and crossed volition; and even
the pain of the body when it is injured or destroyed is as such
only possible through the fact that the body is nothing but the
will itself become object. Now on this account, because much
intense suffering is inseparable from much intense volition,
very bad men bear the stamp of inward suffering in the very
expression of the countenance; even when they have attained
every external happiness, they always look unhappy so long as
they are not transported by some momentary ecstasy and are
not dissembling. From this inward torment, which is absolutely
and directly essential to them, there finally proceeds that delight
in the suffering of others which does not spring from mere egoism, but is disinterested, and which constitutes wickedness
proper, rising to the pitch of cruelty. For this the suffering of
others is not a means for the attainment of the ends of its own
will, but an end in itself. The more definite explanation of this
phenomenon is as follows:—Since man is a manifestation of will
illuminated by the clearest knowledge, he is always contrasting
the actual and felt satisfaction of his will with the merely possible
satisfaction of it which knowledge presents to him. Hence arises
envy: every privation is infinitely increased by the enjoyment
of others, and relieved by the knowledge that others also suffer
the same privation. 

Those ills which are common to all and
inseparable from human life trouble us little, just as those which
belong to the climate, to the whole country. The recollection of[470]
greater sufferings than our own stills our pain; the sight of the
sufferings of others soothes our own. If, now, a man is filled
with an exceptionally intense pressure of will,—if with burning
eagerness he seeks to accumulate everything to slake the thirst
of his egoism, and thus experiences, as he inevitably must, that
all satisfaction is merely apparent, that the attained end never
fulfils the promise of the desired object, the final appeasing of
the fierce pressure of will, but that when fulfilled the wish only
changes its form, and now torments him in a new one; and
indeed that if at last all wishes are exhausted, the pressure of
will itself remains without any conscious motive, and makes
itself known to him with fearful pain as a feeling of terrible
desolation and emptiness; if from all this, which in the case of
the ordinary degrees of volition is only felt in a small measure,
and only produces the ordinary degree of melancholy, in the
case of him who is a manifestation of will reaching the point of
extraordinary wickedness, there necessarily springs an excessive
inward misery, an eternal unrest, an incurable pain; he seeks
indirectly the alleviation which directly is denied him,—seeks to
mitigate his own suffering by the sight of the suffering of others,
which at the same time he recognises as an expression of his
467
power. The suffering of others now becomes for him an end in
itself, and is a spectacle in which he delights; and thus arises
the phenomenon of pure cruelty, blood-thirstiness, which history
exhibits so often in the Neros and Domitians, in the African Deis,
in Robespierre, and the like.
The desire of revenge is closely related to wickedness. It
recompenses evil with evil, not with reference to the future,
which is the character of punishment, but merely on account of
what has happened, what is past, as such, thus disinterestedly,
not as a means, but as an end, in order to revel in the torment
which the avenger himself has inflicted on the offender. What [471]
distinguishes revenge from pure wickedness, and to some extent
excuses it, is an appearance of justice. For if the same act, which
is now revenge, were to be done legally, that is, according to a
previously determined and known rule, and in a society which
had sanctioned this rule, it would be punishment, and thus justice.
Besides the suffering which has been described, and which is
inseparable from wickedness, because it springs from the same
root, excessive vehemence of will, another specific pain quite
different from this is connected with wickedness, which is felt
in the case of every bad action, whether it be merely injustice
proceeding from egoism or pure wickedness, and according to
the length of its duration is called the sting of conscience or
remorse. Now, whoever remembers and has present in his mind
the content of the preceding portion of this Fourth Book, and
especially the truth explained at the beginning of it, that life itself
is always assured to the will to live, as its mere copy or mirror,
and also the exposition of eternal justice, will find that the sting
of conscience can have no other meaning than the following, i.e.,
its content, abstractly expressed, is what follows, in which two
parts are distinguished, which again, however, entirely coincide,
and must be thought as completely united.
However closely the veil of Mâyâ may envelop the mind of
the bad man, i.e., however firmly he may be involved in the
468 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
principium individuationis, according to which he regards his
person as absolutely different and separated by a wide gulf from
all others, a knowledge to which he clings with all his might, as it
alone suits and supports his egoism, so that knowledge is almost
always corrupted by will, yet there arises in the inmost depths
of his consciousness the secret presentiment that such an order
of things is only phenomenal, and that their real constitution is
quite different. He has a dim foreboding that, however much
time and space may separate him from other individuals and the[472]
innumerable miseries which they suffer, and even suffer through
him, and may represent them as quite foreign to him, yet in
themselves, and apart from the idea and its forms, it is the one
will to live appearing in them all, which here failing to recognise
itself, turns its weapons against itself, and, by seeking increased
happiness in one of its phenomena, imposes the greatest suffering
upon another. He dimly sees that he, the bad man, is himself
this whole will; that consequently he is not only the inflicter of
pain but also the endurer of it, from whose suffering he is only
separated and exempted by an illusive dream, the form of which
is space and time, which, however, vanishes away; that he must
in reality pay for the pleasure with the pain, and that all suffering
which he only knows as possible really concerns him as the will to
live, inasmuch as the possible and actual, the near and the distant
in time and space, are only different for the knowledge of the
individual, only by means of the principium individuationis, not
in themselves. This is the truth which mythically, i.e., adapted to
the principle of sufficient reason, and so translated into the form
of the phenomenal, is expressed in the transmigration of souls.
Yet it has its purest expression, free from all foreign admixture,
in that obscurely felt yet inconsolable misery called remorse. But
this springs also from a second immediate knowledge, which is
closely bound to the first—the knowledge of the strength with
which the will to live asserts itself in the wicked individual,
which extends far beyond his own individual phenomenon, to the
469
absolute denial of the same will appearing in other individuals.
Consequently the inward horror of the wicked man at his own
deed, which he himself tries to conceal, contains, besides that
presentment of the nothingness, the mere illusiveness of the
principium individuationis, and of the distinction established by
it between him and others; also the knowledge of the vehemence [473]
of his own will, the intensity with which he has seized upon life
and attached himself closely to it, even that life whose terrible
side he sees before him in the misery of those who are oppressed
by him, and with which he is yet so firmly united, that just on
this account the greatest atrocity proceeds from him himself, as
a means for the fuller assertion of his own will. He recognises
himself as the concentrated manifestation of the will to live,
feels to what degree he is given up to life, and with it also to
innumerable sufferings which are essential to it, for it has infinite
time and infinite space to abolish the distinction between the
possible and the actual, and to change all the sufferings which as
yet are merely known to him into sufferings he has experienced.
The millions of years of constant rebirth certainly exist, like the
whole past and future, only in conception; occupied time, the
form of the phenomenon of the will, is only the present, and
for the individual time is ever new: it seems to him always as
if he had newly come into being. For life is inseparable from
the will to live, and the only form of life is the present. Death
(the repetition of the comparison must be excused) is like the
setting of the sun, which is only apparently swallowed up by the
night, but in reality, itself the source of all light, burns without
intermission, brings new days to new worlds, is always rising and
always setting. Beginning and end only concern the individual
through time, the form of the phenomenon for the idea. Outside
time lies only the will, Kant's thing-in-itself, and its adequate
objectification, the Idea of Plato. Therefore suicide affords no
escape; what every one in his inmost consciousness wills, that
must he be; and what every one is, that he wills. Thus, besides the merely felt knowledge of the illusiveness and nothingness
of the forms of the idea which separate individuals, it is the
self-knowledge of one's own will and its degree that gives the
sting to conscience. 

The course of life draws the image of the[474]
empirical character, whose original is the intelligible character,
and horrifies the wicked man by this image. He is horrified all
the same whether the image is depicted in large characters, so
that the world shares his horror, or in such small ones that he
alone sees it, for it only concerns him directly. The past would
be a matter of indifference, and could not pain the conscience if
the character did not feel itself free from all time and unalterable
by it, so long as it does not deny itself. Therefore things which
are long past still weigh on the conscience. The prayer, “Lead
me not into temptation,” means, “Let me not see what manner
of person I am.” In the might with which the bad man asserts
life, and which exhibits itself to him in the sufferings which he
inflicts on others, he measures how far he is from the surrender
and denial of that will, the only possible deliverance from the
world and its miseries. He sees how far he belongs to it, and
how firmly he is bound to it; the known suffering of others has
no power to move him; he is given up to life and felt suffering.

It remains hidden whether this will ever break and overcome the vehemence of his will.
This exposition of the significance and inner nature of the bad,
which as mere feeling, i.e., not as distinct, abstract knowledge, is
the content of remorse, will gain distinctness and completeness
by the similar consideration of the good as a quality of human
will, and finally of absolute resignation and holiness, which
proceeds from it when it has attained its highest grade. For
opposites always throw light upon each other, and the day at
once reveals both itself and the night, as Spinoza admirably
remarks.
