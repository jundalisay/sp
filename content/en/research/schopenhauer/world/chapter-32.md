Idea and thing-in-itself are not entirely one and the same.

This is in spite of the inner agreement between Kant and Plato, and
the identity of the aim they had before them, or the conception
of the world which roused them and led them to philosophise.

The Idea is for us rather the direct, and therefore adequate,
objectivity of the thing-in-itself, which is, however, itself the
will—the will as not yet objectified, not yet become idea. For
the thing-in-itself must, even according to Kant, be free from
all the forms connected with knowing as such; and it is merely
an error on his part (as is shown in the Appendix) that he did
not count among these forms, before all others, that of being
object for a subject, for it is the first and most universal form
of all phenomena, i.e., of all idea; he should therefore have
distinctly denied objective existence to his thing-in-itself, which
would have saved him from a great inconsistency that was soon
discovered. The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, is necessarily
object, something known, an idea, and in that respect is different
from the thing-in-itself, but in that respect only. It has merely
laid aside the subordinate forms of the phenomenon, all of which
we include in the principle of sufficient reason, or rather it has
not yet assumed them; but it has retained the first and most
universal form, that of the idea in general, the form of being
object for a subject. It is the forms which are subordinate to this (whose general expression is the principle of sufficient
reason) that multiply the Idea in particular transitory individuals,
whose number is a matter of complete indifference to the Idea.


The principle of sufficient reason is thus again the form into
which the Idea enters when it appears in the knowledge of the
subject as individual. The particular thing that manifests itself in

pg. 49, and Buhle's “History of Philosophy,” vol. vi. pp. 802-815 and 823. -->

accordance with the principle of sufficient reason is thus only an
indirect objectification of the thing-in-itself (which is the will),
for between it and the thing-in-itself stands the Idea as the only
direct objectivity of the will, because it has assumed none of the
special forms of knowledge as such, except that of the idea in
general, i.e., the form of being object for a subject. Therefore
it alone is the most adequate objectivity of the will or thing-in-
itself which is possible; indeed it is the whole thing-in-itself, only
under the form of the idea; and here lies the ground of the great
agreement between Plato and Kant, although, in strict accuracy,
that of which they speak is not the same. But the particular things
are no really adequate objectivity of the will, for in them it is
obscured by those forms whose general expression is the principle
of sufficient reason, but which are conditions of the knowledge
which belongs to the individual as such. If it is allowable to
draw conclusions from an impossible presupposition, we would,
in fact, no longer know particular things, nor events, nor change,
nor multiplicity, but would comprehend only Ideas,—only the
grades of the objectification of that one will, of the thing-in-itself,
in pure unclouded knowledge. Consequently our world would be
a nunc stans, if it were not that, as knowing subjects, we are also
individuals, i.e., our perceptions come to us through the medium
of a body, from the affections of which they proceed, and which
is itself only concrete willing, objectivity of the will, and thus is
an object among objects, and as such comes into the knowing
consciousness in the only way in which an object can, through [228]
the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, and consequently
already presupposes, and therefore brings in, time, and all other
forms which that principle expresses. Time is only the broken
and piecemeal view which the individual being has of the Ideas,
which are outside time, and consequently eternal. Therefore
Plato says time is the moving picture of eternity: ±π…Ωø¬ μπ∫…Ω
