Happiness is always essentially only negative, and never positive.

It is not an original gratification coming to us of itself, but is always the satisfaction of a wish. 

The wish, i.e., some want, is the condition which precedes every pleasure. 

But with the satisfaction the wish and therefore the pleasure cease.

Thus the satisfaction or the pleasing can never be more than the deliverance from a pain, from a want; for such is not only every actual, open sorrow, but every desire, the importunity of which disturbs our peace, and, indeed, the deadening ennui also that makes life a burden to us. It is, however, so hard to attain or achieve anything; difficulties and troubles without end are opposed to every purpose, and at every step hindrances accumulate. But when finally everything is overcome and attained, nothing can ever be gained but deliverance from some sorrow or desire, so that we find ourselves just in the same position as we occupied before this sorrow or desire appeared.

All that is even directly given us is merely the want, i.e., the pain. The satisfaction and the pleasure we can only know indirectly through the remembrance of the preceding suffering and want, which ceases with its appearance. Hence it arises that we are not properly conscious of the blessings and advantages we actually possess, nor do we prize them, but think of them merely as a matter of course, for they gratify us only negatively by restraining suffering. 

Only when we have lost them do we become sensible of their value; for the want, the privation, the sorrow, is the positive, communicating itself directly to us. Thus also we are pleased by the remembrance of past need, sickness, want, and such like, because this is the only means of enjoying the present blessings. 

It cannot be denied that in this respect, and from this standpoint of egoism, which is the form of the will to live, the sight or the description of the sufferings of others affords us satisfaction and pleasure in precisely the way Lucretius beautifully and frankly expresses it in the beginning of the Second Book—

“Suave, mari magno, turbantibus æquora ventis,
E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem:
Non, quia vexari quemquam est jucunda voluptas;
Sed, quibus ipse malis careas, quia cernere suave est.”

Yet we shall see farther on that this kind of pleasure, through [413]
knowledge of our own well-being obtained in this way, lies very
near the source of real, positive wickedness.

That all happiness is only of a negative not a positive nature,
that just on this account it cannot be lasting satisfaction and
gratification, but merely delivers us from some pain or want
which must be followed either by a new pain, or by languor,
empty longing, and ennui; this finds support in art, that true
mirror of the world and life, and especially in poetry. Every
epic and dramatic poem can only represent a struggle, an effort,
and fight for happiness, never enduring and complete happiness
itself. It conducts its heroes through a thousand difficulties and
dangers to the goal; as soon as this is reached, it hastens to
412 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
let the curtain fall; for now there would remain nothing for it
to do but to show that the glittering goal in which the hero
expected to find happiness had only disappointed him, and that
after its attainment he was no better off than before. Because
a genuine enduring happiness is not possible, it cannot be the
subject of art. Certainly the aim of the idyll is the description of
such a happiness, but one also sees that the idyll as such cannot
continue. The poet always finds that it either becomes epical in
his hands, and in this case it is a very insignificant epic, made
up of trifling sorrows, trifling delights, and trifling efforts—this
is the commonest case—or else it becomes a merely descriptive
poem, describing the beauty of nature, i.e., pure knowing free
from will, which certainly, as a matter of fact, is the only
pure happiness, which is neither preceded by suffering or want,
nor necessarily followed by repentance, sorrow, emptiness, or
satiety; but this happiness cannot fill the whole life, but is only
possible at moments. What we see in poetry we find again in
music; in the melodies of which we have recognised the universal
expression of the inmost history of the self-conscious will, the
most secret life, longing, suffering, and delight; the ebb and[414]
flow of the human heart. Melody is always a deviation from
the keynote through a thousand capricious wanderings, even to
the most painful discord, and then a final return to the keynote
which expresses the satisfaction and appeasing of the will, but
with which nothing more can then be done, and the continuance
of which any longer would only be a wearisome and unmeaning
monotony corresponding to ennui.

All that we intend to bring out clearly through these
investigations, the impossibility of attaining lasting satisfaction
and the negative nature of all happiness, finds its explanation
in what is shown at the conclusion of the Second Book: that
the will, of which human life, like every phenomenon, is the
objectification, is a striving without aim or end. We find the
stamp of this endlessness imprinted upon all the parts of its whole manifestation, from its most universal form, endless time
and space, up to the most perfect of all phenomena, the life and
efforts of man. We may theoretically assume three extremes
of human life, and treat them as elements of actual human life.

First, the powerful will, the strong passions (Radscha-Guna). It
appears in great historical characters; it is described in the epic
and the drama. But it can also show itself in the little world,
for the size of the objects is measured here by the degree in
which they influence the will, not according to their external
relations. Secondly, pure knowing, the comprehension of the
Ideas, conditioned by the freeing of knowledge from the service
of will: the life of genius (Satwa-Guna). Thirdly and lastly, the
greatest lethargy of the will, and also of the knowledge attaching
to it, empty longing, life-benumbing languor (Tama-Guna). The
life of the individual, far from becoming permanently fixed in
one of these extremes, seldom touches any of them, and is for the
most part only a weak and wavering approach to one or the other
side, a needy desiring of trifling objects, constantly recurring, and
so escaping ennui. It is really incredible how meaningless and [415]
void of significance when looked at from without, how dull and
unenlightened by intellect when felt from within, is the course of
the life of the great majority of men. It is a weary longing and
complaining, a dream-like staggering through the four ages of
life to death, accompanied by a series of trivial thoughts. Such
men are like clockwork, which is wound up, and goes it knows
not why; and every time a man is begotten and born, the clock of
human life is wound up anew, to repeat the same old piece it has
played innumerable times before, passage after passage, measure
after measure, with insignificant variations. Every individual,
every human being and his course of life, is but another short
dream of the endless spirit of nature, of the persistent will to
live; is only another fleeting form, which it carelessly sketches
on its infinite page, space and time; allows to remain for a time
so short that it vanishes into nothing in comparison with these, and then obliterates to make new room. And yet, and here lies
the serious side of life, every one of these fleeting forms, these
empty fancies, must be paid for by the whole will to live, in all
its activity, with many and deep sufferings, and finally with a
bitter death, long feared and coming at last. This is why the sight
of a corpse makes us suddenly so serious.

The life of every individual, if we survey it as a whole and
in general, and only lay stress upon its most significant features,
is really always a tragedy, but gone through in detail, it has the
character of a comedy. For the deeds and vexations of the day,
the restless irritation of the moment, the desires and fears of the
week, the mishaps of every hour, are all through chance, which
is ever bent upon some jest, scenes of a comedy. But the never-
satisfied wishes, the frustrated efforts, the hopes unmercifully
crushed by fate, the unfortunate errors of the whole life, with
increasing suffering and death at the end, are always a tragedy.[416]
Thus, as if fate would add derision to the misery of our existence,
our life must contain all the woes of tragedy, and yet we cannot
even assert the dignity of tragic characters, but in the broad detail
of life must inevitably be the foolish characters of a comedy.

But however much great and small trials may fill human life,
they are not able to conceal its insufficiency to satisfy the spirit;
they cannot hide the emptiness and superficiality of existence,
nor exclude ennui, which is always ready to fill up every pause
that care may allow. Hence it arises that the human mind, not
content with the cares, anxieties, and occupations which the
actual world lays upon it, creates for itself an imaginary world
also in the form of a thousand different superstitions, then finds
all manner of employment with this, and wastes time and strength
upon it, as soon as the real world is willing to grant it the rest
which it is quite incapable of enjoying. This is accordingly most
markedly the case with nations for which life is made easy by
the congenial nature of the climate and the soil, most of all with
the Hindus, then with the Greeks, the Romans, and later with the Italians, the Spaniards, &c. Demons, gods, and saints man creates
in his own image; and to them he must then unceasingly bring
offerings, prayers, temple decorations, vows and their fulfilment,
pilgrimages, salutations, ornaments for their images, &c. 

Their
service mingles everywhere with the real, and, indeed, obscures
it. Every event of life is regarded as the work of these beings; the
intercourse with them occupies half the time of life, constantly
sustains hope, and by the charm of illusion often becomes more
interesting than intercourse with real beings. It is the expression
and symptom of the actual need of mankind, partly for help and
support, partly for occupation and diversion; and if it often works
in direct opposition to the first need, because when accidents
and dangers arise valuable time and strength, instead of being [417]
directed to warding them off, are uselessly wasted on prayers and
offerings; it serves the second end all the better by this imaginary
converse with a visionary spirit world; and this is the by no
means contemptible gain of all superstitions.
