From the fact that we are able spontaneously to assign and
determine the laws of relations in space without having recourse
to experience, Plato concludes (Meno, p. 353, Bip.) that all
learning is mere recollection. Kant, on the other hand, concludes
that space is subjectively conditioned, and merely a form of the
faculty of knowledge. How far, in this regard, does Kant stand
above Plato!

Cogito, ergo sum, is an analytical judgment.

Indeed Parmenides held it to be an identical judgment: “Ä¿ 3±Á ±ÅÄ¿
1⁄2¿μ11⁄2 μÃÄ1 Äμ o±1 μ11⁄2±1” (nam intelligere et esse idem est, Clem.
Alex. Strom., vi. 2, § 23). As such, however, or indeed even
as an analytical judgment, it cannot contain any special wisdom;
nor yet if, to go still deeper, we seek to deduce it as a conclusion
from the major premise, non-entis nulla sunt prædicata. But
with this proposition what Descartes really wished to express
was the great truth that immediate certainty belongs only to
self-consciousness, to what is subjective. To what is objective,
on the other hand, thus to everything else, only indirect certainty
belongs; for it is arrived at through self-consciousness; and being
thus merely at second hand, it is to be regarded as problematical.
Upon this depends the value of this celebrated proposition. As its
opposite we may set up, in the sense of the Kantian philosophy,
cogito, ergo est, that is, exactly as I think certain relations
in things (the mathematical), they must always occur in all
possible experience;—this was an important, profound, and a
late apperçu, which appeared in the form of the problem as to
the possibility of synthetic judgments a priori, and has actually
opened up the way to a deeper knowledge. This problem is the
watchword of the Kantian philosophy, as the former proposition
is that of the Cartesian, and shows μ3⁄4 ¿1É1⁄2 μ1Ã ¿1±.
Kant very fitly places his investigations concerning time and
space at the head of all the rest. For to the speculative mind
[202]192
[203]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
these questions present themselves before all others: what is
time?—what is this that consists of mere movement, without
anything that moves it?—and what is space? this omnipresent
nothing, out of which nothing that exists can escape without
ceasing to be anything at all?
That time and space depend on the subject, are the mode in
which the process of objective apperception is brought about
in the brain, has already a sufficient proof in the absolute
impossibility of thinking away time and space, while we can
very easily think away everything that is presented in them. The
hand can leave go of everything except itself. However, I wish
here to illustrate by a few examples and deductions the more
exact proofs of this truth which are given by Kant, not for the
purpose of refuting stupid objections, but for the use of those
who may have to expound Kant's doctrine in future.
“A right-angled equilateral triangle” contains no logical
contradiction; for the predicates do not by any means cancel
the subject, nor are they inconsistent with each other. It is
only when their object is constructed in pure perception that the
impossibility of their union in it appears. Now if on this account
we were to regard this as a contradiction, then so would every
physical impossibility, only discovered to be such after the lapse
of centuries, be a contradiction; for example, the composition
of a metal from its elements, or a mammal with more or fewer
than seven cervical vertebra,14 or horns and upper incisors in the
same animal. But only logical impossibility is a contradiction,
not physical, and just as little mathematical. Equilateral and
rectangled do not contradict each other (they coexist in the
square), nor does either of them contradict a triangle. Therefore
the incompatibility of the above conceptions can never be known
by mere thinking, but is only discovered by perception—merely
mental perception, however, which requires no experience, no

real object. We should also refer here to the proposition of
Giordano Bruno, which is also found in Aristotle: “An infinitely
large body is necessarily immovable”—a proposition which
cannot rest either upon experience or upon the principle of
contradiction, since it speaks of things which cannot occur in any
experience, and the conceptions “infinitely large” and “movable”
do not contradict each other; but it is only pure perception that
informs us that motion demands a space outside the body, while
its infinite size leaves no space over. Suppose, now, it should
be objected to the first mathematical example that it is only a
question of how complete a conception of a triangle the person
judging has: if the conception is quite complete it will also
contain the impossibility of a triangle being rectangular and also
equilateral. The answer to this is: assume that his conception is
not so complete, yet without recourse to experience he can, by the
mere construction of the triangle in his imagination, extend his
conception of it and convince himself for ever of the impossibility
of this combination of these conceptions. This process, however,
is a synthetic judgment a priori, that is, a judgment through
which, independently of all experience, and yet with validity for
all experience, we form and perfect our conceptions. For, in
general, whether a given judgment is analytical or synthetical
can only be determined in the particular case according as the
conception of the subject in the mind of the person judging is
more or less complete. The conception “cat” contains in the mind
of a Cuvier a hundred times more than in that of his servant;
therefore the same judgments about it will be synthetical for
the latter, and only analytical for the former. But if we take
the conceptions objectively, and now wish to decide whether a
given judgment is analytical or synthetical, we must change the
predicate into its contradictory opposite, and apply this to the
subject without a copula. If this gives a contradictio in adjecto,
then the judgment was analytical; otherwise it was synthetical.
That Arithmetic rests on the pure intuition or perception of
[204]194
[205]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
time is not so evident as that Geometry is based upon that of
space.15 It can be proved, however, in the following manner.
All counting consists in the repeated affirmation of unity. Only
for the purpose of always knowing how often we have already
affirmed unity do we mark it each time with another word:
these are the numerals. Now repetition is only possible through
succession. But succession, that is, being after one another,
depends directly upon the intuition or perception of time. It is
a conception which can only be understood by means of this;
and thus counting also is only possible by means of time. This
dependence of all counting upon time is also betrayed by the
fact that in all languages multiplication is expressed by “time,”
thus by a time-concept: sexies, 3⁄4±o1Â, six fois, sex mal. But
simple counting is already a multiplication by one, and for this
reason in Pestalozzi's educational establishment the children are
always made to multiply thus: “Two times two is four times one.”
Aristotle already recognised the close relationship of number and
time, and expounded it in the fourteenth chapter of the fourth book
of the “Physics.” Time is for him “the number of motion” (“A
15
This, however, does not excuse a professor of philosophy who, sitting
in Kant's chair, expresses himself thus: “That mathematics as such contains
arithmetic and geometry is correct. It is incorrect, however, to conceive
arithmetic as the science of time, really for no other reason than to give
a pendant (sic) to geometry as the science of space” (Rosenkranz in the
“Deutschen Museum,” 1857, May 14, No. 20). This is the fruit of Hegelism.
If the mind is once thoroughly debauched with its senseless jargon, serious
Kantian philosophy will no longer enter it. The audacity to talk at random
about what one does not understand has been inherited from the master, and
one comes in the end to condemn without ceremony the fundamental teaching
of a great genius in a tone of peremptory decision, just as if it were Hegelian
foolery. We must not, however, fail to notice that these little people struggle
to escape from the track of great thinkers. They would therefore have done
better not to attack Kant, but to content themselves with giving their public
full details about God, the soul, the actual freedom of the will, and whatever
belongs to that sort of thing, and then to have indulged in a private luxury in
their dark back-shop, the philosophical journal; there they may do whatever
they like without constraint, for no one sees it.

ÇÁ¿1⁄2¿Â ±Á1 ̧1⁄4¿Â μÃÄ1 o11⁄2·ÃμÉÂ”). He very profoundly suggests
the question whether time could be if the soul were not, and
answers it in the negative. If arithmetic had not this pure intuition
or perception of time at its foundation, it would be no science
a priori, and therefore its propositions would not have infallible
certainty.

Although time, like space, is the form of knowledge of the
subject, yet, just like space, it presents itself as independent of the
subject and completely objective. Against our will, or without
our knowledge, it goes fast or slow. We ask what o'clock it
is; we investigate time, as if it were something quite objective.
And what is this objective existence? Not the progress of the
stars, or of the clocks, which merely serve to measure the course
of time itself, but it is something different from all things, and
yet, like them, independent of our will and knowledge. It exists
only in the heads of percipient beings, but the uniformity of its
course and its independence of the will give it the authority of
objectivity.

Time is primarily the form of inner sense. Anticipating the
following book, I remark that the only object of inner sense is
the individual will of the knowing subject. Time is therefore the
form by means of which self-consciousness becomes possible
for the individual will, which originally and in itself is without
knowledge. In it the nature of the will, which in itself is simple
and identical, appears drawn out into a course of life. But just
on account of this original simplicity and identity of what thus
exhibits itself, its character remains always precisely the same,
and hence also the course of life itself retains throughout the
same key-note, indeed its multifarious events and scenes are at
bottom just like variations of one and the same theme.
The a priori nature of the law of causality has, by Englishmen
and Frenchmen, sometimes not been seen at all, sometimes not
rightly conceived of; and therefore some of them still prosecute
the earlier attempts to find for it an empirical origin. Maine de
[206]196
[207]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Biran places this in the experience that the act of will as cause
is followed by the movement of the body as effect. But this
fact itself is untrue. We certainly do not recognise the really
immediate act of will as something different from the action of
the body, and the two as connected by the bond of causality;
but both are one and indivisible. Between them there is no
succession; they are simultaneous. They are one and the same
thing, apprehended in a double manner. That which makes
itself known to inner apprehension (self-consciousness) as the
real act of will exhibits itself at once in external perception,
in which the body exists objectively as an action of the body.
That physiologically the action of the nerve precedes that of
the muscle is here immaterial, for it does not come within self-
consciousness; and we are not speaking here of the relation
between muscle and nerve, but of that between the act of will
and the action of the body. Now this does not present itself as a
causal relation. If these two presented themselves to us as cause
and effect their connection would not be so incomprehensible to
us as it actually is; for what we understand from its cause we
understand as far as there is an understanding of things generally.
On the other hand, the movement of our limbs by means of mere
acts of will is indeed a miracle of such common occurrence that
we no longer observe it; but if we once turn our attention to it
we become keenly conscious of the incomprehensibility of the
matter, just because in this we have something before us which
we do not understand as the effect of a cause. This apprehension,
then, could never lead us to the idea of causality, for that never
appears in it at all. Maine de Biran himself recognises the
perfect simultaneousness of the act of will and the movement
(Nouvelles Considérations des Rapports du Physique au Moral,
p. 377, 378). In England Thomas Reid (On the First Principles
of Contingent Truths, Essay IV. c. 5) already asserted that the
knowledge of the causal relation has its ground in the nature of
the faculty of knowledge itself. Quite recently Thomas Brown, inChapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
197
his very tediously composed book, “Inquiry into the Relation of
Cause and Effect,” 4th edit., 1835, says much the same thing, that
that knowledge springs from an innate, intuitive, and instinctive
conviction; thus he is at bottom upon the right path. Quite
unpardonable, however, is the crass ignorance on account of
which in this book of 476 pages, of which 130 are devoted to
the refutation of Hume, absolutely no mention is made of Kant,
who cleared up the question more than seventy years ago. If
Latin had remained the exclusive language of science such a
thing would not have occurred. In spite of Brown's exposition,
which in the main is correct, a modification of the doctrine set
up by Maine de Biran, of the empirical origin of the fundamental
knowledge of the causal relation, has yet found acceptance in
England; for it is not without a certain degree of plausibility. It
is this, that we abstract the law of causality from the perceived
effect of our own body upon other bodies. This was already
refuted by Hume. I, however, have shown that it is untenable in
my work, “Ueber den Willen in der Natur” (p. 75 of the second
edition, p. 82 of the third), from the fact that since we apprehend
both our own and other bodies objectively in spatial perception,
the knowledge of causality must already be there, because it
is a condition of such perception. The one genuine proof that
we are conscious of the law of causality before all experience
lies in the necessity of making a transition from the sensation,
which is only empirically given, to its cause, in order that it
may become perception of the external world. Therefore I have
substituted this proof for the Kantian, the incorrectness of which
I have shown. A most full and thorough exposition of the whole
of this important subject, which is only touched on here, the a
priori nature of the law of causality and the intellectual nature of
empirical perception, will be found in my essay on the principle
of sufficient reason, § 21, to which I refer, in order to avoid the
necessity of repeating here what is said there. I have also shown
there the enormous difference between the mere sensation of the
[208]198
[209]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
senses and the perception of an objective world, and discovered
the wide gulf that lies between the two. The law of causality
alone can bridge across this gulf, and it presupposes for its
application the two other forms which are related to it, space and
time. Only by means of these three combined is the objective
idea attained to. Now whether the sensation from which we start
to arrive at apprehension arises through the resistance which is
suffered by our muscular exertion, or through the impression
of light upon the retina, or of sound upon the nerves of the
brain, &c. &c., is really a matter of indifference. The sensation
always remains a mere datum for the understanding, which alone
is capable of apprehending it as the effect of a cause different
from itself, which the understanding now perceives as external,
i.e., as something occupying and filling space, which is also a
form inherent in the intellect prior to all experience. Without
this intellectual operation, for which the forms must lie ready in
us, the perception of an objective, external world could never
arise from a mere sensation within our skin. How can it ever
be supposed that the mere feeling of being hindered in intended
motion, which occurs also in lameness, could be sufficient for
this? We may add to this that before I attempt to affect external
things they must necessarily have affected me as motives. But
this almost presupposes the apprehension of the external world.
According to the theory in question (as I have remarked in the
place referred to above), a man born without arms and legs could
never attain to the idea of causality, and consequently could
never arrive at the apprehension of the external world. But that
this is not the case is proved by a fact communicated in Froriep's
Notizen, July 1838, No. 133—the detailed account, accompanied
by a likeness, of an Esthonian girl, Eva Lauk, then fourteen years
old, who was born entirely without arms or legs. The account
concludes with these words: “According to the evidence of her
mother, her mental development had been quite as quick as that
of her brothers and sisters; she attained just as soon as theyChapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.

did to a correct judgment of size and distance, yet without the
assistance of hands.—Dorpat, 1st March 1838, Dr. A. Hueck.”
Hume's doctrine also, that the conception of causality arises
from the custom of seeing two states constantly following each
other, finds a practical refutation in the oldest of all successions,
that of day and night, which no one has ever held to be cause
and effect of each other. And the same succession also refutes
Kant's false assertion that the objective reality of a succession is
only known when we apprehend the two succeeding events as
standing in the relation of cause and effect to each other. Indeed
the converse of this doctrine of Kant's is true. We know which
of the two connected events is the cause and which the effect,
empirically, only in the succession. Again, on the other hand, the
absurd assertion of several professors of philosophy in our own
day that cause and effect are simultaneous can be refuted by the
fact that in cases in which the succession cannot be perceived on
account of its great rapidity, we yet assume it with certainty a
priori, and with it the lapse of a certain time. Thus, for example,
we know that a certain time must elapse between the falling of
the flint and the projection of the bullet, although we cannot
perceive it, and that this time must further be divided between
several events that occur in a strictly determined succession—the
falling of the flint, the striking of the spark, ignition, the spread
of the fire, the explosion, and the projection of the bullet. No
man ever perceived this succession of events; but because we
know which is the cause of the others, we thereby also know
which must precede the others in time, and consequently also that
during the course of the whole series a certain time must elapse,
although it is so short that it escapes our empirical apprehension;
for no one will assert that the projection of the bullet is actually
simultaneous with the falling of the flint. Thus not only the
law of causality, but also its relation to time, and the necessity
of the succession of cause and effect, is known to us a priori.
If we know which of two events is the cause and which is the
[210]200
[211]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
effect, we also know which precedes the other in time; if, on the
contrary, we do not know which is cause and which effect, but
only know in general that they are causally connected, we seek
to discover the succession empirically, and according to that we
determine which is the cause and which the effect. The falseness
of the assertion that cause and effect are simultaneous further
appears from the following consideration. An unbroken chain
of causes and effects fills the whole of time. (For if this chain
were broken the world would stand still, or in order to set it in
motion again an effect without a cause would have to appear.)
Now if every effect were simultaneous with its cause, then every
effect would be moved up into the time of its cause, and a chain
of causes and effects containing as many links as before would
fill no time at all, still less an infinite time, but would be all
together in one moment. Thus, under the assumption that cause
and effect are simultaneous, the course of the world shrinks up
into an affair of a moment. This proof is analogous to the proof
that every sheet of paper must have a certain thickness, because
otherwise the whole book would have none. To say when the
cause ceases and the effect begins is in almost all cases difficult,
and often impossible. For the changes (i.e., the succession of
states) are continuous, like the time which they fill, and therefore
also, like it, they are infinitely divisible. But their succession
is as necessarily determined and as unmistakable as that of the
moments of time itself, and each of them is called, with reference
to the one which precedes it, “effect,” and with reference to the
one which follows it, “cause.”
Every change in the material world can only take place
because another has immediately preceded it: this is the true and
the whole content of the law of causality. But no conception has
been more misused in philosophy than that of cause, by means of
the favourite trick or blunder of conceiving it too widely, taking
it too generally, through abstract thinking. Since Scholasticism,
indeed properly since Plato and Aristotle, philosophy has been forChapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.

the most part a systematic misuse of general conceptions. Such,
for example, are substance, ground, cause, the good, perfection,
necessity, and very many others. A tendency of the mind to work
with such abstract and too widely comprehended conceptions
has shown itself almost at all times. It may ultimately rest upon
a certain indolence of the intellect, which finds it too difficult
a task to be constantly controlling thought by perception. By
degrees such unduly wide conceptions come to be used almost
like algebraical symbols, and tossed about like them, and thus
philosophy is reduced to a mere process of combination, a kind
of reckoning which (like all calculations) employs and demands
only the lower faculties. Indeed there finally results from this a
mere juggling with words, of which the most shocking example
is afforded us by the mind-destroying Hegelism, in which it is
carried to the extent of pure nonsense. But Scholasticism also
often degenerated into word-juggling. Nay even the “Topi”
of Aristotle—very abstract principles, conceived with absolute
generality, which one could apply to the most different kinds
of subjects, and always bring into the field in arguing either
pro or contra—have also their origin in this misuse of general
conceptions. We find innumerable examples of the way the
Schoolmen worked with such abstractions in their writings,
especially in those of Thomas Aquinas. But philosophy really
pursued the path which was entered on by the Schoolmen down
to the time of Locke and Kant, who at last bethought themselves
as to the origin of conceptions. Indeed we find Kant himself,
in his earlier years, still upon that path, in his “Proof of the
Existence of God” (p. 191 of the first volume of Rosenkranz's
edition), where the conceptions substance, ground, reality, are
used in such a way as would never have been possible if he had
gone back to the source of these conceptions and to their true
content which is determined thereby. For then he would have
found as the source and content of substance simply matter, of
ground (if things of the real world are in question) simply cause,
[212]202
[213]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
that is, the prior change which brings about the later change, &c.
It is true that in this case such an investigation would not have
led to the intended result. But everywhere, as here, such unduly
wide conceptions, under which, therefore, more was subsumed
than their true content would have justified, there have arisen
false principles, and from these false systems. Spinoza's whole
method of demonstration rests upon such uninvestigated and
too widely comprehended conceptions. Now here lies the great
merit of Locke, who, in order to counteract all that dogmatic
unreality, insisted upon the investigation of the origin of the
conceptions, and thus led back to perception and experience.
Bacon had worked in a similar frame of mind, yet more with
reference to Physics than to Metaphysics. Kant followed the path
entered upon by Locke, but in a higher sense and much further,
as has already been mentioned above. To the men of mere
show who succeeded in diverting the attention of the public from
Kant to themselves the results obtained by Locke and Kant were
inconvenient. But in such a case they know how to ignore both
the dead and the living. Thus without hesitation they forsook the
only right path which had at last been found by those wise men,
and philosophised at random with all kinds of indiscriminately
collected conceptions, unconcerned as to their origin and content,
till at last the substance of the Hegelian philosophy, wise beyond
measure, was that the conceptions had no origin at all, but were
rather themselves the origin and source of things. But Kant
has erred in this respect. He has too much neglected empirical
perception for the sake of pure perception—a point which I have
fully discussed in my criticism of his philosophy. With me
perception is throughout the source of all knowledge. I early
recognised the misleading and insidious nature of abstractions,
and in 1813, in my essay on the principle of sufficient reason, I
pointed out the difference of the relations which are thought under
this conception. General conceptions must indeed be the material
in which philosophy deposits and stores up its knowledge, butChapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
203
not the source from which it draws it; the terminus ad quem,
not a quo. It is not, as Kant defines it, a science drawn from
conceptions, but a science in conceptions. Thus the conception
of causality also, with which we are here concerned, has always
been taken far too widely by philosophers for the furtherance
of their dogmatic ends, and much was imported into it which
does not belong to it at all. Hence arose propositions such as
the following: “All that is has its cause”—“the effect cannot
contain more than the cause, thus nothing that was not also in
the cause”—“causa est nobilior suo effectu,” and many others
just as unwarranted. The following subtilty of that insipid gossip
Proclus affords an elaborate and specially lucid example of this.
It occurs in his “Institutio Theologica,” § 76: “ ±1⁄2 Ä¿ ±À¿

quod aliquid facit, est prorsus immobile, non per motum, sed
per ipsum Esse producit ipsum secundum ex se ipso.) Excellent!
But just show me a cause which is not itself set in motion: it is
simply impossible. But here, as in so many cases, abstraction
has thought away all determinations down to that one which it is
desired to make use of without regard to the fact that the latter
cannot exist without the former. The only correct expression of
the law of causality is this: Every change has its cause in another
change which immediately precedes it. If something happens,
i.e., if a new state of things appears, i.e., if something is changed,
then something else must have changed immediately before, and
something else again before this, and so on ad infinitum, for a
first cause is as impossible to conceive as a beginning of time
or a limit of space. More than this the law of causality does not
assert. Thus its claims only arise in the case of changes. So
[214]204
[215]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
long as nothing changes there can be no question of a cause. For
there is no a priori ground for inferring from the existence of
given things, i.e., states of matter, their previous non-existence,
and from this again their coming into being, that is to say, there
is no a priori ground for inferring a change. Therefore the mere
existence of a thing does not justify us in inferring that it has
a cause. Yet there may be a posteriori reasons, that is, reasons
drawn from previous experience, for the assumption that the
present state or condition did not always exist, but has only come
into existence in consequence of another state, and therefore by
means of a change, the cause of which is then to be sought, and
also the cause of this cause. Here then we are involved in the
infinite regressus to which the application of the law of causality
always leads. We said above: “Things, i.e., states or conditions
of matter,” for change and causality have only to do with states or
conditions. It is these states which we understand by form, in the
wider sense; and only the forms change, the matter is permanent.
Thus it is only the form which is subject to the law of causality.
But the form constitutes the thing, i.e., it is the ground of the
difference of things; while matter must be thought as the same in
all. Therefore the Schoolmen said, “Forma dat esse rei;” more
accurately this proposition would run: Forma dat rei essentiam,
materia existentiam. Therefore the question as to the cause of a
thing always concerns merely its form, i.e., its state or quality,
and not its matter, and indeed only the former so far as we have
grounds for assuming that it has not always existed, but has come
into being by means of a change. The union of form and matter,
or of essentia and existentia, gives the concrete, which is always
particular; thus, the thing. And it is the forms whose union with
matter, i.e., whose appearance in matter by means of a change,
are subject to the law of causality. By taking the conception
too widely in the abstract the mistake slipped in of extending
causality to the thing absolutely, that is, to its whole inner nature
and existence, thus also to matter, and ultimately it was thoughtChapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.

justifiable to ask for a cause of the world itself. This is the origin
of the cosmological proof. This proof begins by inferring from
the existence of the world its non-existence, which preceded its
existence, and such an inference is quite unjustifiable; it ends,
however, with the most fearful inconsistency, for it does away
altogether with the law of causality, from which alone it derives
all its evidencing power, for it stops at a first cause, and will
not go further; thus ends, as it were, by committing parricide, as
the bees kill the drones after they have served their end. All the
talk about the absolute is referable to a shamefast, and therefore
disguised cosmological proof, which, in the face of the “Critique
of Pure Reason,” has passed for philosophy in Germany for the
last sixty years. What does the absolute mean? Something that
is, and of which (under pain of punishment) we dare not ask
further whence and why it is. A precious rarity for professors
of philosophy! In the case, however, of the honestly expressed
cosmological proof, through the assumption of a first cause, and
therefore of a first beginning in a time which has absolutely no
beginning, this beginning is always pushed further back by the
question: Why not earlier? And so far back indeed that one never
gets down from it to the present, but is always marvelling that
the present itself did not occur already millions of years ago. In
general, then, the law of causality applies to all things in the
world, but not to the world itself, for it is immanent in the world,
not transcendent; with it it comes into action, and with it it is
abolished. This depends ultimately upon the fact that it belongs
to the mere form of our understanding, like the whole of the
objective world, which accordingly is merely phenomenal, and
is conditioned by the understanding. Thus the law of causality
has full application, without any exception, to all things in the
world, of course in respect of their form, to the variation of these
forms, and thus to their changes. It is valid for the actions of
men as for the impact of a stone, yet, as we have said always,
merely with regard to events, to changes. But if we abstract
[216]206
[217]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
from its origin in the understanding and try to look at it as purely
objective, it will be found in ultimate analysis to depend upon
the fact that everything that acts does so by virtue of its original,
and therefore eternal or timeless, power; therefore its present
effect would necessarily have occurred infinitely earlier, that
is, before all conceivable time, but that it lacked the temporal
condition. This temporal condition is the occasion, i.e., the cause,
on account of which alone the effect only takes place now, but
now takes place necessarily; the cause assigns it its place in time.
But in consequence of that unduly wide view in abstract
thought of the conception cause, which was considered above,
it has been confounded with the conception of force. This is
something completely different from the cause, but yet is that
which imparts to every cause its causality, i.e., the capability of
producing an effect. I have explained this fully and thoroughly
in the second book of the first volume, also in “The Will in
Nature,” and finally also in the second edition of the essay on
the principle of sufficient reason, § 20, p. 44 (third edition, p.
45). This confusion is to be found in its most aggravated form
in Maine de Biran's book mentioned above, and this is dealt with
more fully in the place last referred to; but apart from this it
is also very common; for example, when people seek for the
cause of any original force, such as gravitation. Kant himself
(Über den Einzig Möglichen Beweisgrund, vol. i. p. 211-215
of Rosenkranz's edition) calls the forces of nature “efficient
causes,” and says “gravity is a cause.” Yet it is impossible to
see to the bottom of his thought so long as force and cause are
not distinctly recognised as completely different. But the use
of abstract conceptions leads very easily to their confusion if
the consideration of their origin is set aside. The knowledge of
causes and effects, always perceptive, which rests on the form of
the understanding, is neglected in order to stick to the abstraction
cause. In this way alone is the conception of causality, with all its
simplicity, so very frequently wrongly apprehended. ThereforeChapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
207
even in Aristotle (“Metaph.,” iv. 2) we find causes divided
into four classes which are utterly falsely, and indeed crudely
conceived. Compare with it my classification of causes as set
forth for the first time in my essay on sight and colour, chap.
1, and touched upon briefly in the sixth paragraph of the first
volume of the present work, but expounded at full length in my
prize essay on the freedom of the will, p. 30-33. Two things
in nature remain untouched by that chain of causality which
stretches into infinity in both directions; these are matter and
the forces of nature. They are both conditions of causality, while
everything else is conditioned by it. For the one (matter) is that
in which the states and their changes appear; the other (forces of
nature) is that by virtue of which alone they can appear at all.
Here, however, one must remember that in the second book, and
later and more thoroughly in “The Will in Nature,” the natural
forces are shown to be identical with the will in us; but matter
appears as the mere visibility of the will; so that ultimately it also
may in a certain sense be regarded as identical with the will.
On the other hand, not less true and correct is what is explained
in § 4 of the first book, and still better in the second edition of
the essay on the principle of sufficient reason at the end of §
21, p. 77 (third edition, p. 82), that matter is causality itself
objectively comprehended, for its entire nature consists in acting
in general, so that it itself is thus the activity (μ1⁄2μÁ3μ1± = reality)
of things generally, as it were the abstraction of all their different
kinds of acting. Accordingly, since the essence, essentia, of
matter consists in action in general, and the reality, existentia,
of things consists in their materiality, which thus again is one
with action in general, it may be asserted of matter that in it
existentia and essentia unite and are one, for it has no other
attribute than existence itself in general and independent of all
fuller definitions of it. On the other hand, all empirically given
matter, thus all material or matter in the special sense (which our
ignorant materialists at the present day confound with matter), has
[218]208
[219]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
already entered the framework of the forms and manifests itself
only through their qualities and accidents, because in experience
every action is of quite a definite and special kind, and is never
merely general. Therefore pure matter is an object of thought
alone, not of perception, which led Plotinus (Enneas II., lib. iv.,
c. 8 & 9) and Giordano Bruno (Della Causa, dial. 4) to make the
paradoxical assertion that matter has no extension, for extension
is inseparable from the form, and that therefore it is incorporeal.
Yet Aristotle had already taught that it is not a body although it is
corporeal: “ÃÉ1⁄4± 1⁄4μ1⁄2 ¿Åo ±1⁄2 μ1·, ÃÉ1⁄4±Ä1o·  ́μ” (Stob. Ecl., lib.
i., c. 12, § 5). In reality we think under pure matter only action,
in the abstract, quite independent of the kind of action, thus pure
causality itself; and as such it is not an object but a condition of
experience, just like space and time. This is the reason why in
the accompanying table of our pure a priori knowledge matter is
able to take the place of causality, and therefore appears along
with space and time as the third pure form, and therefore as
dependent on our intellect.
This table contains all the fundamental truths which are rooted
in our perceptive or intuitive knowledge a priori, expressed
as first principles independent of each other. What is special,
however, what forms the content of arithmetic and geometry,
is not given here, nor yet what only results from the union and
application of those formal principles of knowledge. This is the
subject of the “Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science”
expounded by Kant, to which this table in some measure forms
the propædutic and introduction, and with which it therefore
stands in direct connection. In this table I have primarily had in
view the very remarkable parallelism of those a priori principles
of knowledge which form the framework of all experience, but
specially also the fact that, as I have explained in § 4 of the
first volume, matter (and also causality) is to be regarded as
a combination, or if it is preferred, an amalgamation, of space
and time. In agreement with this, we find that what geometryChapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
209
is for the pure perception or intuition of space, and arithmetic
for that of time, Kant's phoronomy is for the pure perception or
intuition of the two united. For matter is primarily that which
is movable in space. The mathematical point cannot even be
conceived as movable, as Aristotle has shown (“Physics,” vi.
10). This philosopher also himself provided the first example of
such a science, for in the fifth and sixth books of his “Physics”
he determined a priori the laws of rest and motion.
Now this table may be regarded at pleasure either as a
collection of the eternal laws of the world, and therefore as
the basis of our ontology, or as a chapter of the physiology of
the brain, according as one assumes the realistic or the idealistic
point of view; but the second is in the last instance right. On
this point, indeed, we have already come to an understanding in
the first chapter; yet I wish further to illustrate it specially by
an example. Aristotle's book “De Xenophane,” &c., commences
with these weighty words of Xenophanes: “‘Ê ́1¿1⁄2 μ11⁄2±1 Æ·Ã11⁄2,
μ1 Ä1 μÃÄ11⁄2, μ1ÀμÁ 1⁄4· μ1⁄2 ́μÇμÄ±1 3μ1⁄2μÃ ̧±1 1⁄4· ́μ1⁄2 μo 1⁄4· ́μ1⁄2¿Â.”
(Æternum esse, inquit, quicquid est, siquidem fieri non potest, ut
ex nihilo quippiam existat.) Here, then, Xenophanes judges as to
the origin of things, as regards its possibility, and of this origin
he can have had no experience, even by analogy; nor indeed does
he appeal to experience, but judges apodictically, and therefore a
priori. How can he do this if as a stranger he looks from without
into a world that exists purely objectively, that is, independently
of his knowledge? How can he, an ephemeral being hurrying
past, to whom only a hasty glance into such a world is permitted,
judge apodictically, a priori and without experience concerning
that world, the possibility of its existence and origin? The
solution of this riddle is that the man has only to do with his
own ideas, which as such are the work of his brain, and the
constitution of which is merely the manner or mode in which
alone the function of his brain can be fulfilled, i.e., the form of
his perception. He thus judges only as to the phenomena of his
[220]210
[221]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
own brain, and declares what enters into its forms, time, space,
and causality, and what does not. In this he is perfectly at home
and speaks apodictically. In a like sense, then, the following
table of the Prædicabilia a priori of time, space, and matter is to
be taken:—
Prædicabilia A Priori.
Of Time.
(1) There is
only one Time,
and all different
times are parts
of it.Of Space.
(1) There is
only one Space,
and all different
spaces are parts
of it.
(2)
Different
times are not
simultaneous
but successive.(2)
Different
spaces are not
successive but
simultaneous.
(3) Time can-
not be thought
away, but ev-
erything can be
thought away
from it.(3) Space can-
not be thought
away, but ev-
erything can be
thought away
from it.
Of Matter.
(1) There is only
one Matter, and
all different ma-
terials are dif-
ferent states of
matter; as such
it is called Sub-
stance.
(2)
Different
matters (mate-
rials) are not
so
through
substance
but
through
accidents.
(3) Annihilation
of matter is in-
conceivable, but
annihilation of
all its forms and
qualities is con-
ceivable.Chapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
(4) Time has
three divisions,
the past, the
present, and the
future, which
constitute two
directions and a
centre of indif-
ference.(4) Space has
three
dimen-
sions—height,
breadth,
and
length.
(5) Time is in-
finitely divisi-
ble.(5) Space is in-
finitely divisi-
ble.
211
(4) Matter ex-
ists, i.e., acts in
all the dimen-
sions of space
and throughout
the whole length
of time, and
thus these two
are united and
thereby filled.
In this consists
the true nature
of matter; thus
it is through and
through causal-
ity.
(5) Matter is
infinitely divisi-
ble.212
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
(6) Time is ho-
mogeneous and
a Continuum,
i.e., no one of
its parts is dif-
ferent from the
rest, nor sepa-
rated from it by
anything that is
not time.(6) Space is ho-
mogeneous and
a Continuum,
i.e., no one of
its parts is dif-
ferent from the
rest, nor sepa-
rated from it by
anything that is
not space.
(7) Time has no
beginning and
no end, but all
beginning and
end is in it.(7) Space has no
limits, but all
limits are in it.
(8) By reason of
time we count.(8) By reason of
space we mea-
sure.
(9) Symmetry is
only in space.
(9) Rhythm is
only in time.
(6) Matter is ho-
mogeneous and
a Continuum,
i.e., it does not
consist of orig-
inally different
(homoiomeria)
or
originally
separated parts
(atoms); it is
therefore
not
composed
of
parts,
which
would necessar-
ily be separated
by something
that was not
matter.
(7) Matter has
no origin and
no end, but all
coming into be-
ing and passing
away are in it.
(8) By reason
of matter we
weigh.
(9) Equilibrium
is only in matter.Chapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
(10) We know
the laws of time
a priori.(10) We know
the laws of
space a priori.
(11) Time can
be perceived a
priori, although
only in the form
of a line.
(12) Time has
no permanence,
but passes away
as soon as it is
there.
(13) Time never
rests.(11) Space is
immediately
perceptible
a
priori.
(14) Everything
that exists in
time has dura-
tion.(14) Everything
that exists in
space has a po-
sition.
(12)
Space
can never pass
away, but en-
dures through
all time.
(13) Space is
immovable.
213
(10) We know
the laws of the
substance of all
accidents a pri-
ori.
(11) Matter can
only be thought
a priori.
(12) The ac-
cidents change;
the substance
remains.
(13) Matter is
indifferent to
rest and motion,
i.e., it is orig-
inally disposed
towards neither
of the two.
(14) Everything
material has the
capacity for ac-
tion.214
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
(15) Time has
no duration, but
all duration is in
it, and is the per-
sistence of what
is permanent in
contrast with its
restless course.(15) Space has
no motion, but
all motion is in
it, and it is the
change of posi-
tion of what is
moved, in con-
trast with its un-
broken rest.
(16) All motion
is only possible
in time.
(17) Velocity is,
in equal spaces,
in inverse pro-
portion to the
time.(16) All motion
is only possible
in space.
(17) Velocity is,
in equal times,
in direct propor-
tion to the space.
(15) Matter is
what is perma-
nent in time
and movable in
space; by the
comparison of
what rests with
what is moved
we measure du-
ration.
(16) All motion
is only possible
to matter.
(17) The magni-
tude of the mo-
tion, the veloc-
ity being equal,
is in direct geo-
metrical propor-
tion to the mat-
ter (mass).Chapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
(18) Time is
not measurable
directly through
itself,
but
only indirectly
through motion,
which is in
space and time
together: thus
the motion of
the sun and
of the clock
measure time.
(19) Time is
omnipresent.
Every part of
time is every-
where, i.e., in
all space, at
once.
(18) Space is
measurable
directly through
itself, and indi-
rectly through
motion, which
is in time and
space together;
hence, for ex-
ample, an hour's
journey,
and
the distance of
the fixed stars
expressed
as
the travelling
of light for so
many years.
(19) Space is
eternal. Every
part of it exists
always.
215
(18) Matter as
such (mass) is
measurable, i.e.,
determinable
as regards its
quantity only
indirectly, only
through
the
amount of the
motion which
it receives and
imparts when
it is repelled or
attracted.
(19) Matter is
absolute. That
is, it neither
comes into be-
ing nor passes
away, and thus
its quantity can
neither be in-
creased nor di-
minished.216
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
(20) In time
taken by it-
self everything
would be in suc-
cession.(20) In space
taken by it-
self everything
would be simul-
taneous.
(21)
Time
makes
the
change of acci-
dents possible.(21)
Space
makes
the
permanence
of
substance
possible.
(22) No part of
space contains
the same matter
as another.
(23) Space is the
principium indi-
viduationis.
(22) Every part
of time contains
all parts of mat-
ter.
(23) Time is the
principium indi-
viduationis.
(20, 21) Mat-
ter unites the
ceaseless flight
of time with
the rigid immo-
bility of space;
therefore it is
the permanent
substance of the
changing acci-
dents. Causality
determines this
change
for
every
place
at every time,
and
thereby
combines time
and space, and
constitutes the
whole nature of
matter.
(22) For matter
is both perma-
nent and impen-
etrable.
(23) Individuals
are material.Chapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
(24) The now

(25) Time in
itself is empty
and
without
properties.(24) The point
has no exten-
sion.
(25) Space in
itself is empty
and
without
properties.
(26) Every mo-
ment is condi-
tioned by the
preceding mo-
ment, and is
only because the
latter has ceased
to be. (Principle
of sufficient rea-
son of existence
in time.—See
my essay on the
principle of suf-
ficient reason.)(26) By the po-
sition of every
limit in space
with reference
to any other
limit, its posi-
tion with refer-
ence to every
possible limit is
precisely deter-
mined. (Princi-
ple of sufficient
reason of exis-
tence in space.)
217
(24) The atom
has no reality.
(25) Matter in it-
self is without
form and qual-
ity, and likewise
inert, i.e., in-
different to rest
or motion, thus
without proper-
ties.
(26)
Every
change in mat-
ter can take
place only on
account
of
another change
which preceded
it; and therefore
a first change,
and thus also
a first state of
matter, is just as
inconceivable
as a beginning
of time or a
limit of space.

Notes to the Annexed Table.
(1) To No. 4 of Matter.
The essence of matter is acting, it is acting itself, in the abstract,
thus acting in general apart from all difference of the kind of
action: it is through and through causality. On this account
it is itself, as regards its existence, not subject to the law of
causality, and thus has neither come into being nor passes away,
for otherwise the law of causality would be applied to itself.
Since now causality is known to us a priori, the conception of
matter, as the indestructible basis of all that exists, can so far
take its place in the knowledge we possess a priori, inasmuch as
it is only the realisation of an a priori form of our knowledge.
For as soon as we see anything that acts or is causally efficient
it presents itself eo ipso as material, and conversely anything
material presents itself as necessarily active or causally efficient.
They are in fact interchangeable conceptions. Therefore the word
“actual” is used as synonymous with “material;” and also the
Greek o±Ä1⁄2 μ1⁄2μÁ3μ1±1⁄2, in opposition to o±Ä±  ́Å1⁄2±1⁄411⁄2, reveals
the same source, for μ1⁄2μÁ3μ1± signifies action in general; so also

Chapter IV. On Knowledge A Priori.
219
with actu in opposition to potentia, and the English “actually” for
“wirklich.” What is called space-occupation, or impenetrability,
and regarded as the essential predicate of body (i.e. of what
is material), is merely that kind of action which belongs to all
bodies without exception, the mechanical. It is this universality
alone, by virtue of which it belongs to the conception of body,
and follows a priori from this conception, and therefore cannot
be thought away from it without doing away with the conception
itself—it is this, I say, that distinguishes it from any other kind
of action, such as that of electricity or chemistry, or light or
heat. Kant has very accurately analysed this space-occupation
of the mechanical mode of activity into repulsive and attractive
force, just as a given mechanical force is analysed into two
others by means of the parallelogram of forces. But this is really
only the thoughtful analysis of the phenomenon into its two
constituent parts. The two forces in conjunction exhibit the body
within its own limits, that is, in a definite volume, while the one
alone would diffuse it into infinity, and the other alone would
contract it to a point. Notwithstanding this reciprocal balancing
or neutralisation, the body still acts upon other bodies which
contest its space with the first force, repelling them, and with the
other force, in gravitation, attracting all bodies in general. So
that the two forces are not extinguished in their product, as, for
instance, two equal forces acting in different directions, or +E
and -E, or oxygen and hydrogen in water. That impenetrability
and gravity really exactly coincide is shown by their empirical
inseparableness, in that the one never appears without the other,
although we can separate them in thought.
I must not, however, omit to mention that the doctrine of Kant
referred to, which forms the fundamental thought of the second
part of his “Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science,”
thus of the Dynamics, was distinctly and fully expounded before
Kant by Priestley, in his excellent “Disquisitions on Matter and
Spirit,” § 1 and 2, a book which appeared in 1777, and the
[225]220
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
second edition in 1782, while Kant's work was published in
1786. Unconscious recollection may certainly be assumed in the
case of subsidiary thoughts, flashes of wit, comparisons, &c., but
not in the case of the principal and fundamental thought. Shall
we then believe that Kant silently appropriated such important
thoughts of another man? and this from a book which at
that time was new? Or that this book was unknown to him,
and that the same thoughts sprang up in two minds within a
short time? The explanation, also, which Kant gives, in the
“Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science” (first edition,
p. 88; Rosenkranz's edition, p. 384), of the real difference
between fluids and solids, is in substance already to be found in
Kaspar Freidr. Wolff's “Theory of Generation,” Berlin 1764, p.
132. But what are we to say if we find Kant's most important
and brilliant doctrine, that of the ideality of space and the
merely phenomenal existence of the corporeal world, already
expressed by Maupertuis thirty years earlier? This will be found
more fully referred to in Frauenstädt's letters on my philosophy,
Letter 14. Maupertuis expresses this paradoxical doctrine so
decidedly, and yet without adducing any proof of it, that one
must suppose that he also took it from somewhere else. 

It is
very desirable that the matter should be further investigated, and
as this would demand tiresome and extensive researches, some
German Academy might very well make the question the subject
of a prize essay. Now in the same relation as that in which Kant
here stands to Priestley, and perhaps also to Kaspar Wolff, and
Maupertuis or his predecessor, Laplace stands to Kant. For the
principal and fundamental thought of Laplace's admirable and
certainly correct theory of the origin of the planetary system,
which is set forth in his “Exposition du Système du Monde,” liv.
v. c. 2, was expressed by Kant nearly fifty years before, in
1755, in his “Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels,” and
more fully in 1763 in his “Einzig möglichen Beweisgrund des
Daseyns Gottes,” ch. 7. Moreover, in the later work he gives us to understand that Lambert in his “Kosmologischen Briefen,”
1761, tacitly adopted that doctrine from him, and these letters at
the same time also appeared in French (Lettres Cosmologiques
sur la Constitution de l'Univers). We are therefore obliged to
assume that Laplace knew that Kantian doctrine. Certainly he
expounds the matter more thoroughly, strikingly, and fully, and
at the same time more simply than Kant, as is natural from his
more profound astronomical knowledge; yet in the main it is
to be found clearly expressed in Kant, and on account of the
importance of the matter, would alone have been sufficient to
make his name immortal. It cannot but disturb us very much if we
find minds of the first order under suspicion of dishonesty, which
would be a scandal to those of the lowest order. For we feel
that theft is even more inexcusable in a rich man than in a poor
one. We dare not, however, be silent; for here we are posterity,
and must be just, as we hope that posterity will some day be just
to us. Therefore, as a third example, I will add to these cases,
that the fundamental thoughts of the “Metamorphosis of Plants,”
by Goethe, were already expressed by Kaspar Wolff in 1764 in
his “Theory of Generation,” p. 148, 229, 243, &c. Indeed, is it
otherwise with the system of gravitation? the discovery of which
is on the Continent of Europe always ascribed to Newton, while
in England the learned at least know very well that it belongs to
Robert Hooke, who in the year 1666, in a “Communication to
the Royal Society,” expounds it quite distinctly, although only
as an hypothesis and without proof. The principal passage of
this communication is quoted in Dugald Stewart's “Philosophy
of the Human Mind,” and is probably taken from Robert Hooke's
Posthumous Works. The history of the matter, and how Newton
got into difficulty by it, is also to be found in the “Biographie
Universelle,” article Newton. Hooke's priority is treated as
an established fact in a short history of astronomy, Quarterly
Review, August 1828. Further details on this subject are to be
found in my “Parerga,” vol. ii., § 86 (second edition, § 88).

The story of the fall of an apple is a fable as groundless as it is
popular, and is quite without authority.

(2) To No. 18 of Matter.
The quantity of a motion (quantitas motus, already in Descartes)
is the product of the mass into the velocity.
This law is the basis not only of the doctrine of impact in
mechanics, but also of that of equilibrium in statics. From the
force of impact which two bodies with the same velocity exert the
relation of their masses to each other may be determined. Thus
of two hammers striking with the same velocity, the one which
has the greater mass will drive the nail deeper into the wall or the
post deeper into the earth. For example, a hammer weighing six
pounds with a velocity = 6 effects as much as a hammer weighing
three pounds with a velocity = 12, for in both cases the quantity
of motion or the momentum = 36. Of two balls rolling at the same
pace, the one which has the greater mass will impel a third ball
at rest to a greater distance than the ball of less mass can. For the
mass of the first multiplied by the same velocity gives a greater
quantity of motion, or a greater momentum. The cannon carries
further than the gun, because an equal velocity communicated to
a much greater mass gives a much greater quantity of motion,
which resists longer the retarding effect of gravity. For the same
reason, the same arm will throw a lead bullet further than a stone
one of equal magnitude, or a large stone further than quite a
small one. And therefore also a case-shot does not carry so far as
a ball-shot.
The same law lies at the foundation of the theory of the lever
and of the balance. For here also the smaller mass, on the longer
arm of the lever or beam of the balance, has a greater velocity
in falling; and multiplied by this it may be equal to, or indeed
exceed, the quantity of motion or the momentum of the greater

about by equilibrium this velocity exists merely in intention or
virtually, potentiâ, not actu; but it acts just as well as actu, which
is very remarkable.
The following explanation will be more easily understood now
that these truths have been called to mind.
The quantity of a given matter can only be estimated in
general according to its force, and its force can only be known
in its expression. Now when we are considering matter only as
regards its quantity, not its quality, this expression can only be
mechanical, i.e., it can only consist in motion which it imparts
to other matter. For only in motion does the force of matter
become, so to speak, alive; hence the expression vis viva for the
manifestation of force of matter in motion. Accordingly the only
measure of the quantity of a given matter is the quantity of its
motion, or its momentum. In this, however, if it is given, the
quantity of matter still appears in conjunction and amalgamated
with its other factor, velocity. Therefore if we want to know the
quantity of matter (the mass) this other factor must be eliminated.
Now the velocity is known directly; for it is S/T. But the other
factor, which remains when this is eliminated, can always be
known only relatively in comparison with other masses, which
again can only be known themselves by means of the quantity of
their motion, or their momentum, thus in their combination with
velocity. We must therefore compare one quantity of motion
with the other, and then subtract the velocity from both, in
order to see how much each of them owed to its mass. This is
done by weighing the masses against each other, in which that
quantity of motion is compared which, in each of the two masses,
calls forth the attractive power of the earth that acts upon both
only in proportion to their quantity. Therefore there are two
kinds of weighing. Either we impart to the two masses to be
compared equal velocity, in order to find out which of the two
now communicates motion to the other, thus itself has a greater
quantity of motion, which, since the velocity is the same on both sides, is to be ascribed to the other factor of the quantity of
motion or the momentum, thus to the mass (common balance).

Or we weigh, by investigating how much more velocity the one
mass must receive than the other has, in order to be equal to the
latter in quantity of motion or momentum, and therefore allow no
more motion to be communicated to itself by the other; for then
in proportion as its velocity must exceed that of the other, its
mass, i.e., the quantity of its matter, is less than that of the other
(steelyard). This estimation of masses by weighing depends upon
the favourable circumstance that the moving force, in itself, acts
upon both quite equally, and each of the two is in a position to
communicate to the other directly its surplus quantity of motion
or momentum, so that it becomes visible.
The substance of these doctrines has long ago been expressed
by Newton and Kant, but through the connection and the clearness
of this exposition I believe I have made it more intelligible, so
that that insight is possible for all which I regarded as necessary
for the justification of proposition No. 18.
