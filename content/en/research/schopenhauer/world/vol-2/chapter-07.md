The Relation of the Concrete Knowledge of Perception to Abstract Knowledge.


Conceptions derive their material from
knowledge of perception, and therefore the entire structure of our
world of thought rests upon the world of perception. We must
therefore be able to go back from every conception, even if only
indirectly through intermediate conceptions, to the perceptions
from which it is either itself directly derived or those conceptions
are derived of which it is again an abstraction. 

We must be able to support it with perceptions which stand to
the abstractions in the relation of examples. These perceptions
thus afford the real content of all our thought, and whenever
they are wanting we have not had conceptions but mere words
in our heads. 

In this respect our intellect is like a bank, which,
if it is to be sound, must have cash in its safe, so as to be
able to meet all the notes it has issued, in case of demand; the
perceptions are the cash, the conceptions are the notes. In this
sense the perceptions might very appropriately be called primary,
and the conceptions, on the other hand, secondary ideas. Not
quite so aptly, the Schoolmen, following the example of Aristotle
(Metaph., vi. 11, xi. 1), called real things substantiæ primæ,
and the conceptions substantiæ secundæ. Books impart only
secondary ideas. Mere conceptions of a thing without perception
give only a general knowledge of it. We only have a thorough
understanding of things and their relations so far as we are able
to represent them to ourselves in pure, distinct perceptions,
without the aid of words. To explain words by words, to compare
concepts with concepts, in which most philosophising consists,
is a trivial shifting about of the concept-spheres in order to see
which goes into the other and which does not. At the best we
can in this way only arrive at conclusions; but even conclusions

This chapter is connected with § 12 of the first volume.241
give no really new knowledge, but only show us all that lay
in the knowledge we already possessed, and what part of it
perhaps might be applicable to the particular case. On the other
hand, to perceive, to allow the things themselves to speak to
us, to apprehend new relations of them, and then to take up
and deposit all this in conceptions, in order to possess it with
certainty—that gives new knowledge. But, while almost every
one is capable of comparing conceptions with conceptions, to
compare conceptions with perceptions is a gift of the select few.
It is the condition, according to the degree of its perfection, of
wit, judgment, ingenuity, genius. The former faculty, on the
contrary, results in little more than possibly rational reflections.
The inmost kernel of all genuine and actual knowledge is a
perception; and every new truth is the profit or gain yielded by a
perception. All original thinking takes place in images, and this
is why imagination is so necessary an instrument of thought, and
minds that lack imagination will never accomplish much, unless
it be in mathematics. On the other hand, merely abstract thoughts,
which have no kernel of perception, are like cloud-structures,
without reality. Even writing and speaking, whether didactic or
poetical, has for its final aim to guide the reader to the same
concrete knowledge from which the author started; if it has not
this aim it is bad. This is why the contemplation and observing
of every real thing, as soon as it presents something new to the
observer, is more instructive than any reading or hearing. For
indeed, if we go to the bottom of the matter, all truth and wisdom,
nay, the ultimate secret of things, is contained in each real object,
yet certainly only in concreto, just as gold lies hidden in the ore;
the difficulty is to extract it. From a book, on the contrary, at the
best we only receive the truth at second hand, and oftener not at
all.

In most books, putting out of account those that are thoroughly
bad, the author, when their content is not altogether empirical,
has certainly thought but not perceived; he has written from reflection, not from intuition, and it is this that makes them
commonplace and tedious. For what the author has thought
could always have been thought by the reader also, if he had
taken the same trouble; indeed it consists simply of intelligent
thought, full exposition of what is implicite contained in the
theme. But no actually new knowledge comes in this way into
the world; this is only created in the moment of perception,
of direct comprehension of a new side of the thing. 

When,
therefore, on the contrary, sight has formed the foundation of
an author's thought, it is as if he wrote from a land where the
reader has never been, for all is fresh and new, because it is
drawn directly from the original source of all knowledge. Let
me illustrate the distinction here touched upon by a perfectly
easy and simple example. 

Any commonplace writer might easily
describe profound contemplation or petrifying astonishment by
saying: “He stood like a statue;” but Cervantes says: “Like a
clothed statue, for the wind moved his garments” (Don Quixote,
book vi. ch. 19). It is thus that all great minds have ever thought
in presence of the perception, and kept their gaze steadfastly
upon it in their thought. We recognise this from this fact,
among others, that even the most opposite of them so often agree
and coincide in some particular; because they all speak of the
same thing which they all had before their eyes, the world, the
perceived reality; indeed in a certain degree they all say the
same thing, and others never believe them. We recognise it
further in the appropriateness and originality of the expression,
which is always perfectly adapted to the subject because it has
been inspired by perception, in the naivete of the language, the
freshness of the imagery, and the impressiveness of the similes,
all of which qualities, without exception, distinguish the works
of great minds, and, on the contrary, are always wanting in
the works of others. Accordingly only commonplace forms of
expression and trite figures are at the service of the latter, and
they never dare to allow themselves to be natural, under penalty of displaying their vulgarity in all its dreary barrenness; instead
of this they are affected mannerists. Hence Buffon says: “Le style
est l'homme même.” If men of commonplace mind write poetry
they have certain traditional conventional opinions, passions,
noble sentiments, &c., which they have received in the abstract,
and attribute to the heroes of their poems, who are in this way
reduced to mere personifications of those opinions, and are thus
themselves to a certain extent abstractions, and therefore insipid
and tiresome. If they philosophise, they have taken in a few wide
abstract conceptions, which they turn about in all directions,
as if they had to do with algebraical equations, and hope that
something will come of it; at the most we see that they have
all read the same things. Such a tossing to and fro of abstract
conceptions, after the manner of algebraical equations, which is
now-a-days called dialectic, does not, like real algebra, afford
certain results; for here the conception which is represented by
the word is not a fixed and perfectly definite quality, such as
are symbolised by the letters in algebra, but is wavering and
ambiguous, and capable of extension and contraction. Strictly
speaking, all thinking, i.e., combining of abstract conceptions, has
at the most the recollections of earlier perceptions for its material,
and this only indirectly, so far as it constitutes the foundation of all
conceptions. Real knowledge, on the contrary, that is, immediate
knowledge, is perception alone, new, fresh perception itself.
Now the concepts which the reason has framed and the memory
has preserved cannot all be present to consciousness at once, but
only a very small number of them at a time. On the other hand, the
energy with which we apprehend what is present in perception,
in which really all that is essential in all things generally is
virtually contained and represented, is apprehended, fills the
consciousness in one moment with its whole power. Upon this
depends the infinite superiority of genius to learning; they stand
to each other as the text of an ancient classic to its commentary.
All truth and all wisdom really lies ultimately in perception. 

But this unfortunately can neither be retained nor communicated.
The objective conditions of such communication can certainly
be presented to others purified and illustrated through plastic
and pictorial art, and even much more directly through poetry;
but it depends so much upon subjective conditions, which are
not at the command of every one, and of no one at all times,
nay, indeed in the higher degrees of perfection, are only the
gift of the favoured few. Only the worst knowledge, abstract,
secondary knowledge, the conception, the mere shadow of true
knowledge, is unconditionally communicable. If perceptions
were communicable, that would be a communication worth the
trouble; but at last every one must remain in his own skin and
skull, and no one can help another. To enrich the conception from
perception is the unceasing endeavour of poetry and philosophy.
However, the aims of man are essentially practical; and for these
it is sufficient that what he has apprehended through perception
should leave traces in him, by virtue of which he will recognise
it in the next similar case; thus he becomes possessed of worldly
wisdom. Thus, as a rule, the man of the world cannot teach
his accumulated truth and wisdom, but only make use of it; he
rightly comprehends each event as it happens, and determines
what is in conformity with it. That books will not take the place
of experience nor learning of genius are two kindred phenomena.
Their common ground is that the abstract can never take the
place of the concrete. Books therefore do not take the place
of experience, because conceptions always remain general, and
consequently do not get down to the particular, which, however,
is just what has to be dealt with in life; and, besides this, all
conceptions are abstracted from what is particular and perceived
in experience, and therefore one must have come to know these
in order adequately to understand even the general conceptions
which the books communicate. Learning cannot take the place
of genius, because it also affords merely conceptions, but the
knowledge of genius consists in the apprehension of the (Platonic)245
Ideas of things, and therefore is essentially intuitive. Thus in the
first of these phenomena the objective condition of perceptive or
intuitive knowledge is wanting; in the second the subjective; the
former may be attained, the latter cannot.

Wisdom and genius, these two summits of the Parnassus of
human knowledge, have their foundation not in the abstract and
discursive, but in the perceptive faculty. Wisdom proper is
something intuitive, not something abstract. It does not consist in
principles and thoughts, which one can carry about ready in his
mind, as results of his own research or that of others; but it is the
whole manner in which the world presents itself in his mind. This
varies so much that on account of it the wise man lives in another
world from the fool, and the genius sees another world from the
blockhead. That the works of the man of genius immeasurably
surpass those of all others arises simply from the fact that the
world which he sees, and from which he takes his utterances, is
so much clearer, as it were more profoundly worked out, than that
in the minds of others, which certainly contains the same objects,
but is to the world of the man of genius as the Chinese picture
without shading and perspective is to the finished oil-painting.
The material is in all minds the same; but the difference lies in the
perfection of the form which it assumes in each, upon which the
numerous grades of intelligence ultimately depend. These grades
thus exist in the root, in the perceptive or intuitive apprehension,
and do not first appear in the abstract. Hence original mental
superiority shows itself so easily when the occasion arises, and
is at once felt and hated by others.

In practical life the intuitive knowledge of the understanding
is able to guide our action and behaviour directly, while the
abstract knowledge of the reason can only do so by means of the
memory. Hence arises the superiority of intuitive knowledge in
all cases which admit of no time for reflection; thus for daily
intercourse, in which, just on this account, women excel. Only
those who intuitively know the nature of men as they are as a rule,
[250]246
[251]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
and thus comprehend the individuality of the person before them,
will understand how to manage him with certainty and rightly.
Another may know by heart all the three hundred maxims of
Gracian, but this will not save him from stupid mistakes and
misconceptions if he lacks that intuitive knowledge. For all
abstract knowledge affords us primarily mere general principles
and rules; but the particular case is almost never to be carried
out exactly according to the rule; then the rule itself has to be
presented to us at the right time by the memory, which seldom
punctually happens; then the propositio minor has to be formed
out of the present case, and finally the conclusion drawn. Before
all this is done the opportunity has generally turned its back
upon us, and then those excellent principles and rules serve at
the most to enable us to measure the magnitude of the error
we have committed. Certainly with time we gain in this way
experience and practice, which slowly grows to knowledge of
the world, and thus, in connection with this, the abstract rules
may certainly become fruitful. On the other hand, the intuitive
knowledge, which always apprehends only the particular, stands
in immediate relation to the present case. Rule, case, and
application are for it one, and action follows immediately upon
it. This explains why in real life the scholar, whose pre-eminence
lies in the province of abstract knowledge, is so far surpassed
by the man of the world, whose pre-eminence consists in perfect
intuitive knowledge, which original disposition conferred on him,
and a rich experience has developed. 

The two kinds of knowledge
always stand to each other in the relation of paper money and
hard cash; and as there are many cases and circumstances in
which the former is to be preferred to the latter, so there are also
things and situations for which abstract knowledge is more useful
than intuitive. If, for example, it is a conception that in some case
guides our action, when it is once grasped it has the advantage of
being unalterable, and therefore under its guidance we go to work
with perfect certainty and consistency. But this certainty which247
the conception confers on the subjective side is outweighed by
the uncertainty which accompanies it on the objective side. 

The
whole conception may be false and groundless, or the object to
be dealt with may not come under it, for it may be either not at
all or not altogether of the kind which belongs to it. Now if in the
particular case we suddenly become conscious of something of
this sort, we are put out altogether; if we do not become conscious
of it, the result brings it to light. Therefore Vauvenargue says:
“Personne n'est sujet à plus de fautes, que ceux qui n'agissent que
par réflexion.” If, on the contrary, it is direct perception of the
objects to be dealt with and their relations that guides our action,
we easily hesitate at every step, for the perception is always
modifiable, is ambiguous, has inexhaustible details in itself, and
shows many sides in succession; we act therefore without full
confidence. But the subjective uncertainty is compensated by the
objective certainty, for here there is no conception between the
object and us, we never lose sight of it; if therefore we only see
correctly what we have before us and what we do, we shall hit
the mark. Our action then is perfectly sure only when it is guided
by a conception the right ground of which, its completeness, and
applicability to the given cause is perfectly certain. Action in
accordance with conceptions may pass into pedantry, action in
accordance with the perceived impression into levity and folly.
Perception is not only the source of all knowledge, but is itself
knowledge o±Ä1⁄2 μ3⁄4¿Ç·1⁄2, is the only unconditionally true, genuine
knowledge completely worthy of the name. For it alone imparts
insight properly so called, it alone is actually assimilated by man,
passes into his nature, and can with full reason be called his; while
the conceptions merely cling to him. In the fourth book we see
indeed that true virtue proceeds from knowledge of perception
or intuitive knowledge; for only those actions which are directly
called forth by this, and therefore are performed purely from the
impulse of our own nature, are properly symptoms of our true
and unalterable character; not so those which, resulting from
[252]248
[253]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
reflection and its dogmas, are often extorted from the character,
and therefore have no unalterable ground in us. But wisdom
also, the true view of life, the correct eye, and the searching
judgment, proceeds from the way in which the man apprehends
the perceptible world, but not from his mere abstract knowledge,
i.e., not from abstract conceptions. The basis or ultimate content
of every science consists, not in proofs, nor in what is proved,
but in the unproved foundation of the proofs, which can finally
be apprehended only through perception. So also the basis of
the true wisdom and real insight of each man does not consist
in conceptions and in abstract rational knowledge, but in what
is perceived, and in the degree of acuteness, accuracy, and
profundity with which he has apprehended it. He who excels
here knows the (Platonic) Ideas of the world and life; every
case he has seen represents for him innumerable cases; he always
apprehends each being according to its true nature, and his action,
like his judgment, corresponds to his insight. By degrees also
his countenance assumes the expression of penetration, of true
intelligence, and, if it goes far enough, of wisdom. For it is
pre-eminence in knowledge of perception alone that stamps its
impression upon the features also; while pre-eminence in abstract
knowledge cannot do this. In accordance with what has been said,
we find in all classes men of intellectual superiority, and often
quite without learning. Natural understanding can take the place
of almost every degree of culture, but no culture can take the place
of natural understanding. The scholar has the advantage of such
men in the possession of a wealth of cases and facts (historical
knowledge) and of causal determinations (natural science), all in
well-ordered connection, easily surveyed; but yet with all this he
has not a more accurate and profound insight into what is truly
essential in all these cases, facts, and causations. The unlearned
man of acuteness and penetration knows how to dispense with
this wealth; we can make use of much; we can do with little.
One case in his own experience teaches him more than many a249
scholar is taught by a thousand cases which he knows, but does
not, properly speaking, understand. For the little knowledge of
that unlearned man is living, because every fact that is known to
him is supported by accurate and well-apprehended perception,
and thus represents for him a thousand similar facts. On the
contrary, the much knowledge of the ordinary scholar is dead,
because even if it does not consist, as is often the case, in mere
words, it consists entirely in abstract knowledge. This, however,
receives its value only through the perceptive knowledge of the
individual with which it must connect itself, and which must
ultimately realise all the conceptions. If now this perceptive
knowledge is very scanty, such a mind is like a bank with
liabilities tenfold in excess of its cash reserve, whereby in the
end it becomes bankrupt. Therefore, while the right apprehension
of the perceptible world has impressed the stamp of insight and
wisdom on the brow of many an unlearned man, the face of many
a scholar bears no other trace of his much study than that of
exhaustion and weariness from excessive and forced straining of
the memory in the unnatural accumulation of dead conceptions.
Moreover, the insight of such a man is often so puerile, so
weak and silly, that we must suppose that the excessive strain
upon the faculty of indirect knowledge, which is concerned with
abstractions, directly weakens the power of immediate perceptive
knowledge, and the natural and clear vision is more and more
blinded by the light of books. At any rate the constant streaming
in of the thoughts of others must confine and suppress our own,
and indeed in the long run paralyse the power of thought if it has
not that high degree of elasticity which is able to withstand that
unnatural stream. Therefore ceaseless reading and study directly
injures the mind—the more so that completeness and constant
connection of the system of our own thought and knowledge
must pay the penalty if we so often arbitrarily interrupt it in order
to gain room for a line of thought entirely strange to us. 

To banish
my own thought in order to make room for that of a book would seem to me like what Shakespeare censures in the tourists of his
time, that they sold their own land to see that of others. Yet the
inclination for reading of most scholars is a kind of fuga vacui,
from the poverty of their own minds, which forcibly draws in
the thoughts of others. In order to have thoughts they must read
something; just as lifeless bodies are only moved from without;
while the man who thinks for himself is like a living body that
moves of itself. Indeed it is dangerous to read about a subject
before we have thought about it ourselves. For along with the
new material the old point of view and treatment of it creeps into
the mind, all the more so as laziness and apathy counsel us to
accept what has already been thought, and allow it to pass for
truth. This now insinuates itself, and henceforward our thought
on the subject always takes the accustomed path, like brooks
that are guided by ditches; to find a thought of our own, a
new thought, is then doubly difficult. This contributes much to
the want of originality on the part of scholars. Add to this that
they suppose that, like other people, they must divide their time
between pleasure and work. Now they regard reading as their
work and special calling, and therefore they gorge themselves
with it, beyond what they can digest. Then reading no longer
plays the part of the mere initiator of thought, but takes its place
altogether; for they think of the subject just as long as they are
reading about it, thus with the mind of another, not with their
own. But when the book is laid aside entirely different things
make much more lively claims upon their interest; their private
affairs, and then the theatre, card-playing, skittles, the news of
the day, and gossip. The man of thought is so because such things
have no interest for him. He is interested only in his problems,
with which therefore he is always occupied, by himself and
without a book. To give ourselves this interest, if we have not
got it, is impossible. This is the crucial point. And upon this also
depends the fact that the former always speak only of what they
have read, while the latter, on the contrary, speaks of what he251
has thought, and that they are, as Pope says:
“For ever reading, never to be read.”
The mind is naturally free, not a slave; only what it does
willingly, of its own accord, succeeds. On the other hand,
the compulsory exertion of a mind in studies for which it is
not qualified, or when it has become tired, or in general too
continuously and invita Minerva, dulls the brain, just as reading
by moonlight dulls the eyes. This is especially the case with the
straining of the immature brain in the earlier years of childhood.
I believe that the learning of Latin and Greek grammar from the
sixth to the twelfth year lays the foundation of the subsequent
stupidity of most scholars. At any rate the mind requires the
nourishment of materials from without. All that we eat is not
at once incorporated in the organism, but only so much of it
as is digested; so that only a small part of it is assimilated,
and the remainder passes away; and thus to eat more than we
can assimilate is useless and injurious. It is precisely the same
with what we read. Only so far as it gives food for thought
does it increase our insight and true knowledge. Therefore
Heracleitus says: “À¿»Å1⁄4± ̧1± 1⁄2¿Å1⁄2 ¿Å  ́1 ́±Ãoμ1” (multiscitia
non dat intellectum). It seems, however, to me that learning may
be compared to a heavy suit of armour, which certainly makes
the strong man quite invincible, but to the weak man is a burden
under which he sinks altogether.
The exposition given in our third book of the knowledge of
the (Platonic) Ideas, as the highest attainable by man, and at the
same time entirely perceptive or intuitive knowledge, is a proof
that the source of true wisdom does not lie in abstract rational
knowledge, but in the clear and profound apprehension of the
world in perception. Therefore wise men may live in any age, and
those of the past remain wise men for all succeeding generations.
Learning, on the contrary, is relative; the learned men of the past are for the most part children as compared with us, and require
indulgence.

But to him who studies in order to gain insight books and
studies are only steps of the ladder by which he climbs to the
summit of knowledge. As soon as a round of the ladder has raised
him a step, he leaves it behind him. The many, on the other hand,
who study in order to fill their memory do not use the rounds of
the ladder to mount by, but take them off, and load themselves
with them to carry them away, rejoicing at the increasing weight
of the burden. They remain always below, because they bear
what ought to have borne them.

Upon the truth set forth here, that the kernel of all knowledge
is the perceptive or intuitive apprehension, depends the true and
profound remark of Helvetius, that the really characteristic and
original views of which a gifted individual is capable, and the
working up, development, and manifold application of which
is the material of all his works, even if written much later, can
arise in him only up to the thirty-fifth or at the latest the fortieth
year of his life, and are really the result of combinations he has
made in his early youth. For they are not mere connections
of abstract conceptions, but his own intuitive comprehension of
the objective world and the nature of things. Now, that this
intuitive apprehension must have completed its work by the age
mentioned above depends partly on the fact that by that time the
ectypes of all (Platonic) Ideas must have presented themselves to
the man, and therefore cannot appear later with the strength of the
first impression; partly on this, that the highest energy of brain
activity is demanded for this quintessence of all knowledge, for
this proof before the letter of the apprehension, and this highest
energy of the brain is dependent on the freshness and flexibility
of its fibres and the rapidity with which the arterial blood flows
to the brain. But this again is at its strongest only as long as
the arterial system has a decided predominance over the venous
system, which begins to decline after the thirtieth year, until253
at last, after the forty-second year, the venous system obtains
the upper hand, as Cabanis has admirably and instructively
explained. Therefore the years between twenty and thirty and the
first few years after thirty are for the intellect what May is for
the trees; only then do the blossoms appear of which all the later
fruits are the development. The world of perception has made its
impression, and thereby laid the foundation of all the subsequent
thoughts of the individual. He may by reflection make clearer
what he has apprehended; he may yet acquire much knowledge
as nourishment for the fruit which has once set; he may extend
his views, correct his conceptions and judgments, it may be
only through endless combinations that he becomes completely
master of the materials he has gained; indeed he will generally
produce his best works much later, as the greatest heat begins
with the decline of the day, but he can no longer hope for new
original knowledge from the one living fountain of perception. It
is this that Byron feels when he breaks forth into his wonderfully
beautiful lament:

“No more—no more—oh! never more on me
The freshness of the heart can fall like dew,
Which out of all the lovely things we see
Extracts emotions beautiful and new,
Hived in our bosoms like the bag o' the bee:
Think'st thou the honey with those objects grew?
Alas! 'twas not in them, but in thy power
To double even the sweetness of a flower.”

Through all that I have said hitherto I hope I have placed in a
clear light the important truth that since all abstract knowledge
springs from knowledge of perception, it obtains its whole
value from its relation to the latter, thus from the fact that
its conceptions, or the abstractions which they denote, can be
realised, i.e., proved, through perceptions; and, moreover, that
most depends upon the quality of these perceptions. 

Conceptions and abstractions which do not ultimately refer to perceptions are
like paths in the wood that end without leading out of it. The great
value of conceptions lies in the fact that by means of them the
original material of knowledge is more easily handled, surveyed,
and arranged. But although many kinds of logical and dialectical
operations are possible with them, yet no entirely original and new
knowledge will result from these; that is to say, no knowledge
whose material neither lay already in perception nor was drawn
from self-consciousness. This is the true meaning of the doctrine
attributed to Aristotle: Nihil est in intellectu, nisi quod antea fuerit
in sensu. 

It is also the meaning of the Lockeian philosophy, which
made for ever an epoch in philosophy, because it commenced
at last the serious discussion of the question as to the origin of
our knowledge. It is also principally what the “Critique of Pure
Reason” teaches. It also desires that we should not remain at the
conceptions, but go back to their source, thus to perception; only
with the true and important addition that what holds good of the
perception also extends to its subjective conditions, thus to the
forms which lie predisposed in the perceiving and thinking brain
as its natural functions; although these at least virtualiter precede
the actual sense-perception, i.e., are a priori, and therefore do
not depend upon sense-perception, but it upon them. For these
forms themselves have indeed no other end, nor service, than to
produce the empirical perception on the nerves of sense being
excited, as other forms are determined afterwards to construct
thoughts in the abstract from the material of perception. 

The
“Critique of Pure Reason” is therefore related to the Lockeian
philosophy as the analysis of the infinite to elementary geometry,
but is yet throughout to be regarded as the continuation of the
Lockeian philosophy. The given material of every philosophy
is accordingly nothing else than the empirical consciousness,
which divides itself into the consciousness of one's own self (self-
consciousness) and the consciousness of other things (external
perception). For this alone is what is immediately and actually255
given. Every philosophy which, instead of starting from this,
takes for its starting-point arbitrarily chosen abstract conceptions,
such as, for example, absolute, absolute substance, God, infinity,
finitude, absolute identity, being, essence, &c., &c., moves in
the air without support, and can therefore never lead to a real
result. Yet in all ages philosophers have attempted it with
such materials; and hence even Kant sometimes, according to
the common usage, and more from custom than consistency,
defines philosophy as a science of mere conceptions. 

But such a
science would really undertake to extract from the partial ideas
(for that is what the abstractions are) what is not to be found
in the complete ideas (the perceptions), from which the former
were drawn by abstraction. The possibility of the syllogism
leads to this mistake, because here the combination of the
judgments gives a new result, although more apparent than real,
for the syllogism only brings out what already lay in the given
judgments; for it is true the conclusion cannot contain more
than the premisses. Conceptions are certainly the material of
philosophy, but only as marble is the material of the sculptor.
It is not to work out of them but in them; that is to say, it
is to deposit its results in them, but not to start from them as
what is given. Whoever wishes to see a glaring example of
such a false procedure from mere conceptions may look at the
“Institutio Theologica” of Proclus in order to convince himself
of the vanity of that whole method. There abstractions such as
“ 1⁄2, À»· ̧¿Â, ±3± ̧¿1⁄2, À±Á±3¿1⁄2 o±1 À±Á±3¿1⁄4μ1⁄2¿1⁄2, ±ÅÄ±ÁoμÂ,
±1Ä1¿1⁄2, oÁμ1ÄÄ¿1⁄2, o11⁄2·Ä¿1⁄2, ±o11⁄2·Ä¿1⁄2, o11⁄2¿Å1⁄4μ1⁄2¿1⁄2” (unum,
multa, bonum, producens et productum, sibi sufficiens, causa,
melius, mobile, immobile, motum), &c., are indiscriminately
collected, but the perceptions to which alone they owe their
origin and content ignored and contemptuously disregarded. 

A
theology is then constructed from these conceptions, but its goal,
the  ̧μ¿Â, is kept concealed; thus the whole procedure is apparently
unprejudiced, as if the reader did not know at the first page, just as well as the author, what it is all to end in. I have already quoted a
fragment of this above. This production of Proclus is really quite
peculiarly adapted to make clear how utterly useless and illusory
such combinations of abstract conceptions are, for we can make
of them whatever we will, especially if we further take advantage
of the ambiguity of many words, such, for example, as oÁμ1ÄÄ¿1⁄2.
If such an architect of conceptions were present in person we
would only have to ask naively where all the things are of which
he has so much to tell us, and whence he knows the laws from
which he draws his conclusions concerning them. He would then
soon be obliged to turn to empirical perception, in which alone
the real world exhibits itself, from which those conceptions are
drawn. 

Then we would only have to ask further why he did
not honestly start from the given perception of such a world, so
that at every step his assertions could be proved by it, instead of
operating with conceptions, which are yet drawn from perception
alone, and therefore can have no further validity than that which
it imparts to them. But of course this is just his trick. Through
such conceptions, in which, by virtue of abstraction, what is
inseparable is thought as separate, and what cannot be united
as united, he goes far beyond the perception which was their
source, and thus beyond the limits of their applicability, to an
entirely different world from that which supplied the material for
building, but just on this account to a world of chimeras. 

I have
here referred to Proclus because in him this procedure becomes
specially clear through the frank audacity with which he carries it
out. But in Plato also we find some examples of this kind, though
not so glaring; and in general the philosophical literature of all
ages affords a multitude of instances of the same thing. That of
our own time is rich in them. Consider, for example, the writings
of the school of Schelling, and observe the constructions that are
built up out of abstractions like finite and infinite—being, non-
being, other being—activity, hindrance, product—determining,
being determined, determinateness—limit, limiting, being257
limited—unity, plurality, multiplicity—identity, diversity,
indifference—thinking, being, essence, &c. Not only does
all that has been said above hold good of constructions out of
such materials, but because an infinite amount can be thought
through such wide abstractions, only very little indeed can be
thought in them; they are empty husks. But thus the matter of the
whole philosophising becomes astonishingly trifling and paltry,
and hence arises that unutterable and excruciating tediousness
which is characteristic of all such writings. If indeed I now chose
to call to mind the way in which Hegel and his companions have
abused such wide and empty abstractions, I should have to fear
that both the reader and I myself would be ill; for the most
nauseous tediousness hangs over the empty word-juggling of this
loathsome philophaster.

That in practical philosophy also no wisdom is brought to light
from mere abstract conceptions is the one thing to be learnt from
the ethical dissertations of the theologian Schleiermacher, with
the delivery of which he has wearied the Berlin Academy for a
number of years, and which are shortly to appear in a collected
form. In them only abstract conceptions, such as duty, virtue,
highest good, moral law, &c., are taken as the starting-point,
without further introduction than that they commonly occur in
ethical systems, and are now treated as given realities. He then
discusses these from all sides with great subtilty, but, on the
other hand, never makes for the source of these conceptions, for
the thing itself, the actual human life, to which alone they are
related, from which they ought to be drawn, and with which
morality has, properly speaking, to do. On this account these
diatribes are just as unfruitful and useless as they are tedious,
which is saying a great deal. At all times we find persons, like
this theologian, who is too fond of philosophising, famous while
they are alive, afterwards soon forgotten. My advice is rather to
read those whose fate has been the opposite of this, for time is
short and valuable.

Now although, in accordance with all that has been said, wide,
abstract conceptions, which can be realised in no perception,
must never be the source of knowledge, the starting-point or the
proper material of philosophy, yet sometimes particular results
of philosophy are such as can only be thought in the abstract, and
cannot be proved by any perception. Knowledge of this kind will
certainly only be half knowledge; it will, as it were, only point
out the place where what is to be known lies; but this remains
concealed. Therefore we should only be satisfied with such
conceptions in the most extreme case, and when we have reached
the limit of the knowledge possible to our faculties. An example
of this might perhaps be the conception of a being out of time;
such as the proposition: the indestructibility of our true being by
death is not a continued existence of it. With conceptions of this
sort the firm ground which supports our whole knowledge, the
perceptible, seems to waver. Therefore philosophy may certainly
at times, and in case of necessity, extend to such knowledge, but
it must never begin with it.

The working with wide abstractions, which is condemned
above, to the entire neglect of the perceptive knowledge from
which they are drawn, and which is therefore their permanent
and natural controller, was at all times the principal source of the
errors of dogmatic philosophy. A science constructed from the
mere comparison of conceptions, that is, from general principles,
could only be certain if all its principles were synthetical a
priori, as is the case in mathematics: for only such admit of
no exceptions. If, on the other hand, the principles have any
empirical content, we must keep this constantly at hand, to
control the general principles. For no truths which are in any way
drawn from experience are ever unconditionally true. They have
therefore only an approximately universal validity; for here there
is no rule without an exception. If now I link these principles
together by means of the intersection of their concept-spheres,
one conception might very easily touch the other precisely where259
the exception lies. But if this happens even only once in the
course of a long train of reasoning, the whole structure is loosed
from its foundation and moves in the air. If, for example, I say,
“The ruminants have no front incisors,” and apply this and what
follows from it to the camel, it all becomes false, for it only holds
good of horned ruminants. What Kant calls das Vernünfteln,
mere abstract reasoning, and so often condemns, is just of this
sort. For it consists simply in subsuming conceptions under
conceptions, without reference to their origin, and without proof
of the correctness and exclusiveness of such subsumption—a
method whereby we can arrive by longer or shorter circuits
at almost any result we choose to set before us as our goal.
Hence this mere abstract reasoning differs only in degree from
sophistication strictly so called. But sophistication is in the
theoretical sphere exactly what chicanery is in the practical.
Yet even Plato himself has very frequently permitted such mere
abstract reasoning; and Proclus, as we have already mentioned,
has, after the manner of all imitators, carried this fault of his
model much further. Dionysius the Areopagite, “De Divinis
Nominibus,” is also strongly affected with this. But even in
the fragments of the Eleatic Melissus we already find distinct
examples of such mere abstract reasoning (especially § 2-5 in
Brandis' Comment. Eleat.) His procedure with the conceptions,
which never touch the reality from which they have their content,
but, moving in the atmosphere of abstract universality, pass away
beyond it, resembles blows which never hit the mark. A good
pattern of such mere abstract reasoning is the “De Diis et Mundo”
of the philosopher Sallustius Büchelchen; especially chaps. 7,
12, and 17. But a perfect gem of philosophical mere abstract
reasoning passing into decided sophistication is the following
reasoning of the Platonist, Maximus of Tyre, which I shall quote,
as it is short: “Every injustice is the taking away of a good. There
is no other good than virtue: but virtue cannot be taken away: thus
it is not possible that the virtuous can suffer injustice from the wicked. 

It now remains either that no injustice can be suffered, or
that it is suffered by the wicked from the wicked. But the wicked
man possesses no good at all, for only virtue is a good; therefore
none can be taken from him. Thus he also can suffer no injustice.
Thus injustice is an impossible thing.” The original, which is less
concise through repetitions, runs thus: “‘ ́1o1± μÃÄ1 ±Æ±1ÁμÃ1Â

¿Å ́μ μ1Â A, Ä1 ± ́1o·Ã ̧·, μÇμ1” (Sermo 2). I shall add further a
modern example of such proofs from abstract conceptions, by
means of which an obviously absurd proposition is set up as the
truth, and I shall take it from the works of a great man, Giordano
Bruno. In his book, “Del Infinito Universo e Mondi” (p. 87 of
the edition of A. Wagner), he makes an Aristotelian prove (with
the assistance and exaggeration of the passage of Aristotle's De
Cœlo, i. 5) that there can be no space beyond the world. 

The
world is enclosed by the eight spheres of Aristotle, and beyond
these there can be no space. For if beyond these there were still
a body, it must either be simple or compound. It is now proved
sophistically, from principles which are obviously begged, that
no simple body could be there; and therefore, also, no compound
body, for it would necessarily be composed of simple ones. Thus
in general there can be no body there—but if not, then no space.
For space is defined as “that in which bodies can be;” and it
has just been proved that no body can be there. Thus there is
also there no space. This last is the final stroke of this proof
from abstract conceptions. It ultimately rests on the fact that the
proposition, “Where no space is, there can be no body” is taken261
as a universal negative, and therefore converted simply, “Where
no body can be there is no space.” But the former proposition,
when properly regarded, is a universal affirmative: “Everything
that has no space has no body,” thus it must not be converted
simply. Yet it is not every proof from abstract conceptions,
with a conclusion which clearly contradicts perception (as here
the finiteness of space), that can thus be referred to a logical
error. For the sophistry does not always lie in the form, but often
in the matter, in the premisses, and in the indefiniteness of the
conceptions and their extension. We find numerous examples
of this in Spinoza, whose method indeed it is to prove from
conceptions. See, for example, the miserable sophisms in his
“Ethics,” P. iv., prop. 29-31, by means of the ambiguity of the
uncertain conceptions convenire and commune habere. Yet this
does not prevent the neo-Spinozists of our own day from taking
all that he has said for gospel. Of these the Hegelians, of whom
there are actually still a few, are specially amusing on account of
their traditional reverence for his principle, omnis determinatio
est negatio, at which, according to the charlatan spirit of the
school, they put on a face as if it was able to unhinge the world;
whereas it is of no use at all, for even the simplest can see
for himself that if I limit anything by determinations, I thereby
exclude and thus negate what lies beyond these limits.
Thus in all mere reasonings of the above kind it becomes
very apparent what errors that algebra with mere conceptions,
uncontrolled by perception, is exposed to, and that therefore
perception is for our intellect what the firm ground upon which
it stands is for our body: if we forsake perception everything
is instabilis tellus, innabilis unda. 

The reader will pardon
the fulness of these expositions and examples on account of
their instructiveness. I have sought by means of them to
bring forward and support the difference, indeed the opposition,
between perceptive and abstract or reflected knowledge, which
has hitherto been too little regarded, and the establishment of which is a fundamental characteristic of my philosophy. For
many phenomena of our mental life are only explicable through
this distinction. The connecting link between these two such
different kinds of knowledge is the faculty of judgment, as I
have shown in § 14 of the first volume. This faculty is certainly
also active in the province of mere abstract knowledge, in
which it compares conceptions only with conceptions; therefore
every judgment, in the logical sense of the word, is certainly
a work of the faculty of judgment, for it always consists in
the subsumption of a narrower conception under a wider one.
Yet this activity of the faculty of judgment, in which it merely
compares conceptions with each other, is a simpler and easier task
than when it makes the transition from what is quite particular,
the perception, to the essentially general, the conception. For
by the analysis of conceptions into their essential predicates it
must be possible to decide upon purely logical grounds whether
they are capable of being united or not, and for this the mere
reason which every one possesses is sufficient. The faculty
of judgment is therefore only active here in shortening this
process, for he who is gifted with it sees at a glance what
others only arrive at through a series of reflections. But its
activity in the narrower sense really only appears when what is
known through perception, thus the real experience, has to be
carried over into distinct abstract knowledge, subsumed under
accurately corresponding conceptions, and thus translated into
reflected rational knowledge. It is therefore this faculty which
has to establish the firm basis of all sciences, which always
consists of what is known directly and cannot be further denied.
Therefore here, in the fundamental judgments, lies the difficulty
of the sciences, not in the inferences from these. To infer is easy,
to judge is difficult. False inferences are rare, false judgments
are always the order of the day. Not less in practical life has
the faculty of judgment to give the decision in all fundamental
conclusions and important determinations. Its office is in the263
main like that of the judicial sentence. As the burning-glass
brings to a focus all the sun's rays, so when the understanding
works, the intellect has to bring together all the data which it has
upon the subject so closely that the understanding comprehends
them at a glance, which it now rightly fixes, and then carefully
makes the result distinct to itself. 

Further, the great difficulty
of judging in most cases depends upon the fact that we have
to proceed from the consequent to the reason, a path which is
always uncertain; indeed I have shown that the source of all
error lies here. Yet in all the empirical sciences, and also in the
affairs of real life, this way is for the most part the only one
open to us. The experiment is an attempt to go over it again the
other way; therefore it is decisive, and at least brings out error
clearly; provided always that it is rightly chosen and honestly
carried out; not like Newton's experiments in connection with
the theory of colours. But the experiment itself must also again
be judged. The complete certainty of the a priori sciences, logic
and mathematics, depends principally upon the fact that in them
the path from the reason to the consequent is open to us, and
it is always certain. This gives them the character of purely
objective sciences, i.e., sciences with regard to whose truths
all who understand them must judge alike; and this is all the
more remarkable as they are the very sciences which rest on the
subjective forms of the intellect, while the empirical sciences
alone have to do with what is palpably objective.

Wit and ingenuity are also manifestations of the faculty of
judgment; in the former its activity is reflective, in the latter
subsuming. In most men the faculty of judgment is only
nominally present; it is a kind of irony that it is reckoned
with the normal faculties of the mind, instead of being only
attributed to the monstris per excessum. Ordinary men show
even in the smallest affairs want of confidence in their own
judgment, just because they know from experience that it is of
no service. With them prejudice and imitation take its place;

Thus they are kept in a state of continual non-age, from which
scarcely one in many hundreds is delivered. Certainly this is not
avowed, for even to themselves they appear to judge; but all the
time they are glancing stealthily at the opinion of others, which
is their secret standard. While each one would be ashamed to go
about in a borrowed coat, hat, or mantle, they all have nothing
but borrowed opinions, which they eagerly collect wherever they
can find them, and then strut about giving them out as their own.
Others borrow them again from them and do the same thing. This
explains the rapid and wide spread of errors, and also the fame
of what is bad; for the professional purveyors of opinion, such as
journalists and the like, give as a rule only false wares, as those
who hire out masquerading dresses give only false jewels.
