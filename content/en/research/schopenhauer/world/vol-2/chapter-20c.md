We became acquainted above with the cerebral nervous system as an assistant organ of the will, in which it therefore objectifies itself in a secondary manner. As thus the cerebral system,
although not directly coming within the sphere of the life-
functions of the organism, but only governing its relations to the
outer world, has yet the organism as its basis, and is nourished by
it in return for its services; and as thus the cerebral or animal life
is to be regarded as the production of the organic life, the brain
and its function, knowledge, thus the intellect, belong indirectly
and in a subordinate manner to the manifestation of the will. The
will objectifies itself also in it, as will to apprehend the external
world, thus as will to know. Therefore great and fundamental as
is the difference in us between willing and knowing, the ultimate
substratum of both is yet the same, the will, as the real inner
nature of the whole phenomenon. 

But knowing, the intellect,
which presents itself in self-consciousness entirely as secondary,
is to be regarded not only as the accident of the will, but also as
its work, and thus, although in a circuitous manner, is yet to be
referred to it. As the intellect presents itself physiologically as
the function of an organ of the body, metaphysically it is to be
regarded as a work of the will, whose objectification or visible
appearance is the whole body. Thus the will to know, objectively
perceived, is the brain; as the will to go, objectively perceived,
is the foot; the will to grasp, the hand; the will to digest,
the stomach; the will to beget, the genitals, &c. This whole
objectification certainly ultimately exists only for the brain, as
its perception: in this the will exhibits itself as organised body.


But so far as the brain knows, it is itself not known, but is the knower, the subject of all knowledge. So far, however, as in
objective perception, i.e., in the consciousness of other things,
thus secondarily, it is known, it belongs, as an organ of the
body, to the objectification of the will. For the whole process
is the self-knowledge of the will; it starts from this and returns
to it, and constitutes what Kant has called the phenomenon in
opposition to the thing in itself. Therefore that which is known,
that which is idea, is the will; and this idea is what we call body,
which, as extended in space and moving in time, exists only by
means of the functions of the brain, thus only in it. That, on
the other hand, which knows, which has that idea, is the brain,
which yet does not know itself, but only becomes conscious of
itself subjectively as intellect, i.e., as the knower. That which
when regarded from within is the faculty of knowledge is when
regarded from without the brain. 

This brain is a part of that
body, just because it itself belongs to the objectification of the
will, the will's will to know is objectified in it, its tendency
towards the external world. Accordingly the brain, and therefore
the intellect, is certainly conditioned immediately by the body,
and this again by the brain, yet only indirectly, as spatial and
corporeal, in the world of perception, not in itself, i.e., as will.
Thus the whole is ultimately the will, which itself becomes idea,
and is that unity which we express by I. The brain itself, so far
as it is perceived—thus in the consciousness of other things, and
hence secondarily—is only idea. But in itself, and so far as it
perceives, it is the will, because this is the real substratum of the
whole phenomenon; its will to know objectifies itself as brain
and its functions. We may take the voltaic pile as an illustration,
certainly imperfect, but yet to some extent throwing light upon
the nature of the human phenomenon, as we here regard it. The
metals, together with the fluid, are the body; the chemical action,
as the basis of the whole effect, is the will, and the electric
current resulting from it, which produces shock and spark, is the
intellect. But omne simile claudicat.473

Quite recently the physiatrica point of view has at last
prevailed in pathology. According to it diseases are themselves
a curative process of nature, which it introduces to remove, by
overcoming its causes, a disorder which in some way has got
into the organism. Thus in the decisive battle, the crisis, it is
either victorious and attains its end, or else is defeated. This
view only gains its full rationality from our standpoint, which
shows the will in the vital force, that here appears as vis naturœ
medicatrix, the will which lies at the foundation of all organic
functions in a healthy condition, but now, when disorder has
entered, threatening its whole work, assumes dictatorial power
in order to subdue the rebellious forces by quite extraordinary
measures and entirely abnormal operations (the disease), and
bring everything back to the right track. On the other hand, that
the will itself is sick, as Brandis repeatedly expresses himself
in his book, “Ueber die Anwendung der Kälte,” which I have
quoted in the first part of my essay, “Ueber den Willen in der
Natur,” is a gross misunderstanding. When I weigh this, and
at the same time observe that in his earlier book, “Ueber die
Lebenskraft,” of 1795, Brandis betrayed no suspicion that this
force is in itself the will, but, on the contrary, says there, page 13:
“It is impossible that the vital force can be that which we only
know through our consciousness, for most movements take place
without our consciousness. The assertion that this, of which the
only characteristic known to us is consciousness, also affects the
body without consciousness is at the least quite arbitrary and
unproved;” and page 14: “Haller's objections to the opinion that
all living movements are the effect of the soul are, as I believe,
quite unanswerable;” when I further reflect that he wrote his
book, “Ueber die Anwendung der Kälte,” in which all at once the
will appears so decidedly as the vital force, in his seventieth year,
an age at which no one as yet has conceived for the first time
original fundamental thoughts; when, lastly, I bear in mind that
he makes use of my exact expressions, “will and idea,” and not of those which are far more commonly used by others, “the faculties of desire and of knowledge,” I am now convinced, contrary to
my earlier supposition, that he borrowed his fundamental thought
from me, and with the usual honesty which prevails at the present
day in the learned world, said nothing about it. The particulars
about this will be found in the second (and third) edition of my
work, “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” p. 14.

Nothing is more fitted to confirm and illustrate the
thesis with which we are occupied in this chapter than
Bichat's justly celebrated book, “Sur la vie et la mort.” His
reflections and mine reciprocally support each other, for his
are the physiological commentary on mine, and mine are the
philosophical commentary on his, and one will best understand
us both by reading us together. This refers specially to the first
half of his work, entitled “Recherches physiologiques sur la vie.”

He makes the foundation of his expositions the opposition of
the organic to the animal life, which corresponds to mine of
the will to the intellect. Whoever looks at the sense, not at the
words, will not allow himself to be led astray by the fact that he
ascribes the will to the animal life; for by will, as is usual, he
only understands conscious volition, which certainly proceeds
from the brain, where, however, as was shown above, it is not
yet actual willing, but only deliberation upon and estimation of
the motives, the conclusion or product of which at last appears
as the act of will. All that I ascribe to the will proper he ascribes
to the organic life, and all that I conceive as intellect is with him
the animal life: the latter has with him its seat in the brain alone,
together with its appendages: the former, again, in the whole
of the remainder of the organism. 

The complete opposition in
which he shows that the two stand to each other corresponds to
that which with me exists between the will and the intellect. As
anatomist and physiologist he starts from the objective, that is,
from the consciousness of other things; I, as a philosopher, start
from the subjective, self-consciousness; and it is a pleasure to475
see how, like the two voices in a duet, we advance in harmony
with each other, although each expresses something different.
Therefore, let every one who wishes to understand me read him;
and let every one who wishes to understand him, better than
he understood himself, read me. Bichat shows us, in article
4, that the organic life begins earlier and ends later than the
animal life; consequently, since the latter also rests in sleep,
has nearly twice as long a duration; then, in articles 8 and 9,
that the organic life performs everything perfectly, at once, and
of its own accord; the animal life, on the other hand, requires
long practice and education. But he is most interesting in the
sixth article, where he shows that the animal life is completely
limited to the intellectual operations, therefore goes on coldly
and indifferently, while the emotions and passions have their
seat in the organic life, although the occasions of them lie in the
animal, i.e., the cerebral, life. Here he has ten valuable pages
which I wish I could quote entire. On page 50 he says: “Il est sans
doute étonnant, que les passions n'ayent jamais leur terme ni leur
origine dans les divers organs de la vie animale; qu'au contraire
les parties servant aux fonctions internes, soient constamment
affectées par elles, et même les déterminent suivant l'état où elles
se trouvent. Tel est cependant ce que la stricte observation nous
prouve. Je dis d'abord que l'effet de toute espèce de passion,
constamment étranger à la vie animale, est de faire naître un
changement, une altération quelconque dans la vie organique.”

Then he shows in detail how anger acts on the circulation of
the blood and the beating of the heart, then how joy acts, and
lastly how fear; next, how the lungs, the stomach, the intestines,
the liver, glands, and pancreas are affected by these and kindred
emotions, and how grief diminishes the nutrition; and then how
the animal, that is, the brain life, is untouched by all this, and
quietly goes on its way. He refers to the fact that to signify
intellectual operations we put the hand to the head, but, on the
contrary, we lay it on the heart, the stomach, the bowels, if we wish to express our love, joy, sorrow, or hatred; and he remarks that he must be a bad actor who when he spoke of his grief would
touch his head, and when he spoke of his mental effort would
touch his heart; and also that while the learned make the so-called
soul reside in the head, the common people always indicate the
well-felt difference between the affections of the intellect and
the will by the right expression, and speak, for example, of a
capable, clever, fine head; but, on the other hand, say a good
heart, a feeling heart, and also “Anger boils in my veins,” “Stirs
my gall,” “My bowels leap with joy,” “Jealousy poisons my
blood,” &c. “Les chants sont le langage des passions, de la vie
organique, comme la parole ordinaire est celui de l'entendement,
de la vie animale: la déclamation, tient le milieu, elle anime la
langue froide du cerveau par la langue expressive des organes
intérieurs, du cœur, du foie, de l'estomac,” &c. His conclusion
is: “La vie organique est le terme où aboutissent, et le centre d'où
partent les passions.”

Nothing is better fitted than this excellent
and thorough book to confirm and bring out clearly that the
body is only the embodied (i.e., perceived by means of the brain
functions, time, space, and causality) will itself, from which it
follows that the will is the primary and original, the intellect,
as mere brain function, the subordinate and derived. But that
which is most worthy of admiration, and to me most pleasing,
in Bichat's thought is, that this great anatomist, on the path of
his purely physiological investigations, actually got so far as to
explain the unalterable nature of the moral character from the
fact that only the animal life, thus the functions of the brain,
are subject to the influence of education, practice, culture, and
habit, but the moral character belongs to the organic life, i.e.,
to all the other parts, which cannot be modified from without.
I cannot refrain from giving the passage; it occurs in article
9, § 2: “Telle est donc la grande différence des deux vies de
l'animal” (cerebral or animal and organic life) “par rapport à
l'inégalité de perfection des divers systèmes de fonctions, dont477
chacune résulte; savoir, que dans l'une la prédominance ou
l'infériorité d'un système relativement aux autres, tient presque
toujours à l'activité ou à l'inertie plus grandes de ce système, à
l'habitude d'agir ou de ne pas agir; que dans l'autre, au contraire,
cette prédominance ou cette infériorité sont immédiatement liées
a la texture des organes, et jamais à leur éducation. Voilà
pourquoi le tempérament physique et le CHARACTÈRE MORAL ne
sont point susceptible de changer par l'éducation, qui modifie
si prodigieusement les actes de la vie animale; car, comme
nous l'avons vu, tous deux APPARTIENNENT À LA VIE ORGANIQUE.

La charactère est, si je puis m'exprimer ainsi, la physionomie
des passions; le tempérament est celle des fonctions internes:
or les unes et les autres étant toujours les mêmes, ayant une
direction que l'habitude et l'exercice ne dérangent jamais, il est
manifeste que le tempérament et le charactère doivent être aussi
soustraits à l'empire de l'éducation. Elle peut modérer l'influence
du second, perfectionner assez le jugement et la réflection, pour
rendre leur empire supérieur au sien, fortifier la vie animal afin
qu'elle résiste aux impulsions de l'organique. Mais vouloir par
elle dénaturer le charactère, adoucir ou exalter les passions
dont il est l'expression habituelle, agrandir ou resserrer leur
sphère, c'est une entreprise analogue a celle d'un médecin qui
essaierait d'élever ou d'abaisser de quelque degrés, et pour
toute la vie, la force de contraction ordinaire au cœur dans
l'état de santé, de précipiter ou de ralentir habituellement le
mouvement naturel aux artères, et qui est nécessaire à leur
action, etc. Nous observerions à ce médecin, que la circulation,
la respiration, etc., ne sont point sous le domaine de la volonté
(volition), quelles ne peuvent être modifiées par l'homme, sans
passer à l'état maladif, etc. Faisons la même observation à
ceux qui croient qu'on change le charactère, et par-là, même les
PASSIONS, puisque celles-ci sont un PRODUIT DE L'ACTION DE TOUS
LES ORGANES INTERNES, ou qu'elles y ont au moins spécialement
leur siège.” The reader who is familiar with my philosophy may imagine how great was my joy when I discovered, as it were,
the proof of my own convictions in those which were arrived at
upon an entirely different field, by this extraordinary man, so
early taken from the world.
