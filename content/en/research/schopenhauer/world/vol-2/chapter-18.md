Chapter XVIII.29 On The Possibility Of Knowing The Thing In Itself.

In 1836 I already published, under the title “Ueber den Willen
in der Natur” (second ed., 1854; third ed., 1867), the most
essential supplement to this book, which contains the most
peculiar and important step in my philosophy, the transition from
the phenomenon to the thing in itself, which Kant gave up as
impossible. It would be a great mistake to regard the foreign
conclusions with which I have there connected my expositions
as the real material and subject of that work, which, though small
as regards its extent, is of weighty import. These conclusions
are rather the mere occasion starting from which I have there
expounded that fundamental truth of my philosophy with so
much greater clearness than anywhere else, and brought it down
to the empirical knowledge of nature. And indeed this is done
most exhaustively and stringently under the heading “Physische
Astronomie;” so that I dare not hope ever to find a more correct or
accurate expression of that core of my philosophy than is given
there. Whoever desires to know my philosophy thoroughly and
to test it seriously must therefore give attention before everything
to that section. Thus, in general, all that is said in that little work
would form the chief content of these supplements, if it had not
to be excluded on account of having preceded them; but, on the
other hand, I here take for granted that it is known, for otherwise
the very best would be wanting.
I wish now first of all to make a few preliminary observations
from a general point of view as to the sense in which we can
speak of a knowledge of the thing in itself and of its necessary
limitation.
What is knowledge? It is primarily and essentially idea. What
is idea? A very complicated physiological process in the brain of

This chapter is connected with § 18 of the first volume.


an animal, the result of which is the consciousness of a picture
there. Clearly the relation between such a picture and something
entirely different from the animal in whose brain it exists can
only be a very indirect one. This is perhaps the simplest and
most comprehensible way of disclosing the deep gulf between
the ideal and the real. This belongs to the things of which, like
the motion of the earth, we are not directly conscious; therefore
the ancients did not observe it, just as they did not observe the
motion of the earth. Once pointed out, on the other hand, first by
Descartes, it has ever since given philosophers no rest. But after
Kant had at last proved in the most thorough manner the complete
diversity of the ideal and the real, it was an attempt, as bold as it
was absurd, yet perfectly correctly calculated with reference to
the philosophical public in Germany, and consequently crowned
with brilliant results, to try to assert the absolute identity of
the two by dogmatic utterances, on the strength of a pretended
intellectual intuition. In truth, on the contrary, a subjective
and an objective existence, a being for self and a being for
others, a consciousness of one's own self, and a consciousness
of other things, is given us directly, and the two are given in
such a fundamentally different manner that no other difference
can compare with this. About himself every one knows directly,
about all others only very indirectly. This is the fact and the
problem.
[401]
Whether, on the other hand, through further processes in
the interior of a brain, general conceptions (Universalia) are
abstracted from the perceptible ideas or images that have arisen
within it, for the assistance of further combinations, whereby
knowledge becomes rational, and is now called thinking—this
is here no longer the essential question, but is of subordinate
significance. For all such conceptions receive their content
only from the perceptible idea, which is therefore primary
knowledge, and has consequently alone to be taken account
of in an investigation of the relation between the ideal and the389
real. It therefore shows entire ignorance of the problem, or at
least it is very inept, to wish to define that relation as that between
being and thinking. Thinking has primarily only a relation to
perceiving, but perception has a relation to the real being of
what is perceived, and this last is the great problem with which
we are here concerned. Empirical being, on the other hand,
as it lies before us, is nothing else than simply being given in
perception; but the relation of the latter to thinking is no riddle,
for the conceptions, thus the immediate materials of thought,
are obviously abstracted from perception, which no reasonable
man can doubt. It may be said in passing that one can see
how important the choice of expressions in philosophy is from
the fact that that inept expression condemned above, and the
misunderstanding which arose from it, became the foundation of
the whole Hegelian pseudo-philosophy, which has occupied the
German public for twenty-five years.
If, however, it should be said: “The perception is itself the
knowledge of the thing in itself: for it is the effect of that which
is outside of us, and as this acts, so it is: its action is just its
being;” to this we reply: (1.) that the law of causality, as has
been sufficiently proved, is of subjective origin, as well as the
sensation from which the perception arises; (2.) that at any
rate time and space, in which the object presents itself, are of
subjective origin; (3.) that if the being of the object consists
simply in its action, this means that it consists merely in the
changes which it brings about in others; therefore itself and in
itself it is nothing at all. Only of matter is it true, as I have said in
the text, and worked out in the essay on the principle of sufficient
reason, at the end of § 21, that its being consists in its action, that
it is through and through only causality, thus is itself causality
objectively regarded; hence, however, it is also nothing in itself
(! Q»· Ä¿ ±»· ̧11⁄2¿1⁄2 ÈμÅ ́¿Â, materia mendacium verax), but as
an ingredient in the perceived object, is a mere abstraction, which
for itself alone can be given in no experience. It will be fully
[402]390
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
considered later on in a chapter of its own. But the perceived
object must be something in itself, and not merely something for
others. For otherwise it would be altogether merely idea, and
we would have an absolute idealism, which would ultimately
become theoretical egoism, with which all reality disappears and
the world becomes a mere subjective phantasm. If, however,
without further question, we stop altogether at the world as idea,
then certainly it is all one whether I explain objects as ideas
in my head or as phenomena exhibiting themselves in time and
space; for time and space themselves exist only in my head.
In this sense, then, an identity of the ideal and the real might
always be affirmed; only, after Kant, this would not be saying
anything new. Besides this, however, the nature of things and of
the phenomenal world would clearly not be thereby exhausted;
but with it we would always remain still upon the ideal side. The
real side must be something toto genere different from the world
as idea, it must be that which things are in themselves; and it is
this entire diversity between the ideal and the real which Kant
has proved in the most thorough manner.
[403]
Locke had denied to the senses the knowledge of things as
they are in themselves; but Kant denied this also to the perceiving
understanding, under which name I here comprehend what he
calls the pure sensibility, and, as it is given a priori, the law
of causality which brings about the empirical perception. Not
only are both right, but we can also see quite directly that a
contradiction lies in the assertion that a thing is known as it is
in and for itself, i.e., outside of knowledge. For all knowing
is, as we have said, essentially a perceiving of ideas; but my
perception of ideas, just because it is mine, can never be identical
with the inner nature of the thing outside of me. The being
in and for itself, of everything, must necessarily be subjective;
in the idea of another, however, it exists just as necessarily
as objective—a difference which can never be fully reconciled.
For by it the whole nature of its existence is fundamentally391
changed; as objective it presupposes a foreign subject, as whose
idea it exists, and, moreover, as Kant has shown, has entered
forms which are foreign to its own nature, just because they
belong to that foreign subject, whose knowledge is only possible
by means of them. If I, absorbed in this reflection, perceive,
let us say lifeless bodies, of easily surveyed magnitude and
regular, comprehensible form, and now attempt to conceive this
spatial existence, in its three dimensions, as their being in itself,
consequently as the existence which to the things is subjective,
the impossibility of the thing is at once apparent to me, for I can
never think those objective forms as the being which to the things
is subjective, rather I become directly conscious that what I there
perceive is only a picture produced in my brain, and existing
only for me as the knowing subject, which cannot constitute the
ultimate, and therefore subjective, being in and for itself of even
these lifeless bodies. But, on the other hand, I must not assume
that even these lifeless bodies exist only in my idea, but, since
they have inscrutable qualities, and, by virtue of these, activity,
I must concede to them a being in itself of some kind. But this
very inscrutableness of the properties, while, on the one hand, it
certainly points to something which exists independently of our
knowledge, gives also, on the other hand, the empirical proof that
our knowledge, because it consists simply in framing ideas by
means of subjective forms, affords us always mere phenomena,
not the true being of things. This is the explanation of the fact
that in all that we know there remains hidden from us a certain
something, as quite inscrutable, and we are obliged to confess
that we cannot thoroughly understand even the commonest and
simplest phenomena. For it is not merely the highest productions
of nature, living creatures, or the complicated phenomena of the
unorganised world that remain inscrutable to us, but even every
rock-crystal, every iron-pyrite, by reason of its crystallographical,
optical, chemical, and electrical properties, is to the searching
consideration and investigation an abyss of incomprehensibilities
[404]392
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
and mysteries. This could not be the case if we knew things as
they are in themselves; for then at least the simpler phenomena,
the path to whose qualities was not barred for us by ignorance,
would necessarily be thoroughly comprehensible to us, and
their whole being and nature would be able to pass over into
our knowledge. Thus it lies not in the defectiveness of our
acquaintance with things, but in the nature of knowledge itself.
For if our perception, and consequently the whole empirical
comprehension of the things that present themselves to us, is
already essentially and in the main determined by our faculty
of knowledge, and conditioned by its forms and functions, it
cannot but be that things exhibit themselves in a manner which
is quite different from their own inner nature, and therefore
appear as in a mask, which allows us merely to assume what is
concealed beneath it, but never to know it; hence, then, it gleams
through as an inscrutable mystery, and never can the nature of
anything entire and without reserve pass over into knowledge;
but much less can any real thing be construed a priori, like a
mathematical problem. Thus the empirical inscrutableness of all
natural things is a proof a posteriori of the ideality and merely
phenomenal-actuality of their empirical existence.
[405]
According to all this, upon the path of objective knowledge,
hence starting from the idea, one will never get beyond the idea,
i.e., the phenomenon. One will thus remain at the outside of
things, and will never be able to penetrate to their inner nature
and investigate what they are in themselves, i.e., for themselves.
So far I agree with Kant. But, as the counterpart of this truth, I
have given prominence to this other truth, that we are not merely
the knowing subject, but, in another aspect, we ourselves also
belong to the inner nature that is to be known, we ourselves
are the thing in itself ; that therefore a way from within stands
open for us to that inner nature belonging to things themselves, to
which we cannot penetrate from without, as it were a subterranean
passage, a secret alliance, which, as if by treachery, places us393
at once within the fortress which it was impossible to take by
assault from without. The thing in itself can, as such, only come
into consciousness quite directly, in this way, that it is itself
conscious of itself : to wish to know it objectively is to desire
something contradictory. Everything objective is idea, therefore
appearance, mere phenomenon of the brain.
Kant's chief result may in substance be thus concisely stated:
“All conceptions which have not at their foundation a perception
in space and time (sensuous intuition), that is to say then, which
have not been drawn from such a perception, are absolutely
empty, i.e., give no knowledge. But since now perception can
afford us only phenomena, not things in themselves, we have
also absolutely no knowledge of things in themselves.” I grant
this of everything, with the single exception of the knowledge
which each of us has of his own willing: this is neither a
perception (for all perception is spatial) nor is it empty; rather
it is more real than any other. Further, it is not a priori, like
merely formal knowledge, but entirely a posteriori; hence also
we cannot anticipate it in the particular case, but are hereby often
convicted of error concerning ourselves. In fact, our willing is
the one opportunity which we have of understanding from within
any event which exhibits itself without, consequently the one
thing which is known to us immediately, and not, like all the rest,
merely given in the idea. Here, then, lies the datum which alone
is able to become the key to everything else, or, as I have said,
the single narrow door to the truth. Accordingly we must learn
to understand nature from ourselves, not conversely ourselves
from nature. What is known to us immediately must give us the
explanation of what we only know indirectly, not conversely. Do
we perhaps understand the rolling of a ball when it has received
an impulse more thoroughly than our movement when we feel a
motive? Many may imagine so, but I say it is the reverse. Yet
we shall attain to the knowledge that what is essential in both the
occurrences just mentioned is identical; although identical in the
[406]394
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
same way as the lowest audible note of harmony is the same as
the note of the same name ten octaves higher.
[407]
Meanwhile it should be carefully observed, and I have always
kept it in mind, that even the inward experience which we have
of our own will by no means affords us an exhaustive and
adequate knowledge of the thing in itself. This would be the case
if it were entirely an immediate experience; but it is effected
in this way: the will, with and by means of the corporisation,
provides itself also with an intellect (for the sake of its relations
to the external world), and through this now knows itself as will
in self-consciousness (the necessary counterpart of the external
world); this knowledge therefore of the thing in itself is not fully
adequate. First of all, it is bound to the form of the idea, it is
apprehension, and as such falls asunder into subject and object.
For even in self-consciousness the I is not absolutely simple, but
consists of a knower, the intellect, and a known, the will. The
former is not known, and the latter does not know, though both
unite in the consciousness of an I. But just on this account that I
is not thoroughly intimate with itself, as it were transparent, but
is opaque, and therefore remains a riddle to itself, thus even in
inner knowledge there also exists a difference between the true
being of its object and the apprehension of it in the knowing
subject. Yet inner knowledge is free from two forms which
belong to outer knowledge, the form of space and the form of
causality, which is the means of effecting all sense-perception.
On the other hand, there still remains the form of time, and that
of being known and knowing in general. Accordingly in this
inner knowledge the thing in itself has indeed in great measure
thrown off its veil, but still does not yet appear quite naked. In
consequence of the form of time which still adheres to it, every
one knows his will only in its successive acts, and not as a whole,
in and for itself: therefore no one knows his character a priori,
but only learns it through experience and always incompletely.
But yet the apprehension, in which we know the affections and395
acts of our own will, is far more immediate than any other.
It is the point at which the thing in itself most directly enters
the phenomenon and is most closely examined by the knowing
subject; therefore the event thus intimately known is alone fitted
to become the interpreter of all others.
For in every emergence of an act of will from the obscure
depths of our inner being into the knowing consciousness a direct
transition occurs of the thing in itself, which lies outside time,
into the phenomenal world. Accordingly the act of will is indeed
only the closest and most distinct manifestation of the thing in
itself; yet it follows from this that if all other manifestations or
phenomena could be known by us as directly and inwardly, we
would be obliged to assert them to be that which the will is in
us. Thus in this sense I teach that the inner nature of everything
is will, and I call will the thing in itself. Kant's doctrine of
the unknowableness of the thing in itself is hereby modified to
this extent, that the thing in itself is only not absolutely and
from the very foundation knowable, that yet by far the most
immediate of its phenomena, which by this immediateness is
toto genere distinguished from all the rest, represents it for us;
and accordingly we have to refer the whole world of phenomena
to that one in which the thing in itself appears in the very thinnest
of veils, and only still remains phenomenon in so far as my
intellect, which alone is capable of knowledge, remains ever
distinguished from me as the willing subject, and moreover does
not even in inner perfection put off the form of knowledge of
time.

Accordingly, even after this last and furthest step, the question
may still be raised, what that will, which exhibits itself in the
world and as the world, ultimately and absolutely is in itself?
i.e., what it is, regarded altogether apart from the fact that it
exhibits itself as will, or in general appears, i.e., in general
is known. This question can never be answered: because, as
we have said, becoming known is itself the contradictory of being in itself, and everything that is known is as such only
phenomenal. But the possibility of this question shows that
the thing in itself, which we know most directly in the will,
may have, entirely outside all possible phenomenal appearance,
ways of existing, determinations, qualities, which are absolutely
unknowable and incomprehensible to us, and which remain as
the nature of the thing in itself, when, as is explained in the fourth
book, it has voluntarily abrogated itself as will, and has therefore
retired altogether from the phenomenon, and for our knowledge,
i.e., as regards the world of phenomena, has passed into empty
nothingness. If the will were simply and absolutely the thing in
itself this nothing would also be absolute, instead of which it
expressly presents itself to us there as only relative.

Psychological facts which prove that 

1. In our own consciousness the will always appears as primary and fundamental, and throughout asserts its superiority
to the intellect, which, on the other hand, always presents itself
as secondary, subordinate, and conditioned. 

This proof is the
more necessary as all philosophers before me, from the first to
the last, place the true being or the kernel of man in the knowing
consciousness, and accordingly have conceived and explained
the I, or, in the case of many of them, its transcendental hypostasis
called soul, as primarily and essentially knowing, nay, thinking,
and only in consequence of this, secondarily and derivatively, as
willing. This ancient and universal radical error, this enormous
ÀÁÉÄ¿1⁄2 ÈμÅ ́¿Â and fundamental QÃÄμÁ¿1⁄2 ÀÁ¿ÄμÁ¿1⁄2, must before
everything be set aside, and instead of it the true state of the
case must be brought to perfectly distinct consciousness. Since,397
however, this is done here for the first time, after thousands
of years of philosophising, some fulness of statement will be
appropriate. The remarkable phenomenon, that in this most
essential point all philosophers have erred, nay, have exactly
reversed the truth, might, especially in the case of those of the
Christian era, be partly explicable from the fact that they all had
the intention of presenting man as distinguished as widely as
possible from the brutes, yet at the same time obscurely felt that
the difference between them lies in the intellect, not in the will;
whence there arose unconsciously within them an inclination to
make the intellect the essential and principal thing, and even
to explain volition as a mere function of the intellect. Hence
also the conception of a soul is not only inadmissible, because
it is a transcendent hypostasis, as is proved by the “Critique of
Pure Reason,” but it becomes the source of irremediable errors,
because in its “simple substance” it establishes beforehand an
indivisible unity of knowledge and will, the separation of which
is just the path to the truth. That conception must therefore appear
no more in philosophy, but may be left to German doctors and
physiologists, who, after they have laid aside scalpel and spattle,
amuse themselves by philosophising with the conceptions they
received when they were confirmed. They might certainly try
their luck in England. The French physiologists and zootomists
have (till lately) kept themselves free from that reproach.
The first consequence of their common fundamental error,
which is very inconvenient to all these philosophers, is this:
since in death the knowing consciousness obviously perishes,
they must either allow death to be the annihilation of the man,
to which our inner being is opposed, or they must have recourse
to the assumption of a continued existence of the knowing
consciousness, which requires a strong faith, for his own
experience has sufficiently proved to every one the thorough
and complete dependence of the knowing consciousness upon
the brain, and one can just as easily believe in digestion without a stomach as in a knowing consciousness without a brain. My
philosophy alone leads out of this dilemma, for it for the first
time places the true being of man not in the consciousness but in
the will, which is not essentially bound up with consciousness,
but is related to consciousness, i.e., to knowledge, as substance
to accident, as something illuminated to the light, as the string
to the resounding-board, and which enters consciousness from
within as the corporeal world does from without. Now we can
comprehend the indestructibleness of this our real kernel and true
being, in spite of the evident ceasing of consciousness in death,
and the corresponding non-existence of it before birth. For the
intellect is as perishable as the brain, whose product or rather
whose action it is. But the brain, like the whole organism, is
the product or phenomenon, in short, the subordinate of the will,
which alone is imperishable.
