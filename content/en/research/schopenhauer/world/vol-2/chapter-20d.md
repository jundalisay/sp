A special authentication of the truth that the organism is
merely the visibility of the will is also afforded us by the fact
that if dogs, cats, domestic cocks, and indeed other animals, bite
when violently angry, the wounds become mortal; nay, if they
come from a dog, may cause hydrophobia in the man who is
bitten, without the dog being mad or afterwards becoming so.
For the extremest anger is only the most decided and vehement
will to annihilate its object; this now appears in the assumption
by the saliva of an injurious, and to a certain extent magically
acting, power, and springs from the fact that the will and the
organism are in truth one. This also appears from the fact
that intense vexation may rapidly impart to the mother's milk
such a pernicious quality that the sucking child dies forthwith in
convulsions (Most, Ueber sympathetische Mittel, p. 16).

Bichat has, as we have shown above, cast a deep glance into
human nature, and in consequence has given an exceedingly
admirable exposition, which is one of the most profound works
in the whole of French literature. Now, sixty years later, M.
Flourens suddenly appears with a polemic against it in his work,
“De la vie et de l'intelligence,” and makes so bold as to declare
without ceremony that all that Bichat has brought to light on
this important subject, which was quite his own, is false. And
what does he oppose to him in the field? Counter reasons?

No, counter assertions37 and authorities, indeed, which are as
inadmissible as they are remarkable—Descartes and Gall! M.
Flourens is by conviction a Cartesian, and to him Descartes,
in the year 1858, is still “le philosophe par excellence.” Now
Descartes was certainly a great man, yet only as a forerunner.
In the whole of his dogmas, on the other hand, there is not a
word of truth; and to appeal to these as authorities at this time of
day is simply absurd. For in the nineteenth century a Cartesian
in philosophy is just what a follower of Ptolemy would be in
astronomy, or a follower of Stahl in chemistry. But for M.
Flourens the dogmas of Descartes are articles of faith. Descartes
has taught, les volontés sont des pensées: therefore this is the
case, although every one feels within himself that willing and
thinking are as different as white and black. Hence I have been
able above, in chapter 19, to prove and explain this fully and
thoroughly, and always under the guidance of experience. But
above all, according to Descartes, the oracle of M. Flourens,
there are two fundamentally different substances, body and soul.
Consequently M. Flourens, as an orthodox Cartesian, says: “Le
37
« Tout ce qui est relatif à l'entendement appartient à la vie animale, »
dit Bichat, et jusque-là point de doute; « tout ce qui est relatif aux passions
appartient à la vie organique, »—et ceci est absolument faux. Indeed!—decrevit
Florentius magnus.480

premier point est de séparer, même par les mots, ce qui est du
corps de ce qui est de l'âme” (i. 72). He informs us further that
this “âme réside uniquement et exclusivement dans le cerveau”
(ii. 137); from whence, according to a passage of Descartes, it
sends the spiritus animales as couriers to the muscles, yet can
only itself be affected by the brain; therefore the passions have
their seat (siège) in the heart, which is altered by them, yet their
place (place) in the brain. Thus, really thus, speaks the oracle of
M. Flourens, who is so much edified by it, that he even utters
it twice after him (i. 33 and ii. 135), for the unfailing conquest
of the ignorant Bichat, who knows neither soul nor body, but
merely an animal and an organic life, and whom he then here
condescendingly informs that we must thoroughly distinguish
the parts where the passions have their seat (siègent) from those
which they affect. According to this, then, the passions act in
one place while they are in another. Corporeal things are wont
to act only where they are, but with an immaterial soul the case
may be different. But what in general may he and his oracle
really have thought in this distinction of place and siège, of
sièger and affecter? The fundamental error of M. Flourens and
Descartes springs really from the fact that they confound the
motives or occasions of the passions, which, as ideas, certainly
lie in the intellect, i.e., in the brain, with the passions themselves,
which, as movements of the will, lie in the whole body, which
(as we know) is the perceived will itself. M. Flourens' second
authority is, as we have said, Gall. I certainly have said, at the
beginning of this twentieth chapter (and already in the earlier
edition): “The greatest error in Gall's phrenology is, that he
makes the brain the organ of moral qualities also.” 

But what
I censure and reject is precisely what M. Flourens praises and
admires, for he bears in his heart the doctrine of Descartes:
“Les volontés sont des pensées.” Accordingly he says, p. 144:
“Le premier service que Gall a rendu à la physiologie (?) a
éte de rammener le moral à l'intellectuel, et de faire voir queNote On What Has Been Said About Bichat.
481
les facultés morales et les facultés intellectuelles sont du même
ordre, et de les placer toutes, autant les unes que les autres,
uniquement et exclusivement dans le cerveau.” To a certain extent
my whole philosophy, but especially the nineteenth chapter of
this volume, consists of the refutation of this fundamental error.
M. Flourens, on the contrary, is never tired of extolling this as
a great truth and Gall as its discoverer; for example, p. 147:
“Si j'en étais à classer les services que nous a rendu Gall, je
dirais que le premier a été de rammener les qualités morales au
cerveau;”—p. 153: “Le cerveau seul est l'organe de l'âme, et
de l'âme dans toute la plénitude de ses fonctions” (we see the
simple soul of Descartes still always lurks in the background, as
the kernel of the matter); “il est le siège de toutes les facultés
intellectuelles.... Gall a rammené LE MORAL A L'INTELLECTUEL, il a
rammené les qualités morales au même siège, au même organe,
que les facultés intellectuelles.” Oh how must Bichat and I be
ashamed of ourselves in the presence of such wisdom! 

But, to
speak seriously, what can be more disheartening, or rather more
shocking, than to see the true and profound rejected and the false
and perverse extolled; to live to find that important truths, deeply
hidden, and extracted late and with difficulty, are to be torn
down, and the old, stale, and late conquered errors set up in their
place; nay, to be compelled to fear that through such procedure
the advances of human knowledge, so hardly achieved, will be
broken off! But let us quiet our fears; for magma est vis veritatis
et prævalebit. M. Flourens is unquestionably a man of much
merit, but he has chiefly acquired it upon the experimental path.

Just those truths, however, which are of the greatest importance
cannot be brought out by experiments, but only by reflection and
penetration. Now Bichat by his reflection and penetration has
here brought a truth to light which is of the number of those which
are unattainable by the experimental efforts of M. Flourens, even
if, as a true and consistent Cartesian, he tortures a hundred more
animals to death. But he ought betimes to have observed and thought something of this: “Take care, friend, for it burns.”
The presumption and self-sufficiency, however, such as is only
imparted by superficiality combined with a false obscurity, with
which M. Flourens undertakes to refute a thinker like Bichat
by counter assertions, old wives' beliefs, and futile authorities,
indeed to reprove and instruct him, and even almost to mock at
him, has its origin in the nature of the Academy and its fauteuils.
Throned upon these, and saluting each other mutually as illustre
confrère, gentlemen cannot avoid making themselves equal with
the best who have ever lived, regarding themselves as oracles,
and therefore fit to decree what shall be false and what true.
This impels and entitles me to say out plainly for once, that the
really superior and privileged minds, who now and then are born
for the enlightenment of the rest, and to whom certainly Bichat
belongs, are so “by the grace of God,” and accordingly stand to
the Academy (in which they have generally occupied only the
forty-first fauteuil) and to its illustres confrères, as born princes
to the numerous representatives of the people, chosen from the
crowd. Therefore a secret awe should warn these gentlemen of
the Academy (who always exist by the score) before they attack
such a man,—unless they have most cogent reasons to present,
and not mere contradictions and appeals to placita of Descartes,
which at the present day is quite absurd.Footnotes***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE
