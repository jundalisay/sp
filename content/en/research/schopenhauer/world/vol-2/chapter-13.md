Euclid's method of demonstration has brought forth from its
own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous
controversy on the theory of parallels, and the attempts, which
are repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom. This axiom
asserts, and indeed supports its assertion by the indirect evidence
of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclining towards each
other (for that is just the meaning of “less than two right angles”)
if produced far enough must meet—a truth which is supposed to
be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore requires
a demonstration. Such a demonstration, however, cannot be
produced, just because there is nothing that is not immediate.

This scruple of conscience reminds me of Schiller's question of
law:—

“For years I have used my nose for smelling. Have I, then,
actually a right to it that can be proved?” Indeed it seems to
me that the logical method is hereby reduced to absurdity. Yet
it is just through the controversies about this, together with
the vain attempts to prove what is directly certain as merely
indirectly certain, that the self-sufficingness and clearness of
intuitive evidence appears in contrast with the uselessness and
difficulty of logical proof—a contrast which is no less instructive
than amusing. The direct certainty is not allowed to be valid
here, because it is no mere logical certainty following from the
conceptions, thus resting only upon the relation of the predicate
to the subject, according to the principle of contradiction. That
axiom, however, is a synthetical proposition a priori, and as such
has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception, which is
just as immediate and certain as the principle of contradiction
itself, from which all demonstrations first derive their certainty.
Ultimately this holds good of every geometrical theorem, and
it is quite arbitrary where we draw the line between what is directly certain and what has first to be demonstrated. It surprises
me that the eighth axiom is not rather attacked. “Figures which
coincide with each other are equal to each other.” For “coinciding
with each other” is either a mere tautology or something purely
empirical which does not belong to pure perception but to
external sensuous experience. It presupposes that the figures
may be moved; but only matter is movable in space. Therefore
this appeal to coincidence leaves pure space—the one element
of geometry—in order to pass over to what is material and
empirical.

The reputed motto of the Platonic lecture-room,
“‘3μÉ1⁄4μÄÁ·Ä¿Â 1⁄4· ́μ1Â μ1Ã1ÄÉ,” of which mathematicians are so
proud, was no doubt inspired by the fact that Plato regarded
the geometrical figures as intermediate existences between
the eternal Ideas and particular things, as Aristotle frequently
mentions in his “Metaphysics” (especially i. c. 6, p. 887, 998, et
Scholia, p. 827, ed. Berol.) Moreover, the opposition between
those self-existent eternal forms, or Ideas, and the transitory
individual things, was most easily made comprehensible in
geometrical figures, and thereby laid the foundation of the
doctrine of Ideas, which is the central point of the philosophy of
Plato, and indeed his only serious and decided theoretical dogma.
In expounding it, therefore, he started from geometry. In the same
sense we are told that he regarded geometry as a preliminary
exercise through which the mind of the pupil accustomed itself
to deal with incorporeal objects, having hitherto in practical life
had only to do with corporeal things (Schol. in Aristot., p.
12, 15). 

This, then, is the sense in which Plato recommended
geometry to the philosopher; and therefore one is not justified
in extending it further. I rather recommend, as an investigation
of the influence of mathematics upon our mental powers, and
their value for scientific culture in general, a very thorough and
learned discussion, in the form of a review of a book by Whewell
in the Edinburgh Review of January 1836. Its author, who afterwards published it with some other discussions, with his
name, is Sir W. Hamilton, Professor of Logic and Metaphysics
in Scotland. This work has also found a German translator,
and has appeared by itself under the title, “Ueber den Werth
und Unwerth der Mathematik” aus dem Englishen, 1836. The
conclusion the author arrives at is that the value of mathematics
is only indirect, and lies in the application to ends which are only
attainable through them; but in themselves mathematics leave
the mind where they find it, and are by no means conducive
to its general culture and development, nay, even a decided
hindrance. This conclusion is not only proved by thorough
dianoiological investigation of the mathematical activity of the
mind, but is also confirmed by a very learned accumulation of
examples and authorities. The only direct use which is left to
mathematics is that it can accustom restless and unsteady minds
to fix their attention. Even Descartes, who was yet himself
famous as a mathematician, held the same opinion with regard
to mathematics. In the “Vie de Descartes par Baillet,” 1693,
it is said, Liv. ii. c. 6, p. 54: “Sa propre expérience l'avait
convaincu du peu d'utilité des mathématiques, surtout lorsqu'on
ne les cultive que pour elles mêmes.... Il ne voyait rien de moins
solide, que de s'occuper de nombres tout simples et de figures
imaginaires,” &c.
