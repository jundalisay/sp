The presence of ideas and thoughts in our consciousness is as
strictly subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason in its
different forms as the movement of bodies to the law of causality.

It is just as little possible that a thought can appear in the mind
without an occasion as that a body can be set in motion without a
cause. Now this occasion is either external, thus an impression of
the senses, or internal, thus itself also a thought which introduces
another thought by means of association. This again depends
either upon a relation of reason and consequent between the
two; or upon similarity, even mere analogy; or lastly upon the
circumstance that they were both first apprehended at the same
time, which again may have its ground in the proximity in space
of their objects. The last two cases are denoted by the word
à propos. The predominance of one of these three bonds of
association of thoughts over the others is characteristic of the
intellectual worth of the man. The first named will predominate
in thoughtful and profound minds, the second in witty, ingenious,
and poetical minds, and the third in minds of limited capacity.
Not less characteristic is the degree of facility with which one
thought recalls others that stand in any kind of relation to it:
this constitutes the activeness of the mind. But the impossibility
of the appearance of a thought without its sufficient occasion,
even when there is the strongest desire to call it up, is proved by
all the cases in which we weary ourselves in vain to recollect
something, and go through the whole store of our thoughts in
order to find any one that may be associated with the one we
seek; if we find the former, the latter is also found. Whoever
wishes to call up something in his memory first seeks for a thread
with which it is connected by the association of thoughts. Upon
this depends mnemonics: it aims at providing us with easily
found occasioners or causes for all the conceptions, thoughts, or
words which are to be preserved. But the worst of it is that these occasioners themselves have first to be recalled, and this again
requires an occasioner. 

How much the occasion accomplishes
in memory may be shown in this way. If we have read in a
book of anecdotes say fifty anecdotes, and then have laid it
aside, immediately afterwards we will sometimes be unable to
recollect a single one of them. But if the occasion comes, or if
a thought occurs to us which has any analogy with one of those
anecdotes, it immediately comes back to us; and so with the
whole fifty as opportunity offers. The same thing holds good of
all that we read. Our immediate remembrance of words, that is,
our remembrance of them without the assistance of mnemonic
contrivances, and with it our whole faculty of speech, ultimately
depends upon the direct association of thoughts. For the learning
of language consists in this, that once for all we so connect a
conception with a word that this word will always occur to us
along with this conception, and this conception will always occur
to us along with this word. We have afterwards to repeat the
same process in learning every new language; yet if we learn
a language for passive and not for active use—that is, to read,
but not to speak, as, for example, most of us learn Greek—then
the connection is one-sided, for the conception occurs to us
along with the word, but the word does not always occur to us
along with the conception. The same procedure as in language
becomes apparent in the particular case, in the learning of every
new proper name. But sometimes we do not trust ourselves
to connect directly the name of this person, or town, river,
mountain, plant, animal, &c., with the thought of each so firmly
that it will call each of them up of itself; and then we assist
ourselves mnemonically, and connect the image of the person or
thing with any perceptible quality the name of which occurs in
that of the person or thing. Yet this is only a temporary prop
to lean on; later we let it drop, for the association of thoughts
becomes an immediate support.
The search of memory for a clue shows itself in a peculiar
[326]318
[327]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
manner in the case of a dream which we have forgotten on
awaking, for in this case we seek in vain for that which a few
minutes before occupied our minds with the strength of the
clearest present, but now has entirely disappeared. We grasp
at any lingering impression by which may hang the clue that
by virtue of association would call that dream back again into
our consciousness. According to Kieser, “Tellurismus,” Bd. ii.
§ 271, memory even of what passed in magnetic-somnambular
sleep may possibly sometimes be aroused by a sensible sign
found when awake. It depends upon the same impossibility
of the appearance of a thought without its occasion that if we
propose to do anything at a definite time, this can only take place
if we either think of nothing else till then, or if at the determined
time we are reminded of it by something, which may either be
an external impression arranged beforehand or a thought which
is itself again brought about in the regular way. Both, then,
belong to the class of motives. Every morning when we awake
our consciousness is a tabula rasa, which, however, quickly
fills itself again. First it is the surroundings of the previous
evening which now reappear, and remind us of what we thought
in these surroundings; to this the events of the previous day link
themselves on; and so one thought rapidly recalls the others,
till all that occupied us yesterday is there again. Upon the fact
that this takes place properly depends the health of the mind,
as opposed to madness, which, as is shown in the third book,
consists in the existence of great blanks in the memory of past
events. But how completely sleep breaks the thread of memory,
so that each morning it has to be taken up again, we see in
particular cases of the incompleteness of this operation. For
example, sometimes we cannot recall in the morning a melody
which the night before ran in our head till we were tired of it.
The cases in which a thought or a picture of the fancy
suddenly came into our mind without any conscious occasion
seem to afford an exception to what has been said. Yet this is forChapter XIV. On The Association Of Ideas.

the most part an illusion, which rests on the fact that the occasion
was so trifling and the thought itself so vivid and interesting,
that the former is instantly driven out of consciousness. Yet
sometimes the cause of such an instantaneous appearance of an
idea may be an internal physical impression either of the parts of
the brain on each other or of the organic nervous system upon
the brain.
In general our internal process of thought is in reality not so
simple as the theory of it; for here it is involved in many ways.
To make the matter clear to our imagination, let us compare
our consciousness to a sheet of water of some depth. Then the
distinctly conscious thoughts are merely the surface; while, on
the other hand, the indistinct thoughts, the feelings, the after
sensation of perceptions and of experience generally, mingled
with the special disposition of our own will, which is the kernel
of our being, is the mass of the water. Now the mass of the whole
consciousness is more or less, in proportion to the intellectual
activity, in constant motion, and what rise to the surface, in
consequence of this, are the clear pictures of the fancy or the
distinct, conscious thoughts expressed in words and the resolves
of the will. The whole process of our thought and purpose seldom
lies on the surface, that is, consists in a combination of distinctly
thought judgments; although we strive against this in order that
we may be able to explain our thought to ourselves and others.
But ordinarily it is in the obscure depths of the mind that the
rumination of the materials received from without takes place,
through which they are worked up into thoughts; and it goes on
almost as unconsciously as the conversion of nourishment into
the humours and substance of the body. Hence it is that we can
often give no account of the origin of our deepest thoughts. They
are the birth of our mysterious inner life. Judgments, thoughts,
purposes, rise from out that deep unexpectedly and to our own
surprise. A letter brings us unlooked-for and important news, in
consequence of which our thoughts and motives are disordered;
[328]320
[329]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
we get rid of the matter for the present, and think no more about
it; but next day, or on the third or fourth day after, the whole
situation sometimes stands distinctly before us, with what we
have to do in the circumstances. Consciousness is the mere
surface of our mind, of which, as of the earth, we do not know
the inside, but only the crust.
But in the last instance, or in the secret of our inner being,
what sets in activity the association of thought itself, the laws of
which were set forth above, is the will, which urges its servant
the intellect, according to the measure of its powers, to link
thought to thought, to recall the similar, the contemporaneous, to
recognise reasons and consequents. For it is to the interest of the
will that, in general, one should think, so that one may be well
equipped for all cases that may arise. Therefore the form of the
principle of sufficient reason which governs the association of
thoughts and keeps it active is ultimately the law of motivation.
For that which rules the sensorium, and determines it to follow the
analogy or other association of thoughts in this or that direction,
is the will of the thinking subject. Now just as here the laws of
the connection of ideas subsist only upon the basis of the will,
so also in the real world the causal connection of bodies really
subsists only upon the basis of the will, which manifests itself
in the phenomena of this world. On this account the explanation
from causes is never absolute and exhaustive, but leads back to
forces of nature as their condition, and the inner being of the
latter is just the will as thing in itself. In saying this, however, I
have certainly anticipated the following book.
But because now the outward (sensible) occasions of the
presence of our ideas, just as well as the inner occasions (those
of association), and both independently of each other, constantly
affect the consciousness, there arise from this the frequent
interruptions of our course of thought, which introduce a certain
cutting up and confusion of our thinking. This belongs to its
imperfections which cannot be explained away, and which weChapter XIV. On The Association Of Ideas.

shall now consider in a separate chapter.
