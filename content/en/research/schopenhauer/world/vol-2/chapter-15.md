Our self-consciousness has not space but only time as its form,
and therefore we do not think in three dimensions, as we perceive,
but only in one, thus in a line, without breadth or depth. This
is the source of the greatest of the essential imperfections of our
intellect. We can know all things only in succession, and can
become conscious of only one at a time, indeed even of this one
only under the condition that for the time we forget everything
else, thus are absolutely unconscious of everything else, so that
for the time it ceases to exist as far as we are concerned. In respect
of this quality our intellect may be compared to a telescope with
a very narrow field of vision; just because our consciousness
is not stationary but fleeting. The intellect apprehends only
successively, and in order to grasp one thing must let another
go, retaining nothing but traces of it, which are ever becoming
weaker. The thought which is vividly present to me now must
after a little while have escaped me altogether; and if a good
night's sleep intervene, it may be that I shall never find it again,
unless it is connected with my personal interests, that is, with my
will, which always commands the field.

Upon this imperfection of the intellect depends the
disconnected and often fragmentary nature of our course of
thought, which I have already touched on at the close of last
chapter; and from this again arises the unavoidable distraction of
our thinking. Sometimes external impressions of sense throng in
upon it, disturbing and interrupting it, forcing different kinds of
things upon it every moment; sometimes one thought draws in
another by the bond of association, and is now itself dislodged
by it; sometimes, lastly, the intellect itself is not capable of fixing
itself very long and continuously at a time upon one thought, but
as the eye when it gazes long at one object is soon unable to see
it any more distinctly, because the outlines run into each other323
and become confused, until finally all is obscure, so through
long-continued reflection upon one subject our thinking also is
gradually confused, becomes dull, and ends in complete stupor.

Therefore after a certain time, which varies with the individual,
we must for the present give up every meditation or deliberation
which has had the fortune to remain undisturbed, but yet has not
been brought to an end, even if it concerns a matter which is most
important and pertinent to us; and we must dismiss from our
consciousness the subject which interests us so much, however
heavily our anxiety about it may weigh upon us, in order to occupy
ourselves now with insignificant and indifferent things. During
this time that important subject no longer exists for us; it is like
the heat in cold water, latent. If now we resume it again at another
time, we approach it like a new thing, with which we become
acquainted anew, although more quickly, and the agreeable or
disagreeable impression of it is also produced anew upon our
will. We ourselves, however, do not come back quite unchanged.
For with the physical composition of the humours and tension of
the nerves, which constantly changes with the hours, days, and
years, our mood and point of view also changes. Moreover, the
different kinds of ideas which have been there in the meantime
have left an echo behind them, the tone of which influences the
ideas which follow. Therefore the same thing appears to us at
different times, in the morning, in the evening, at mid-day, or
on another day, often very different; opposite views of it now
press upon each other and increase our doubt. Hence we speak
of sleeping upon a matter, and for important determinations we
demand a long time for consideration. Now, although this quality
of our intellect, as springing from its weakness, has its evident
disadvantages, yet, on the other hand, it affords the advantage
that after the distraction and the physical change we return to our
subject as comparatively new beings, fresh and strange, and thus
are able to see it repeatedly in very different lights. 

From all this
it is plain that human consciousness and thought is in its nature necessarily fragmentary, on account of which the theoretical and
practical results which are achieved by piecing together such
fragments are for the most part defective. In this our thinking
consciousness is like a magic lantern, in the focus of which only
one picture can appear at a time, and each, even if it represents
the noblest objects, must yet soon pass away in order to make
room for others of a different, and even most vulgar, description.
In practical matters the most important plans and resolutions are
formed in general; but others are subordinated to these as means
to an end, and others again are subordinated to these, and so on
down to the particular case that has to be carried out in concreto.
They do not, however, come to be carried out in the order of their
dignity, but while we are occupied with plans which are great
and general, we have to contend with the most trifling details and
the cares of the moment. In this way our consciousness becomes
still more desultory. In general, theoretical occupations of the
mind unfit us for practical affairs, and vice versâ.

In consequence of the inevitably distracted and fragmentary
nature of all our thinking, which has been pointed out, and the
mingling of ideas of different kinds thereby introduced, to which
even the noblest human minds are subject, we really have only
half a consciousness with which to grope about in the labyrinth of
our life and the obscurity of our investigations; bright moments
sometimes illuminate our path like lightning. But what is to be
expected of heads of which even the wisest is every night the
scene of the strangest and most senseless dreams, and which
has to take up its meditations again on awakening from these?
Clearly a consciousness which is subject to such great limitations
is little suited for solving the riddle of the world; and such an
endeavour would necessarily appear strange and pitiful to a being
of a higher order whose intellect had not time as its form, and
whose thinking had thus true completeness and unity. Indeed it
is really wonderful that we are not completely confused by the
very heterogeneous mixture of ideas and fragments of thought325
of every kind which are constantly crossing each other in our
minds, but are yet always able to see our way again and make
everything agree together. Clearly there must exist a simpler
thread upon which everything ranges itself together: but what
is this? Memory alone is not sufficient, for it has essential
limitations of which I shall speak shortly, and besides this, it
is exceedingly imperfect and untrustworthy. The logical ego
or even the transcendental synthetic unity of apperception are
expressions and explanations which will not easily serve to make
the matter comprehensible; they will rather suggest to many:
“'Tis true your beard is curly, yet it will not draw you the
bolt.”

Kant's proposition, “The I think must accompany all our
ideas,” is insufficient; for the “I” is an unknown quantity, i.e.,
it is itself a secret. That which gives unity and connection to
consciousness in that it runs through all its ideas, and is thus its
substratum, its permanent supporter, cannot itself be conditioned
by consciousness, therefore cannot be an idea. Rather it must be
the prius of consciousness, and the root of the tree of which that
is the fruit. This, I say, is the will. It alone is unchangeable and
absolutely identical, and has brought forth consciousness for its
own ends. Therefore it is also the will which gives it unity and
holds together all its ideas and thoughts, accompanying them like
a continuous harmony. Without it the intellect would no longer
have the unity of consciousness, as a mirror in which now this
and now that successively presents itself, or at the most only
so much as a convex mirror whose rays unite in an imaginary
point behind its surface. But the will alone is that which is
permanent and unchangeable in consciousness. It is the will
which holds together all thoughts and ideas as means to its ends,
and tinges them with the colour of its own character, its mood,
and its interests, commands the attention, and holds in its hand
the train of motives whose influence ultimately sets memory and the association of ideas in activity; at bottom it is the will that
is spoken of whenever “I” appears in a judgment. Thus it is the
true and final point of unity of consciousness, and the bond of all
its functions and acts; it does not itself, however, belong to the
intellect, but is only its root, source, and controller.

From the form of time and the single dimension of the series
of ideas, on account of which, in order to take up one, the
intellect must let all the others fall, there follows not only its
distraction, but also its forgetfulness. Most of what it lets fall
it never takes up again; especially since the taking up again is
bound to the principle of sufficient reason, and thus demands
an occasion which the association of thoughts and motivation
have first to supply; an occasion, however, which may be the
more remote and smaller in proportion as our sensibility for it is
heightened by our interest in the subject. But memory, as I have
already shown in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason,
is not a store-house, but merely a faculty acquired by practice
of calling up ideas at pleasure, which must therefore constantly
be kept in practice by use; for otherwise it will gradually be
lost. Accordingly the knowledge even of the learned man exists
only virtualiter as an acquired facility in calling up certain ideas;
actualiter, on the other hand, it also is confined to one idea,
and is only conscious of this one at a time. Hence arises a
strange contrast between what he knows potentiâ and what he
knows actu; that is, between his knowledge and what he thinks
at any moment: the former is an immense and always somewhat
chaotic mass, the latter is a single distinct thought. The relation
resembles that between the innumerable stars of the heavens and
the limited field of vision of the telescope; it appears in a striking
manner when upon some occasion he wishes to call distinctly to
his remembrance some particular circumstance in his knowledge,
and time and trouble are required to produce it from that chaos.
Rapidity in doing this is a special gift, but is very dependent
upon day and hour; therefore memory sometimes refuses us its327
service, even in things which at another time it has readily at
hand. This consideration calls us in our studies to strive more
to attain to correct insight than to increase our learning, and to
lay it to heart that the quality of knowledge is more important
than its quantity. The latter imparts to books only thickness, the
former thoroughness and also style; for it is an intensive quantity,
while the other is merely extensive. It consists in the distinctness
and completeness of the conceptions, together with the purity
and accuracy of the knowledge of perception which forms their
foundation; therefore the whole of knowledge in all its parts
is penetrated by it, and in proportion as it is so is valuable or
trifling. With a small quantity, but of good quality, one achieves
more than with a very large quantity of bad quality.
The most perfect and satisfactory knowledge is that of
perception, but it is limited absolutely to the particular, the
individual. The combination of the many and the different in one
idea is only possible through the conception, that is, through the
omission of the differences; therefore this is a very imperfect
manner of presenting things to the mind. Certainly the particular
also can be directly comprehended as a universal, if it is raised
to the (Platonic) Idea; but in this process, which I have analysed
in the third book, the intellect already passes beyond the limits
of individuality, and therefore of time; moreover it is only an
exception.
These inner and essential imperfections of the intellect are
further increased by a disturbance which, to a certain extent,
is external to it, but yet is unceasing—the influence exerted
by the will upon all its operations whenever it is in any way
concerned in their result. Every passion, indeed every inclination
and aversion, tinges the objects of knowledge with its colour. Of
most common occurrence is the falsifying of knowledge which
is brought about by wishes and hopes, for they picture to us the
scarcely possible as probable and well nigh certain, and make us
almost incapable of comprehending what is opposed to it: fear
[336]328
[337]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
acts in a similar way; and every preconceived opinion, every
partiality, and, as has been said, every interest, every emotion
and inclination of the will, acts in an analogous manner.
To all these imperfections of the intellect we have finally to add
this, that it grows old with the brain, that is, like all physiological
functions, it loses its energy in later years, whereby all its
imperfections are then much increased.
The defective nature of the intellect here set forth will not,
however, surprise us if we look back at its origin and destiny as
established by me in the second book. Nature has produced it for
the service of an individual will. Therefore it is only designed to
know things so far as they afford the motives of such a will, but not
to fathom them or comprehend their true being. Human intellect
is only a higher gradation of the intellect of the brutes; and as this
is entirely confined to the present, our intellect also bears strong
traces of this limitation, Therefore our memory and recollection
is something very imperfect. How little of all that we have done,
experienced, learnt, or read, can we recall! And even this little
for the most part only laboriously and imperfectly. For the same
reasons is it so very difficult for us to keep ourselves free from the
impressions of the present. Unconsciousness is the original and
natural condition of all things, and therefore also the basis from
which, in particular species of beings, consciousness results as
their highest efflorescence; wherefore even then unconsciousness
always continues to predominate. Accordingly most existences
are without consciousness; but yet they act according to the
laws of their nature, i.e., of their will. Plants have at most
a very weak analogue of consciousness; the lowest species of
animals only the dawn of it. But even after it has ascended
through the whole series of animals to man and his reason, the
unconsciousness of plants, from which it started, still remains
the foundation, and may be traced in the necessity for sleep, and
also in all those essential and great imperfections, here set forth,
of every intellect produced through physiological functions; and329
of another intellect we have no conception.
The imperfections here proved to be essential to the intellect
are constantly increased, however, in particular cases, by non-
essential imperfections. The intellect is never in every respect
what it possibly might be. The perfections possible to it are so
opposed that they exclude each other. Therefore no man can be
at once Plato and Aristotle, or Shakspeare and Newton, or Kant
and Goethe. The imperfections of the intellect, on the contrary,
consort very well together; therefore in reality it for the most
part remains far below what it might be. Its functions depend
upon so very many conditions, which we can only comprehend
as anatomical and physiological, in the phenomenon in which
alone they are given us, that a decidedly excelling intellect, even
in one respect alone, is among the rarest of natural phenomena.
Therefore the productions of such an intellect are preserved
through thousands of years, indeed every relic of such a highly
favoured individual becomes a most valuable treasure. From
such an intellect down to that which approaches imbecility the
gradations are innumerable. And primarily, in conformity with
these gradations, the mental horizon of each of us varies very
much from the mere comprehension of the present, which even
the brute has, to that which also embraces the next hour, the
day, even the morrow, the week, the year, the life, the century,
the thousand years, up to that of the consciousness which has
almost always present, even though obscurely dawning, the
horizon of the infinite, and whose thoughts therefore assume a
character in keeping with this. Further, that difference among
intelligences shows itself in the rapidity of their thinking, which
is very important, and which may be as different and as finely
graduated as that of the points in the radius of a revolving disc.
The remoteness of the consequents and reasons to which any
one's thought can extend seems to stand in a certain relation to
the rapidity of his thinking, for the greatest exertion of thought-
power in general can only last quite a short time, and yet only
[338]330
[339]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
while it lasts can a thought be thought out in its complete unity.
It therefore amounts to this, how far the intellect can pursue
it in so short a time, thus what length of path it can travel in
it. On the other hand, in the case of some, rapidity may be
made up for by the greater duration of that time of perfectly
concentrated thought. Probably the slow and lasting thought
makes the mathematical mind, while rapidity of thought makes
the genius. The latter is a flight, the former a sure advance upon
firm ground, step by step. Yet even in the sciences, whenever it
is no longer a question of mere quantities, but of understanding
the nature of phenomena, this last kind of thinking is inadequate.
This is shown, for example, by Newton's theory of colour, and
later by Biot's nonsense about colour rings, which yet agrees
with the whole atomistic method of treating light among the
French, with its molécules de lumière, and in general with their
fixed idea of reducing everything in nature to mere mechanical
effects. Lastly, the great individual diversity of intelligence we
are speaking about shows itself excellently in the degrees of the
clearness of understanding, and accordingly in the distinctness
of the whole thinking. To one man that is to understand which
to another is only in some degree to observe; the one is already
done and at the goal while the other is only at the beginning; to
the one that is the solution which to the other is only the problem.
This depends on the quality of thought and knowledge, which
was already referred to above. As in rooms the degree of light
varies, so does it in minds. We can detect this quality of the whole
thought as soon as we have read only a few pages of an author.
For in doing so we have been obliged to understand both with his
understanding and in his sense; and therefore before we know
all that he has thought we see already how he thinks, what is the
formal nature, the texture of his thinking, which remains the same
in everything about which he thinks, and whose expression is the
train of thought and the style. In this we feel at once the pace, the
flexibleness and lightness, even indeed the soaring power of his331
mind; or, on the contrary, its dulness, formality, lameness and
leaden quality. For, as language is the expression of the mind of a
nation, style is the more immediate expression of the mind of an
author than even his physiognomy. We throw a book aside when
we observe that in it we enter an obscurer region than our own,
unless we have to learn from it mere facts, not thoughts. Apart
from mere facts, only that author will afford us profit whose
understanding is keener and clearer than our own, who forwards
our thinking instead of hindering it, like the dull mind that will
force us to keep pace with the toad-like course of its thought;
thus that author with whose mind it gives us sensible relief
and assistance sometimes to think, by whom we feel ourselves
borne where we could not have gone alone. Goethe once said
to me that if he read a page of Kant he felt as if he entered a
brightly lighted room. Inferior minds are so not merely because
they are distorted, and therefore judge falsely, but primarily
through the indistinctness of their whole thinking, which may
be compared to seeing through a bad telescope, when all the
outlines appear indistinct and as if obliterated, and the different
objects run into each other. The weak understanding of such
minds shrinks from the demand for distinctness of conceptions,
and therefore they do not themselves make this claim upon it,
but put up with haziness; and to satisfy themselves with this
they gladly have recourse to words, especially such as denote
indefinite, very abstract, unusual conceptions which are hard
to explain; such, for example, as infinite and finite, sensible
and supersensible, the Idea of being, Ideas of the reason, the
absolute, the Idea of the good, the divine, moral freedom, power
of spontaneous generation, the absolute Idea, subject-object, &c.
The like of these they confidently fling about, imagine they
really express thoughts, and expect every one to be content with
them; for the highest summit of wisdom which they can see is
to have at command such ready-made words for every possible
question. This immense satisfaction in words is thoroughly
[340]332
[341]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
characteristic of inferior minds. It depends simply upon their
incapacity for distinct conceptions, whenever these must rise
above the most trivial and simple relations. Hence upon the
weakness and indolence of their intellect, and indeed upon the
secret consciousness of this, which in the case of scholars is
bound up with the early learnt and hard necessity of passing
themselves off as thinking beings, to meet which demand in all
cases they keep such a suitable store of ready-made words. It
must really be amusing to see a professor of philosophy of this
kind in the chair, who bonâ fide delivers such a juggle of words
destitute of thoughts, quite sincerely, under the delusion that they
are really thoughts, and in front of him the students, who just
as bonâ fide, i.e., under the same delusion, listen attentively and
take notes, while yet in reality neither the one nor the other goes
beyond the words, but rather these words themselves, together
with the audible scratching of pens, are the only realities in the
whole matter. This peculiar satisfaction in words has more than
anything else to do with the perpetuation of errors. For, relying
on the words and phrases received from his predecessors, each
one confidently passes over obscurities and problems, and thus
these are propagated through centuries from book to book; and
the thinking man, especially in youth, is in doubt whether it may
be that he is incapable of understanding it, or that there is really
nothing here to understand; and similarly, whether for others the
problem which they all slink past with such comical seriousness
by the same path is no problem at all, or whether it is only that
they will not see it. Many truths remain undiscovered simply on
this account, that no one has the courage to look the problem in
the face and grapple with it. On the contrary, the distinctness of
thought and clearness of conceptions peculiar to eminent minds
produces the effect that even known truths when brought forward
by them gain new light, or at least a new stimulus. If we hear them
or read them, it is as if we exchanged a bad telescope for a good
one. Let one only read, for example, in Euler's “Letters to the333
Princess,” his exposition of the fundamental truths of mechanics
and optics. Upon this rests the remark of Diderot in the Neveu
de Rameau, that only the perfect masters are capable of teaching
really well the elements of a science; just because it is only they
who really understand the questions, and for them words never
take the place of thoughts.
But we ought to know that inferior minds are the rule, good
minds the exception, eminent minds very rare, and genius
a portent. How otherwise could a human race consisting of
about eight hundred million individuals have left so much after
six thousand years to discover, to invent, to think out, and to
say? The intellect is calculated for the support of the individual
alone, and as a rule it is only barely sufficient even for this.
But nature has wisely been very sparing of conferring a larger
measure; for the man of limited intelligence can survey the few
and simple relations which lie within reach of his narrow sphere
of action, and can control the levers of them with much greater
ease than could the eminently intellectual man who commands
an incomparably larger sphere and works with long levers. Thus
the insect sees everything on its stem or leaf with the most minute
exactness, and better than we, and yet is not aware of the man who
stands within three steps of it. This is the reason of the slyness
of half-witted persons, and the ground of the paradox: Il y a un
mystère dans l'esprit des gens qui n'en ont pas. For practical life
genius is about as useful as an astral telescope in a theatre. Thus,
with regard to the intellect nature is highly aristocratic. The
distinctions which it has established are greater than those which
are made in any country by birth, rank, wealth, or caste. But
in the aristocracy of intellect, as in other aristocracies, there are
many thousands of plebeians for one nobleman, many millions
for one prince, and the great multitude of men are mere populace,
mob, rabble, la canaille. Now certainly there is a glaring contrast
between the scale of rank of nature and that of convention,
and their agreement is only to be hoped for in a golden age.
[342]334
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Meanwhile those who stand very high in the one scale of rank
and in the other have this in common, that for the most part they
live in exalted isolation, to which Byron refers when he says:—
“To feel me in the solitude of kings
Without the power that makes them bear a crown.”
—Proph. of Dante, c. I.

For intellect is a differentiating, and therefore a separating
principle. Its different grades, far more than those of mere
culture, give to each man different conceptions, in consequence
of which each man lives to a certain extent in a different world, in
which he can directly meet those only who are like himself, and
can only attempt to speak to the rest and make himself understood
by them from a distance. Great differences in the grade and in
the cultivation of the understanding fix a wide gulf between man
and man, which can only be crossed by benevolence; for it is, on
the contrary, the unifying principle, which identifies every one
else with its own self. Yet the connection remains a moral one; it
cannot become intellectual. Indeed, when the degree of culture is
about the same, the conversation between a man of great intellect
and an ordinary man is like the journey together of two men, one
of whom rides on a spirited horse and the other goes on foot. It
soon becomes very trying to both of them, and for any length of
time impossible. For a short way the rider can indeed dismount,
in order to walk with the other, though even then the impatience
of his horse will give him much to do.

But the public could be benefited by nothing so much as by
the recognition of that intellectual aristocracy of nature. By
virtue of such recognition it would comprehend that when facts
are concerned, thus when the matter has to be decided from
experiments, travels, codes, histories, and chronicles, the normal
mind is certainly sufficient; but, on the other hand, when mere
thoughts are in question, especially those thoughts the material335
or data of which are within reach of every one, thus when
it is really only a question of thinking before others, decided
reflectiveness, native eminence, which only nature bestows, and
that very seldom, is inevitably demanded, and no one deserves
to be heard who does not at once give proofs of this. If the public
could be brought to see this for itself, it would no longer waste
the time which is sparingly measured out to it for its culture
on the productions of ordinary minds, thus on the innumerable
botches of poetry and philosophy which are produced every day.
It would no longer seize always what is newest, in the childish
delusion that books, like eggs, must be enjoyed while they are
fresh, but would confine itself to the works of the few select
and chosen minds of all ages and nations, would strive to learn
to know and understand them, and might thus by degrees attain
to true culture. And then, also, those thousands of uncalled-for
productions which, like tares, hinder the growth of the good
wheat would be discontinued.
