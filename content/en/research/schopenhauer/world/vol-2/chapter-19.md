This chapter is connected with § 19 of the first volume.


The will, as the thing in itself, constitutes the inner, true, and indestructible nature of man.

in itself, however, it is unconscious.

For consciousness is conditioned by the intellect, and the intellect
is a mere accident of our being; for it is a function of the brain,
which, together with the nerves and spinal cord connected with it,
is a mere fruit, a product, nay, so far, a parasite of the rest of the
organism; for it does not directly enter into its inner constitution,
but merely serves the end of self-preservation by regulating the
relations of the organism to the external world. 

The organism itself, on the other hand, is the visibility, the objectivity, of the
individual will, the image of it as it presents itself in that very brain
(which in the first book we learned to recognise as the condition
of the objective world in general), therefore also brought about
by its forms of knowledge, space, time, and causality, and
consequently presenting itself as extended, successively acting,
and material, i.e., as something operative or efficient. The
members are both directly felt and also perceived by means of
the senses only in the brain. According to this one may say: The
intellect is the secondary phenomenon; the organism the primary
phenomenon, that is, the immediate manifestation of the will; the
will is metaphysical, the intellect physical;—the intellect, like its
objects, is merely phenomenal appearance; the will alone is the
thing in itself. Then, in a more and more figurative sense, thus
by way of simile: The will is the substance of man, the intellect
the accident; the will is the matter, the intellect is the form; the
will is warmth, the intellect is light.

## The inner life of man

1. Not only the consciousness of other things, i.e., the
apprehension of the external world, but also self-consciousness,
contains, as was mentioned already above, a knower and a known;
otherwise it would not be consciousness. 

For consciousness
consists in knowing; but knowing requires a knower and a
known; therefore there could be no self-consciousness if there
were not in it also a known opposed to the knower and different
from it. As there can be no object without a subject, so also
there can be no subject without an object, i.e., no knower
without something different from it which is known. Therefore
a consciousness which is through and through pure intelligence
is impossible. 

The intelligence is like the sun, which does
not illuminate space if there is no object from which its rays
are reflected. The knower himself, as such, cannot be known;
otherwise he would be the known of another knower. But now,
as the known in self-consciousness we find exclusively the will.
For not merely willing and purposing in the narrowest sense,
but also all striving, wishing, shunning, hoping, fearing, loving,
hating, in short, all that directly constitutes our own weal and
woe, desire and aversion, is clearly only affection of the will,
is a moving, a modification of willing and not-willing, is just
that which, if it takes outward effect, exhibits itself as an act of
will proper.31 In all knowledge, however, the known is first
and essential, not the knower; for the former is the ÀÁÉÄ¿ÄÅÀ¿Â,
the latter the μoÄÅÀ¿Â. Therefore in self-consciousness also the
known, thus the will, must be what is first and original; the

It is remarkable that Augustine already knew this. In the fourteenth book,
“De Civ. Dei,” c. 6, he speaks of the affectionibus animi, which in the
preceding book he had brought under four categories, cupiditas, timor, lætitia,
tristitia, and says: “Voluntas est quippe in omnibus, imo omnes nihil aliud,
quam voluntates sunt: nam quid est cupiditas et lætitia, nisi voluntas in eorum
consensionem, quæ volumus? et quid est metus atque tristitia, nisi voluntas in
dissensionem ab his, quæ nolumus? cet.”401

knower, on the other hand, only what is secondary, that which
has been added, the mirror. They are related very much as the
luminous to the reflecting body; or, again, as the vibrating strings
to the resounding-board, in which case the note produced would
be consciousness. We may also regard the plant as a like symbol
of consciousness. 

It has, we know, two poles, the root and the
corona: the former struggling into darkness, moisture, and cold,
the latter into light, dryness, and warmth; then, as the point of
indifference of the two poles, where they part asunder, close to
the ground, the collum (rhizoma, le collet). The root is what is
essential, original, perennial, the death of which involves that of
the corona, is thus the primary; the corona, on the other hand,
is the ostensible, but it has sprung from something else, and it
passes away without the root dying; it is thus secondary. The
root represents the will, the corona the intellect, and the point of
indifference of the two, the collum, would be the I, which, as their
common termination, belongs to both. This I is the pro tempore
identical subject of knowing and willing, whose identity I called
in my very first essay (on the principle of sufficient reason), and
in my first philosophical wonder, the miracle o±Ä μ3⁄4¿Ç·1⁄2. It
is the temporal starting-point and connecting-link of the whole
phenomenon, i.e., of the objectification of the will: it conditions
indeed the phenomenon, but is also conditioned by it. This
comparison may even be carried to the individual nature of men.
As a large corona commonly springs only from a large root, so
the greatest intellectual capabilities are only found in connection
with a vehement and passionate will. A genius of a phlegmatic
character and weak passions would resemble those succulent
plants that, with a considerable corona consisting of thick leaves,
have very small roots; will not, however, be found. That
vehemence of will and passionateness of character are conditions
of heightened intelligence exhibits itself physiologically through
the fact that the activity of the brain is conditioned by the
movement which the great arteries running towards the basis

cerebri impart to it with each pulsation; therefore an energetic
pulse, and even, according to Bichat, a short neck, is a requisite of
great activity of the brain. But the opposite of the above certainly
occurs: vehement desires, passionate, violent character, along
with weak intellect, i.e., a small brain of bad conformation in a
thick skull. This is a phenomenon as common as it is repulsive:
we might perhaps compare it to beetroot.
