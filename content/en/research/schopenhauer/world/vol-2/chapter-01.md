In boundless space countless shining spheres, about each of which, and illuminated by its light, there revolve a dozen or so of smaller ones, hot at the core and covered with a hard, cold crust, upon whose surface there have been generated from a mouldy film beings which live and know—this is what presents itself to us in experience as the truth, the real, the world. Yet for a thinking being it is a precarious position to stand upon one of those numberless spheres moving freely in boundless space without knowing whence or whither, and to be only one of innumerable similar beings who throng and press and toil, ceaselessly and quickly arising and passing away in time, which has no beginning and no end; moreover, nothing permanent but matter alone and the recurrence of the same varied organised forms, by means of certain ways and channels which are there once for all. All that empirical science can teach is only the more exact nature and law of these events. But now at last modern philosophy especially through Berkeley and Kant, has called to mind that all this is first of all merely a phenomenon of the brain, and is affected with such great, so many, and such different subjective conditions that its supposed absolute reality vanishes away, and leaves room for an entirely different scheme of the world, which consists of what lies at the foundation of that phenomenon, i.e., what is related to it as the thing in itself is related to its mere manifestation.

“The world is my idea” is, like the axioms of Euclid, a
proposition which every one must recognise as true as soon as he understands it; although it is not a proposition which every one understands as soon as he hears it. To have brought this
proposition to clear consciousness, and in it the problem of the
relation of the ideal and the real, i.e., of the world in the head to
the world outside the head, together with the problem of moral
freedom, is the distinctive feature of modern philosophy. For
it was only after men had spent their labour for thousands of
years upon a mere philosophy of the object that they discovered
that among the many things that make the world so obscure and
doubtful the first and chiefest is this, that however immeasurable
and massive it may be, its existence yet hangs by a single thread;
and this is the actual consciousness in which it exists. This
condition, to which the existence of the world is irrevocably
subject, marks it, in spite of all empirical reality, with the stamp
of ideality, and therefore of mere phenomenal appearance. Thus
on one side at least the world must be recognised as akin to
dreams, and indeed to be classified along with them. For the
same function of the brain which, during sleep, conjures up
before us a completely objective, perceptible, and even palpable
world must have just as large a share in the presentation of the
objective world of waking life. Both worlds, although different
as regards their matter, are yet clearly moulded in the one form.
This form is the intellect, the function of the brain. Descartes was
probably the first who attained to the degree of reflection which
this fundamental truth demands, and consequently he made it the
starting-point of his philosophy, though provisionally only in the
form of a sceptical doubt. When he took his cogito ergo sum
as alone certain, and provisionally regarded the existence of the
world as problematical, he really discovered the essential and
only right starting-point of all philosophy, and at the same time
its true foundation. This foundation is essentially and inevitably
the subjective, the individual consciousness. For this alone is
and remains immediate; everything else, whatever it may be, is
mediated and conditioned through it, and is therefore dependent upon it. 

Therefore modern philosophy is rightly regarded as
starting with Descartes, who was the father of it. Not long
afterwards Berkeley followed the same path further, and attained
to idealism proper, i.e., to the knowledge that the world which is
extended in space, thus the objective, material world in general,
exists as such simply and solely in our idea, and that it is false,
and indeed absurd, to attribute to it, as such, an existence apart
from all idea and independent of the knowing subject, thus to
assume matter as something absolute and possessed of real being
in itself. But his correct and profound insight into this truth really
constitutes Berkeley's whole philosophy; in it he had exhausted
himself.

Thus true philosophy must always be idealistic; indeed, it must
be so in order to be merely honest. For nothing is more certain
than that no man ever came out of himself in order to identify
himself directly with things which are different from him; but
everything of which he has certain, and therefore immediate,
knowledge lies within his own consciousness. Beyond this
consciousness, therefore, there can be no immediate certainty;
but the first principles of a science must have such certainty. For
the empirical standpoint of the other sciences it is quite right to
assume the objective world as something absolutely given; but
not so for the standpoint of philosophy, which has to go back
to what is first and original. Only consciousness is immediately
given; therefore the basis of philosophy is limited to facts of
consciousness, i.e., it is essentially idealistic. Realism which
commends itself to the crude understanding, by the appearance
which it assumes of being matter-of-fact, really starts from an
arbitrary assumption, and is therefore an empty castle in the air,
for it ignores or denies the first of all facts, that all that we know
lies within consciousness. For that the objective existence of
things is conditioned through a subject whose ideas they are, and
consequently that the objective world exists only as idea, is no
hypothesis, and still less a dogma, or even a paradox set up for the sake of discussion; but it is the most certain and the simplest truth; and the knowledge of it is only made difficult by the fact
that it is indeed so simple, and that it is not every one who has
sufficient power of reflection to go back to the first elements
of his consciousness of things. There can never be an absolute
and independent objective existence; indeed such an existence
is quite unintelligible. For the objective, as such, always and
essentially has its existence in the consciousness of a subject, is
thus the idea of this subject, and consequently is conditioned by
it, and also by its forms, the forms of the idea, which depend
upon the subject and not on the object.

That the objective world would exist even if there existed
no conscious being certainly seems at the first blush to be
unquestionable, because it can be thought in the abstract, without
bringing to light the contradiction which it carries within it. But
if we desire to realise this abstract thought, that is, to reduce it to
ideas of perception, from which alone (like everything abstract)
it can have content and truth, and if accordingly we try to imagine
an objective world without a knowing subject, we become aware
that what we then imagine is in truth the opposite of what we
intended, is in fact nothing else than the process in the intellect
of a knowing subject who perceives an objective world, is thus
exactly what we desired to exclude. For this perceptible and real
world is clearly a phenomenon of the brain; therefore there lies a
contradiction in the assumption that as such it ought also to exist
independently of all brains.

The principal objection to the inevitable and essential ideality
of all objects, the objection which, distinctly or indistinctly,
arises in every one, is certainly this: My own person also is
an object for some one else, is thus his idea, and yet I know
certainly that I would continue to exist even if he no longer
perceived me. But all other objects also stand in the same
relation to his intellect as I do; consequently they also would
continue to exist without being perceived by him. 

The answer to this is: That other being as whose object I now regard my
person is not absolutely the subject, but primarily is a knowing
individual. Therefore, if he no longer existed, nay, even if there
existed no other conscious being except myself, yet the subject,
in whose idea alone all objects exist, would by no means be on
that account abolished. For I myself indeed am this subject, as
every conscious being is. Consequently, in the case assumed,
my person would certainly continue to exist, but still as idea, in
my own knowledge. For even by me myself it is always known
only indirectly, never immediately; because all existence as idea
is indirect. As object, i.e., as extended, occupying space and
acting, I know my body only in the perception of my brain. This
takes place by means of the senses, upon data supplied by which
the percipient understanding performs its function of passing
from effect to cause, and thereby, in that the eye sees the body
or the hands touch it, it constructs that extended figure which
presents itself in space as my body. By no means, however, is
there directly given me, either in some general feeling of bodily
existence or in inner self-consciousness, any extension, form, or
activity, which would then coincide with my nature itself, which
accordingly, in order so to exist, would require no other being
in whose knowledge it might exhibit itself. On the contrary, that
general feeling of bodily existence, and also self-consciousness,
exists directly only in relation to the will, that is, as agreeable
or disagreeable, and as active in the acts of will, which for
external perception exhibit themselves as actions of the body.

From this it follows that the existence of my person or body as
something extended and acting always presupposes a knowing
being distinct from it; because it is essentially an existence in
apprehension, in the idea, thus an existence for another. In fact,
it is a phenomenon of brain, just as much whether the brain in
which it exhibits itself is my own or belongs to another person. In
the first case one's own person divides itself into the knowing and
the known, into object and subject, which here as everywhere  stand opposed to each other, inseparable and irreconcilable. 

If, then, my own person, in order to exist as such, always requires
a knowing subject, this will at least as much hold good of the
other objects for which it was the aim of the above objection to
vindicate an existence independent of knowledge and its subject.
However, it is evident that the existence which is conditioned
through a knowing subject is only the existence in space, and
therefore that of an extended and active being. This alone is
always something known, and consequently an existence for
another. On the other hand, every being that exists in this way
may yet have an existence for itself, for which it requires no
subject. Yet this existence for itself cannot be extension and
activity (together space-occupation), but is necessarily a being of
another kind, that of a thing in itself, which, as such, can never
be an object. This, then, would be the answer to the leading
objection set forth above, which accordingly does not overthrow
the fundamental truth that the objectively given world can only
exist in the idea, thus only for a subject.

Kant can have thought no objects
among his things in themselves. For this follows from the fact
that he proves that space, and also time, are mere forms of
our perception, which consequently do not belong to things in
themselves. 

What is neither in space nor in time can be no object;
thus the being of things in themselves cannot be objective, but of
quite a different kind, a metaphysical being. Consequently that
Kantian principle already involves this principle also, that the
objective world exists only as idea.

In spite of all that one may say, nothing is so persistently and
ever anew misunderstood as Idealism, because it is interpreted
as meaning that one denies the empirical reality of the external
world. Upon this rests the perpetual return to the appeal to
common sense, which appears in many forms and guises; for
example, as an “irresistible conviction” in the Scotch school, or as Jacobi's faith in the reality of the external world. 

The external world by no means presents itself, as Jacobi declares,
upon credit, and is accepted by us upon trust and faith. It presents
itself as that which it is, and performs directly what it promises.
It must be remembered that Jacobi, who set up such a credit
or faith theory of the world, and had the fortune to impose it
upon a few professors of philosophy, who for thirty years have
philosophised upon the same lines lengthily and at their ease, is
the same man who once denounced Lessing as a Spinozist, and
afterwards denounced Schelling as an atheist, and who received
from the latter the well-known and well-deserved castigation. In
keeping with such zeal, when he reduced the external world to
a mere matter of faith he only wished to open the door to faith
in general, and to prepare belief for that which was afterwards
really to be made a matter of belief; as if, in order to introduce
a paper currency, one should seek to appeal to the fact that the
value of the ringing coin also depends merely on the stamp which
the State has set upon it. Jacobi, in his doctrine that the reality
of the external world is assumed upon faith, is just exactly “the
transcendental realist who plays the empirical idealist” censured
by Kant in the “Critique of Pure Reason,” first edition, p. 369.

The true idealism, on the contrary, is not the empirical but
the transcendental. This leaves the empirical reality of the world
untouched, but holds fast to the fact that every object, thus the
empirically real in general, is conditioned in a twofold manner
by the subject; in the first place materially or as object generally,
because an objective existence is only conceivable as opposed to
a subject, and as its idea; in the second place formally, because
the mode of existence of an object, i.e., its being perceived (space,
time, causality), proceeds from the subject, is pre-arranged in
the subject. Therefore with the simple or Berkeleian idealism,
which concerns the object in general, there stands in immediate
connection the Kantian idealism, which concerns the specially
given mode or manner of objective existence. 

This proves that the whole material world, with its bodies, which are extended
in space and, by means of time, have causal relations to each
other, and everything that depends upon this—that all this is
not something which is there independently of our head, but
essentially presupposes the functions of our brain by means of
which and in which alone such an objective arrangement of
things is possible. For time, space, and causality, upon which
all those real and objective events rest, are themselves nothing
more than functions of the brain; so that thus the unchangeable
order of things which affords the criterion and clue to their
empirical reality itself proceeds only from the brain, and has its
credentials from this alone. All this Kant has expounded fully
and thoroughly; only he does not speak of the brain, but calls
it “the faculty of knowledge.” Indeed he has attempted to prove
that when that objective order in time, space, causality, matter,
&c., upon which all the events of the real world ultimately rest,
is properly considered, it cannot even be conceived as a self-
existing order, i.e., an order of the thing in itself, or as something
absolutely objective and unconditionally given, for if one tries
to think this out it leads to contradictions. To accomplish this
was the object of the antinomies, but in the appendix to my work
I have proved the failure of the attempt. 

The Kantian doctrine, even without the antinomies, leads to the insight that things and the whole mode of their existence are inseparably bound up with our consciousness of them. Therefore whoever has distinctly grasped this soon attains to the conviction that the assumption that things also exist as such, apart from and independently of our consciousness, is really absurd. That we are so deeply involved in time, space, causality, and the whole regular process of experience which rests upon them, that we (and indeed the brutes) are so perfectly at home, and know how to find our way from the first—this would not be possible if our intellect were one thing and things another, but can only be explained from the fact that both constitute one whole, the intellect itself creates that order, and exists only for things, while they, on the other hand, exist only for it.

But even apart from the deep insight, which only the Kantian
philosophy gives, the inadmissibility of the assumption of
absolute realism which is so obstinately clung to may be directly
shown, or at least made capable of being felt, by the simple
exhibition of its meaning in the light of such considerations as
the following. According to realism, the world is supposed to
exist, as we know it, independently of this knowledge. Let
us once, then, remove all percipient beings from it, and leave
only unorganised and vegetable nature. Rock, tree, and brook
are there, and the blue heaven; sun, moon, and stars light this
world, as before; yet certainly in vain, for there is no eye to see
it. Let us now in addition place in it a percipient being. Now
that world presents itself again in his brain, and repeats itself
within it precisely as it was formerly without it. Thus to the first
world a second has been added, which, although completely
separated from it, resembles it to a nicety. And now the subjective
world of this perception is precisely so constituted in subjective,
known space as the objective world in objective, infinite space.
But the subjective world has this advantage over the objective,
the knowledge that that space, outside there, is infinite; indeed
it can also give beforehand most minutely and accurately the
whole constitution or necessary properties of all relations which
are possible, though not yet actual, in that space, and does not
require to examine them. It can tell just as much with regard to the
course of time, and also with regard to the relation of cause and
effect which governs the changes in that external world. I think
all this, when closely considered, turns out absurd enough, and
hence leads to the conviction that that absolute objective world
outside the head, independent of it and prior to all knowledge,
which at first we imagined ourselves to conceive, is really no
other than the second, the world which is known subjectively, the
world of idea, as which alone we are actually able to conceive it. Thus of its own accord the assumption forces itself upon us, that the world, as we know it, exists also only for our knowledge,
therefore in the idea alone, and not a second time outside of
it.12 In accordance, then, with this assumption, the thing in
itself, i.e., that which exists independently of our knowledge and
of every knowledge, is to be regarded as something completely
different from the idea and all its attributes, thus from objectivity
in general.

What this is will be the subject of our second book.

On the other hand, the controversy concerning the reality
of the external world considered in § 5 of the first volume
rests upon the assumption, which has just been criticised, of an
objective and a subjective world both in space, and upon the
impossibility which arises in connection with this presupposition
of a transition from one to the other, a bridge between the two.
Upon this controversy I have still to add the following remarks.
The subjective and the objective do not constitute a continuous
whole. That of which we are immediately conscious is bounded
by the skin, or rather by the extreme ends of the nerves which
proceed from the cerebral system. Beyond this lies a world of
which we have no knowledge except through pictures in our
head. Now the question is, whether and how far there is a world
independent of us which corresponds to these pictures. The
relation between the two could only be brought about by means
of the law of causality; for this law alone leads from what is
given to something quite different from it. But this law itself
has first of all to prove its validity. 

Now it must either be of I specially recommend here the passage in Lichtenberg's “Miscellaneous
Writings” (Göthingen, 1801, vol. ii. p. 12): “Euler says, in his letters upon
various subjects in connection with natural science (vol. ii. p. 228), that it
would thunder and lighten just as well if there were no man present whom the
lightning might strike. It is a very common expression, but I must confess that
it has never been easy for me completely to comprehend it. It always seems to
me as if the conception being were something derived from our thought, and
thus, if there are no longer any sentient and thinking creatures, then there is
nothing more whatever.”

objective or of subjective origin; but in either case it lies upon
one or the other side, and therefore cannot supply the bridge
between them. If, as Locke and Hume assume, it is a posteriori,
thus drawn from experience, it is of objective origin, and belongs
then itself to the external world which is in question. Therefore
it cannot attest the reality of this world, for then, according to
Locke's method, causality would be proved from experience, and
the reality of experience from causality. If, on the contrary, it is
given a priori, as Kant has more correctly taught us, then it is of
subjective origin, and in that case it is clear that with it we remain
always in the subjective sphere. For all that is actually given
empirically in perception is the occurrence of a sensation in the
organ of sense; and the assumption that this, even in general,
must have a cause rests upon a law which is rooted in the form
of our knowledge, i.e., in the functions of our brain. The origin
of this law is therefore just as subjective as that of the sensation
itself. 

The cause of the given sensation, which is assumed in
consequence of this law, presents itself at once in perception
as an object, which has space and time for the form of its
manifestation. But these forms themselves again are entirely of
subjective origin; for they are the mode or method of our faculty
of perception. That transition from the sensation to its cause
which, as I have repeatedly pointed out, lies at the foundation of
all sense-perception is certainly sufficient to give us the empirical
presence in space and time of an empirical object, and is therefore
quite enough for the practical purposes of life; but it is by no
means sufficient to afford us any conclusion as to the existence
and real nature, or rather as to the intelligible substratum, of
the phenomena which in this way arise for us. Thus that on the
occasion of certain sensations occurring in my organs of sense
there arises in my head a perception of things which are extended
in space, permanent in time, and causally efficient by no means
justifies the assumption that they also exist in themselves, i.e.,
that such things with these properties belonging absolutely to
[174]166
[175]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
themselves exist independently and outside of my head. This is
the true outcome of the Kantian philosophy. It coincides with an
earlier result of Locke's, which is just as true, but far more easily
understood. For although, as Locke's doctrine permits, external
things are absolutely assumed as the causes of sensations, yet
there can be no resemblance between the sensation in which
the effect consists and the objective nature of the cause which
occasions it. For the sensation, as organic function, is primarily
determined by the highly artificial and complicated nature of our
organs of sense. It is therefore merely excited by the external
cause, but is then perfected entirely in accordance with its own
laws, and thus is completely subjective. Locke's philosophy was
the criticism of the functions of sense; Kant has given us the
criticism of the functions of the brain. But to all this we have
yet to add the Berkeleian result, which has been revised by me,
that every object, whatever its origin may be, is as object already
conditioned by the subject, is in fact merely its idea. The aim of
realism is indeed the object without subject; but it is impossible
even to conceive such an object distinctly.

From this whole inquiry it follows with certainty and
distinctness that it is absolutely impossible to attain to the
comprehension of the inner nature of things upon the path of
mere knowledge and perception. For knowledge always comes
to things from without, and therefore must for ever remain
outside them. This end would only be reached if we could find
ourselves in the inside of things, so that their inner nature would
be known to us directly. Now, how far this is actually the case is
considered in my second book. But so long as we are concerned,
as in this first book, with objective comprehension, that is, with
knowledge, the world is, and remains for us, a mere idea, for
here there is no possible path by which we can cross over to it.
But, besides this, a firm grasp of the point of view of idealism is
a necessary counterpoise to that of materialism. The controversy
concerning the real and the ideal may also be regarded as a controversy concerning the existence of matter. For it is the
reality or ideality of this that is ultimately in question. 

Does
matter, as such, exist only in our idea, or does it also exist
independently of it? In the latter case it would be the thing
in itself; and whoever assumes a self-existent matter must also,
consistently, be a materialist, i.e., he must make matter the
principle of explanation of all things. Whoever, on the contrary,
denies its existence as a thing in itself is eo ipso an idealist. Among
the moderns only Locke has definitely and without ambiguity
asserted the reality of matter; and therefore his teaching led, in
the hands of Condillac, to the sensualism and materialism of
the French. Only Berkeley directly and without modifications
denies matter. The complete antithesis is thus that of idealism
and materialism, represented in its extremes by Berkeley and the
French materialists (Hollbach). Fichte is not to be mentioned
here: he deserves no place among true philosophers; among
those elect of mankind who, with deep earnestness, seek not their
own things but the truth, and therefore must not be confused
with those who, under this pretence, have only their personal
advancement in view. Fichte is the father of the sham philosophy,
of the disingenuous method which, through ambiguity in the use
of words, incomprehensible language, and sophistry, seeks to
deceive, and tries, moreover, to make a deep impression by
assuming an air of importance—in a word, the philosophy which
seeks to bamboozle and humbug those who desire to learn. After
this method had been applied by Schelling, it reached its height,
as every one knows, in Hegel, in whose hands it developed into
pure charlatanism. But whoever even names this Fichte seriously
along with Kant shows that he has not even a dim notion of what
Kant is. On the other hand, materialism also has its warrant. It is
just as true that the knower is a product of matter as that matter is
merely the idea of the knower; but it is also just as one-sided. For
materialism is the philosophy of the subject that forgets to take
account of itself. And, accordingly, as against the assertion that I am a mere modification of matter, this must be insisted upon, that all matter exists merely in my idea; and it is no less right.
A knowledge, as yet obscure, of these relations seems to have
been the origin of the saying of Plato, “Q»· ±»· ̧11⁄2¿1⁄2 ÈμÅ ́¿Â”
(materia mendacium verax).


Realism necessarily leads to materialism.

If empirical perception gives us things in themselves, as they
exist independently of our knowledge, experience also gives us
the order of things in themselves, i.e., the true and sole order
of the world. But this path leads to the assumption that there
is only one thing in itself, matter; of which all other things are
modifications; for the course of nature is here the absolute and
only order of the world. To escape from these consequences,
while realism remained in undisputed acceptance, spiritualism
was set up, that is, the assumption of a second substance outside
of and along with matter, an immaterial substance. This dualism
and spiritualism, equally unsupported by experience and destitute
of proof and comprehensibility, was denied by Spinoza, and was
proved to be false by Kant, who dared to do so because at the
same time he established idealism in its rights. For with realism
materialism, as the counterpoise of which spiritualism had been
devised, falls to the ground of its own accord, because then
matter and the course of nature become mere phenomena, which
are conditioned by the intellect, as they have their existence only
in its idea. Accordingly spiritualism is the delusive and false
safeguard against materialism, while the real and true safeguard is
idealism, which, by making the objective world dependent upon
us, gives the needed counterpoise to the position of dependence
upon the objective world, in which we are placed by the course
of nature. The world from which I part at death is, in another
aspect, only my idea. The centre of gravity of existence falls
back into the subject. What is proved is not, as in spiritualism,
that the knower is independent of matter, but that all matter is
dependent on him. Certainly this is not so easy to comprehend orChapter I. The Standpoint of Idealism.

In opposition to the subjective starting-point, “the world is my
idea,” there certainly stands provisionally with equal justification
the objective starting-point, “the world is matter,” or “matter
alone is absolute” (since it alone is not subject to becoming
and passing away), or “all that exists is matter.” This is the
starting-point of Democritus, Leucippus, and Epicurus. 

But,
more closely considered, the departure from the subject retains
a real advantage; it has the start by one perfectly justified step.
For consciousness alone is the immediate: but we pass over
this if we go at once to matter and make it our starting-point.

On the other hand, it would certainly be possible to construct
the world from matter and its properties if these were correctly,
completely, and exhaustively known to us (which is far from
being the case as yet). For all that has come to be has become
actual through causes, which could operate and come together
only by virtue of the fundamental forces of matter. But these
must be perfectly capable of demonstration at least objectively,
even if subjectively we never attain to a knowledge of them. But
such an explanation and construction of the world would not only
have at its foundation the assumption of an existence in itself
of matter (while in truth it is conditioned by the subject), but it
would also be obliged to allow all the original qualities in this
matter to pass current and remain absolutely inexplicable, thus as
qualitates occultæ. (Cf. § 26, 27 of the first volume.) For matter
is only the vehicle of these forces, just as the law of causality
is only the arranger of their manifestations. Therefore such an
explanation of the world would always remain merely relative
and conditioned, properly the work of a physical science, which
at every step longed for a metaphysic. On the other hand, there
is also something inadequate about the subjective starting-point
and first principle, “the world is my idea,” partly because it is
one-sided, since the world is far more than that (the thing in
[178]170
[179]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
itself, will), and indeed its existence as idea is to a certain extent
only accidental to it; but partly also because it merely expresses
the fact that the object is conditioned by the subject, without at
the same time saying that the subject, as such, is also conditioned
by the object. For the assertion, “the subject would still remain
a knowing being if it had no object, i.e., if it had absolutely no
idea,” is just as false as the assertion of the crude understanding,
“the world, the object, would still exist, even if there were no
subject.” A consciousness without an object is no consciousness.
A thinking subject has conceptions for its object; a subject of
sense perception has objects with the qualities corresponding to
its organisation. If we rob the subject of all special characteristics
and forms of its knowledge, all the properties of the object vanish
also, and nothing remains but matter without form and quality,
which can just as little occur in experience as a subject without
the forms of its knowledge, but which remains opposed to the
naked subject as such, as its reflex, which can only disappear
along with it. Although materialism pretends to postulate nothing
more than this matter—for instance, atoms—yet it unconsciously
adds to it not only the subject, but also space, time, and causality,
which depend upon special properties of the subject.
The world as idea, the objective world, has thus, as it were,
two poles; the simple knowing subject without the forms of its
knowledge, and crude matter without form and quality. Both
are completely unknowable; the subject because it is that which
knows, matter because without form and quality it cannot be
perceived. Yet both are fundamental conditions of all empirical
perception. Thus the knowing subject, merely as such, which
is a presupposition of all experience, stands opposed as its pure
counterpart to the crude, formless, and utterly dead (i.e., will-less)
matter, which is given in no experience, but which all experience
presupposes. This subject is not in time, for time is only the
more definite form of all its ideas. The matter which stands over
against it is, like it, eternal and imperishable, endures throughChapter I. The Standpoint of Idealism.

all time, but is, properly speaking, not extended, for extension
gives form, thus it has no spatial properties. Everything else is
involved in a constant process of coming into being and passing
away, while these two represent the unmoved poles of the world
as idea. The permanence of matter may therefore be regarded
as the reflex of the timelessness of the pure subject, which is
simply assumed as the condition of all objects. Both belong to
phenomena, not to the thing in itself, but they are the framework
of the phenomenon. Both are arrived at only by abstraction, and
are not given immediately, pure and for themselves.
The fundamental error of all systems is the failure to
understand this truth. Intelligence and matter are correlates,
i.e., the one exists only for the other, both stand and fall together,
the one is only the reflex of the other. Indeed they are really one
and the same thing regarded from two opposite points of view;
and this one thing, I am here anticipating, is the manifestation of
the will, or the thing in itself. Consequently both are secondary,
and therefore the origin of the world is not to be sought in either
of the two. But because of their failure to understand this, all
systems (with the exception perhaps of that of Spinoza) sought
the origin of all things in one of these two. Some of them, on the
one hand, suppose an intelligence, 1⁄2¿ÅÂ, as the absolutely First
and  ́·1⁄41¿ÅÁ3¿Â, and accordingly in this allow an idea of things
and of the world to precede their actual existence; consequently
they distinguish the real world from the world of idea; which is
false. Therefore matter now appears as that through which the
two are distinguished, as the thing in itself. Hence arises the
difficulty of procuring this matter, the Q»·, so that when added
to the mere idea of the world it may impart reality to it. That
original intelligence must now either find it ready to hand, in
which case it is just as much an absolute First as that intelligence
itself, and we have then two absolute Firsts, the  ́·1⁄41¿ÅÁ3¿Â and
the Q»·; or the absolute intelligence must create this matter out
of nothing, an assumption which our understanding refuses to
[180]172
[181]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
make, for it is only capable of comprehending changes in matter,
and not that matter itself should come into being or pass away.
This rests ultimately upon the fact that matter is essential, the
correlate of the understanding. On the other hand, the systems
opposed to these, which make the other of the two correlates, that
is, matter, the absolute First, suppose a matter which would exist
without being perceived; and it has been made sufficiently clear
by all that has been said above that this is a direct contradiction,
for by the existence of matter we always mean simply its being
perceived. But here they encounter the difficulty of bringing to
this matter, which alone is their absolute First, the intelligence
which is finally to experience it. I have shown this weak side of
materialism in § 7 of the first volume. For me, on the contrary,
matter and intelligence are inseparable correlates, which exist
only for each other, and therefore merely relatively. Matter is
the idea of the intelligence; the intelligence is that in whose idea
alone matter exists. The two together constitute the world as idea,
which is just Kant's phenomenon, and consequently something
secondary. What is primary is that which manifests itself, the
thing in itself, which we shall afterwards discover is the will.
This is in itself neither the perceiver nor the perceived, but is
entirely different from the mode of its manifestation.
As a forcible conclusion of this important and difficult
discussion I shall now personify these two abstractions, and
present them in a dialogue after the fashion of Prabodha
Tschandro Daya. It may also be compared with a similar
dialogue between matter and form in the “Duodecim Principia
Philosophiæ” of Raymund Lully, c. 1 and 2.
The Subject.
I am, and besides me there is nothing. For the world is my
idea.
Matter.
Presumptuous delusion! I, I am, and besides me there is
nothing, for the world is my fleeting form. Thou art a mere resultChapter I. The Standpoint of Idealism.

of a part of this form and altogether accidental.
The Subject.
What insane arrogance! Neither thou nor thy form would
exist without me; ye are conditioned by me. Whosoever thinks
me away, and believes he can still think ye there, is involved
in gross delusion, for your existence apart from my idea is a
direct contradiction, a meaningless form of words. Ye are simply
means ye are perceived by me. My idea is the sphere of your
existence; therefore I am its first condition.
Matter.
Fortunately the audacity of your assertion will soon be put to
silence in reality and not by mere words. Yet a few moments and
thou actually art no more. With all thy boasting thou hast sunk
into nothing, vanished like a shadow, and shared the fate of all my
transitory forms. But I, I remain, unscathed and undiminished,
from age to age, through infinite time, and behold unshaken the
play of my changing form.

The Subject.

This infinite time through which thou boastest that thou livest,
like the infinite space which thou fillest, exists only in my idea.
Indeed it is merely the form of my idea which I bear complete in
myself, and in which thou exhibitest thyself, which receives thee,
and through which thou first of all existest. But the annihilation
with which thou threatenest me touches me not; were it so, then
wouldst thou also be annihilated. It merely affects the individual,
which for a short time is my vehicle, and which, like everything
else, is my idea.

Matter.

And if I concede this, and go so far as to regard thy
existence, which is yet inseparably linked to that of these fleeting
individuals, as something absolute, it yet remains dependent
upon mine. For thou art subject only so far as thou hast an object;
and this object I am. 

I am its kernel and content, that which is
permanent in it, that which holds it together, and without which it would be as disconnected, as wavering, and unsubstantial as the dreams and fancies of thy individuals, which have yet borrowed
from me even the illusive content they possess.

The Subject.

Thou dost well to refrain from contesting my existence on the
ground that it is linked to individuals; for, as inseparably as I
am joined to them, thou art joined to thy sister, Form, and hast
never appeared without her. No eye hath yet seen either thee or
me naked and isolated; for we are both mere abstractions. It is in
reality one being that perceives itself and is perceived by itself,
but whose real being cannot consist either in perceiving or in
being perceived, since these are divided between us two.

Both.

We are, then, inseparably joined together as necessary parts of
one whole, which includes us both and exists through us. Only
a misunderstanding can oppose us two hostilely to each other,
and hence draw the false conclusion that the one contests the
existence of the other, with which its own existence stands or
falls.

This whole, which comprehends both, is the world as idea, or
the world of phenomena. When this is taken away there remains
only what is purely metaphysical, the thing in itself, which in the
second book we shall recognise as the will.
