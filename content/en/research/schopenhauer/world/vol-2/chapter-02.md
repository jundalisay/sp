With all transcendental ideality the objective world retains
empirical reality; the object is indeed not the thing in itself,
but as an empirical object it is real. It is true that space is only in
my head; but empirically my head is in space. The law of causality
can certainly never enable us to get quit of idealism by building
a bridge between things in themselves and our knowledge of
them, and thus certifying the absolute reality of the world, which
exhibits itself in consequence of its application; but this by no
means does away with the causal relation of objects to each other,
thus it does not abolish the causal relation which unquestionably
exists between the body of each knowing person and all other
material objects. But the law of causality binds together only
phenomena, and does not lead beyond them. With that law we are
and remain in the world of objects, i.e., the world of phenomena,
or more properly the world of ideas. Yet the whole of such a
world of experience is primarily conditioned by the knowledge
of a subject in general as its necessary presupposition, and then
by the special forms of our perception and apprehension, thus
necessarily belongs to the merely phenomenal, and has no claim
to pass for the world of things in themselves. Indeed the subject
itself (so far as it is merely the knowing subject) belongs to the
merely phenomenal, of which it constitutes the complementary
half.

Without application of the law of causality, however,
perception of an objective world could never be arrived at;
for this perception is, as I have often explained, essentially
matter of the intellect, and not merely of the senses. The senses
afford us mere sensation, which is far from being perception.
The part played by sensations of the senses in perception was
distinguished by Locke under the name secondary qualities,
which he rightly refused to ascribe to things in themselves. But Kant, carrying Locke's method further, distinguished also, and
refused to ascribe to things in themselves what belongs to the
working up of this material (the sensations) by the brain. The
result was, that in this was included all that Locke had left
to things in themselves as primary qualities—extension, form,
solidity, &c.—so that with Kant the thing in itself was reduced
to a completely unknown quantity = x. With Locke accordingly
the thing in itself is certainly without colour, sound, smell, taste,
neither warm nor cold, neither soft nor hard, neither smooth nor
rough; yet it has still extension and form, it is impenetrable,
at rest or in motion, and has mass and number. With Kant,
on the other hand, it has laid aside all these latter qualities
also, because they are only possible by means of time, space,
and causality, and these spring from an intellect (brain), just as
colours, tones, smells, &c., originate in the nerves of the organs
of sense. The thing in itself has with Kant become spaceless,
unextended, and incorporeal. Thus what the mere senses bring
to the perception, in which the objective world exists, stands
to what is supplied by the functions of the brain (space, time,
causality) as the mass of the nerves of sense stand to the mass of
the brain, after subtracting that part of the latter which is further
applied to thinking proper, i.e., to abstract ideas, and is therefore
not possessed by the brutes. For as the nerves of the organs
of sense impart to the phenomenal objects colour, sound, taste,
smell, temperature, &c., so the brain imparts to them extension,
form, impenetrability, the power of movement, &c., in short all
that can only be presented in perception by means of time, space,
and causality. How small is the share of the senses in perception,
compared with that of the intellect, is also shown by a comparison
of the nerve apparatus for receiving impressions with that for
working them up. The mass of the nerves of sensation of the
whole of the organs of sense is very small compared with that of
the brain, even in the case of the brutes, whose brain, since they
do not, properly speaking, i.e., in the abstract, think, is merely177
used for effecting perception, and yet when this is complete,
thus in the case of mammals, has a very considerable mass, even
after the cerebellum, whose function is the systematic guidance
of movements, has been taken away.
That excellent book by Thomas Reid, the “Inquiry into the
Human Mind” (first edition, 1764; 6th edition, 1810), as a
negative proof of the Kantian truths, affords us a very thorough
conviction of the inadequacy of the senses to produce the
objective perception of things, and also of the non-empirical
origin of the perception of space and time. Reid refutes Locke's
doctrine that perception is a product of the senses, by a thorough
and acute demonstration that the collective sensations of the
senses do not bear the least resemblance to the world as known
in perception, and especially that the five primary qualities
of Locke (extension, form, solidity, movement, and number)
absolutely could not be afforded us by any sensation of the
senses. Accordingly he gives up the question as to the mode of
origination and the source of perception as completely insoluble;
and although altogether unacquainted with Kant, he gives us, as
it were, according to the regula falsi, a thorough proof of the
intellectual nature of perception (really first explained by me
as a consequence of the Kantian doctrine), and also of the a
priori source, discovered by Kant, of its constituent elements,
space, time, and causality, from which those primary qualities
of Locke first proceed, but by means of which they are easily
constructed. Thomas Reid's book is very instructive and well
worth reading—ten times more so than all the philosophy together
that has been written since Kant. Another indirect proof of the
same doctrine, though in the way of error, is afforded by the
French sensational philosophers, who, since Condillac trod in
the footsteps of Locke, have laboured to show once for all that
the whole of our perception and thinking can be referred to mere
sensations (penser c'est sentir), which, after Locke's example,
they call idées simples, and through the mere coming together
[187]178
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
and comparison of which the whole objective world is supposed
to build itself up in our heads. These gentlemen certainly have
des idées bien simples. It is amusing to see how, lacking alike
the profundity of the German and the honesty of the English
philosopher, they turn the poor material of sensation this way
and that way, and try to increase its importance, in order to
construct out of it the deeply significant phenomena of the world
of perception and thought. But the man constructed by them
would necessarily be an Anencephalus, a Tête de crapaud, with
only organs of sense and without a brain. To take only a couple of
the better attempts of this sort out of a multitude of others, I may
mention as examples Condorcet at the beginning of his book,
“Des Progrès de l'Esprit Humain,” and Tourtual on Sight, in the
second volume of the “Scriptures Ophthalmologici Minores,”
edidit Justus Radius (1828).
[188]
The feeling of the insufficiency of a purely sensationalistic
explanation of perception is in like manner shown in the assertion
which was made shortly before the appearance of the Kantian
philosophy, that we not only have ideas of things called forth by
sensation, but apprehend the things themselves directly, although
they lie outside us—which is certainly inconceivable. And this
was not meant in some idealistic sense, but was said from the
point of view of common realism. This assertion is well and
pointedly put by the celebrated Euler in his “Letters to a German
Princess,” vol. ii. p. 68. He says: “I therefore believe
that the sensations (of the senses) contain something more than
philosophers imagine. They are not merely empty perceptions
of certain impressions made in the brain. They do not give the
soul mere ideas of things, but actually place before it objects
which exist outside it, although we cannot conceive how this
really happens.” This opinion is explained by the following facts.
Although, as I have fully proved, perception is brought about by
application of the law of causality, of which we are conscious
a priori, yet in sight the act of the understanding, by means of179
which we pass from the effect to the cause, by no means appears
distinctly in consciousness; and therefore the sensation does not
separate itself clearly from the idea which is constructed out of
it, as the raw material, by the understanding. Still less can a
distinction between object and idea, which in general does not
exist, appear in consciousness; but we feel the things themselves
quite directly, and indeed as lying outside us, although it is
certain that what is immediate can only be the sensation, and this
is confined to the sphere of the body enclosed by our skin. This
can be explained from the fact that outside us is exclusively a
spatial determination. But space itself is a form of our faculty of
perception, i.e., a function of our brain. Therefore that externality
to us to which we refer objects, on the occasion of sensations of
sight, is itself really within our heads; for that is its whole sphere
of activity. Much as in the theatre we see the mountains, the
woods, and the sea, but yet everything is inside the house. From
this it becomes intelligible that we perceive things in the relation
of externality, and yet in every respect immediately, but have
not within us an idea of the things which lie outside us, different
from these things. For things are in space, and consequently also
external to us only in so far as we perceive them. Therefore
those things which to this extent we perceive directly, and not
mere images of them, are themselves only our ideas, and as
such exist only in our heads. Therefore we do not, as Euler
says, directly perceive the things themselves which are external
to us, but rather the things which are perceived by us as external
to us are only our ideas, and consequently are apprehended by
us immediately. The whole observation given above in Euler's
words, and which is quite correct, affords a fresh proof of Kant's
Transcendental Æsthetic, and of my theory of perception which
is founded upon it, as also of idealism in general. The directness
and unconsciousness referred to above, with which in perception
we make the transition from the sensation to its cause, may be
illustrated by an analogous procedure in the use of abstract ideas
[189]180
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
or thinking. When we read or hear we receive mere words, but
we pass from these so immediately to the conceptions denoted
by them, that it is as if we received the conceptions directly; for
we are absolutely unconscious of the transition from the words to
the conceptions. Therefore it sometimes happens that we do not
know in what language it was that we read something yesterday
which we now remember. Yet that such a transition always takes
place becomes apparent if it is once omitted, that is, if in a fit
of abstraction we read without thinking, and then become aware
that we certainly have taken in all the words but no conceptions.
Only when we pass from abstract conceptions to pictures of the
imagination do we become conscious of the transposition we
have made.
[190]
Further, it is really only in perception in the narrowest sense,
that is, in sight, that in empirical apprehension the transition
from the sensation to its cause takes place quite unconsciously.
In every other kind of sense perception, on the contrary, the
transition takes place with more or less distinct consciousness;
therefore, in the case of apprehension through the four coarser
senses, its reality is capable of being established as an immediate
fact. Thus in the dark we feel a thing for a long time on all sides
until from the different effects upon our hands we are able to
construct its definite form as their cause. Further, if something
feels smooth we sometimes reflect whether we may not have fat
or oil upon our hands; and again, if something feels cold we
ask ourselves whether it may not be that we have very warm
hands. When we hear a sound we sometimes doubt whether it
was really an affection of our sense of hearing from without or
merely an inner affection of it; then whether it sounded near and
weak or far off and strong, then from what direction it came, and
finally whether it was the voice of a man or of a brute, or the
sound of an instrument; thus we investigate the cause of each
effect we experience. In the case of smell and taste uncertainty
as to the objective nature of the cause of the effect felt is of the181
commonest occurrence, so distinctly are the two separated here.
The fact that in sight the transition from the effect to the cause
occurs quite unconsciously, and hence the illusion arises that this
kind of perception is perfectly direct, and consists simply in the
sensation alone without any operation of the understanding—this
has its explanation partly in the great perfection of the organ of
vision, and partly in the exclusively rectilineal action of light.
On account of the latter circumstance the impression itself leads
directly to the place of the cause, and since the eye is capable
of perceiving with the greatest exactness and at a glance all the
fine distinctions of light and shade, colour and outline, and also
the data in accordance with which the understanding estimates
distance, it thus happens that in the case of impressions of this
sense the operation of the understanding takes place with such
rapidity and certainty that we are just as little conscious of it as
of spelling when we read. Hence arises the delusion that the
sensation itself presents us directly with the objects. Yet it is just
in sight that the operation of the understanding, consisting in the
knowledge of the cause from the effect, is most significant. By
means of it what is felt doubly, with two eyes, is perceived as
single; by means of it the impression which strikes the retina
upside down, in consequence of the crossing of the rays in the
pupils, is put right by following back the cause of this in the
same direction, or as we express ourselves, we see things upright
although their image in the eye is reversed; and finally by means
of the operation of the understanding magnitude and distance
are estimated by us in direct perception from five different data,
which are very clearly and beautifully described by Dr. Thomas
Reid. I expounded all this, and also the proofs which irrefutably
establish the intellectual nature of perception, as long ago as
1816, in my essay “On Sight and Colour” (second edition, 1854;
third edition, 1870), and with important additions fifteen years
later in the revised Latin version of it which is given under the
title, “Theoria Colorum Physiologica Eademque Primaria,” in
[191]182
[192]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
the third volume of the “Scriptores Ophthalmologici Minores,”
published by Justus Radius in 1830; yet most fully and thoroughly
in the second (and third) edition of my essay “On the Principle
of Sufficient Reason,” § 21. Therefore on this important subject
I refer to these works, so as not to extend unduly the present
exposition.
On the other hand, an observation which trenches on the
province of æsthetics may find its place here. It follows from the
proved intellectual nature of perception that the sight of beautiful
objects—for example, of a beautiful view—is also a phenomenon
of the brain. Its purity and completeness, therefore, depends not
merely on the object, but also upon the quality of the brain, its
form and size, the fineness of its texture, and the stimulation of its
activity by the strength of the pulse of the arteries which supply
it. Accordingly the same view appears in different heads, even
when the eyes are equally acute, as different as, for example, the
first and last impressions of a copper plate that has been much
used. This is the explanation of the difference of capacity for
enjoying natural beauty, and consequently also for reproducing
it, i.e., for occasioning a similar phenomenon of the brain by
means of an entirely different kind of cause, the arrangement of
colours on a canvas.
The apparent immediacy of perception, depending on its entire
intellectuality, by virtue of which, as Euler says, we apprehend
the thing itself, and as external to us, finds an analogy in the way
in which we feel the parts of our own bodies, especially when
they suffer pain, which when we do feel them is generally the
case. Just as we imagine that we perceive things where they are,
while the perception really takes place in the brain, we believe
that we feel the pain of a limb in the limb itself, while in reality
it also is felt in the brain, to which it is conducted by the nerve
of the affected part. Therefore, only the affections of those parts
whose nerves go to the brain are felt, and not those of the parts
whose nerves belong to the sympathetic system, unless it be that183
an unusually strong affection of these parts penetrates by some
roundabout way to the brain, where yet for the most part it only
makes itself known as a dull sense of discomfort, and always
without definite determination of its locality. Hence, also, it is
that we do not feel injuries to a limb whose nerve-trunk has been
severed or ligatured. And hence, finally, the man who has lost
a limb still sometimes feels pain in it, because the nerves which
go to the brain are still there. Thus, in the two phenomena here
compared, what goes on in the brain is apprehended as outside
of it; in the case of perception, by means of the understanding,
which extends its feelers into the outer world; in the case of the
feeling of our limbs, by means of the nerves.
