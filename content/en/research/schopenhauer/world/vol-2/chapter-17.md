Chapter XVII.27 On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.

With the exception of man, no being wonders at its own existence;
but it is to them all so much a matter of course that they do not
observe it. The wisdom of nature speaks out of the peaceful
glance of the brutes; for in them the will and the intellect are
not yet so widely separated that they can be astonished at each
other when they meet again. Thus here the whole phenomenon
is still firmly attached to the stem of nature from which it has
come, and is partaker of the unconscious omniscience of the great
mother. Only after the inner being of nature (the will to live in its
objectification) has ascended, vigorous and cheerful, through the
two series of unconscious existences, and then through the long
and broad series of animals, does it attain at last to reflection
for the first time on the entrance of reason, thus in man. Then
it marvels at its own works, and asks itself what it itself is. Its
wonder however is the more serious, as it here stands for the
first time consciously in the presence of death, and besides the
finiteness of all existence, the vanity of all effort forces itself
more or less upon it. With this reflection and this wonder there
arises therefore for man alone, the need for a metaphysic; he is
accordingly an animal metaphysicum. At the beginning of his
consciousness certainly he also accepts himself as a matter of
course. This does not last long however, but very early, with the
first dawn of reflection, that wonder already appears, which is
some day to become the mother of metaphysics. In agreement
with this Aristotle also says at the beginning of his metaphysics:
“”1± 3±Á Ä¿  ̧±Å1⁄4±¶μ11⁄2 ¿1 ±1⁄2 ̧ÁÉÀ¿1 o±1 1⁄2Å1⁄2 o±1 Ä¿ ÀÁÉÄ¿1⁄2
·Á3⁄4±1⁄2Ä¿ Æ1»¿Ã¿Æμ11⁄2.” (Propter admirationem enim et nunc et
primo inceperunt homines philosophari.) Moreover, the special
philosophical disposition consists primarily in this, that a man
is capable of wonder beyond the ordinary and everyday degree,
and is thus induced to make the universal of the phenomenon his

problem, while the investigators in the natural sciences wonder
only at exquisite or rare phenomena, and their problem is merely
to refer these to phenomena which are better known. The lower
a man stands in an intellectual regard the less of a problem is
existence itself for him; everything, how it is, and that it is,
appears to him rather a matter of course. This rests upon the fact
that his intellect still remains perfectly true to its original destiny
of being serviceable to the will as the medium of motives,
and therefore is closely bound up with the world and nature,
as an integral part of them. Consequently it is very far from
comprehending the world in a purely objective manner, freeing
itself, so to speak, from the whole of things, opposing itself to
this whole, and so for a while becoming as if self-existent. On
the other hand, the philosophical wonder which springs from this
is conditioned in the individual by higher development of the
intellect, yet in general not by this alone; but without doubt it is
the knowledge of death, and along with this the consideration of
the suffering and misery of life, which gives the strongest impulse
to philosophical reflection and metaphysical explanation of the
world. If our life were endless and painless, it would perhaps
occur to no one to ask why the world exists, and is just the kind
of world it is; but everything would just be taken as a matter of
course. In accordance with this we find that the interest which
philosophical and also religious systems inspire has always its
strongest hold in the dogma of some kind of existence after
death; and although the most recent systems seem to make the
existence of their gods the main point, and to defend this most
zealously, yet in reality this is only because they have connected
their special dogma of immortality with this, and regard the
one as inseparable from the other: only on this account is it of
importance to them. For if one could establish their doctrine
of immortality for them in some other way, their lively zeal for
their gods would at once cool, and it would give place almost to
complete indifference if, conversely, the absolute impossibility
[361]352
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of immortality were proved to them; for the interest in the
existence of the gods would vanish with the hope of a closer
acquaintance with them, to the residuum which might connect
itself with their possible influence on the events of this present
life. But if one could prove that continued existence after death
is incompatible with the existence of gods, because, let us say, it
pre-supposes originality of being, they would soon sacrifice the
gods to their own immortality and become zealous for Atheism.
The fact that the materialistic systems, properly so-called, and
also absolute scepticism, have never been able to obtain a general
or lasting influence, depends upon the same grounds.
[362]
Temples and churches, pagodas and mosques, in all lands and
in all ages, in splendour and vastness, testify to the metaphysical
need of man, which, strong and ineradicable, follows close upon
his physical need. Certainly whoever is satirically inclined might
add that this metaphysical need is a modest fellow who is content
with poor fare. It sometimes allows itself to be satisfied with
clumsy fables and insipid tales. If only imprinted early enough,
they are for a man adequate explanations of his existence and
supports of his morality. Consider, for example, the Koran.
This wretched book was sufficient to found a religion of the
world, to satisfy the metaphysical need of innumerable millions
of men for twelve hundred years, to become the foundation of
their morality, and of no small contempt for death, and also to
inspire them to bloody wars and most extended conquests. We
find in it the saddest and the poorest form of Theism. Much
may be lost through the translations; but I have not been able
to discover one single valuable thought in it. Such things show
that metaphysical capacity does not go hand in hand with the
metaphysical need. Yet it will appear that in the early ages of
the present surface of the earth this was not the case, and that
those who stood considerably nearer than we do to the beginning
of the human race and the source of organic nature, had also
both greater energy of the intuitive faculty of knowledge, and aChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
353
truer disposition of mind, so that they were capable of a purer,
more direct comprehension of the inner being of nature, and
were thus in a position to satisfy the metaphysical need in a more
worthy manner. Thus originated in the primitive ancestors of
the Brahmans, the Rishis, the almost super-human conceptions
which were afterwards set down in the Upanishads of the Vedas.
On the other hand, there have never been wanting persons who
were interested in deriving their living from that metaphysical
need, and in making the utmost they could out of it. Therefore
among all nations there are monopolists and farmers-general of
it—the priests. Yet their trade had everywhere to be assured
to them in this way, that they received the right to impart
their metaphysical dogmas to men at a very early age, before
the judgment has awakened from its morning slumber, thus in
early childhood; for then every well-impressed dogma, however
senseless it may be, remains for ever. If they had to wait till the
judgment is ripe, their privileges could not continue.
A second, though not a numerous class of persons, who
derive their support from the metaphysical need of man, is
constituted by those who live by philosophy. By the Greeks they
were called Sophists, by the moderns they are called Professors
of Philosophy. Aristotle (Metaph., ii. 2) without hesitation
numbers Aristippus among the Sophists. In Diogenes Laertius
(ii. 65) we find that the reason of this is that he was the first
of the Socratics who accepted payment for his philosophy; on
account of which Socrates also returned him his present. Among
the moderns also those who live by philosophy are not only, as
a rule, and with the rarest exceptions, quite different from those
who live for philosophy, but they are very often the opponents,
the secret and irreconcilable enemies of the latter. For every
true and important philosophical achievement will overshadow
their own too much, and, moreover, cannot adapt itself to the
views and limitations of their guild. Therefore it is always
their endeavour to prevent such a work from making its way;

and for this purpose, according to the age and circumstances
in each case, the customary means are suppressing, concealing,
hushing up, ignoring and keeping secret, or denying, disparaging,
censuring, slandering and distorting, or, finally, denouncing and
persecuting. Hence many a great man has had to drag himself
wearily through life unknown, unhonoured, unrewarded, till at
last, after his death, the world became undeceived as to him and
as to them. In the meanwhile they had attained their end, had
been accepted by preventing him from being accepted, and, with
wife and child, had lived by philosophy, while he lived for it.
But if he is dead, then the thing is reversed; the new generation
of the former class, which always exists, now becomes heir to
his achievements, cuts them down to its own measure, and now
lives by him. That Kant could yet live both by and for philosophy
depended on the rare circumstance that, for the first time since
Divus Antoninus and Divus Julianus, a philosopher sat on the
throne. Only under such auspices could the “Critique of Pure
Reason” have seen the light. Scarcely was the king dead than we
see that Kant also, seized with fear, because he belonged to the
guild, modified, expurgated, and spoiled his masterpiece in the
second edition, and yet was soon in danger of losing his place;
so that Campe invited him to come to him, in Brunswick, and
live with him as the instructor of his family (Ring., Ansichten
aus Kant's Leben, p. 68). University philosophy is, as a rule,
mere juggling. Its real aim is to impart to the students, in the
deepest ground of their thought, that tendency of mind which the
ministry that appoints to the professorships regards as consistent
with its views. The ministry may also be perfectly right in this
from a statesman's point of view; only the result of it is that
such philosophy of the chair is a nervis alienis mobile lignum,
and cannot be regarded as serious philosophy, but as the mere
jest of it. Moreover, it is at any rate just that such inspection or
guidance should extend only to the philosophy of the chair, and
not to the real philosophy that is in earnest. For if anything in the world is worth wishing for—so well worth wishing for that
even the ignorant and dull herd in its more reflective moments
would prize it more than silver and gold—it is that a ray of light
should fall on the obscurity of our being, and that we should gain
some explanation of our mysterious existence, in which nothing
is clear but its misery and its vanity. But even if this is in itself
attainable, it is made impossible by imposed and compulsory
solutions.
We shall now subject to a general consideration the different
ways of satisfying this strong metaphysical need.
By metaphysics I understand all knowledge that pretends to
transcend the possibility of experience, thus to transcend nature
or the given phenomenal appearance of things, in order to give
an explanation of that by which, in some sense or other, this
experience or nature is conditioned; or, to speak in popular
language, of that which is behind nature, and makes it possible.
But the great original diversity in the power of understanding,
besides the cultivation of it, which demands much leisure, makes
so great a difference between men, that as soon as a people
has emerged from the state of savages, no one metaphysic
can serve for them all. Therefore among civilised nations we
find throughout two different kinds of metaphysics, which are
distinguished by the fact that the one has its evidence in itself, the
other outside itself. Since the metaphysical systems of the first
kind require reflection, culture, and leisure for the recognition
of their evidence, they can be accessible only to a very small
number of men; and, moreover, they can only arise and maintain
their existence in the case of advanced civilisation. On the other
hand, the systems of the second kind exclusively are for the great
majority of men who are not capable of thinking, but only of
believing, and who are not accessible to reasons, but only to
authority. These systems may therefore be called metaphysics
of the people, after the analogy of poetry of the people, and
also wisdom of the people, by which is understood proverbs.
[365]356
[366]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
These systems, however, are known under the name of religions,
and are found among all nations, not excepting even the most
savage. Their evidence is, as has been said, external, and as
such is called revelation, which is authenticated by signs and
miracles. Their arguments are principally threats of eternal,
and indeed also temporal evils, directed against unbelievers, and
even against mere doubters. As ultima ratio theologorum, we
find among many nations the stake or things similar to it. If
they seek a different authentication, or if they make use of other
arguments, they already make the transition into the systems of
the first kind, and may degenerate into a mixture of the two,
which brings more danger than advantage, for their invaluable
prerogative of being imparted to children gives them the surest
guarantee of the permanent possession of the mind, for thereby
their dogmas grow into a kind of second inborn intellect, like the
twig upon the grafted tree; while, on the other hand, the systems
of the first kind only appeal to grown-up people, and in them
always find a system of the second kind already in possession of
their convictions. Both kinds of metaphysics, whose difference
may be briefly expressed by the words reasoned conviction and
faith, have this in common, that every one of their particular
systems stands in a hostile relation to all the others of its kind.
Between those of the first kind war is waged only with word
and pen; between those of the second with fire and sword as
well. Several of the latter owe their propagation in part to
this last kind of polemic, and all have by degrees divided the
earth between them, and indeed with such decided authority that
the peoples of the earth are distinguished and separated more
according to them than according to nationality or government.
They alone reign, each in its own province. The systems of
the first kind, on the contrary, are at the most tolerated, and
even this only because, on account of the small number of their
adherents, they are for the most part not considered worth the
trouble of combating with fire and sword—although, where itChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
357
seemed necessary, these also have been employed against them
with effect; besides, they occur only in a sporadic form. Yet in
general they have only been endured in a tamed and subjugated
condition, for the system of the second kind which prevailed in
the country ordered them to conform their teaching more or less
closely to its own. Sometimes it not only subjugated them, but
even employed their services and used them as a support, which
is however a dangerous experiment. For these systems of the
first kind, since they are deprived of power, believe they may
advance themselves by craft, and never entirely lay aside a secret
ill-will which at times comes unexpectedly into prominence and
inflicts injuries which are hard to heal. For they are further made
the more dangerous by the fact that all the real sciences, not
even excepting the most innocent, are their secret allies against
the systems of the second kind, and without themselves being
openly at war with the latter, suddenly and unexpectedly do
great mischief in their province. Besides, the attempt which
is aimed at by the enlistment referred to of the services of the
systems of the first kind by the second—the attempt to add an
inner authentication to a system whose original authentication
was external, is in its nature perilous; for, if it were capable of
such an authentication, it would never have required an external
one. And in general it is always a hazardous thing to attempt
to place a new foundation under a finished structure. Moreover,
how should a religion require the suffrage of a philosophy?
It has everything upon its side—revelation, tradition, miracles,
prophecies, the protection of the government, the highest rank,
as is due to the truth, the consent and reverence of all, a thousand
temples in which it is proclaimed and practised, bands of sworn
priests, and, what is more than all, the invaluable privilege of
being allowed to imprint its doctrines on the mind at the tender
age of childhood, whereby they became almost like innate ideas.
With such wealth of means at its disposal, still to desire the
assent of poor philosophers it must be more covetous, or to care
[367]358
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
about their contradiction it must be more fearful, than seems to
be compatible with a good conscience.
[368]
To the distinction established above between metaphysics
of the first and of the second kind, we have yet to add the
following:—A system of the first kind, thus a philosophy, makes
the claim, and has therefore the obligation, in everything that
it says, sensu stricto et proprio, to be true, for it appeals to
thought and conviction. A religion, on the other hand, being
intended for the innumerable multitude who, since they are
incapable of examination and thought, would never comprehend
the profoundest and most difficult truths sensu proprio, has only
the obligation to be true sensu allegorico. Truth cannot appear
naked before the people. A symptom of this allegorical nature
of religions is the mysteries which are to be found perhaps
in them all, certain dogmas which cannot even be distinctly
thought, not to speak of being literally true. Indeed, perhaps it
might be asserted that some absolute contradictions, some actual
absurdities, are an essential ingredient in a complete religion, for
these are just the stamp of its allegorical nature, and the only
adequate means of making the ordinary mind and the uncultured
understanding feel what would be incomprehensible to it, that
religion has ultimately to do with quite a different order of things,
with an order of things in themselves, in the presence of which
the laws of this phenomenal world, in conformity with which it
must speak, vanish; and that therefore not only the contradictory
but also the comprehensible dogmas are really only allegories
and accommodations to the human power of comprehension. It
seems to me that it was in this spirit that Augustine and even
Luther adhered to the mysteries of Christianity in opposition
to Pelagianism, which sought to reduce everything to the dull
level of comprehensibility. From this point of view it is also
conceivable how Tertullian could say in all seriousness: “Prorsus
credibile est, quia ineptum est: ... certum est, quia impossibile”
(De Carne Christi, c. 5). This allegorical nature of religionsChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
359
makes them independent of the proofs which are incumbent on
philosophy, and in general withdraws them from investigation.
Instead of this they require faith, that is, a voluntary admission
that such is the state of the case. Since, then, faith guides action,
and the allegory is always so framed that, as regards the practical,
it leads precisely to that which the truth sensu proprio would also
lead to, religion is justified in promising to those who believe
eternal salvation. Thus we see that in the main, and for the great
majority, who cannot apply themselves to thought, religions very
well supply the place of metaphysics in general, the need of
which man feels to be imperative. They do this partly in a
practical interest, as the guiding star of their action, the unfurled
standard of integrity and virtue, as Kant admirably expresses it;
partly as the indispensable comfort in the heavy sorrows of life,
in which capacity they fully supply the place of an objectively
true metaphysic, because they lift man above himself and his
existence in time, as well perhaps as such a metaphysic ever
could. In this their great value and indeed necessity shows
itself very clearly. For Plato says, and says rightly, “Æ1»yÃ¿Æ¿1⁄2
À»Æ ̧¿Â  ́{1⁄2±Ä¿1⁄2 μ61⁄2±1” (vulgus philosophum esse impossible
est. De Rep., vi. p. 89, Bip.) On the other hand, the only
stumbling-stone is this, that religions never dare to confess their
allegorical nature, but have to assert that they are true sensu
proprio. They thereby encroach on the province of metaphysics
proper, and call forth the antagonism of the latter, which has
therefore expressed itself at all times when it was not chained
up. The controversy which is so perseveringly carried on in our
own day between supernaturalists and rationalists also rests on
the failure to recognise the allegorical nature of all religion. Both
wish to have Christianity true sensu proprio; in this sense the
former wish to maintain it without deduction, as it were with
skin and hair; and thus they have a hard stand to make against
the knowledge and general culture of the age. The latter wish to
explain away all that is properly Christian; whereupon they retain
[369]360
[370]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
something which is neither sensu proprio nor sensu allegorico
true, but rather a mere platitude, little better than Judaism, or at
the most a shallow Pelagianism, and, what is worst, an abject
optimism, absolutely foreign to Christianity proper. Moreover,
the attempt to found a religion upon reason removes it into the
other class of metaphysics, that which has its authentication in
itself, thus to the foreign ground of the philosophical systems,
and into the conflict which these wage against each other in
their own arena, and consequently exposes it to the light fire
of scepticism and the heavy artillery of the “Critique of Pure
Reason;” but for it to venture there would be clear presumption.
It would be most beneficial to both kinds of metaphysics that
each of them should remain clearly separated from the other and
confine itself to its own province, that it may there be able to
develop its nature fully. Instead of which, through the whole
Christian era, the endeavour has been to bring about a fusion
of the two, for the dogmas and conceptions of the one have
been carried over into the other, whereby both are spoiled. This
has taken place in the most open manner in our own day in
that strange hermaphrodite or centaur, the so-called philosophy
of religion, which, as a kind of gnosis, endeavours to interpret
the given religion, and to explain what is true sensu allegorico
through something which is true sensu proprio. But for this we
would have to know and possess the truth sensu proprio already;
and in that case such an interpretation would be superfluous. For
to seek first to find metaphysics, i.e., the truth sensu proprio,
merely out of religion by explanation and interpretation would
be a doubtful and dangerous undertaking, to which one would
only make up one's mind if it were proved that truth, like iron
and other base metals, could only be found in a mixed, not in a
pure form, and therefore one could only obtain it by reduction
from the mixed ore.
Religions are necessary for the people, and an inestimable
benefit to them. But if they oppose themselves to the progress ofChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
361
mankind in the knowledge of the truth, they must with the utmost
possible forbearance be set aside. And to require that a great
mind—a Shakspeare; a Goethe—should make the dogmas of any
religion implicitly, bonâ fide et sensu proprio, his conviction is
to require that a giant should put on the shoe of a dwarf.
Religions, being calculated with reference to the power of
comprehension of the great mass of men, can only have indirect,
not immediate truth. To require of them the latter is as if one
wished to read the letters set up in the form-chase, instead of
their impression. The value of a religion will accordingly depend
upon the greater or less content of truth which it contains under
the veil of allegory, and then upon the greater or less distinctness
with which it becomes visible through this veil, thus upon the
transparency of the latter. It almost seems that, as the oldest
languages are the most perfect, so also are the oldest religions.
If I were to take the results of my philosophy as the standard
of truth, I would be obliged to concede to Buddhism the pre-
eminence over the rest. In any case it must be a satisfaction to
me to see my teaching in such close agreement with a religion
which the majority of men upon the earth hold as their own; for
it numbers far more adherents than any other. This agreement,
however, must be the more satisfactory to me because in my
philosophising I have certainly not been under its influence. For
up till 1818, when my work appeared, there were very few,
exceedingly incomplete and scanty, accounts of Buddhism to be
found in Europe, which were almost entirely limited to a few
essays in the earlier volumes of “Asiatic Researches,” and were
principally concerned with the Buddhism of the Burmese. Only
since then has fuller information about this religion gradually
reached us, chiefly through the profound and instructive essays
of the meritorious member of the St. Petersburg Academy, J.
J. Schmidt, in the proceedings of his Academy, and then little
by little through several English and French scholars, so that
I was able to give a fairly numerous list of the best works on
[371]362
[372]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
this religion in my work, “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,”
under the heading Sinologie. Unfortunately Csoma Körösi, that
persevering Hungarian, who, in order to study the language and
sacred writings of Buddhism, spent many years in Tibet, and for
the most part in Buddhist monasteries, was carried off by death
just as he was beginning to work out for us the results of his
researches. I cannot, however, deny the pleasure with which I
read, in his provisional accounts, several passages cited directly
from the Kahgyur itself; for example, the following conversation
of the dying Buddha with Brahma, who is doing him homage:
“There is a description of their conversation on the subject of
creation,—by whom was the world made? Shakya asks several
questions of Brahma,—whether was it he who made or produced
such and such things, and endowed or blessed them with such
and such virtues or properties,—whether was it he who caused
the several revolutions in the destruction and regeneration of the
world. He denies that he had ever done anything to that effect.
At last he himself asks Shakya how the world was made,—by
whom? Here are attributed all changes in the world to the moral
works of the animal beings, and it is stated that in the world all
is illusion, there is no reality in the things; all is empty. Brahma,
being instructed in his doctrine, becomes his follower” (Asiatic
Researches, vol. XX. p. 434).
I cannot place, as is always done, the fundamental difference
of all religions in the question whether they are monotheistic,
polytheistic, pantheistic, or atheistic, but only in the question
whether they are optimistic or pessimistic, that is, whether they
present the existence of the world as justified by itself, and
therefore praise and value it, or regard it as something that can
only be conceived as the consequence of our guilt, and therefore
properly ought not to be, because they recognise that pain and
death cannot lie in the eternal, original, and immutable order
of things, in that which in every respect ought to be. The
power by virtue of which Christianity was able to overcomeChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
363
first Judaism, and then the heathenism of Greece and Rome, lies
solely in its pessimism, in the confession that our state is both
exceedingly wretched and sinful, while Judaism and heathenism
were optimistic. That truth, profoundly and painfully felt by all,
penetrated, and bore in its train the need of redemption.
I turn to a general consideration of the other kind of
metaphysics, that which has its authentication in itself, and
is called philosophy. I remind the reader of its origin, mentioned
above, in a wonder concerning the world and our own existence,
inasmuch as these press upon the intellect as a riddle, the solution
of which therefore occupies mankind without intermission. Here,
then, I wish first of all to draw attention to the fact that this could
not be the case if, in Spinoza's sense, which in our own day
has so often been brought forward again under modern forms
and expositions as pantheism, the world were an “absolute
substance,” and therefore an absolutely necessary existence. For
this means that it exists with so great a necessity that beside it
every other necessity comprehensible to our understanding as
such must appear as an accident. It would then be something
which comprehended in itself not only all actual but also all
possible existence, so that, as Spinoza indeed declares, its
possibility and its actuality would be absolutely one. Its non-
being would therefore be impossibility itself; thus it would
be something the non-being or other-being of which must be
completely inconceivable, and which could therefore just as
little be thought away as, for example, space or time. And
since, further, we ourselves would be parts, modes, attributes, or
accidents of such an absolute substance, which would be the only
thing that, in any sense, could ever or anywhere exist, our and
its existence, together with its properties, would necessarily be
very far from presenting itself to us as remarkable, problematical,
and indeed as an unfathomable and ever-disquieting riddle, but,
on the contrary, would be far more self-evident than that two
and two make four. For we would necessarily be incapable of
[373]364
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
thinking anything else than that the world is, and is, as it is;
and therefore we would necessarily be as little conscious of its
existence as such, i.e., as a problem for reflection, as we are of
the incredibly fast motion of our planet.
[374]
All this, however, is absolutely not the case. Only to the brutes,
who are without thought, does the world and existence appear as a
matter of course; to man, on the contrary, it is a problem, of which
even the most uneducated and narrow-minded becomes vividly
conscious in certain brighter moments, but which enters more
distinctly and more permanently into the consciousness of each
one of us the clearer and more enlightened that consciousness is,
and the more material for thought it has acquired through culture,
which all ultimately rises, in minds that are naturally adapted
for philosophising, to Plato's “ ̧±Å1⁄4±¶μ11⁄2, 1⁄4±»± Æ1»¿Ã¿Æ1o¿1⁄2
À± ̧¿Â” (mirari, valde philosophicus affectus), that is, to that
wonder which comprehends in its whole magnitude that problem
which unceasingly occupies the nobler portion of mankind in
every age and in every land, and gives it no rest. In fact, the
pendulum which keeps in motion the clock of metaphysics, that
never runs down, is the consciousness that the non-existence
of this world is just as possible as its existence. Thus, then,
the Spinozistic view of it as an absolutely necessary existence,
that is, as something that absolutely and in every sense ought
to and must be, is a false one. Even simple Theism, since in
its cosmological proof it tacitly starts by inferring the previous
non-existence of the world from its existence, thereby assumes
beforehand that the world is something contingent. Nay, what is
more, we very soon apprehend the world as something the non-
existence of which is not only conceivable, but indeed preferable
to its existence. Therefore our wonder at it easily passes into a
brooding over the fatality which could yet call forth its existence,
and by virtue of which such stupendous power as is demanded
for the production and maintenance of such a world could be
directed so much against its own interest. The philosophicalChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
365
astonishment is therefore at bottom perplexed and melancholy;
philosophy, like the overture to “Don Juan,” commences with a
minor chord. It follows from this that it can neither be Spinozism
nor optimism. The more special nature, which has just been
indicated, of the astonishment which leads us to philosophise
clearly springs from the sight of the suffering and the wickedness
in the world, which, even if they were in the most just proportion
to each other, and also were far outweighed by good, are yet
something which absolutely and in general ought not to be. But
since now nothing can come out of nothing, these also must have
their germ in the origin or in the kernel of the world itself. It is
hard for us to assume this if we look at the magnitude, the order
and completeness, of the physical world, for it seems to us that
what had the power to produce such a world must have been able
to avoid the suffering and the wickedness. That assumption (the
truest expression of which is Ormuzd and Ahrimines), it is easy
to conceive, is hardest of all for Theism. Therefore the freedom
of the will was primarily invented to account for wickedness.
But this is only a concealed way of making something out of
nothing, for it assumes an Operari that proceeded from no Esse
(see Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik, p. 58, et seq.; second
edition, p. 57 et seq..) Then it was sought to get rid of evil by
attributing it to matter, or to unavoidable necessity, whereby the
devil, who is really the right Expediens ad hoc, was unwillingly
set aside. To evil also belongs death; but wickedness is only the
throwing of the existing evil from oneself on to another. Thus,
as was said above, it is wickedness, evil, and death that qualify
and intensify the philosophical astonishment. Not merely that the
world exists, but still more that it is such a wretched world, is the
punctum pruriens of metaphysics, the problem which awakens
in mankind an unrest that cannot be quieted by scepticism nor
yet by criticism.
We find physics also (in the widest sense of the word) occupied
with the explanation of the phenomena in the world. But it lies
[375]366
[376]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
in the very nature of its explanations themselves that they cannot
be sufficient. Physics cannot stand on its own feet, but requires a
metaphysic to lean upon, whatever airs it may give itself towards
the latter. For it explains the phenomena by something still
more unknown than they are themselves; by laws of nature,
resting upon forces of nature, to which the power of life also
belongs. Certainly the whole present condition of all things
in the world, or in nature, must necessarily be explicable from
purely physical causes. But such an explanation—supposing one
actually succeeded so far as to be able to give it—must always
just as necessarily be tainted with two imperfections (as it were
with two sores, or like Achilles with the vulnerable heel, or the
devil with the horse's hoof), on account of which everything
so explained really remains still unexplained. First with this
imperfection, that the beginning of every explanatory chain of
causes and effects, i.e., of connected changes, can absolutely
never be reached, but, just like the limits of the world in space
and time, unceasingly recedes in infinito. Secondly with this,
that the whole of the efficient causes out of which everything is
explained constantly rest upon something which is completely
inexplicable, the original qualities of things and the natural forces
which play a prominent part among them, by virtue of which
they produce a specific kind of effect, e.g., weight, hardness,
impulsive force, elasticity, warmth, electricity, chemical forces,
&c., and which now remain in every explanation which is
given, like an unknown quantity, which absolutely cannot be
eliminated, in an otherwise perfectly solved algebraical equation.
Accordingly there is no fragment of clay, however little worth,
that is not entirely composed of inexplicable qualities. Thus
these two inevitable defects in every purely physical, i.e., causal,
explanation show that such an explanation can only be relative,
and that its whole method and nature cannot be the only one, the
ultimate and thus the sufficient one, i.e., cannot be the method
of explanation that can ever lead to the satisfactory solution ofChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
367
the difficult riddle of things, and to the true understanding of
the world and existence; but that the physical explanation in
general and as such requires further a metaphysical explanation,
which affords us the key to all its assumptions, but just on this
account must necessarily follow quite a different path. The first
step to this is that one should bring to distinct consciousness
and firmly retain the difference of the two, hence the difference
between physics and metaphysics. It rests in general on the
Kantian distinction between phenomenon and thing in itself. Just
because Kant held the latter to be absolutely unknowable, there
was, according to him, no metaphysics, but merely immanent
knowledge, i.e., physics, which throughout can speak only of
phenomena, and also a critique of the reason which strives after
metaphysics. Here, however, in order to show the true point
of connection between my philosophy and that of Kant, I shall
anticipate the second book, and give prominence to the fact that
Kant, in his beautiful exposition of the compatibility of freedom
and necessity (Critique of Pure Reason, first edition, p. 532-554;
and Critique of Practical Reason, p. 224-231 of Rosenkranz's
edition), shows how one and the same action may in one aspect
be perfectly explicable as necessarily arising from the character
of the man, the influence to which he has been subject in the
course of his life, and the motives which are now present to him,
but yet in another aspect must be regarded as the work of his free
will; and in the same sense he says, § 53 of the “Prolegomena:”
“Certainly natural necessity will belong to every connection of
cause and effect in the world of sense; yet, on the other hand,
freedom will be conceded to that cause which is not itself a
phenomenon (though indeed it is the ground of phenomena),
thus nature and freedom may without contradiction be attributed
to the same thing, but in a different reference—in the one case
as a phenomenon, in the other case as a thing in itself.” What,
then, Kant teaches of the phenomenon of man and his action my
teaching extends to all phenomena in nature, in that it makes
[377]368
[378]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
the will as a thing in itself their foundation. This proceeding
is justified first of all by the fact that it must not be assumed
that man is specifically toto genere radically different from the
other beings and things in nature, but rather that he is different
only in degree. I turn back from this premature digression to
our consideration of the inadequacy of physics to afford us the
ultimate explanation of things. I say, then, everything certainly
is physical, but yet nothing is explicable physically. As for
the motion of the projected bullet, so also for the thinking of
the brain, a physical explanation must ultimately be in itself
possible, which would make the latter just as comprehensible
as is the former. But even the former, which we imagine
we understand so perfectly, is at bottom as obscure to us as
the latter; for what the inner nature of expansion in space may
be—of impenetrability, mobility, hardness, elasticity, and gravity
remains, after all physical explanations, a mystery, just as much
as thought. But because in the case of thought the inexplicable
appears most immediately, a spring was at once made here from
physics to metaphysics, and a substance of quite a different kind
from all corporeal substances was hypostatised—a soul was set
up in the brain. But if one had not been so dull as only to be
capable of being struck by the most remarkable of phenomena,
one would have had to explain digestion by a soul in the stomach,
vegetation by a soul in the plant, affinity by a soul in the reagents,
nay, the falling of a stone by a soul in the stone. For the quality
of every unorganised body is just as mysterious as the life in the
living body. In the same way, therefore, the physical explanation
strikes everywhere upon what is metaphysical, by which it is
annihilated, i.e., it ceases to be explanation. Strictly speaking, it
may be asserted that no natural science really achieves anything
more than what is also achieved by Botany: the bringing together
of similars, classification. A physical system which asserted
that its explanations of things—in the particular from causes,
and in general from forces—were really sufficient, and thusChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.

exhausted the nature of the world, would be the true Naturalism.
From Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus down to the Système
de la Nature, and further, to Delamark, Cabanis, and to the
materialism that has again been warmed up in the last few years,
we can trace the persistent attempt to set up a system of physics
without metaphysics, that is, a system which would make the
phenomenon the thing in itself. But all their explanations seek
to conceal from the explainers themselves and from others that
they simply assume the principal matter without more ado. They
endeavour to show that all phenomena, even those of mind,
are physical. And they are right; only they do not see that all
that is physical is in another aspect also metaphysical. But,
without Kant, this is indeed difficult to see, for it presupposes
the distinction of the phenomenon from the thing in itself. Yet
without this Aristotle, much as he was inclined to empiricism,
and far as he was removed from the Platonic hyper-physics, kept
himself free from this limited point of view. He says: “•1 1⁄4μ1⁄2
¿Å1⁄2 1⁄4· μÃÄ1 Ä1Â ÄμÁ± ¿ÅÃ1± À±Á± Ä±Â ÆÅÃμ1 ÃÅ1⁄2μÃÄ·oÅ1±Â, !

igitur non est aliqua alia substantia, prœter eas, quœ natura

est aliqua substantia immobilis, hœc prior et philosophia prima,
et universalis sic, quod prima; et de ente, prout ens est, speculari
hujus est), “Metaph.,” V. 1. Such an absolute system of physics as
is described above, which leaves room for no metaphysics, would
make the Natura naturata into the Natura naturans; it would be
physics established on the throne of metaphysics, yet it would
comport itself in this high position almost like Holberg's theatrical
would-be politician who was made burgomaster. Indeed behind
the reproach of atheism, in itself absurd, and for the most part
malicious, there lies, as its inner meaning and truth, which gives
it strength, the obscure conception of such an absolute system
[379]370
[380]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of physics without metaphysics. Certainly such a system would
necessarily be destructive of ethics; and while Theism has falsely
been held to be inseparable from morality, this is really true
only of metaphysics in general, i.e., of the knowledge that the
order of nature is not the only and absolute order of things.
Therefore we may set up this as the necessary Credo of all just
and good men: “I believe in metaphysics.” In this respect it
is important and necessary that one should convince oneself of
the untenable nature of an absolute system of physics, all the
more as this, the true naturalism, is a point of view which of its
own accord and ever anew presses itself upon a man, and can
only be done away with through profound speculation. In this
respect, however, all kinds of systems and faiths, so far and so
long as they are accepted, certainly serve as a substitute for such
speculation. But that a fundamentally false view presses itself
upon man of its own accord, and must first be skilfully removed,
is explicable from the fact that the intellect is not originally
intended to instruct us concerning the nature of things, but only
to show us their relations, with reference to our will; it is, as we
shall find in the second book, only the medium of motives. Now,
that the world schematises itself in the intellect in a manner which
exhibits quite a different order of things from the absolutely true
one, because it shows us, not their kernel, but only their outer
shell, happens accidentally, and cannot be used as a reproach
to the intellect; all the less as it nevertheless finds in itself the
means of rectifying this error, in that it arrives at the distinction
between the phenomenal appearance and the inner being of
things, which distinction existed in substance at all times, only
for the most part was very imperfectly brought to consciousness,
and therefore was inadequately expressed, indeed often appeared
in strange clothing. The Christian mystics, when they call it
the light of nature, declare the intellect to be inadequate to the
comprehension of the true nature of things. It is, as it were, a
mere surface force, like electricity, and does not penetrate to theChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
371
inner being.
The insufficiency of pure naturalism appears, as we have said,
first of all, on the empirical path itself, through the circumstance
that every physical explanation explains the particular from its
cause; but the chain of these causes, as we know a priori, and
therefore with perfect certainty, runs back to infinity, so that
absolutely no cause could ever be the first. Then, however, the
effect of every cause is referred to a law of nature, and this
finally to a force of nature, which now remains as the absolutely
inexplicable. But this inexplicable, to which all phenomena of
this so clearly given and naturally explicable world, from the
highest to the lowest, are referred, just shows that the whole
nature of such explanation is only conditional, as it were only
ex concessis, and by no means the true and sufficient one;
therefore I said above that physically everything and nothing is
explicable. That absolutely inexplicable element which pervades
all phenomena, which is most striking in the highest, e.g., in
generation, but yet is just as truly present in the lowest, e.g.,
in mechanical phenomena, points to an entirely different kind
of order of things lying at the foundation of the physical order,
which is just what Kant calls the order of things in themselves,
and which is the goal of metaphysics. But, secondly, the
insufficiency of pure naturalism comes out clearly from that
fundamental philosophical truth, which we have fully considered
in the first half of this book, and which is also the theme of
the “Critique of Pure Reason;” the truth that every object, both
as regards its objective existence in general and as regards the
manner (forms) of this existence, is throughout conditioned by
the knowing subject, hence is merely a phenomenon, not a thing
in itself. This is explained in § 7 of the first volume, and it is
there shown that nothing can be more clumsy than that, after the
manner of all materialists, one should blindly take the objective
as simply given in order to derive everything from it without
paying any regard to the subjective, through which, however,
[381]372
[382]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
nay, in which alone the former exists. Samples of this procedure
are most readily afforded us by the fashionable materialism of
our own day, which has thereby become a philosophy well suited
for barbers' and apothecaries' apprentices. For it, in its innocence,
matter, assumed without reflection as absolutely real, is the thing
in self, and the one capacity of a thing in itself is impulsive force,
for all other qualities can only be manifestations of this.
With naturalism, then, or the purely physical way of looking
at things, we shall never attain our end; it is like a sum that never
comes out. Causal series without beginning or end, fundamental
forces which are inscrutable, endless space, beginningless time,
infinite divisibility of matter, and all this further conditioned
by a knowing brain, in which alone it exists just like a dream,
and without which it vanishes—constitute the labyrinth in which
naturalism leads us ceaselessly round. The height to which in
our time the natural sciences have risen in this respect entirely
throws into the shade all previous centuries, and is a summit
which mankind reaches for the first time. But however great are
the advances which physics (understood in the wide sense of the
ancients) may make, not the smallest step towards metaphysics
is thereby taken, just as a plane can never obtain cubical content
by being indefinitely extended. For all such advances will only
perfect our knowledge of the phenomenon; while metaphysics
strives to pass beyond the phenomenal appearance itself, to that
which so appears. And if indeed it had the assistance of an
entire and complete experience, it would, as regards the main
point, be in no way advantaged by it. Nay, even if one wandered
through all the planets and fixed stars, one would thereby have
made no step in metaphysics. It is rather the case that the greatest
advances of physics will make the need of metaphysics ever more
felt; for it is just the corrected, extended, and more thorough
knowledge of nature which, on the one hand, always undermines
and ultimately overthrows the metaphysical assumptions which
till then have prevailed, but, on the other hand, presents theChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
373
problem of metaphysics itself more distinctly, more correctly,
and more fully, and separates it more clearly from all that is
merely physical; moreover, the more perfectly and accurately
known nature of the particular thing more pressingly demands
the explanation of the whole and the general, which, the more
correctly, thoroughly, and completely it is known empirically,
only presents itself as the more mysterious. Certainly the
individual, simple investigator of nature, in a special branch of
physics, does not at once become clearly conscious of all this;
he rather sleeps contentedly by the side of his chosen maid, in
the house of Odysseus, banishing all thoughts of Penelope (cf.
ch. 12 at the end). Hence we see at the present day the husk
of nature investigated in its minutest details, the intestines of
intestinal worms and the vermin of vermin known to a nicety.
But if some one comes, as, for example, I do, and speaks of
the kernel of nature, they will not listen; they even think it has
nothing to do with the matter, and go on sifting their husks.
One finds oneself tempted to call that over-microscopical and
micrological investigator of nature the cotquean of nature. But
those persons who believe that crucibles and retorts are the
true and only source of all wisdom are in their own way just
as perverse as were formerly their antipodes the Scholastics.
As the latter, absolutely confined to their abstract conceptions,
used these as their weapons, neither knowing nor investigating
anything outside them, so the former, absolutely confined to
their empiricism, allow nothing to be true except what their eyes
behold, and believe they can thus arrive at the ultimate ground
of things, not discerning that between the phenomenon and that
which manifests itself in it, the thing in itself, there is a deep
gulf, a radical difference, which can only be cleared up by the
knowledge and accurate delimitation of the subjective element
of the phenomenon, and the insight that the ultimate and most
important conclusions concerning the nature of things can only
be drawn from self-consciousness; yet without all this one cannot
[383]374
[384]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
advance a step beyond what is directly given to the senses, thus
can get no further than to the problem. Yet, on the other hand,
it is to be observed that the most perfect possible knowledge of
nature is the corrected statement of the problem of metaphysics.
Therefore no one ought to venture upon this without having first
acquired a knowledge of all the branches of natural science,
which, though general, shall be thorough, clear, and connected.
For the problem must precede its solution. Then, however, the
investigator must turn his glance inward; for the intellectual
and ethical phenomena are more important than the physical,
in the same proportion as, for example, animal magnetism is a
far more important phenomenon than mineral magnetism. The
last fundamental secret man carries within himself, and this is
accessible to him in the most immediate manner; therefore it is
only here that he can hope to find the key to the riddle of the
world and gain a clue to the nature of all things. The special
province of metaphysics thus certainly lies in what has been
called mental philosophy.
“The ranks of living creatures thou dost lead
Before me, teaching me to know my brothers
In air and water and the silent wood:
Then to the cave secure thou leadest me,
Then show'st me mine own self, and in my breast
The deep, mysterious miracles unfold.”28
28
[Bayard Taylor's translation of Faust, vol. i. 180. Trs.]Chapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
375
Finally, then, as regards the source or the foundation of
metaphysical knowledge, I have already declared myself above
to be opposed to the assumption, which is even repeated by
Kant, that it must lie in mere conceptions. In no knowledge can
conceptions be what is first; for they are always derived from
some perception. What has led, however, to that assumption is
probably the example of mathematics. Mathematics can leave
perception altogether, and, as is especially the case in algebra,
trigonometry, and analysis, can operate with purely abstract
conceptions, nay, with conceptions which are represented only
by signs instead of words, and can yet arrive at a perfectly
certain result, which is still so remote that any one who adhered
to the firm ground of perception could not arrive at it. But
the possibility of this depends, as Kant has clearly shown, on
the fact that the conceptions of mathematics are derived from
the most certain and definite of all perceptions, from the a
priori and yet intuitively known relations of quantity, and can
therefore be constantly realised again and controlled by these,
either arithmetically, by performing the calculations which are
merely indicated by those signs, or geometrically, by means
of what Kant calls the construction of the conceptions. This
advantage, on the other hand, is not possessed by the conceptions
out of which it was believed metaphysics could be built up;
such, for example, as essence, being, substance, perfection,
necessity, reality, finite, infinite, absolute, ground, &c. For such
conceptions are by no means original, as fallen from heaven,
or innate; but they also, like all conceptions, are derived from
perceptions; and as, unlike the conceptions of mathematics,
they do not contain the mere form of perception, but more,
empirical perceptions must lie at their foundation. Thus nothing
can be drawn from them which the empirical perceptions did
not also contain, that is, nothing which was not a matter of
experience, and which, since these conceptions are very wide
abstractions, we would receive with much greater certainty at
[385]376
[386]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
first hand from experience. For from conceptions nothing more
can ever be drawn than the perceptions from which they are
derived contain. If we desire pure conceptions, i.e., such as have
no empirical source, the only ones that can be produced are those
which concern space and time, i.e., the merely formal part of
perception, consequently only the mathematical conceptions, or
at most also the conception of causality, which indeed does not
originate in experience, but yet only comes into consciousness
by means of it (first in sense-perception); therefore experience
indeed is only possible by means of it; but it also is only valid
in the sphere of experience, on which account Kant has shown
that it only serves to communicate the connection of experience,
and not to transcend it; that thus it admits only of physical
application, not of metaphysical. Certainly only its a priori
origin can give apodictic certainty to any knowledge; but this
limits it to the mere form of experience in general, for it shows
that it is conditioned by the subjective nature of the intellect.
Such knowledge, then, far from taking us beyond experience,
gives only one part of experience itself, the formal part, which
belongs to it throughout, and therefore is universal, consequently
mere form without content. Since now metaphysics can least of
all be confined to this, it must have also empirical sources of
knowledge; therefore that preconceived idea of a metaphysic to
be found purely a priori is necessarily vain. It is really a petitio
principii of Kant's, which he expresses most distinctly in § 1 of
the Prolegomena, that metaphysics must not draw its fundamental
conceptions and principles from experience. In this it is assumed
beforehand that only what we knew before all experience can
extend beyond all possible experience. Supported by this, Kant
then comes and shows that all such knowledge is nothing more
than the form of the intellect for the purpose of experience, and
consequently can never lead beyond experience, from which he
then rightly deduces the impossibility of all metaphysics. But
does it not rather seem utterly perverse that in order to discoverChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
377
the secret of experience, i.e., of the world which alone lies before
us, we should look quite away from it, ignore its content, and
take and use for its material only the empty forms of which
we are conscious a priori? Is it not rather in keeping with the
matter that the science of experience in general, and as such,
should also be drawn from experience? Its problem itself is
given it empirically; why should not the solution of it call in the
assistance of experience? Is it not senseless that he who speaks
of the nature of things should not look at things themselves, but
should confine himself to certain abstract conceptions? The
task of metaphysics is certainly not the observation of particular
experiences, but yet it is the correct explanation of experience
as a whole. Its foundation must therefore, at any rate, be of an
empirical nature. Indeed the a priori nature of a part of human
knowledge will be apprehended by it as a given fact, from which
it will infer the subjective origin of the same. Only because the
consciousness of its a priori nature accompanies it is it called by
Kant transcendental as distinguished from transcendent, which
signifies “passing beyond all possibility of experience,” and
has its opposite in immanent, i.e., remaining within the limits
of experience. I gladly recall the original meaning of this
expression introduced by Kant, with which, as also with that of
the Categories, and many others, the apes of philosophy carry on
their game at the present day. Now, besides this, the source of
the knowledge of metaphysics is not outer experience alone, but
also inner. Indeed, what is most peculiar to it, that by which the
decisive step which alone can solve the great question becomes
possible for it, consists, as I have fully and thoroughly proved in
“Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” under the heading, “Physische
Astronomie,” in this, that at the right place it combines outer
experience with inner, and uses the latter as a key to the former.
The origin of metaphysics in empirical sources of knowledge,
which is here set forth, and which cannot fairly be denied,
deprives it certainly of that kind of apodictic certainty which
[387]378
[388]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
is only possible through knowledge a priori. This remains the
possession of logic and mathematics—sciences, however, which
really only teach what every one knows already, though not
distinctly. At most the primary elements of natural science may
also be deduced from knowledge a priori. By this confession
metaphysics only surrenders an ancient claim, which, according
to what has been said above, rested upon misunderstanding,
and against which the great diversity and changeableness of
metaphysical systems, and also the constantly accompanying
scepticism, in every age has testified. Yet against the possibility
of metaphysics in general this changeableness cannot be urged,
for the same thing affects just as much all branches of natural
science, chemistry, physics, geology, zoology, &c., and even
history has not remained exempt from it. But when once, as
far as the limits of human intellect allow, a true system of
metaphysics shall have been found, the unchangeableness of
a science which is known a priori will yet belong to it; for
its foundation can only be experience in general, and not the
particular and special experiences by which, on the other hand,
the natural sciences are constantly modified and new material is
always being provided for history. For experience as a whole
and in general will never change its character for a new one.
The next question is: How can a science drawn from
experience pass beyond it and so merit the name of metaphysics?
It cannot do so perhaps in the same way as we find a fourth number
from three proportionate ones, or a triangle from two sides and an
angle. This was the way of the pre-Kantian dogmatism, which,
according to certain laws known to us a priori, sought to reason
from the given to the not given, from the consequent to the
reason, thus from experience to that which could not possibly
be given in any experience. Kant proved the impossibility of a
metaphysic upon this path, in that he showed that although these
laws were not drawn from experience, they were only valid for
experience. He therefore rightly taught that in such a way weChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.
379
cannot transcend the possibility of all experience. But there are
other paths to metaphysics. The whole of experience is like a
cryptograph, and philosophy the deciphering of it, the correctness
of which is proved by the connection appearing everywhere. If
this whole is only profoundly enough comprehended, and the
inner experience is connected with the outer, it must be capable
of being interpreted, explained from itself. Since Kant has
irrefutably proved to us that experience in general proceeds from
two elements, the forms of knowledge and the inner nature of
things, and that these two may be distinguished in experience
from each other, as that of which we are conscious a priori
and that which is added a posteriori, it is possible, at least in
general, to say, what in the given experience, which is primarily
merely phenomenal, belongs to the form of this phenomenon,
conditioned by the intellect, and what, after deducting this,
remains over for the thing in itself. And although no one
can discern the thing in itself through the veil of the forms of
perception, on the other hand every one carries it in himself,
indeed is it himself; therefore in self-consciousness it must be
in some way accessible to him, even though only conditionally.
Thus the bridge by which metaphysics passes beyond experience
is nothing else than that analysis of experience into phenomenon
and thing in itself in which I have placed Kant's greatest merit.
For it contains the proof of a kernel of the phenomenon different
from the phenomenon itself. This can indeed never be entirely
separated from the phenomenon and regarded in itself as an ens
extramundanum, but is always known only in its relations to and
connections with the phenomenon itself. But the interpretation
and explanation of the latter, in relation to the former, which
is its inner kernel, is capable of affording us information with
regard to it which does not otherwise come into consciousness.
In this sense, then, metaphysics goes beyond the phenomenon,
i.e., nature, to that which is concealed in or behind it (Ä¿ 1⁄4μÄ±
Ä¿ ÆÅÃ1o¿1⁄2), always regarding it, however, merely as that which
[389]380
[390]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
manifests itself in the phenomenon, not as independent of all
phenomenal appearance; it therefore remains immanent, and
does not become transcendent. For it never disengages itself
entirely from experience, but remains merely its interpretation
and explanation, since it never speaks of the thing in itself
otherwise than in its relation to the phenomenon. This at least is
the sense in which I, with reference throughout to the limitations
of human knowledge proved by Kant, have attempted to solve
the problem of metaphysics. Therefore his Prolegomena to future
metaphysics will be valid and suitable for mine also. Accordingly
it never really goes beyond experience, but only discloses the true
understanding of the world which lies before it in experience.
It is neither, according to the definition of metaphysics which
even Kant repeats, a science of mere conceptions, nor is it a
system of deductions from a priori principles, the uselessness of
which for the end of metaphysics has been shown by Kant. But
it is rational knowledge, drawn from perception of the external
actual world and the information which the most intimate fact of
self-consciousness affords us concerning it, deposited in distinct
conceptions. It is accordingly the science of experience; but
its subject and its source is not particular experiences, but the
totality of all experience. I completely accept Kant's doctrine
that the world of experience is merely phenomenal, and that the
a priori knowledge is valid only in relation to phenomena; but
I add that just as phenomenal appearance, it is the manifestation
of that which appears, and with him I call this the thing in itself.
This must therefore express its nature and character in the world
of experience, and consequently it must be possible to interpret
these from this world, and indeed from the matter, not the mere
form, of experience. Accordingly philosophy is nothing but the
correct and universal understanding of experience itself, the true
exposition of its meaning and content. To this the metaphysical,
i.e., that which is merely clothed in the phenomenon and veiled
in its forms, is that which is related to it as thought to words.Chapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.

Such a deciphering of the world with reference to that which
manifests itself in it must receive its confirmation from itself,
through the agreement with each other in which it places the
very diverse phenomena of the world, and which without it we
do not perceive. If we find a document the alphabet of which
is unknown, we endeavour to make it out until we hit upon
an hypothesis as to the significance of the letters in accordance
with which they make up comprehensible words and connected
sentences. Then, however, there remains no doubt as to the
correctness of the deciphering, because it is not possible that
the agreement and connection in which all the letters of that
writing are placed by this explanation is merely accidental, and
that by attributing quite a different value to the letters we could
also recognise words and sentences in this arrangement of them.
In the same way the deciphering of the world must completely
prove itself from itself. It must throw equal light upon all the
phenomena of the world, and also bring the most heterogeneous
into agreement, so that the contradiction between those which
are most in contrast may be abolished. This proof from itself is
the mark of genuineness. For every false deciphering, even if it is
suitable for some phenomena, will conflict all the more glaringly
with the rest. So, for example, the optimism of Leibnitz conflicts
with the palpable misery of existence; the doctrine of Spinoza,
that the world is the only possible and absolutely necessary
substance, is incompatible with our wonder at its existence and
nature; the Wolfian doctrine, that man obtains his Existentia
and Essentia from a will foreign to himself, is contradicted
by our moral responsibility for the actions which proceed with
strict necessity from these, in conflict with the motives; the
oft-repeated doctrine of the progressive development of man to
an ever higher perfection, or in general of any kind of becoming
by means of the process of the world, is opposed to the a priori
knowledge that at any point of time an infinite time has already
run its course, and consequently all that is supposed to come with time would necessarily have already existed; and in this
way an interminable list might be given of the contradictions of
dogmatic assumptions with the given reality of things. On the
other hand, I must deny that any doctrine of my philosophy
could fairly be added to such a list, because each of them has
been thought out in the presence of the perceived reality, and
none of them has its root in abstract conceptions alone. There
is yet in it a fundamental thought which is applied to all the
phenomena of the world as their key; but it proves itself to be the
right alphabet at the application of which all words and sentences
have sense and significance. The discovered answer to a riddle
shows itself to be the right one by the fact that all that is said
in the riddle is suitable to it. In the same way my doctrine
introduces agreement and connection into the confusion of the
contrasting phenomena of this world, and solves the innumerable
contradictions which, when regarded from any other point of
view, it presents. Therefore, so far, it is like a sum that comes out
right, yet by no means in the sense that it leaves no problem over
to solve, no possible question unanswered. To assert anything
of that sort would be a presumptuous denial of the limits of
human knowledge in general. Whatever torch we may kindle,
and whatever space it may light, our horizon will always remain
bounded by profound night. For the ultimate solution of the
riddle of the world must necessarily be concerned with the things
in themselves, no longer with the phenomena. But all our forms
of knowledge are adapted to the phenomena alone; therefore we
must comprehend everything through coexistence, succession,
and causal relations. These forms, however, have meaning and
significance only with reference to the phenomenon; the things
in themselves and their possible relations cannot be apprehended
by means of those forms. Therefore the actual, positive solution
of the riddle of the world must be something that human intellect
is absolutely incapable of grasping and thinking; so that if a being
of a higher kind were to come and take all pains to impart it toChapter XVII. On Man's Need Of Metaphysics.

us, we would be absolutely incapable of understanding anything
of his expositions. Those, therefore, who profess to know the
ultimate, i.e., the first ground of things, thus a primordial being,
an absolute, or whatever else they choose to call it, together
with the process, the reasons, motives, or whatever it may be,
in consequence of which the world arises from it, or springs, or
falls, or is produced, set in existence, “discharged,” and ushered
forth, are playing tricks, are vain boasters, when indeed they are
not charlatans.
I regard it as a great excellence of my philosophy that all
its truths have been found independently of each other, by
contemplation of the real world; but their unity and agreement,
about which I had been unconcerned, has always afterwards
appeared of itself. Hence also it is rich, and has wide-
spreading roots in the ground of perceptible reality, from which
all nourishment of abstract truths springs; and hence, again, it is
not wearisome—a quality which, to judge from the philosophical
writings of the last fifty years, one might regard as essential
to philosophy. If, on the other hand, all the doctrines of a
philosophy are merely deduced the one out of the other, and
ultimately indeed all out of one first principle, it must be poor
and meagre, and consequently wearisome, for nothing can follow
from a proposition except what it really already says itself.
Moreover, in this case everything depends upon the correctness
of one proposition, and by a single mistake in the deduction the
truth of the whole would be endangered. Still less security is
given by the systems which start from an intellectual intuition,
i.e., a kind of ecstasy or clairvoyance. All knowledge so obtained
must be rejected as subjective, individual, and consequently
problematical. Even if it actually existed it would not be
communicable, for only the normal knowledge of the brain is
communicable; if it is abstract, through conceptions and words;
if purely perceptible or concrete, through works of art.

If, as so often happens, metaphysics is reproached with having made so little progress, it ought also to be considered that no
other science has grown up like it under constant oppression,
none has been so hampered and hindered from without as it has
always been by the religion of every land, which, everywhere in
possession of a monopoly of metaphysical knowledge, regards
metaphysics as a weed growing beside it, as an unlicensed
worker, as a horde of gipsies, and as a rule tolerates it only under
the condition that it accommodates itself to serve and follow
it. For where has there ever been true freedom of thought?
It has been vaunted sufficiently; but whenever it wishes to go
further than perhaps to differ about the subordinate dogmas of
the religion of the country, a holy shudder seizes the prophets
of tolerance, and they say: “Not a step further!” What progress
of metaphysics was possible under such oppression? Nay,
this constraint which the privileged metaphysics exercises is
not confined to the communication of thoughts, but extends to
thinking itself, for its dogmas are so firmly imprinted in the
tender, plastic, trustful, and thoughtless age of childhood, with
studied solemnity and serious airs, that from that time forward
they grow with the brain, and almost assume the nature of innate
thoughts, which some philosophers have therefore really held
them to be, and still more have pretended to do so. Yet nothing
can so firmly resist the comprehension of even the problem of
metaphysics as a previous solution of it intruded upon and early
implanted in the mind. For the necessary starting-point for all
genuine philosophy is the deep feeling of the Socratic: “This one
thing I know, that I know nothing.” The ancients were in this
respect in a better position than we are, for their national religions
certainly limited somewhat the imparting of thoughts; but they
did not interfere with the freedom of thought itself, because they
were not formally and solemnly impressed upon children, and in
general were not taken so seriously. Therefore in metaphysics
the ancients are still our teachers.

Whenever metaphysics is reproached with its small progress, and with not having yet reached its goal in spite of such sustained
efforts, one ought further to consider that in the meanwhile it
has constantly performed the invaluable service of limiting the
boundless claims of the privileged metaphysics, and yet at the
same time combating naturalism and materialism proper, which
are called forth by it as an inevitable reaction. Consider to what a
pitch the arrogance of the priesthood of every religion would rise
if the belief in their doctrines was as firm and blind as they really
wish. Look back also at the wars, disturbances, rebellions, and
revolutions in Europe from the eighth to the eighteenth century;
how few will be found that have not had as their essence, or
their pretext, some controversy about beliefs, thus a metaphysical
problem, which became the occasion of exciting nations against
each other. Yet is that whole thousand years a continual slaughter,
now on the battlefield, now on the scaffold, now in the streets, in
metaphysical interests! I wish I had an authentic list of all crimes
which Christianity has really prevented, and all good deeds it has
really performed, that I might be able to place them in the other
scale of the balance.
Lastly, as regards the obligations of metaphysics, it has only
one; for it is one which endures no other beside it—the obligation
to be true. If one would impose other obligations upon it besides
this, such as to be spiritualistic, optimistic, monotheistic, or even
only to be moral, one cannot know beforehand whether this would
not interfere with the fulfilment of that first obligation, without
which all its other achievements must clearly be worthless. A
given philosophy has accordingly no other standard of its value
than that of truth. For the rest, philosophy is essentially world-
wisdom: its problem is the world. It has to do with this alone,
and leaves the gods in peace—expects, however, in return, to be
left in peace by them.
