This chapter is connected with § 20 of the first volume.455

Objectification is the self-exhibition in the real corporeal world. However, this world itself, as was fully shown in the first book and its supplements, is throughout conditioned by the knowing subject, thus by the intellect, and therefore as such is absolutely inconceivable outside the knowledge of this subject; for it primarily consists simply of ideas of perception, and as such is a phenomenon of the brain. After its removal the thing in itself would remain. That this is the will is the theme of the second book, and is there proved first of all in the human organism and in that of the brutes.

The knowledge of the external world may also be defined as the consciousness of other things, in opposition to self- consciousness. Since we have found in the latter that its true object or material is the will, we shall now, with the same intention, take into consideration the consciousness of other things, thus objective knowledge. Now here my thesis is this: that which in self-consciousness, thus subjectively is the intellect, presents itself in the consciousness of other things, thus objectively, as the brain; and that which in self-consciousness, thus subjectively, is the will, presents itself in the consciousness of other things, thus objectively, as the whole organism. To the evidence which is given in support of this proposition, both in our second book and in the first two chapters of the treatise “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” I add the following supplementary remarks and illustrations.

Nearly all that is necessary to establish the first part of this
thesis has already been brought forward in the preceding chapter,
for in the necessity of sleep, in the alterations that arise from age,
and in the differences of the anatomical conformation, it was proved that the intellect is of a secondary nature, and depends absolutely upon a single organ, the brain, whose function it is,
just as grasping is the function of the hand; that it is therefore
physical, like digestion, not metaphysical, like the will. As good
digestion requires a healthy, strong stomach, as athletic power
requires muscular sinewy arms, so extraordinary intelligence
requires an unusually developed, beautifully formed brain of
exquisitely fine texture and animated by a vigorous pulse. The
nature of the will, on the contrary, is dependent upon no organ,
and can be prognosticated from none. 

The greatest error in Gall's phrenology is that he assigns organs of the brain for moral qualities also. Injuries to the head, with loss of brain substance, affect the intellect as a rule very disadvantageously: they result in complete or partial imbecility or forgetfulness of language, permanent or temporary, yet sometimes only of one language out of several which were known, also in the loss of other knowledge possessed, &c., &c. On the other hand, we never read that after a misfortune of this kind the character has undergone a change, that the man has perhaps become morally worse or better, or has lost certain inclinations or passions, or assumed new ones; never. For the will has not its seat in the brain, and moreover, as that which is metaphysical, it is the prius of the brain, as of the whole body, and therefore cannot be altered by injuries of the brain.

According to an experiment made by Spallanzani and repeated
by Voltaire,35 a snail that has had its head cut off remains alive,
and after some weeks a new head grows on, together with horns;
with this consciousness and ideas again appear; while till then the
snail had only given evidence of blind will through unregulated
movements. Thus here also we find the will as the substance
which is permanent, the intellect, on the contrary, conditioned
by its organ, as the changing accident. It may be defined as the regulator of the will.
It was perhaps Tiedemann who first compared the cerebral
nervous system to a parasite (Tiedemann und Trevirann's Journal
für Physiologie, Bd. i. § 62). The comparison is happy; for the
brain, together with the spinal cord and nerves which depend upon
it, is, as it were, implanted in the organism, and is nourished
by it without on its part directly contributing anything to the
support of the economy of the organism; therefore there can be
life without a brain, as in the case of brainless abortions, and
also in the case of tortoises, which live for three weeks after their
heads have been cut off; only the medulla oblongata, as the organ
of respiration, must be spared. Indeed a hen whose whole brain
Flourens had cut away lived for ten months and grew. Even in the
case of men the destruction of the brain does not produce death
directly, but only through the medium of the lungs, and then of
the heart (Bichat, Sur la Vie et la Mort, Part ii., art. ii. § 1). On the
other hand, the brain controls the relations to the external world;
this alone is its office, and hereby it discharges its debt to the
organism which nourishes it, since its existence is conditioned
by the external relations. Accordingly the brain alone of all the
parts requires sleep, because its activity is completely distinct
from its support; the former only consumes both strength and
substance, the latter is performed by the rest of the organism
as the nurse of the brain: thus because its activity contributes
nothing to its continued existence it becomes exhausted, and only
when it pauses in sleep does its nourishment go on unhindered.
The second part of our thesis, stated above, will require a fuller
exposition even after all that I have said about it in the writings
referred to. I have shown above, in chapter 18, that the thing in
itself, which must lie at the foundation of every phenomenon,
and therefore of our own phenomenal existence also, throws
off in self-consciousness one of its phenomenal forms—space,
and only retains the other—time. On this account it presents
itself here more immediately than anywhere else, and we claim457
it as will, according to its most undisguised manifestation. But
no permanent substance, such as matter is, can present itself
in time alone, because, as § 4 of the first volume showed,
such a substance is only possible through the intimate union
of space and time. Therefore, in self-consciousness the will
is not apprehended as the enduring substratum of its impulses,
therefore is not perceived as a permanent substance; but only
its individual acts, such as purposes, wishes, and emotions, are
known successively and during the time they last, directly, yet not
perceptibly. The knowledge of the will in self-consciousness is
accordingly not a perception of it, but a perfectly direct becoming
aware of its successive impulses. On the other hand, for the
knowledge which is directed outwardly, brought about by the
senses and perfected in the understanding, which, besides time,
has also space for its form, which two it connects in the closest
manner by means of the function of the understanding, causality,
whereby it really becomes perception—this knowledge presents
to itself perceptibly what in inner immediate apprehension was
conceived as will, as organic body, whose particular movements
visibly present to us the acts, and whose parts and forms visibly
present to us the sustained efforts, the fundamental character,
of the individually given will, nay, whose pain and comfort are
perfectly immediate affections of this will itself.

We first become aware of this identity of the body with the
will in the individual actions of the two, for in these what is
known in self-consciousness as an immediate, real act of will,
at the same time and unseparated, exhibits itself outwardly as
movement of the body; and every one beholds the purposes of
his will, which are instantaneously brought about by motives
which just as instantaneously appear at once as faithfully copied
in as many actions of his body as his body itself is copied
in his shadow; and from this, for the unprejudiced man, the
knowledge arises in the simplest manner that his body is merely
the outward manifestation of his will, i.e., the way in which his will exhibits itself in his perceiving intellect, or his will itself
under the form of the idea. Only if we forcibly deprive ourselves
of this primary and simple information can we for a short time
marvel at the process of our own bodily action as a miracle,
which then rests on the fact that between the act of will and the
action of the body there is really no causal connection, for they
are directly identical, and their apparent difference only arises
from the circumstance that here what is one and the same is
apprehended in two different modes of knowledge, the outer and
the inner. Actual willing is, in fact, inseparable from doing and
in the strictest sense only that is an act of will which the deed sets
its seal to. Mere resolves of the will, on the contrary, till they are
carried out, are only intentions, and are therefore matter of the
intellect alone; as such they have their place merely in the brain,
and are nothing more than completed calculations of the relative
strength of the different opposing motives. They have, therefore,
certainly great probability, but no infallibility. They may turn out
false, not only through alteration of the circumstances, but also
from the fact that the estimation of the effect of the respective
motives upon the will itself was erroneous, which then shows
itself, for the deed is untrue to the purpose: therefore before it is
carried out no resolve is certain. The will itself, then, is operative
only in real action; hence in muscular action, and consequently
in irritability. Thus the will proper objectifies itself in this. The
cerebrum is the place of motives, where, through these, the
will becomes choice, i.e., becomes more definitely determined
by motives. 

These motives are ideas, which, on the occasion of
external stimuli of the organs of sense, arise by means of the
functions of the brain, and are also worked up into conceptions,
and then into resolves. When it comes to the real act of will these
motives, the workshop of which is the cerebrum, act through the
medium of the cerebellum upon the spinal cord and the motor
nerves which proceed from it, which then act upon the muscles,
yet merely as stimuli of their irritability; for galvanic, chemical,459
and even mechanical stimuli can effect the same contraction
which the motor nerve calls forth. Thus what was motive in the
brain acts, when it reaches the muscle through the nerves, as mere
stimulus. Sensibility in itself is quite unable to contract a muscle.
This can only be done by the muscle itself, and its capacity for
doing so is called irritability, i.e., susceptibility to stimuli. It is
exclusively a property of the muscle, as sensibility is exclusively
a property of the nerve. The latter indeed gives the muscle the
occasion for its contraction, but it is by no means it that, in some
mechanical way, draws the muscle together; but this happens
simply and solely on account of the irritability, which is a power
of the muscle itself. Apprehended from without this is a Qualitas
occulta, and only self-consciousness reveals it as the will. In the
causal chain here briefly set forth, from the effect of the motive
lying outside us to the contraction of the muscle, the will does
not in some way come in as the last link of the chain; but it
is the metaphysical substratum of the irritability of the muscle:
thus it plays here precisely the same part which in a physical or
chemical chain of causes is played by the mysterious forces of
nature which lie at the foundation of the process—forces which
as such are not themselves involved as links in the causal chain,
but impart to all the links of it the capacity to act, as I have fully
shown in § 26 of the first volume. Therefore we would ascribe
the contraction of the muscle also to a similar mysterious force
of nature, if it were not that this contraction is disclosed to us by
an entirely different source of knowledge—self-consciousness as
will. Hence, as was said above, if we start from the will our own
muscular movement appears to us a miracle; for indeed there is
a strict causal chain from the external motive to the muscular
action; but the will itself is not included as a link in it, but, as
the metaphysical substratum of the possibility of an action upon
the muscle through brain and nerve, lies at the foundation of the
present muscular action also; therefore the latter is not properly
its effect but its manifestation. 

As such it enters the world of idea, the form of which is the law of causality, a world which
is entirely different from the will in itself: and thus, if we start
from the will, this manifestation has, for attentive reflection, the
appearance of a miracle, but for deeper investigation it affords
the most direct authentication of the great truth that what appears
in the phenomenon as body and its action is in itself will. If now
perhaps the motor nerve that leads to my hand is severed, the will
can no longer move it. This, however, is not because the hand has
ceased to be, like every part of my body, the objectivity, the mere
visibility, of my will, or in other words, that the irritability has
vanished, but because the effect of the motive, in consequence
of which alone I can move my hand, cannot reach it and act on
its muscles as a stimulus, for the line of connection between it
and the brain is broken. Thus really my will is, in this part, only
deprived of the effect of the motive. The will objectifies itself
directly, in irritability, not in sensibility.
