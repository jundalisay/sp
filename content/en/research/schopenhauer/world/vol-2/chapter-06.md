The Doctrine of Abstract or Rational Knowledge.

The outward impression upon the senses, together with the mood
which it alone awakens in us, vanishes with the presence of
the thing. Therefore these two cannot of themselves constitute
experience proper, whose teaching is to guide our conduct for
the future. The image of that impression which the imagination
preserves is originally weaker than the impression itself, and
becomes weaker and weaker daily, until in time it disappears
altogether. There is only one thing which is not subject either to
the instantaneous vanishing of the impression or to the gradual
disappearance of its image, and is therefore free from the power
of time. This is the conception. In it, then, the teaching of
experience must be stored up, and it alone is suited to be a safe
guide to our steps in life. Therefore Seneca says rightly, “Si vis
tibi omnia subjicere, te subjice rationi” (Ep. 37). And I add
to this that the essential condition of surpassing others in actual
life is that we should reflect or deliberate. Such an important
tool of the intellect as the concept evidently cannot be identical
with the word, this mere sound, which as an impression of sense
passes with the moment, or as a phantasm of hearing dies away
with time. Yet the concept is an idea, the distinct consciousness
and preservation of which are bound up with the word. Hence
the Greeks called word, concept, relation, thought, and reason
by the name of the first, A »¿3¿Â. Yet the concept is perfectly
different both from the word, to which it is joined, and from
the perceptions, from which it has originated. It is of an entirely
different nature from these impressions of the senses. Yet it is
able to take up into itself all the results of perception, and give
them back again unchanged and undiminished after the longest
period of time; thus alone does experience arise. But the concept
preserves, not what is perceived nor what is then felt, but only
what is essential in these, in an entirely altered form, and yet231
as an adequate representative of them. Just as flowers cannot
be preserved, but their ethereal oil, their essence, with the same
smell and the same virtues, can be. The action that has been
guided by correct conceptions will, in the result, coincide with
the real object aimed at. We may judge of the inestimable value
of conceptions, and consequently of the reason, if we glance for
a moment at the infinite multitude and variety of the things and
conditions that coexist and succeed each other, and then consider
that speech and writing (the signs of conceptions) are capable
of affording us accurate information as to everything and every
relation when and wherever it may have been; for comparatively
few conceptions can contain and represent an infinite number
of things and conditions. In our own reflection abstraction is
a throwing off of useless baggage for the sake of more easily
handling the knowledge which is to be compared, and has
therefore to be turned about in all directions. We allow much that
is unessential, and therefore only confusing, to fall away from
the real things, and work with few but essential determinations
thought in the abstract. But just because general conceptions are
only formed by thinking away and leaving out existing qualities,
and are therefore the emptier the more general they are, the use of
this procedure is confined to the working up of knowledge which
we have already acquired. This working up includes the drawing
of conclusions from premisses contained in our knowledge. New
insight, on the contrary, can only be obtained by the help of the
faculty of judgment, from perception, which alone is complete
and rich knowledge. Further, because the content and the extent
of the concepts stand in inverse relation to each other, and thus
the more is thought under a concept, the less is thought in it,
concepts form a graduated series, a hierarchy, from the most
special to the most general, at the lower end of which scholastic
realism is almost right, and at the upper end nominalism. For the
most special conception is almost the individual, thus almost real;
and the most general conception, e.g., being (i.e., the infinitive
[236]232
[237]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of the copula), is scarcely anything but a word. Therefore
philosophical systems which confine themselves to such very
general conceptions, without going down to the real, are little
more than mere juggling with words. For since all abstraction
consists in thinking away, the further we push it the less we
have left over. Therefore, if I read those modern philosophemes
which move constantly in the widest abstractions, I am soon quite
unable, in spite of all attention, to think almost anything more
in connection with them; for I receive no material for thought,
but am supposed to work with mere empty shells, which gives
me a feeling like that which we experience when we try to throw
very light bodies; the strength and also the exertion are there,
but there is no object to receive them, so as to supply the other
moment of motion. If any one wants to experience this let him
read the writings of the disciples of Schelling, or still better of
the Hegelians. Simple conceptions would necessarily be such as
could not be broken up. Accordingly they could never be the
subject of an analytical judgment. This I hold to be impossible,
for if we think a conception we must also be able to give its
content. What are commonly adduced as examples of simple
conceptions are really not conceptions at all, but partly mere
sensations—as, for instance, those of some special colour; partly
the forms of perception which are known to us a priori, thus
properly the ultimate elements of perceptive knowledge. But this
itself is for the whole system of our thought what granite is for
geology, the ultimate firm basis which supports all, and beyond
which we cannot go. The distinctness of a conception demands
not only that we should be able to separate its predicates, but
also that we should be able to analyse these even if they are
abstractions, and so on until we reach knowledge of perception,
and thus refer to concrete things through the distinct perception
of which the final abstractions are verified and reality guaranteed
to them, as well as to all the higher abstractions which rest upon
them. Therefore the ordinary explanation that the conception is233
distinct as soon as we can give its predicates is not sufficient.
For the separating of these predicates may lead perhaps to
more conceptions; and so on again without there being that
ultimate basis of perceptions which imparts reality to all those
conceptions. Take, for example, the conception “spirit,” and
analyse it into its predicates: “A thinking, willing, immaterial,
simple, indestructible being that does not occupy space.” Nothing
is yet distinctly thought about it, because the elements of these
conceptions cannot be verified by means of perceptions, for a
thinking being without a brain is like a digesting being without
a stomach. Only perceptions are, properly speaking, clear, not
conceptions; these at the most can only be distinct. Hence also,
absurd as it was, “clear and confused” were coupled together
and used as synonymous when knowledge of perception was
explained as merely a confused abstract knowledge, because
the latter kind of knowledge alone was distinct. This was first
done by Duns Scotus, but Leibnitz has substantially the same
view, upon which his “Identitas Indiscernibilium” depends. (See
Kant's refutation of this, p. 275 of the first edition of the Critique
of Pure Reason.)
The close connection of the conception with the word, thus
of speech with reason, which was touched on above, rests
ultimately upon the following ground. Time is throughout the
form of our whole consciousness, with its inward and outward
apprehension. Conceptions, on the other hand, which originate
through abstraction and are perfectly general ideas, different
from all particular things, have in this property indeed a certain
measure of objective existence, which does not, however, belong
to any series of events in time. Therefore in order to enter
the immediate present of an individual consciousness, and thus
to admit of being introduced into a series of events in time,
they must to a certain extent be reduced again to the nature of
individual things, individualised, and therefore linked to an idea
of sense. Such an idea is the word. It is accordingly the sensible
[238]234
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
sign of the conception, and as such the necessary means of fixing
it, that is, of presenting it to the consciousness, which is bound
up with the form of time, and thus establishing a connection
between the reason, whose objects are merely general universals,
knowing neither place nor time, and consciousness, which is
bound up with time, is sensuous, and so far purely animal.
Only by this means is the reproduction at pleasure, thus the
recollection and preservation, of conceptions possible and open
to us; and only by means of this, again, are the operations which
are undertaken with conceptions possible—judgment, inference,
comparison, limitation, &c. It is true it sometimes happens that
conceptions occupy consciousness without their signs, as when
we run through a train of reasoning so rapidly that we could not
think the words in the time. But such cases are exceptions, which
presuppose great exercise of the reason, which it could only have
obtained by means of language. How much the use of reason is
bound up with speech we see in the case of the deaf and dumb,
who, if they have learnt no kind of language, show scarcely more
intelligence than the ourang-outang or the elephant. For their
reason is almost entirely potential, not actual.
[239]
Words and speech are thus the indispensable means of distinct
thought. But as every means, every machine, at once burdens
and hinders, so also does language; for it forces the fluid and
modifiable thoughts, with their infinitely fine distinctions of
difference, into certain rigid, permanent forms, and thus in fixing
also fetters them. This hindrance is to some extent got rid of by
learning several languages. For in these the thought is poured
from one mould into another, and somewhat alters its form in
each, so that it becomes more and more freed from all form and
clothing, and thus its own proper nature comes more distinctly
into consciousness, and it recovers again its original capacity
for modification. The ancient languages render this service very
much better than the modern, because, on account of their great
difference from the latter, the same thoughts are expressed in235
them in quite another way, and must thus assume a very different
form; besides which the more perfect grammar of the ancient
languages renders a more artistic and more perfect construction
of the thoughts and their connection possible. Thus a Greek or
a Roman might perhaps content himself with his own language,
but he who understands nothing but some single modern patois
will soon betray this poverty in writing and speaking; for his
thoughts, firmly bound to such narrow stereotyped forms, must
appear awkward and monotonous. Genius certainly makes up for
this as for everything else, for example in Shakespeare.
Burke, in his “Inquiry into the Sublime and Beautiful,” p.
5, § 4 and 5, has given a perfectly correct and very elaborate
exposition of what I laid down in § 9 of the first volume, that
the words of a speech are perfectly understood without calling
up ideas of perception, pictures in our heads. But he draws
from this the entirely false conclusion that we hear, apprehend,
and make use of words without connecting with them any idea
whatever; whereas he ought to have drawn the conclusion that
all ideas are not perceptible images, but that precisely those
ideas which must be expressed by means of words are abstract
notions or conceptions, and these from their very nature are not
perceptible. Just because words impart only general conceptions,
which are perfectly different from ideas of perception, when,
for example, an event is recounted all the hearers will receive
the same conceptions; but if afterwards they wish to make the
incident clear to themselves, each of them will call up in his
imagination a different image of it, which differs considerably
from the correct image that is possessed only by the eye-witness.
This is the primary reason (which, however, is accompanied by
others) why every fact is necessarily distorted by being repeatedly
told. The second recounter communicates conceptions which he
has abstracted from the image of his own imagination, and from
these conceptions the third now forms another image differing
still more widely from the truth, and this again he translates into
[240]236
[241]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
conceptions, and so the process goes on. Whoever is sufficiently
matter of fact to stick to the conceptions imparted to him, and
repeat them, will prove the most truthful reporter.
The best and most intelligent exposition of the essence and
nature of conceptions which I have been able to find is in Thomas
Reid's “Essays on the Powers of Human Mind,” vol. ii., Essay 5,
ch. 6. This was afterwards condemned by Dugald Stewart in his
“Philosophy of the Human Mind.” Not to waste paper I will only
briefly remark with regard to the latter that he belongs to that
large class who have obtained an undeserved reputation through
favour and friends, and therefore I can only advise that not an
hour should be wasted over the scribbling of this shallow writer.
The princely scholastic Pico de Mirandula already saw that
reason is the faculty of abstract ideas, and understanding
the faculty of ideas of perception. For in his book, “De
Imaginatione,” ch. 11, he carefully distinguishes understanding
and reason, and explains the latter as the discursive faculty
peculiar to man, and the former as the intuitive faculty, allied
to the kind of knowledge which is proper to the angels, and
indeed to God. Spinoza also characterises reason quite correctly
as the faculty of framing general conceptions (Eth., ii. prop.
40, schol. 2). Such facts would not need to be mentioned if
it were not for the tricks that have been played in the last fifty
years by the whole of the philosophasters of Germany with the
conception reason. For they have tried, with shameless audacity,
to smuggle in under this name an entirely spurious faculty of
immediate, metaphysical, so-called super-sensuous knowledge.
The reason proper, on the other hand, they call understanding,
and the understanding proper, as something quite strange to them,
they overlook altogether, and ascribe its intuitive functions to
sensibility.
In the case of all things in this world new drawbacks or
disadvantages cleave to every source of aid, to every gain, to
every advantage; and thus reason also, which gives to man237
such great advantages over the brutes, carries with it its special
disadvantages, and opens for him paths of error into which the
brutes can never stray. Through it a new species of motives, to
which the brute is not accessible, obtains power over his will.
These are the abstract motives, the mere thoughts, which are
by no means always drawn from his own experience, but often
come to him only through the talk and example of others, through
tradition and literature. Having become accessible to thought,
he is at once exposed to error. But every error must sooner or
later do harm, and the greater the error the greater the harm it
will do. The individual error must be atoned for by him who
cherishes it, and often he has to pay dearly for it. And the
same thing holds good on a large scale of the common errors
of whole nations. Therefore it cannot too often be repeated that
every error wherever we meet it, is to be pursued and rooted out
as an enemy of mankind, and that there can be no such thing
as privileged or sanctioned error. The thinker ought to attack
it, even if humanity should cry out with pain, like a sick man
whose ulcer the physician touches. The brute can never stray
far from the path of nature; for its motives lie only in the world
of perception, where only the possible, indeed only the actual,
finds room. On the other hand, all that is only imaginable, and
therefore also the false, the impossible, the absurd, and senseless,
enters into abstract conceptions, into thoughts and words. Since
now all partake of reason, but few of judgment, the consequence
is that man is exposed to delusion, for he is abandoned to every
conceivable chimera which any one talks him into, and which,
acting on his will as a motive, may influence him to perversities
and follies of every kind, to the most unheard-of extravagances,
and also to actions most contrary to his animal nature. True
culture, in which knowledge and judgment go hand in hand, can
only be brought to bear on a few; and still fewer are capable
of receiving it. For the great mass of men a kind of training
everywhere takes its place. It is effected by example, custom,
[242]238
[243]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
and the very early and firm impression of certain conceptions,
before any experience, understanding, or judgment were there to
disturb the work. Thus thoughts are implanted, which afterward
cling as firmly, and are as incapable of being shaken by any
instruction as if they were inborn; and indeed they have often
been regarded, even by philosophers, as such. In this way we
can, with the same trouble, imbue men with what is right and
rational, or with what is most absurd. 

For example, we can
accustom them to approach this or that idol with holy dread,
and at the mention of its name to prostrate in the dust not only
their bodies but their whole spirit; to sacrifice their property and
their lives willingly to words, to names, to the defence of the
strangest whims; to attach arbitrarily the greatest honour or the
deepest disgrace to this or that, and to prize highly or disdain
everything accordingly with full inward conviction; to renounce
all animal food, as in Hindustan, or to devour still warm and
quivering pieces, cut from the living animal, as in Abyssinia;
to eat men, as in New Zealand, or to sacrifice their children to
Moloch; to castrate themselves, to fling themselves voluntarily
on the funeral piles of the dead—in a word, to do anything we
please. Hence the Crusades, the extravagances of fanatical sects;
hence Chiliasts and Flagellants, persecutions, autos da fe, and
all that is offered by the long register of human perversities.
Lest it should be thought that only the dark ages afford such
examples, I shall add a couple of more modern instances. In
the year 1818 there went from Würtemberg 7000 Chiliasts to
the neighbourhood of Ararat, because the new kingdom of God,
specially announced by Jung Stilling, was to appear there.17 Gall
relates that in his time a mother killed her child and roasted it
in order to cure her husband's rheumatism with its fat.18 The
tragical side of error lies in the practical, the comical is reserved
for the theoretical. 

For example, if we could firmly persuade Illgen's “Zeitschrift für Historische Theologie,” 1839, part i, p. 182.
Gall et Spurzheim, “Des Dispositions Innées,” 1811, p. 253.239
three men that the sun is not the cause of daylight, we might
hope to see it soon established as the general conviction. In
Germany it was possible to proclaim as the greatest philosopher
of all ages Hegel, a repulsive, mindless charlatan, an unparalleled
scribbler of nonsense, and for twenty years many thousands have
believed it stubbornly and firmly; and indeed, outside Germany,
the Danish Academy entered the lists against myself for his
fame, and sought to have him regarded as a summus philosophus.
(Upon this see the preface to my Grundproblemen der Ethik.)
These, then, are the disadvantages which, on account of the rarity
of judgment, attach to the existence of reason. We must add
to them the possibility of madness. The brutes do not go mad,
although the carnivora are subject to fury, and the ruminants to a
sort of delirium.
