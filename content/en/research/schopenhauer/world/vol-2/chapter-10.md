Although it is very hard to establish a new and correct view
of a subject which for more than two thousand years has been
handled by innumerable writers, and which, moreover, does not
receive additions through the growth of experience, yet this must
not deter me from presenting to the thinker for examination the
following attempt of this kind.

An inference is that operation of our reason by virtue of which,
through the comparison of two judgments a third judgment arises,
without the assistance of any knowledge otherwise obtained. The
condition of this is that these two judgments have one conception
in common, for otherwise they are foreign to each other and have
no community. But under this condition they become the father
and mother of a child that contains in itself something of both.
Moreover, this operation is no arbitrary act, but an act of the
reason, which, when it has considered such judgments, performs
it of itself according to its own laws. So far it is objective, not
subjective, and therefore subject to the strictest rules.
We may ask in passing whether he who draws an inference
really learns something new from the new proposition, something
previously unknown to him? Not absolutely; but yet to a certain
extent he does. What he learns lay in what he knew: thus he
knew it also, but he did not know that he knew it; which is as if
he had something, but did not know that he had it, and this is
just the same as if he had it not. He knew it only implicite, now
he knows it explicite; but this distinction may be so great that the
conclusion appears to him a new truth. For example:
All diamonds are stones;
All diamonds are combustible:
Therefore some stones are combustible.
[293]286

The nature of inference consequently consists in this, that we
bring it to distinct consciousness that we have already thought in
the premisses what is asserted in the conclusion. It is therefore
a means of becoming more distinctly conscious of one's own
knowledge, of learning more fully, or becoming aware of what
one knows. The knowledge which is afforded by the conclusion
was latent, and therefore had just as little effect as latent heat
has on the thermometer. Whoever has salt has also chlorine;
but it is as if he had it not, for it can only act as chlorine if it
is chemically evolved; thus only, then, does he really possess
it. It is the same with the gain which a mere conclusion from
already known premisses affords: a previously bound or latent
knowledge is thereby set free. These comparisons may indeed
seem to be somewhat strained, but yet they really are not. For
because we draw many of the possible inferences from our
knowledge very soon, very rapidly, and without formality, and
therefore have no distinct recollection of them, it seems to us as
if no premisses for possible conclusions remained long stored up
unused, but as if we already had also conclusions prepared for
all the premisses within reach of our knowledge. But this is not
always the case; on the contrary, two premisses may have for a
long time an isolated existence in the same mind, till at last some
occasion brings them together, and then the conclusion suddenly
appears, as the spark comes from the steel and the stone only
when they are struck together. In reality the premisses assumed
from without, both for theoretical insight and for motives, which
bring about resolves, often lie for a long time in us, and become,
partly through half-conscious, and even inarticulate, processes
of thought, compared with the rest of our stock of knowledge,
reflected upon, and, as it were, shaken up together, till at last the
right major finds the right minor, and these immediately take up
their proper places, and at once the conclusion exists as a light
that has suddenly arisen for us, without any action on our part,
as if it were an inspiration; for we cannot comprehend how weChapter X. On The Syllogism.

and others have so long been in ignorance of it. It is true that
in a happily organised mind this process goes on more quickly
and easily than in ordinary minds; and just because it is carried
on spontaneously and without distinct consciousness it cannot be
learned. Therefore Goethe says: “How easy anything is he knows
who has discovered it, he knows who has attained to it.” As an
illustration of the process of thought here described we may
compare it to those padlocks which consist of rings with letters;
hanging on the box of a travelling carriage, they are shaken so
long that at last the letters of the word come together in their
order and the lock opens. For the rest, we must also remember
that the syllogism consists in the process of thought itself, and
the words and propositions through which it is expressed only
indicate the traces it has left behind it—they are related to it as the
sound-figures of sand are related to the notes whose vibrations
they express. When we reflect upon something, we collect our
data, reduce them to judgments, which are all quickly brought
together and compared, and thereby the conclusions which it is
possible to draw from them are instantly arrived at by means of
the use of all the three syllogistic figures. Yet on account of
the great rapidity of this operation only a few words are used,
and sometimes none at all, and only the conclusion is formally
expressed. Thus it sometimes happens that because in this way,
or even merely intuitively, i.e., by a happy apperçu, we have
brought some new truth to consciousness, we now treat it as a
conclusion and seek premisses for it, that is, we desire to prove
it, for as a rule knowledge exists earlier than its proofs. We then
go through our stock of knowledge in order to see whether we
can find some truth in it in which the newly discovered truth was
already implicitly contained, or two propositions which would
give this as a result if they were brought together according to
rule. On the other hand, every judicial proceeding affords a most
complete and imposing syllogism, a syllogism in the first figure.
The civil or criminal transgression complained of is the minor; it
[295]288
[296]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
is established by the prosecutor. The law applicable to the case
is the major. The judgment is the conclusion, which therefore, as
something necessary, is “merely recognised” by the judge.
But now I shall attempt to give the simplest and most correct
exposition of the peculiar mechanism of inference.
Judging, this elementary and most important process of
thought, consists in the comparison of two conceptions; inference
in the comparison of two judgments. Yet ordinarily in text-books
inference is also referred to the comparison of conceptions,
though of three, because from the relation which two of these
conceptions have to a third their relation to each other may
be known. Truth cannot be denied to this view also; and
since it affords opportunity for the perceptible demonstration
of syllogistic relations by means of drawn concept-spheres, a
method approved of by me in the text, it has the advantage of
making the matter easily comprehensible. But it seems to me that
here, as in so many cases, comprehensibility is attained at the cost
of thoroughness. The real process of thought in inference, with
which the three syllogistic figures and their necessity precisely
agree, is not thus recognised. In inference we operate not with
mere conceptions but with whole judgments, to which quality,
which lies only in the copula and not in the conceptions, and
also quantity are absolutely essential, and indeed we have further
to add modality. That exposition of inference as a relation
of three conceptions fails in this, that it at once resolves the
judgments into their ultimate elements (the conceptions), and
thus the means of combining these is lost, and that which is
peculiar to the judgments as such and in their completeness,
which is just what constitutes the necessity of the conclusion
which follows from them, is lost sight of. It thus falls into an
error analogous to that which organic chemistry would commit
if, for example, in the analysis of plants it were at once to
reduce them to their ultimate elements, when it would find in
all plants carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but would lose theChapter X. On The Syllogism.

specific differences, to obtain which it is necessary to stop at
their more special elements, the so-called alkaloids, and to take
care to analyse these in their turn. From three given conceptions
no conclusion can as yet be drawn. It may certainly be said: the
relation of two of them to the third must be given with them.
But it is just the judgments which combine these conceptions,
that are the expression of this relation; thus judgments, not mere
conceptions, are the material of the inference. Accordingly
inference is essentially a comparison of two judgments. The
process of thought in our mind is concerned with these and the
thoughts expressed by them, not merely with three conceptions.
This is the case even when this process is imperfectly or not at
all expressed in words; and it is as such, as a bringing together of
the complete and unanalysed judgments, that we must consider
it in order properly to understand the technical procedure of
inference. From this there will then also follow the necessity for
three really rational syllogistic figures.
As in the exposition of syllogistic reasoning by means of
concept-spheres these are presented to the mind under the form
of circles, so in the exposition by means of entire judgments
we have to think these under the form of rods, which, for the
purpose of comparison, are held together now by one end, now
by the other. The different ways in which this can take place give
the three figures. Since now every premiss contains its subject
and its predicate, these two conceptions are to be imagined as
situated at the two ends of each rod. The two judgments are
now compared with reference to the two different conceptions in
them; for, as has already been said, the third conception must be
the same in both, and is therefore subject to no comparison, but
is that with which, that is, in reference to which, the other two
are compared; it is the middle. The latter is accordingly always
only the means and not the chief concern. The two different
conceptions, on the other hand, are the subject of reflection, and
to find out their relation to each other by means of the judgments
[297]290
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
in which they are contained is the aim of the syllogism. Therefore
the conclusion speaks only of them, not of the middle, which
was only a means, a measuring rod, which we let fall as soon as
it has served its end. Now if this conception which is identical in
both propositions, thus the middle, is the subject of one premiss,
the conception to be compared with it must be the predicate, and
conversely. Here at once is established a priori the possibility
of three cases; either the subject of one premiss is compared
with the predicate of the other, or the subject of the one with the
subject of the other, or, finally, the predicate of the one with the
predicate of the other. Hence arise the three syllogistic figures of
Aristotle; the fourth, which was added somewhat impertinently,
is ungenuine and a spurious form. It is attributed to Galenus, but
this rests only on Arabian authority. Each of the three figures
exhibits a perfectly different, correct, and natural thought-process
of the reason in inference.
[298]
If in the two judgments to be compared the relation between
the predicate of the one and the subject of the other is the object
of the comparison, the first figure appears. This figure alone has
the advantage that the conceptions which in the conclusion are
subject and predicate both appear already in the same character
in the premisses; while in the two other figures one of them must
always change its roll in the conclusion. But thus in the first
figure the result is always less novel and surprising than in the
other two. Now this advantage in the first figure is obtained
by the fact that the predicate of the major is compared with the
subject of the minor, but not conversely, which is therefore here
essential, and involves that the middle should assume both the
positions, i.e., it is the subject in the major and the predicate in the
minor. And from this again arises its subordinate significance,
for it appears as a mere weight which we lay at pleasure now in
one scale and now in the other. The course of thought in this
figure is, that the predicate of the major is attributed to the subject
of the minor, because the subject of the major is the predicateChapter X. On The Syllogism.
291
of the minor, or, in the negative case, the converse holds for
the same reason. Thus here a property is attributed to the things
thought through a conception, because it depends upon another
property which we already know they possess; or conversely.
Therefore here the guiding principle is: Nota notæ est nota rei
ipsius, et repugnans notæ repugnat rei ipsi.
If, on the other hand, we compare two judgments with the
intention of bringing out the relation which the subjects of both
may have to each other, we must take as the common measure
their predicate. This will accordingly be here the middle, and
must therefore be the same in both judgments. Hence arises the
second figure. In it the relation of two subjects to each other is
determined by that which they have as their common predicate.
But this relation can only have significance if the same predicate
is attributed to the one subject and denied of the other, for thus it
becomes an essential ground of distinction between the two. For
if it were attributed to both the subjects this could decide nothing
as to their relation to each other, for almost every predicate
belongs to innumerable subjects. Still less would it decide this
relation if the predicate were denied of both the subjects. From
this follows the fundamental characteristic of the second figure,
that the premisses must be of opposite quality; the one must
affirm and the other deny. Therefore here the principal rule is:
Sit altera negans; the corollary of which is: E meris affirmativis
nihil sequitur; a rule which is sometimes transgressed in a loose
argument obscured by many parenthetical propositions. The
course of thought which this figure exhibits distinctly appears
from what has been said. It is the investigation of two kinds of
things with the view of distinguishing them, thus of establishing
that they are not of the same species; which is here decided by
showing that a certain property is essential to the one kind, which
the other lacks. That this course of thought assumes the second
figure of its own accord, and expresses itself clearly only in it,
will be shown by an example:
[299]292
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
All fishes have cold blood;
No whale has cold blood:
Thus no whale is a fish.
In the first figure, on the other hand, this thought exhibits itself
in a weak, forced, and ultimately patched-up form:
Nothing that has cold blood is a whale;
All fishes have cold blood:
Thus no fish is a whale,
And consequently no whale is a fish.
Take also an example with an affirmative minor:
No Mohamedan is a Jew;
Some Turks are Jews:
Therefore some Turks are not Mohamedans.
[300]
As the guiding principle for this figure I therefore give, for
the mood with the negative minor: Cui repugnat nota, etiam
repugnat notatum; and for the mood with the affirmative minor:
Notato repugnat id cui nota repugnat. Translated these may be
thus combined: Two subjects which stand in opposite relations
to one predicate have a negative relation to each other.
The third case is that in which we place two judgments
together in order to investigate the relation of their predicates.
Hence arises the third figure, in which accordingly the middle
appears in both premisses as the subject. It is also here the
tertium comparationis, the measure which is applied to both
the conceptions which are to be investigated, or, as it were, a
chemical reagent, with which we test them both in order to learn
from their relation to it what relation exists between themselves.
Thus, then, the conclusion declares whether a relation of subject
and predicate exists between the two, and to what extent this is the
case. Accordingly, what exhibits itself in this figure is reflectionChapter X. On The Syllogism.
293
concerning two properties which we are inclined to regard either
as incompatible, or else as inseparable, and in order to decide
this we attempt to make them the predicates of one subject in
two judgments. From this it results either that both properties
belong to the same thing, consequently their compatibility, or
else that a thing has the one but not the other, consequently their
separableness. The former in all moods with two affirmative
premisses, the latter in all moods with one negative; for example:
Some brutes can speak;
All brutes are irrational:
Therefore some irrational beings can speak.
According to Kant (Die Falsche Spitzfinigkeit, § 4) this
inference would only be conclusive if we added in thought:
“Therefore some irrational beings are brutes.” But this seems to
be here quite superfluous and by no means the natural process of
thought. But in order to carry out the same process of thought
directly by means of the first figure I must say:
“All brutes are irrational;
Some beings that can speak are brutes,”
which is clearly not the natural course of thought; indeed
the conclusion which would then follow, “Some beings that can
speak are irrational,” would have to be converted in order to
preserve the conclusion which the third figure gives of itself,
and at which the whole course of thought has aimed. Let us take
another example:
All alkalis float in water;
All alkalis are metals:
Therefore some metals float in water.
[301]294
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Figure 1
Figure 2
When this is transposed into the first figure the minor must be
converted, and thus runs: “Some metals are alkalis.” It therefore
merely asserts that some metals lie in the sphere “alkalis,” thus
[Figure 1], while our actual knowledge is that all alkalis lie in
the sphere “metals,” thus [Figure 2]: It follows that if the first
figure is to be regarded as the only normal one, in order to think
naturally we would have to think less than we know, and to think
indefinitely while we know definitely. This assumption has too
much against it. Thus in general it must be denied that when we
draw inferences in the second and third figures we tacitly convert
a proposition. On the contrary, the third, and also the second,
figure exhibits just as rational a process of thought as the first.
Let us now consider another example of the other class of the
third figure, in which the separableness of two predicates is the
result; on account of which one premiss must here be negative:
No Buddhist believes in a God;
Some Buddhists are rational:
Therefore some rational beings do not believe in a God.Chapter X. On The Syllogism.
295
As in the examples given above the compatibility of two
properties is the problem of reflection, now their separableness
is its problem, which here also must be decided by comparing
them with one subject and showing that one of them is present
in it without the other. Thus the end is directly attained, while
by means of the first figure it could only be attained indirectly.
For in order to reduce the syllogism to the first figure we must
convert the minor, and therefore say: “Some rational beings
are Buddhists,” which would be only a faulty expression of its
meaning, which really is: “Some Buddhists are yet certainly
rational.”
As the guiding principle of this figure I therefore give: for
the affirmative moods: Ejusdem rei notœ, modo sit altera
universalis, sibi invicem sunt notœ particulares; and for the
negative moods: Nota rei competens, notœ eidem repugnanti,
particulariter repugnat, modo sit altera universalis. Translated:
If two predicates are affirmed of one subject, and at least one of
them universally, they are also affirmed of each other particularly;
and, on the contrary, they are denied of each other particularly
whenever one of them contradicts the subject of which the other
is affirmed; provided always that either the contradiction or the
affirmation be universal.
In the fourth figure the subject of the major has to be compared
with the predicate of the minor; but in the conclusion they must
both exchange their value and position, so that what was the
subject of the major appears as the predicate of the conclusion,
and what was the predicate of the minor appears as the subject
of the conclusion. By this it becomes apparent that this figure is
merely the first, wilfully turned upside down, and by no means
the expression of a real process of thought natural to the reason.
On the other hand, the first three figures are the ectypes of
three real and essentially different operations of thought. They
have this in common, that they consist in the comparison of two
judgments; but such a comparison only becomes fruitful when
[302]296
[303]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
these judgments have one conception in common. If we present
the premisses to our imagination under the sensible form of two
rods, we can think of this conception as a clasp that links them
to each other; indeed in lecturing one might provide oneself with
such rods. On the other hand, the three figures are distinguished
by this, that those judgments are compared either with reference
to the subjects of both, or to the predicates of both, or lastly,
with reference to the subject of the one and the predicate of the
other. Since now every conception has the property of being
subject or predicate only because it is already part of a judgment,
this confirms my view that in the syllogism only judgments are
primarily compared, and conceptions only because they are parts
of judgments. In the comparison of two judgments, however,
the essential question is, in respect of what are they compared?
not by what means are they compared? The former consists of
the concepts which are different in the two judgments; the latter
consists of the middle, that is, the conception which is identical
in both. It is therefore not the right point of view which Lambert,
and indeed really Aristotle, and almost all the moderns have
taken in starting from the middle in the analysis of syllogisms,
and making it the principal matter and its position the essential
characteristic of the syllogisms. On the contrary, its role is
only secondary, and its position a consequence of the logical
value of the conceptions which are really to be compared in the
syllogism. These may be compared to two substances which are
to be chemically tested, and the middle to the reagent by which
they are tested. It therefore always takes the place which the
conceptions to be compared leave vacant, and does not appear
again in the conclusion. It is selected according to our knowledge
of its relation to both the conceptions and its suitableness for the
place it has to take up. Therefore in many cases we can change
it at pleasure for another without affecting the syllogism. For
example, in the syllogism:Chapter X. On The Syllogism.
297
All men are mortal;
Caius is a man:
[304]
I can exchange the middle “man” for “animal existence.” In
the syllogism:
All diamonds are stones;
All diamonds are combustible:
I can exchange the middle “diamond” for “anthracite.” As
an external mark by which we can recognise at once the figure
of a syllogism the middle is certainly very useful. But as the
fundamental characteristic of a thing which is to be explained,
we must take what is essential to it; and what is essential here is,
whether we place two propositions together in order to compare
their predicates or their subjects, or the predicate of the one and
the subject of the other.
Therefore, in order as premisses to yield a conclusion, two
judgments must have a conception in common; further, they
must not both be negative, nor both particular; and lastly, in the
case in which the conceptions to be compared are the subjects of
both, they must not both be affirmative.
The voltaic pile may be regarded as a sensible image of the
syllogism. Its point of indifference, at the centre, represents the
middle, which holds together the two premisses, and by virtue
of which they have the power of yielding a conclusion. The two
different conceptions, on the other hand, which are really what
is to be compared, are represented by the two opposite poles of
the pile. Only because these are brought together by means of
their two conducting wires, which represent the copulas of the
two judgments, is the spark emitted upon their contact—the new
light of the conclusion.
