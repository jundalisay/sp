My doctrine asserts that the whole body is the will itself, exhibiting itself in the perception of the brain.

<!-- Consequently, having entered into its forms of knowledge. -->

From this it follows that the will is everywhere equally present in the whole body, as is also demonstrably the case, for the organic functions are its work no less than the animal. 

But how, then, can we reconcile it with this, that the voluntary actions, those most undeniable expressions of the will, clearly originate in the brain, and thus only through the spinal cord reach the nerve fibres, which finally set the limbs in motion, and the paralysis or severing of which therefore prevents the possibility of voluntary movement? This would lead one to think that the will, like the intellect, has its seat only in the brain, and, like it, is a mere function of the brain.

Yet this is not the case.

The whole body is and remains the exhibition of the will in perception, thus the will itself objectively perceived by means of the functions of the brain.

That process, however, in the case of the acts of will, depends upon the fact that the will, which, according to my doctrine, expresses itself in every phenomenon of nature, even in vegetable and inorganic phenomena, appears in the bodies of men and animals as a conscious will.

A consciousness, however, is essentially a unity, and therefore always requires a central point of unity. The necessity of consciousness is, as I have often explained, occasioned by the fact that in consequence of the increased complication, and thereby more multifarious wants, of an organism, the acts of its will must be guided by motives, no longer, as in the lower grades, by mere stimuli. For this purpose it had at this stage to appear provided with a knowing consciousness, thus with an intellect, as the medium and place of the motives.

This intellect, if itself objectively perceived, exhibits itself as the brain, together with its appendages, spinal cord, and nerves. It is the brain now in which, on the occasion of external impressions, the ideas arise which become motives for the will. But in the rational intellect they undergo besides this a still further working up, through reflection and deliberation. 

Thus such an intellect must first of all unite in one point all impressions, together with the working up of them by its functions, whether to mere perception or to conceptions, a point which will be, as it were, the focus of all its rays, in order that that unity of consciousness may arise which is the the theoretical ego, the supporter of the whole consciousness, in which it presents itself as identical with the willing ego, whose mere function of knowledge it is.

That point of unity of consciousness, or the
theoretical ego, is just Kant's synthetic unity of apperception,
upon which all ideas string themselves as on a string of pearls,
and on account of which the “I think,” as the thread of the
string of pearls, “must be capable of accompanying all our ideas.”36 

This assembling-place of the motives, then, where their entrance into the single focus of consciousness takes place, is the brain. Here, in the non-rational consciousness, they are merely perceived; in the rational consciousness they are elucidated by conceptions, thus are first thought in the abstract and compared; upon which the will chooses, in accordance with its individual and immutable character, and so the purpose results which now, by means of the cerebellum, the spinal cord, and the nerves, sets the outward limbs in motion.

For although the will is quite directly present in these, inasmuch as they are merely its manifestation, yet when it has to move according to motives, or indeed according to reflection, it requires such an apparatus for the apprehension and working up of ideas into such motives, in conformity with which its acts here appear as resolves: just as the nourishment of the blood with chyle requires a stomach and intestines, in which this is prepared, and then as such is poured into the blood through the ductus thoracicus, which here plays the part which the spinal cord plays in the former case.

The matter may be most simply and generally comprehended thus: the will is immediately present as irritability in all the muscular fibres of the whole body, as a continual striving after activity in general.

Now if this striving is to realise itself, thus to manifest
itself as movement, this movement must as such have some
direction; but this direction must be determined by something,
i.e., it requires a guide, and this is the nervous system. For to
the mere irritability, as it lies in the muscular fibres and in itself
is pure will, all directions are alike; thus it determines itself in
no direction, but behaves like a body which is equally drawn
in all directions; it remains at rest. Since the activity of the
nerves comes in as motive (in the case of reflex movements as
a stimulus), the striving force, i.e., the irritability, receives a
definite direction, and now produces the movements. 

Yet those external acts of will which require no motives, and thus also no
working up of mere stimuli into ideas in the brain, from which
motives arise, but which follow immediately upon stimuli, for
the most part inward stimuli, are the reflex movements, starting
only from the spinal cord, as, for example, spasms and cramp, in
which the will acts without the brain taking part. In an analogous
manner the will carries on the organic life, also by nerve stimulus,
which does not proceed from the brain. 

Thus the will appears
in every muscle as irritability, and is consequently of itself in a
position to contract them, yet only in general; in order that some
definite contraction should take place at a given moment, there
is required here, as everywhere, a cause, which in this case must
be a stimulus. This is everywhere given by the nerve which goes
into the muscle. If this nerve is in connection with the brain,
then the contraction is a conscious act of will, i.e., takes place
in accordance with motives, which, in consequence of external
impressions, have arisen as ideas in the brain. If the nerve
is not in connection with the brain, but with the sympathicus
maximus, then the contraction is involuntary and unconscious,
an act connected with the maintenance of the organic life, and
the nerve stimulus which causes it is occasioned by inward
impressions; for example, by the pressure upon the stomach of
the food received, or of the chyme upon the intestines, or of the
in-flowing blood upon the walls of the heart, in accordance with
which the act is digestion, or motus peristalticus, or beating of
the heart, &c.

But if now, in this process, we go one step further, we find
that the muscles are the product of the blood, the result of its
work of condensation, nay, to a certain extent they are merely
solidified, or, as it were, clotted or crystallised blood; for they
have taken up into themselves, almost unaltered, its fibrin (cruor)
and its colouring matter (Burdach's Physiologie, Bd. v. § 686).

But the force which forms the muscle out of the blood must not
be assumed to be different from that which afterwards moves it as irritability, upon nerve stimulus, which the brain supplies; in which case it then presents itself in self-consciousness as that
which we call will. The close connection between the blood
and irritability is also shown by this, that where, on account of
imperfection of the lesser circulation, part of the blood returns to
the heart unoxidised, the irritability is also uncommonly weak,
as in the batrachia. Moreover, the movement of the blood,
like that of the muscle, is independent and original; it does
not, like irritation, require the influence of the nerve, and is
even independent of the heart, as is shown most clearly by the
return of the blood through the veins to the heart; for here it is not
propelled by a vis a tergo, as in the case of the arterial circulation;
and all other mechanical explanations, such as a power of suction
of the right ventricle of the heart, are quite inadequate. 


The French recognise nothing but mechanical forces, controvert
each other with insufficient grounds upon both sides; and Bichat
ascribes the flowing back of the blood through the veins to the
pressure of the walls of the capillary tubes, and Magendie, on
the other hand, to the continue action of the impulse of the heart
(Précis de Physiologie par Magendie, vol. ii. p. 389). 

That the movement of the blood is also independent of the nervous
system, at least of the cerebral nervous system, is shown by the
fetus, which (according to Müller's Physiologie), without brain
and spinal cord, has yet circulation of the blood. And Flourens
also says: “Le mouvement du cœur, pris en soi, et abstraction
faite de tout ce qui n'est pas essentiellement lui, comme sa durée,
son énergie, ne dépend ni immédiatement, ni coinstantanément,
du système nerveux central, et conséquemment c'est dans tout
autre point de ce système que dans les centres nerveux eux-
mêmes, qu'il faut chercher le principe primitif et immédiat de
ce mouvement” (Annales des sciences naturelles p. Audouin et
Brougniard, 1828, vol. 13). Cuvier also says: “La circulation465
survit à la déstruction de tout l'encéphale et de toute la moëlle
épiniaire (Mém. de l'acad. d. sc., 1823, vol. 6; Hist. d. l'acad.
p. Cuvier,” p. cxxx). “Cor primum vivens et ultimum moriens,”
says Haller. The beating of the heart ceases at last in death. The
blood has made the vessels themselves; for it appears in the ovum
earlier than they do; they are only its path, voluntarily taken, then
beaten smooth, and finally gradually condensed and closed up;
as Kaspar Wolff has already taught: “Theorie der Generation,”
§ 30-35. 

The motion of the heart also, which is inseparable from that of the blood, although occasioned by the necessity of sending blood into the lungs, is yet an original motion, for it is independent of the nervous system and of sensibility, as Burdach fully shows. “In the heart,” he says, “appears, with the maximum of irritability, a minimum of sensibility” (loc. cit., § 769).

The heart belongs to the muscular system as well as to the blood or vascular system; from which, however, it is clear that the two are closely related, indeed constitute one whole. Since now the metaphysical substratum of the force which moves the muscle, thus of irritability, is the will, the will must also be the metaphysical substratum of the force which lies at the foundation of the movement and the formations of the blood, as that by which the muscles are produced. The course of the arteries also determines the form and size of all the limbs; consequently the whole form of the body is determined by the course of the blood. Thus in general the blood, as it nourishes all the parts of the body, has also, as the primary fluidity of the organism, produced and framed them out of itself.

The nourishment which confessedly constitutes the principal function of the blood is only the continuance of that original production of them. This truth will be found thoroughly and excellently explained in the work of Rösch referred to above: “Ueber die Bedeutung des Blutes,” 1839.

He shows that the blood is that which first has life and is the source both of the existence and of the maintenance of all the parts; that all the organs have sprung from it through secretion, and together with them, for the management of their functions, the nervous system, which appears now as plastic, ordering and arranging the life of the particular parts within, now as cerebral, controlling the relation to the external world. “The blood,” he says, p. 25, “was flesh and nerve at once, and at the same moment at which the muscle freed itself from it the nerve, severed in like manner, remained opposed to the flesh.” Here it is a matter of course that the blood, before those solid parts have been secreted from it, has also a somewhat different character from afterwards; it is then, as Rösch defines it, the chaotic, animated, slimy, primitive fluid, as it were an organic emulsion, in which all subsequent parts are implicite contained: moreover, it has not the red colour quite at the beginning. This disposes of the objection which might be drawn from the fact that the brain and the spinal cord begin to form before the circulation of the blood is visible or the heart appears.

In this reference also Schultz says (System der Circulation, § 297): “We do not believe that the view of Bakmgärten, according to which the nervous system is formed earlier than the blood, can consistently be carried out; for Bakmgärten reckons the appearance of the blood only from the formation of the corpuscles, while in the embryo and in the series of animals blood appears much earlier in the form of a pure plasma.” The blood of invertebrate animals never assumes the red colour; but we do not therefore, with Aristotle, deny that they have any.

Justinus Kerner, a clairvoyant somnambulist says:

“I am as deep in myself as ever a man can be led. The force of my mortal life seems to me to have its source in the blood, whereby, through the circulation in the veins, it communicates itself, by means of the nerves, to the whole body, and to the brain, which is the noblest part of the body, and above the blood itself.”

This means that the will objectifies itself most
immediately in the blood as that which originally makes and forms the organism, perfects it by growth, and afterwards constantly maintains it, both by the regular renewal of all the
parts and by the extraordinary restoration of any part that may
have been injured. 

The first productions of the blood are its own
vessels, and then the muscles, in the irritability of which the will
makes itself known to self-consciousness; but with this also the
heart, which is at once vessel and muscle, and therefore is the
true centre and primum mobile of the whole life. But for the
individual life and subsistence in the external world the will now
requires two assistant systems: one to govern and order its inner
and outer activity, and another for the constant renewal of the
mass of the blood; thus a controller and a sustainer. 

It therefore
makes for itself the nervous and the intestinal systems; thus
the functiones animales and the functiones naturales associate
themselves in a subsidiary manner with the functiones vitales,
which are the most original and essential. In the nervous system,
accordingly, the will only objectifies itself in an indirect and
secondary way; for this system appears as a mere auxiliary
organ, as a contrivance by means of which the will attains to
a knowledge of those occasions, internal and external, upon
which, in conformity with its aims, it must express itself; the
internal occasions are received by the plastic nervous system,
thus by the sympathetic nerve, this cerebrum abdominale, as
mere stimuli, and the will thereupon reacts on the spot without
the brain being conscious; the outward occasions are received
by the brain, as motives, and the will reacts through conscious
actions directed outwardly. Therefore the whole nervous system
constitutes, as it were, the antennæ of the will, which it stretches
towards within and without. The nerves of the brain and spinal
cord separate at their roots into sensory and motory nerves. 

The sensory nerves receive the knowledge from without, which now
accumulates in the thronging brain, and is there worked up into
ideas, which arise primarily as motives. But the motory nerves
bring back, like couriers, the result of the brain function to the muscle, upon which it acts as a stimulus, and the irritability of
which is the immediate manifestation of the will. Presumably
the plastic nerves also divide into sensory and motory, although
on a subordinate scale. The part which the ganglia play in the
organism we must think of as that of a diminutive brain, and thus
the one throws light upon the other. The ganglia lie wherever
the organic functions of the vegetative system require care. It is
as if there the will was not able by its direct and simple action
to carry out its aims, but required guidance, and consequently
control; just as when in some business a man's own memory is
not sufficient, and he must constantly take notes of what he does.

For this end mere knots of nerves are sufficient for the interior
of the organism, because everything goes on within its own
compass. For the exterior, on the other hand, a very complicated
contrivance of the same kind is required. This is the brain with
its feelers, which it stretches into the outer world, the nerves of
sense. 

But even in the organs which are in communication with
this great nerve centre, in very simple cases the matter does not
need to be brought before the highest authority, but a subordinate
one is sufficient to determine what is needed; such is the spinal
cord, in the reflex actions discovered by Marshall Hall, such
as sneezing, yawning, vomiting, the second half of swallowing,
&c. &c. The will itself is present in the whole organism,
since this is merely its visible form; the nervous system exists
everywhere merely for the purpose of making the direction of
an action possible by a control of it, as it were to serve the will
as a mirror, so that it may see what it does, just as we use a
mirror to shave by. Hence small sensoria arise within us for
special, and consequently simple, functions, the ganglia; but the
chief sensorium, the brain, is the great and skilfully contrived
apparatus for the complicated and multifarious functions which
have to do with the ceaselessly and irregularly changing external
world. Wherever in the organism the nerve threads run together
in a ganglion, there, to a certain extent, an animal exists for469
itself and shut off, which by means of the ganglion has a kind
of weak knowledge, the sphere of which is, however, limited
to the part from which these nerves directly come. 

But what
actuates these parts to such quasi knowledge is clearly the will;
indeed we are utterly unable to conceive it otherwise. Upon this
depends the vita propria of each part, and also in the case of
insects, which, instead of a spinal cord, have a double string of
nerves, with ganglia at regular intervals, the capacity of each
part to continue alive for days after being severed from the head
and the rest of the trunk; and finally also the actions which in
the last instance do not receive their motives from the brain,
i.e., instinct and natural mechanical skill. Marshall Hall, whose
discovery of the reflex movements I have mentioned above, has
given us in this the theory of involuntary movements. Some
of these are normal or physiological; such are the closing of
the places of ingress to and egress from the body, thus of the
sphincteres vesicæ et ani (proceeding from the nerves of the
spinal cord); the closing of the eyelids in sleep (from the fifth
pair of nerves), of the larynx (from N. vagus) if food passes
over it or carbonic acid tries to enter; also swallowing, from
the pharynx, yawning and sneezing, respiration, entirely in sleep
and partly when awake; and, lastly, the erection, ejaculation, as
also conception, and many more. Some, again, are abnormal and
pathological; such are stammering, hiccoughing, vomiting, also
cramps and convulsions of every kind, especially in epilepsy,
tetanus, in hydrophobia and otherwise; finally, the convulsive
movements produced by galvanic or other stimuli, and which
take place without feeling or consciousness in paralysed limbs,
i.e., in limbs which are out of connection with the brain, also
the convulsions of beheaded animals, and, lastly, all movements
and actions of children born without brains. All cramps are
a rebellion of the nerves of the limbs against the sovereignty
of the brain; the normal reflex movements, on the other hand,
are the legitimate autocracy of the subordinate officials. 

These movements are thus all involuntary, because they do not proceed
from the brain, and therefore do not take place in accordance
with motives, but follow upon mere stimuli. The stimuli which
occasion them extend only to the spinal cord or the medulla
oblongata, and from there the reaction directly takes place which
effects the movement. The spinal cord has the same relation
to these involuntary movements as the brain has to motive and
action, and what the sentient and voluntary nerve is for the latter
the incident and motor nerve is for the former. That yet, in
the one as in the other, that which really moves is the will is
brought all the more clearly to light because the involuntarily
moved muscles are for the most part the same which, under other
circumstances, are moved from the brain in the voluntary actions,
in which their primum mobile is intimately known to us through
self-consciousness as the will. Marshall Hall's excellent book
“On the Diseases of the Nervous System” is peculiarly fitted to
bring out clearly the difference between volition and will, and
to confirm the truth of my fundamental doctrine.
For the sake of illustrating all that has been said, let us now
call to mind that case of the origination of an organism which
is most accessible to our observation. Who makes the chicken
in the egg? Some power and skill coming from without, and
penetrating through the shell? Oh no! The chicken makes
itself, and the force which carries out and perfects this work,
which is complicated, well calculated, and designed beyond all
expression, breaks through the shell as soon as it is ready, and
now performs the outward actions of the chicken, under the
name of will. It cannot do both at once; previously occupied with
the perfecting of the organism, it had no care for without. But
after it has completed the former, the latter appears, under the
guidance of the brain and its feelers, the senses, as a tool prepared
beforehand for this end, the service of which only begins when it
grows up in self-consciousness as intellect, which is the lantern
to the steps of the will, its !3μ1⁄4¿1⁄21o¿1⁄2, and also the supporter471
of the objective external world, however limited the horizon of
this may be in the consciousness of a hen. But what the hen is
now able to do in the external world, through the medium of this
organ, is, as accomplished by means of something secondary,
infinitely less important than what it did in its original form, for
it made itself.
