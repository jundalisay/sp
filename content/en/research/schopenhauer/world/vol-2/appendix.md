<!-- C'est le privilège du vrai génie, et surtout du génie qui ouvre
une carrière,
de faire impunément de grandes fautes.—Voltaire. -->

It is much easier to point out the faults and errors in the work
of a great mind than to give a distinct and full exposition of its
value. For the faults are particular and finite, and can therefore
be fully comprehended; while, on the contrary, the very stamp
which genius impresses upon its works is that their excellence
is unfathomable and inexhaustible. Therefore they do not grow
old, but become the instructor of many succeeding centuries. The
perfected masterpiece of a truly great mind will always produce
a deep and powerful effect upon the whole human race, so much
so that it is impossible to calculate to what distant centuries and
lands its enlightening influence may extend. This is always the
case; for however cultivated and rich the age may be in which
such a masterpiece appears, genius always rises like a palm-tree
above the soil in which it is rooted.
But a deep-reaching and widespread effect of this kind cannot
take place suddenly, because of the great difference between the
genius and ordinary men. The knowledge which that one man
in one lifetime drew directly from life and the world, won and
presented to others as won and arranged, cannot yet at once
become the possession of mankind; for mankind has not so much
power to receive as the genius has power to give. But even after a
successful battle with unworthy opponents, who at its very birth contest the life of what is immortal and desire to nip in the bud the
salvation of man (like the serpents in the cradle of Hercules), that
knowledge must then traverse the circuitous paths of innumerable
false constructions and distorted applications, must overcome the
attempts to unite it with old errors, and so live in conflict till
a new and unprejudiced generation grows up to meet it. 

Little
by little, even in youth, this new generation partially receives
the contents of that spring through a thousand indirect channels,
gradually assimilates it, and so participates in the benefit which
was destined to flow to mankind from that great mind. So slowly
does the education of the human race, the weak yet refractory
pupil of genius, advance. Thus with Kant's teaching also; its
full strength and importance will only be revealed through time,
when the spirit of the age, itself gradually transformed and altered
in the most important and essential respects by the influence of
that teaching, will afford convincing evidence of the power of
that giant mind. I have, however, no intention of presumptuously
anticipating the spirit of the age and assuming here the thankless
rôle of Calchas and Cassandra. Only I must be allowed, in
accordance with what has been said, to regard Kant's works as
still very new, while many at the present day look upon them
as already antiquated, and indeed have laid them aside as done
with, or, as they express it, have left them behind; and others,
emboldened by this, ignore them altogether, and with brazen face
go on philosophising about God and the soul on the assumption
of the old realistic dogmatism and its scholastic teaching, which
is as if one sought to introduce the doctrines of the alchemists
into modern chemistry. For the rest, the works of Kant do not
stand in need of my feeble eulogy, but will themselves for ever
praise their author, and though perhaps not in the letter, yet in
the spirit they will live for ever upon earth.

Certainly, however, if we look back at the first result of his
teaching, at the efforts and events in the sphere of philosophy
during the period that has elapsed since he wrote, a very depressing saying of Goethe obtains confirmation: “As the water
that is displaced by a ship immediately flows in again behind it,
so when great minds have driven error aside and made room for
themselves, it very quickly closes in behind them again by the
law of its nature” (Wahrheit und Dichtung, Theil 3, s. 521). Yet
this period has been only an episode, which is to be reckoned
as part of the lot referred to above that befalls all new and great
knowledge; an episode which is now unmistakably near its end,
for the bubble so long blown out yet bursts at last. Men generally
are beginning to be conscious that true and serious philosophy
still stands where Kant left it. At any rate, I cannot see that
between Kant and myself anything has been done in philosophy;
therefore I regard myself as his immediate successor.

In this Appendix, I defend my doctrine which contradicts Kant.

I have a sincere reverence for Kant. 

Therefore in my polemic against Kant, I have only his mistakes and weak points in
view. 

I oppose them with hostility, and wage a relentless war of
extermination against them, always mindful not to conceal them
indulgently, but rather to place them in the clearest light, in order
to extirpate them the more surely. 

For the reasons given above, I
am not conscious either of injustice or ingratitude towards Kant
in doing this. However, in order that, in the eyes of others also,
I may remove every appearance of malice, I wish first to bring
out clearly my sincere reverence for Kant and gratitude to him,
by expressing shortly what in my eyes appears to be his chief
merit; and I shall do this from a standpoint so general that I shall
not require to touch upon the points in which I must afterwards
controvert him.

Kant's greatest merit is the distinction of the phenomenon from the thing in itself, based upon the proof that between things
and us there still always stands the intellect, so that they cannot
be known as they may be in themselves. He was led into
this path through Locke (see Prolegomena zu jeder Metaph.,
§ 13, Anm. 2). The latter had shown that the secondary
qualities of things, such as sound, smell, colour, hardness,
softness, smoothness, and the like, as founded on the affections of the senses, do not belong to the objective body, to the
thing in itself. To this he attributed only the primary qualities,
i.e., such as only presuppose space and impenetrability; thus
extension, figure, solidity, number, mobility. 

But this easily
discovered Lockeian distinction was, as it were, only a youthful
introduction to the distinction of Kant. The latter, starting from
an incomparably higher standpoint, explains all that Locke had
accepted as primary qualities, i.e., qualities of the thing in itself,
as also belonging only to its phenomenal appearance in our
faculty of apprehension, and this just because the conditions of
this faculty, space, time, and causality, are known by us a priori.
Thus Locke had abstracted from the thing in itself the share
which the organs of sense have in its phenomenal appearance;
Kant, however, further abstracted the share of the brain-functions
(though not under that name). Thus the distinction between the
phenomenon and the thing in itself now received an infinitely
greater significance, and a very much deeper meaning. For this
end he was obliged to take in hand the important separation
of our a priori from our a posteriori knowledge, which before
him had never been carried out with adequate strictness and
completeness, nor with distinct consciousness. Accordingly this
now became the principal subject of his profound investigations.
Now here we would at once remark that Kant's philosophy has
a threefold relation to that of his predecessors. First, as we have
just seen, to the philosophy of Locke, confirming and extending
it; secondly, to that of Hume, correcting and making use of it, a
relation which is most distinctly expressed in the “Prolegomena”
(that most beautiful and comprehensible of all Kant's important
writings, which is far too little read, for it facilitates immensely
the study of his philosophy); thirdly, a decidedly polemical and
destructive relation to the Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy. 

All 3 systems ought to be known before one proceeds to the study
of the Kantian philosophy. If now, according to the above, the
distinction of the phenomenon from the thing in itself, thus the doctrine of the complete diversity of the ideal and the real, is the
fundamental characteristic of the Kantian philosophy, then the
assertion of the absolute identity of these two which appeared
soon afterwards is a sad proof of the saying of Goethe quoted
above; all the more so as it rested upon nothing but the empty
boast of intellectual intuition, and accordingly was only a return
to the crudeness of the vulgar opinion, masked under bombast and
nonsense, and the imposing impression of an air of importance.

It became the fitting starting-point for the still grosser nonsense
of the clumsy and stupid Hegel. Now as Kant's separation of the
phenomenon from the thing in itself, arrived at in the manner
explained above, far surpassed all that preceded it in the depth
and thoughtfulness of its conception, it was also exceedingly
important in its results. For in it he propounded, quite originally,
in a perfectly new way, found from a new side and on a new
path, the same truth which Plato never wearies of repeating,
and in his language generally expresses thus: This world which
appears to the senses has no true being, but only a ceaseless
becoming; it is, and it is not, and its comprehension is not so
much knowledge as illusion. This is also what he expresses
mythically at the beginning of the seventh book of the Republic,
the most important passage in all his writings, which has already
been referred to in the third book of the present work. He says:
Men, firmly chained in a dark cave, see neither the true original
light nor real things, but only the meagre light of the fire in
the cave and the shadows of real things which pass by the fire
behind their backs; yet they think the shadows are the reality,
and the determining of the succession of these shadows is true
wisdom. The same truth, again quite differently presented, is
also a leading doctrine of the Vedas and Puranas, the doctrine of
Mâyâ, by which really nothing else is understood than what Kant
calls the phenomenon in opposition to the thing in itself; for the
work of Mâyâ is said to be just this visible world in which we are,
a summoned enchantment, an inconstant appearance without true
[009]8
[010]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
being, like an optical illusion or a dream, a veil which surrounds
human consciousness, something of which it is equally false and
true to say that it is and that it is not. But Kant not only expressed
the same doctrine in a completely new and original way, but
raised it to the position of proved and indisputable truth by
means of the calmest and most temperate exposition; while both
Plato and the Indian philosophers had founded their assertions
merely upon a general perception of the world, had advanced
them as the direct utterance of their consciousness, and presented
them rather mythically and poetically than philosophically and
distinctly. In this respect they stand to Kant in the same relation
as the Pythagoreans Hicetas, Philolaus, and Aristarchus, who
already asserted the movement of the earth round the fixed
sun, stand to Copernicus. Such distinct knowledge and calm,
thoughtful exposition of this dream-like nature of the whole
world is really the basis of the whole Kantian philosophy; it is
its soul and its greatest merit. He accomplished this by taking to
pieces the whole machinery of our intellect by means of which
the phantasmagoria of the objective world is brought about,
and presenting it in detail with marvellous insight and ability.
All earlier Western philosophy, appearing in comparison with
the Kantian unspeakably clumsy, had failed to recognise that
truth, and had therefore always spoken just as if in a dream.
Kant first awakened it suddenly out of this dream; therefore the
last sleepers (Mendelssohn) called him the “all-destroyer.” He
showed that the laws which reign with inviolable necessity in
existence, i.e., in experience generally, are not to be applied to
deduce and explain existence itself that thus the validity of these
laws is only relative, i.e., only arises after existence; the world
of experience in general is already established and present; that
consequently these laws cannot be our guide when we come to
the explanation of the existence of the world and of ourselves.
All earlier Western philosophers had imagined that these laws,
according to which the phenomena are combined, and all of which—time and space, as well as causality and inference—I
comprehend under the expression “the principle of sufficient
reason,” were absolute laws conditioned by nothing, æternæ
veritates; that the world itself existed only in consequence of and
in conformity with them; and therefore that under their guidance
the whole riddle of the world must be capable of solution. The
assumptions made for this purpose, which Kant criticises under
the name of the Ideas of the reason, only served to raise the
mere phenomenon, the work of Mâyâ, the shadow world of
Plato, to the one highest reality, to put it in the place of the
inmost and true being of things, and thereby to make the real
knowledge of this impossible; that is, in a word, to send the
dreamers still more soundly to sleep. Kant exhibited these laws,
and therefore the whole world, as conditioned by the form of
knowledge belonging to the subject; from which it followed,
that however far one carried investigation and reasoning under
the guidance of these laws, yet in the principal matter, i.e., in
knowledge of the nature of the world in itself and outside the
idea, no step in advance was made, but one only moved like a
squirrel in its wheel. Thus, all the dogmatists may be compared
to persons who supposed that if they only went straight on long
enough they would come to the end of the world; but Kant then
circumnavigated the world and showed that, because it is round,
one cannot get out of it by horizontal movement, but that yet by
perpendicular movement this is perhaps not impossible. We may
also say that Kant's doctrine affords the insight that we must seek
the end and beginning of the world, not without, but within us.
All this, however, rests on the fundamental distinction between
dogmatic and critical or transcendental philosophy. Whoever
wishes to make this quite clear to himself, and realise it by means
of an example, may do so very briefly by reading, as a specimen
of dogmatic philosophy, an essay of Leibnitz entitled “De Rerum
Originatione Radicali,” and printed for the first time in the edition
of the philosophical works of Leibnitz by Erdmann (vol. i. p.
[011]10
[012]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
147). Here the origin and excellence of the world is demonstrated
a priori, so thoroughly in the manner of realistic-dogmatism, on
the ground of the veritates æternæ and with the assistance of the
ontological and cosmological proofs. It is indeed once admitted,
by the way, that experience shows the exact opposite of the
excellence of the world here demonstrated; but experience is
therefore given to understand that it knows nothing of the matter,
and ought to hold its tongue when philosophy has spoken a
priori. Now, with Kant, the critical philosophy appeared as the
opponent of this whole method. It takes for its problem just
these veritates æternæ, which serve as the foundation of every
such dogmatic structure, investigates their origin, and finds it
in the human mind, where they spring from the peculiar forms
which belong to it, and which it carries in itself for the purpose
of comprehending an objective world. Thus, here, in the brain,
is the quarry which supplies the material for that proud dogmatic
edifice. But because the critical philosophy, in order to attain
to this result, was obliged to go beyond the veritates æternæ
upon which all the preceding dogmatism was founded, and make
these truths themselves the objects of investigation, it became
transcendental philosophy. From this, then, it also follows that
the objective world, as we know it, does not belong to the
true being of the thing in itself, but is merely its phenomenal
appearance conditioned by those very forms which lie a priori in
the intellect (i.e., the brain), therefore it cannot contain anything
but phenomena.
Kant, indeed, did not attain to the knowledge that the
phenomenon is the world as idea, and the thing in itself is the
will. But he showed that the phenomenal world is conditioned
just as much through the subject as through the object, and
because he isolated the most universal forms of its phenomenal
appearance, i.e., of the idea, he proved that we may know these
forms and consider them in their whole constitution, not only by
starting from the object, but also just as well by starting fromAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
11
the subject, because they are really the limits between object and
subject which are common to them both; and he concluded that
by following these limits we never penetrate to the inner nature
either of the object or of the subject, consequently never know
the true nature of the world, the thing in itself.
He did not deduce the thing in itself in the right way, as I
shall show presently, but by means of an inconsistency, and
he had to pay the penalty of this in frequent and irresistible
attacks upon this important part of his teaching. He did not
recognise the thing in itself directly in the will; but he made a
great initial step towards this knowledge in that he explained the
undeniable moral significance of human action as quite different
from and not dependent upon the laws of the phenomenon, nor
even explicable in accordance with them, but as something which
touches the thing in itself directly: this is the second important
point of view for estimating his services.
We may regard as the third the complete overthrow of the
Scholastic philosophy, a name by which I wish here to denote
generally the whole period beginning with Augustine, the Church
Father, and ending just before Kant. For the chief characteristic
of Scholasticism is, indeed, that which is very correctly stated by
Tennemann, the guardianship of the prevailing national religion
over philosophy, which had really nothing left for it to do but
to prove and embellish the cardinal dogmas prescribed to it by
religion. The Schoolmen proper, down to Suarez, confess this
openly; the succeeding philosophers do it more unconsciously,
or at least unavowedly. It is held that Scholastic philosophy
only extends to about a hundred years before Descartes, and
that then with him there begins an entirely new epoch of free
investigation independent of all positive theological doctrine.
Such investigation, however, is in fact not to be attributed to
Descartes and his successors,1 but only an appearance of it,
1
Bruno and Spinoza are here entirely to be excepted. They stand each for
himself and alone, and belong neither to their age nor their quarter of the
[013]12
[014]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
and in any case an effort after it. Descartes was a man of
supreme ability, and if we take account of the age he lived in, he
accomplished a great deal. But if we set aside this consideration
and measure him with reference to the freeing of thought from all
fetters and the commencement of a new period of untrammelled
original investigation with which he is credited, we are obliged
to find that with his doubt still wanting in true seriousness, and
therefore surrendering so quickly and so entirely, he has, indeed,
the appearance of wishing to throw off at once all the early
implanted opinions belonging to his age and nation, but does
so only apparently and for a moment, to assume them again
immediately and hold them all the more firmly; and so is it with
all his successors down to Kant. Goethe's lines are, therefore,
very applicable to a free independent thinker of this kind:
“Saving Thy gracious presence, he to me
A long-legged grasshopper appears to be,
gentler age, so that the after-world whose curse was to fall on those fiendish
fanatics is the world we now live in.
globe, which rewarded the one with death and the other with persecution and
insult. Their miserable existence and death in this Western world is like that
of a tropical plant in Europe. The banks of the sacred Ganges were their
true spiritual home; there they would have led a peaceful and honoured life
among men of like mind. In the following lines, with which Bruno begins his
book Della Causa Principio et Uno, for which he was brought to the stake, he
expresses clearly and beautifully how lonely he felt himself in his age, and he
also shows a presentiment of his fate which led him to delay the publication
of his views, till that inclination to communicate what one knows to be true,
which is so strong in noble minds, prevailed:
“Ad partum properare tuum, mens ægra, quid obstat;
Seclo hæc indigno sint tribuenda licet?
Umbrarum fluctu terras mergente, cacumen
Adtolle in clarum, noster Olympe, Jovem.”
Whoever has read this his principal work, and also his other Italian writings,
which were formerly so rare, but are now accessible to all through a German
edition, will find, as I have done, that he alone of all philosophers in some
degree approaches to Plato, in respect of the strong blending of poetical power
and tendency along with the philosophical, and this he also shows especially inAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
13
That springing flies, and flying springs,
And in the grass the same old ditty sings.”2
Kant had reasons for assuming the air of also intending nothing
more. But the pretended spring, which was permitted because
it was known that it leads back to the grass, this time became a
flight, and now those who remain below can only look after him,
and can never catch him again.
Kant, then, ventured to show by his teaching that all those
dogmas which had been so often professedly proved were
incapable of proof. Speculative theology, and the rational
psychology connected with it, received from him their deathblow.
Since then they have vanished from German philosophy, and one
must not allow oneself to be misled by the fact that here and
there the word is retained after the thing has been given up,
or some wretched professor of philosophy has the fear of his
master in view, and lets truth take care of itself. Only he who
has observed the pernicious influence of these conceptions upon
natural science, and upon philosophy in all, even the best writers
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, can estimate the
extent of this service of Kant's. The change of tone and of
metaphysical background which has appeared in German writing
upon natural science since Kant is remarkable; before him it
was in the same position as it still occupies in England. This
merit of Kant's is connected with the fact that the unreflecting
pursuit of the laws of the phenomenon, the elevation of these to
the position of eternal truths, and thus the raising of the fleeting
appearance to the position of the real being of the world, in
short, realism undisturbed in its illusion by any reflection, had
reigned throughout all preceding philosophy, ancient, mediæval,
a dramatic form. Imagine the tender, spiritual, thoughtful being, as he shows
himself to us in this work of his, in the hands of coarse, furious priests as
his judges and executioners, and thank Time which brought a brighter and a

and modern. Berkeley, who, like Malebranche before him,
recognised its one-sidedness, and indeed falseness, was unable
to overthrow it, for his attack was confined to one point. Thus
it was reserved for Kant to enable the idealistic point of view
to obtain the ascendancy in Europe, at least in philosophy; the
point of view which throughout all non-Mohammedan Asia, and
indeed essentially, is that of religion. Before Kant, then, we were
in time; now time is in us, and so on.
[016]
Ethics also were treated by that realistic philosophy according
to the laws of the phenomenon, which it regarded as absolute and
valid also for the thing in itself. They were therefore based now
upon a doctrine of happiness, now upon the will of the Creator,
and finally upon the conception of perfection; a conception
which, taken by itself, is entirely empty and void of content, for
it denotes a mere relation that only receives significance from the
things to which it is applied. “To be perfect” means nothing more
than “to correspond to some conception which is presupposed and
given,” a conception which must therefore be previously framed,
and without which the perfection is an unknown quantity, and
consequently has no meaning when expressed alone. If, however,
it is intended tacitly to presuppose the conception “humanity,”
and accordingly to make it the principle of morality to strive
after human perfection, this is only saying: “Men ought to be
as they ought to be,”—and we are just as wise as before. In
fact “perfect” is very nearly a mere synonym of “complete,”
for it signifies that in one given case or individual, all the
predicates which lie in the conception of its species appear, thus
are actually present. Therefore the conception “perfection,” if
used absolutely and in the abstract, is a word void of significance,
and this is also the case with the talk about the “most perfect
being,” and other similar expressions. All this is a mere jingle
of words. Nevertheless last century this conception of perfection
and imperfection had become current coin; indeed it was the
hinge upon which almost all speculation upon ethics, and evenAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
15
theology, turned. It was in every one's mouth, so that at last
it became a simple nuisance. We see even the best writers of
the time, for example Lessing, entangled in the most deplorable
manner in perfections and imperfections, and struggling with
them. At the same time, every thinking man must at least dimly
have felt that this conception is void of all positive content,
because, like an algebraical symbol, it denotes a mere relation
in abstracto. Kant, as we have already said, entirely separated
the undeniably great ethical significance of actions from the
phenomenon and its laws, and showed that the former directly
concerned the thing in itself, the inner nature of the world, while
the latter, i.e., time, space, and all that fills them, and disposes
itself in them according to the law of causality, is to be regarded
as a changing and unsubstantial dream.
The little I have said, which by no means exhausts the
subject, may suffice as evidence of my recognition of the great
merits of Kant,—a recognition expressed here both for my own
satisfaction, and because justice demands that those merits should
be recalled to the memory of every one who desires to follow me
in the unsparing exposure of his errors to which I now proceed.
It may be inferred, upon purely historical grounds, that Kant's
great achievements must have been accompanied by great errors.
For although he effected the greatest revolution in philosophy
and made an end of Scholasticism, which, understood in the
wider sense we have indicated, had lasted for fourteen centuries,
in order to begin what was really the third entirely new epoch
in philosophy which the world has seen, yet the direct result of
his appearance was only negative, not positive. For since he
did not set up a completely new system, to which his disciples
could only have adhered for a period, all indeed observed that
something very great had happened, but yet no one rightly knew
what. They certainly saw that all previous philosophy had been
fruitless dreaming, from which the new age had now awakened,
[017]16
[018]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
but what they ought to hold to now they did not know. A great
void was felt; a great need had arisen; the universal attention
even of the general public was aroused. Induced by this, but
not urged by inward inclination and sense of power (which find
utterance even at unfavourable times, as in the case of Spinoza),
men without any exceptional talent made various weak, absurd,
and indeed sometimes insane, attempts, to which, however, the
now interested public gave its attention, and with great patience,
such as is only found in Germany, long lent its ear.
The same thing must once have happened in Nature, when a
great revolution had altered the whole surface of the earth, land
and sea had changed places, and the scene was cleared for a new
creation. It was then a long time before Nature could produce a
new series of lasting forms all in harmony with themselves and
with each other. Strange and monstrous organisations appeared
which did not harmonise either with themselves or with each
other, and therefore could not endure long, but whose still
existing remains have brought down to us the tokens of that
wavering and tentative procedure of Nature forming itself anew.
Since, now, in philosophy, a crisis precisely similar to this,
and an age of fearful abortions, was, as we all know, introduced
by Kant, it may be concluded that the services he rendered were
not complete, but must have been negative and one-sided, and
burdened with great defects. These defects we now desire to
search out.
First of all we shall present to ourselves clearly and examine
the fundamental thought in which the aim of the whole “Critique
of Pure Reason” lies. Kant placed himself at the standpoint of
his predecessors, the dogmatic philosophers, and accordingly
he started with them from the following assumptions:—(1.)
Metaphysics is the science of that which lies beyond the
possibility of all experience. (2.) Such a science can never
be attained by applying principles which must first themselvesAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
17
be drawn from experience (Prolegomena, § 1); but only what
we know before, and thus independently of all experience, can
reach further than possible experience. (3.) In our reason
certain principles of this kind are actually to be found: they are
comprehended under the name of Knowledge of pure reason.
So far Kant goes with his predecessors, but here he separates
from them. They say: “These principles, or this knowledge
of pure reason, are expressions of the absolute possibility of
things, æternæ veritates, sources of ontology; they stand above
the system of the world, as fate stood above the gods of the
ancients.” Kant says, they are mere forms of our intellect, laws,
not of the existence of things, but of our idea of them; they
are therefore valid merely for our apprehension of things, and
hence they cannot extend beyond the possibility of experience,
which, according to assumption 1, is what was aimed at; for the
a priori nature of these forms of knowledge, since it can only
rest on their subjective origin, is just what cuts us off for ever
from the knowledge of the nature of things in themselves, and
confines us to a world of mere phenomena, so that we cannot
know things as they may be in themselves, even a posteriori, not
to speak of a priori. Accordingly metaphysics is impossible,
and criticism of pure reason takes its place. As opposed to the
old dogmatism, Kant is here completely victorious; therefore all
dogmatic attempts which have since appeared have been obliged
to pursue an entirely different path from the earlier systems;
and I shall now go on to the justification of my own system,
according to the expressed intention of this criticism. A more
careful examination, then, of the reasoning given above will
oblige one to confess that its first fundamental assumption is a
petitio principii. It lies in the proposition (stated with particular
clearness in the Prolegomena, § 1): “The source of metaphysics
must throughout be non-empirical; its fundamental principles
and conceptions must never be taken from either inner or outer
experience.” Yet absolutely nothing is advanced in proof of this
[019]18
[020]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
cardinal assertion except the etymological argument from the
word metaphysic. In truth, however, the matter stands thus: The
world and our own existence presents itself to us necessarily as
a riddle. It is now assumed, without more ado, that the solution
of this riddle cannot be arrived at from a thorough understanding
of the world itself, but must be sought in something entirely
different from the world (for that is the meaning of “beyond
the possibility of all experience”); and that everything must
be excluded from that solution of which we can in any way
have immediate knowledge (for that is the meaning of possible
experience, both inner and outer); the solution must rather be
sought only in that at which we can arrive merely indirectly, that
is, by means of inferences from universal principles a priori.
After the principal source of all knowledge has in this way been
excluded, and the direct way to truth has been closed, we must
not wonder that the dogmatic systems failed, and that Kant was
able to show the necessity of this failure; for metaphysics and
knowledge a priori had been assumed beforehand to be identical.
But for this it was first necessary to prove that the material for the
solution of the riddle absolutely cannot be contained in the world
itself, but must be sought for only outside the world in something
we can only attain to under the guidance of those forms of which
we are conscious a priori. But so long as this is not proved, we
have no grounds for shutting ourselves off, in the case of the most
important and most difficult of all questions, from the richest of
all sources of knowledge, inner and outer experience, in order
to work only with empty forms. I therefore say that the solution
of the riddle of the world must proceed from the understanding
of the world itself; that thus the task of metaphysics is not to
pass beyond the experience in which the world exists, but to

the right point, and the combination thereby produced of these
two very different sources of knowledge. Yet this solution is
only possible within certain limits which are inseparable from
our finite nature, so that we attain to a right understanding of the
world itself without reaching a final explanation of its existence
abolishing all further problems. Therefore est quadam prodire
tenus, and my path lies midway between the omniscience of the
earlier dogmatists and the despair of the Kantian Critique. The
important truths, however, which Kant discovered, and through
which the earlier metaphysical systems were overthrown, have
supplied my system with data and materials. Compare what I have
said concerning my method in chap. xvii. of the Supplements.
So much for the fundamental thought of Kant; we shall now
consider his working out of it and its details.
Kant's style bears throughout the stamp of a pre-eminent
mind, genuine strong individuality, and quite exceptional power
of thought. Its characteristic quality may perhaps be aptly
described as a brilliant dryness, by virtue of which he was able
to grasp firmly and select the conceptions with great certainty,
and then to turn them about with the greatest freedom, to the
astonishment of the reader. I find the same brilliant dryness in
the style of Aristotle, though it is much simpler. Nevertheless
Kant's language is often indistinct, indefinite, inadequate, and
sometimes obscure. Its obscurity, certainly, is partly excusable
on account of the difficulty of the subject and the depth of
the thought; but he who is himself clear to the bottom, and
knows with perfect distinctness what he thinks and wishes,
will never write indistinctly, will never set up wavering and
indefinite conceptions, compose most difficult and complicated
expressions from foreign languages to denote them, and use
these expressions constantly afterwards, as Kant took words
and formulas from earlier philosophy, especially Scholasticism,
which he combined with each other to suit his purposes; as, for
[021]20
[022]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
example, “transcendental synthetic unity of apperception,” and
in general “unity of synthesis” (Einheit der Synthesis), always
used where “union” (Vereinigung) would be quite sufficient
by itself. Moreover, a man who is himself quite clear will
not be always explaining anew what has once been explained,
as Kant does, for example, in the case of the understanding,
the categories, experience, and other leading conceptions. In
general, such a man will not incessantly repeat himself, and
yet in every new exposition of the thought already expressed
a hundred times leave it in just the same obscure condition,
but he will express his meaning once distinctly, thoroughly, and
exhaustively, and then let it alone. “Quo enim melius rem aliquam
concipimus eo magis determinati sumus ad eam unico modo
exprimendam,” says Descartes in his fifth letter. But the most
injurious result of Kant's occasionally obscure language is, that
it acted as exemplar vitiis imitabile; indeed, it was misconstrued
as a pernicious authorisation. The public was compelled to
see that what is obscure is not always without significance;
consequently, what was without significance took refuge behind
obscure language. Fichte was the first to seize this new privilege
and use it vigorously; Schelling at least equalled him; and a host
of hungry scribblers, without talent and without honesty, soon
outbade them both. But the height of audacity, in serving up pure
nonsense, in stringing together senseless and extravagant mazes
of words, such as had previously only been heard in madhouses,
was finally reached in Hegel, and became the instrument of the
most barefaced general mystification that has ever taken place,
with a result which will appear fabulous to posterity, and will
remain as a monument of German stupidity. In vain, meanwhile,
Jean Paul wrote his beautiful paragraph, “Higher criticism of
philosophical madness in the professorial chair, and poetical
madness in the theatre” (Æsthetische Nachschule); for in vain
Goethe had already said—Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
21
“They prate and teach, and no one interferes;
All from the fellowship of fools are shrinking;
Man usually believes, if only words he hears,
That also with them goes material for thinking.”3
But let us return to Kant. We are compelled to admit
that he entirely lacks grand, classical simplicity, naïveté,
ingénuité, candeur. His philosophy has no analogy with Grecian
architecture, which presents large simple proportions revealing
themselves at once to the glance; on the contrary, it reminds us
strongly of the Gothic style of building. For a purely individual
characteristic of Kant's mind is a remarkable love of symmetry,
which delights in a varied multiplicity, so that it may reduce
it to order, and repeat this order in subordinate orders, and so
on indefinitely, just as happens in Gothic churches. Indeed, he
sometimes carries this to the extent of trifling, and from love of
this tendency he goes so far as to do open violence to truth,
and to deal with it as Nature was dealt with by the old-fashioned
gardeners, whose work we see in symmetrical alleys, squares,
and triangles, trees shaped like pyramids and spheres, and hedges
winding in regular curves. I will support this with facts.
After he has treated space and time isolated from everything
else, and has then dismissed this whole world of perception
which fills space and time, and in which we live and are, with
the meaningless words “the empirical content of perception is
given us,” he immediately arrives with one spring at the logical
basis of his whole philosophy, the table of judgments. From this
table he deduces an exact dozen of categories, symmetrically
arranged under four heads, which afterwards become the fearful
procrustean bed into which he violently forces all things in the
world and all that goes on in man, shrinking from no violence and
disdaining no sophistry if only he is able to repeat everywhere the
symmetry of that table. The first that is symmetrically deduced

[023]22
[024]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
from it is the pure physiological table of the general principles
of natural science—the axioms of intuition, anticipations of
perception, analogies of experience, and postulates of empirical
thought in general. Of these fundamental principles, the first two
are simple; but each of the last two sends out symmetrically three
shoots. The mere categories were what he calls conceptions; but
these principles of natural science are judgments. In accordance
with his highest guide to all wisdom, symmetry, the series
must now prove itself fruitful in the syllogisms, and this,
indeed, is done symmetrically and regularly. For, as by the
application of the categories to sensibility, experience with all
its a priori principles arose for the understanding, so by the
application of syllogisms to the categories, a task performed by
the reason in accordance with its pretended principle of seeking
the unconditioned, the Ideas of the reason arise. Now this takes
place in the following manner: The three categories of relation
supply to syllogistic reasoning the three only possible kinds of
major premisses, and syllogistic reasoning accordingly falls into
three kinds, each of which is to be regarded as an egg out of
which the reason hatches an Idea; out of the categorical syllogism
the Idea of the soul, out of the hypothetical the Idea of the world,
and out of the disjunctive the Idea of God. In the second of these,
the Idea of the world, the symmetry of the table of the categories
now repeats itself again, for its four heads produce four theses,
each of which has its antithesis as a symmetrical pendant.
We pay the tribute of our admiration to the really exceedingly
acute combination which produced this elegant structure, but
we shall none the less proceed to a thorough examination of its
foundation and its parts. But the following remarks must come
first.
It is astonishing how Kant, without further reflection, pursues
his way, following his symmetry, ordering everything in
accordance with it, without ever taking one of the subjectsAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

so handled into consideration on its own account. I will explain
myself more fully. After he has considered intuitive knowledge
in a mathematical reference only, he neglects altogether the
rest of knowledge of perception in which the world lies before
us, and confines himself entirely to abstract thinking, although
this receives the whole of its significance and value from the
world of perception alone, which is infinitely more significant,
generally present, and rich in content than the abstract part of our
knowledge. Indeed, and this is an important point, he has nowhere
clearly distinguished perception from abstract knowledge, and
just on this account, as we shall afterwards see, he becomes
involved in irresolvable contradictions with himself. After he
has disposed of the whole sensible world with the meaningless
“it is given,” he makes, as we have said, the logical table of
judgments the foundation-stone of his building. But here again
he does not reflect for a moment upon that which really lies
before him. These forms of judgment are indeed words and
combinations of words; yet it ought first to have been asked
what these directly denote: it would have been found that they
denote conceptions. The next question would then have been
as to the nature of conceptions. It would have appeared from
the answer what relation these have to the ideas of perception
in which the world exists; for perception and reflection would
have been distinguished. It would now have become necessary
to examine, not merely how pure and merely formal intuition
or perception a priori, but also how its content, the empirical
perception, comes into consciousness. But then it would have
become apparent what part the understanding has in this, and
thus also in general what the understanding is, and, on the other
hand, what the reason properly is, the critique of which is being
written. It is most remarkable that he does not once properly and
adequately define the latter, but merely gives incidentally, and
as the context in each case demands, incomplete and inaccurate
explanations of it, in direct contradiction to the rule of Descartes
[025]24
[026]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
given above.4 For example, at p. 11; V. 24, of the “Critique
of Pure Reason,” it is the faculty of principles a priori; but at
p. 299; V. 356, it is said that reason is the faculty of principles,
and it is opposed to the understanding, which is the faculty of
rules! One would now think that there must be a very wide
difference between principles and rules, since it entitles us to
assume a special faculty of knowledge for each of them. But
this great distinction is made to lie merely in this, that what is
known a priori through pure perception or through the forms of
the understanding is a rule, and only what results from mere
conceptions is a principle. We shall return to this arbitrary and
inadmissible distinction later, when we come to the Dialectic. On
p. 330; V. 386, reason is the faculty of inference; mere judging
(p. 69; V. 94) he often explains as the work of the understanding.
Now, this really amounts to saying: Judging is the work of
the understanding so long as the ground of the judgment is
empirical, transcendental, or metalogical (Essay on the Principle
of Sufficient Reason, § 31, 32, 33); but if it is logical, as is the
case with the syllogism, then we are here concerned with a quite
special and much more important faculty of knowledge—the
reason. Nay, what is more, on p. 303; V. 360, it is explained
that what follows directly from a proposition is still a matter
of the understanding, and that only those conclusions which are
arrived at by the use of a mediating conception are the work of
the reason, and the example given is this: From the proposition,
“All men are mortal,” the inference, “Some mortals are men,”
may be drawn by the mere understanding. On the other hand,
to draw the conclusion, “All the learned are mortal,” demands
an entirely different and far more important faculty—the reason.

Observe here that I always quote the “Kritik der reinen Vernunft” according
to the paging of the first edition, for in Rosenkranz's edition of Kant's collected
works this paging is always given in addition. Besides this, I add the paging
of the fifth edition, preceded by a V.; all the other editions, from the second
onwards, are the same as the fifth, and so also is their paging.Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
25
How was it possible for a great thinker to write the like of this!
On p. 553; V. 581, reason is all at once the constant condition
of all voluntary action. On p. 614; V. 642, it consists in the
fact that we can give an account of our assertions; on pp. 643,
644; V. 671, 672, in the circumstance that it brings unity into
the conceptions of the understanding by means of Ideas, as the
understanding brings unity into the multiplicity of objects by
means of conceptions. On p. 646; V. 674, it is nothing else than
the faculty which deduces the particular from the general.
The understanding also is constantly being explained anew. In
seven passages of the “Critique of Pure Reason” it is explained
in the following terms. On p. 51; V. 75, it is the faculty which
of itself produces ideas of perception. On p. 69; V. 94, it is the
faculty of judging, i.e., of thinking, i.e., of knowing through
conceptions. On p. 137 of the fifth edition, it is the faculty of
knowledge generally. On p. 132; V. 171, it is the faculty of rules.
On p. 158; V. 197, however, it is said: “It is not only the faculty
of rules, but the source of principles (Grundsätze) according
to which everything comes under rules;” and yet above it was
opposed to the reason because the latter alone was the faculty of
principles (Principien). On p. 160; V. 199, the understanding is
the faculty of conceptions; but on p. 302; V. 359, it is the faculty
of the unity of phenomena by means of rules.
Against such really confused and groundless language on the
subject (even though it comes from Kant) I shall have no need to
defend the explanation which I have given of these two faculties
of knowledge—an explanation which is fixed, clearly defined,
definite, simple, and in full agreement with the language of all
nations and all ages. I have only quoted this language as a
proof of my charge that Kant follows his symmetrical, logical
system without sufficiently reflecting upon the subject he is thus
handling.
Now, as I have said above, if Kant had seriously examined
how far two such different faculties of knowledge, one of which
[027]26
[028]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
is the specific difference of man, may be known, and what, in
accordance with the language of all nations and all philosophers,
reason and understanding are, he would never, without further
authority than the intellectus theoreticus and practicus of the
Schoolmen, which is used in an entirely different sense, have
divided the reason into theoretical and practical, and made the
latter the source of virtuous conduct. In the same way, before
Kant separated so carefully conceptions of the understanding
(by which he sometimes means his categories, sometimes all
general conceptions) and conceptions of the reason (his so-called
Ideas), and made them both the material of his philosophy, which
for the most part deals only with the validity, application, and
origin of all these conceptions;—first, I say, he ought to have
really examined what in general a conception is. But this very
necessary investigation has unfortunately been also neglected,
and has contributed much to the irremediable confusion of
intuitive and abstract knowledge which I shall soon refer to. The
same want of adequate reflection with which he passed over
the questions: what is perception? what is reflection? what is
conception? what is reason? what is understanding? allowed
him to pass over the following investigations, which were just
as inevitably necessary: what is it that I call the object, which
I distinguish from the idea? what is existence? what is object?
what is subject? what is truth, illusion, error? But he follows his
logical schema and his symmetry without reflecting or looking
about him. The table of judgments ought to, and must, be the key
to all wisdom.
I have given it above as the chief merit of Kant that he
distinguished the phenomenon from the thing in itself, explained
the whole visible world as phenomenon, and therefore denied
all validity to its laws beyond the phenomenon. It is certainly
remarkable that he did not deduce this merely relative existence
of the phenomenon from the simple undeniable truth which layAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
27
so near him, “No object without a subject,” in order thus at
the very root to show that the object, because it always exists
merely in relation to a subject, is dependent upon it, conditioned
by it, and therefore conditioned as mere phenomenon, which
does not exist in itself nor unconditioned. Berkeley, to whose
merits Kant did not do justice, had already made this important
principle the foundation-stone of his philosophy, and thereby
established an immortal reputation. Yet he himself did not draw
the proper conclusions from this principle, and so he was both
misunderstood and insufficiently attended to. In my first edition
I explained Kant's avoidance of this Berkeleian principle as
arising from an evident shrinking from decided idealism; while,
on the other hand, I found idealism distinctly expressed in many
passages of the “Critique of Pure Reason,” and accordingly I
charged Kant with contradicting himself. And this charge was
well founded, if, as was then my case, one only knew the
“Critique of Pure Reason” in the second or any of the five
subsequent editions printed from it. But when later I read Kant's
great work in the first edition, which is already so rare, I saw, to
my great pleasure, all these contradictions disappear, and found
that although Kant does not use the formula, “No object without a
subject,” he yet explains, with just as much decision as Berkeley
and I do, the outer world lying before us in space and time as the
mere idea of the subject that knows it. Therefore, for example, he
says there without reserve (p. 383): “If I take away the thinking
subject, the whole material world must disappear, for it is nothing
but a phenomenon in the sensibility of our subject, and a class
of its ideas.” But the whole passage from p. 348-392, in which
Kant expounded his pronounced idealism with peculiar beauty
and clearness, was suppressed by him in the second edition,
and instead of it a number of remarks controverting it were
introduced. In this way then the text of the “Critique of Pure
Reason,” as it has circulated from the year 1787 to the year 1838,
was disfigured and spoilt, and it became a self-contradictory
[029]28
[030]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
book, the sense of which could not therefore be thoroughly clear
and comprehensible to any one. The particulars about this, and
also my conjectures as to the reasons and the weaknesses which
may have influenced Kant so to disfigure his immortal work,
I have given in a letter to Professor Rosenkranz, and he has
quoted the principal passage of it in his preface to the second
volume of the edition of Kant's collected works edited by him,
to which I therefore refer. In consequence of my representations,
Professor Rosenkranz was induced in the year 1838 to restore
the “Critique of Pure Reason” to its original form, for in the
second volume referred to he had it printed according to the first
edition of 1781, by which he has rendered an inestimable service
to philosophy; indeed, he has perhaps saved from destruction
the most important work of German literature; and this should
always be remembered to his credit. But let no one imagine
that he knows the “Critique of Pure Reason” and has a distinct
conception of Kant's teaching if he has only read the second or
one of the later editions. That is altogether impossible, for he has
only read a mutilated, spoilt, and to a certain extent ungenuine
text. It is my duty to say this here decidedly and for every one's
warning.
Yet the way in which Kant introduces the thing in itself
stands in undeniable contradiction with the distinctly idealistic
point of view so clearly expressed in the first edition of the
“Critique of Pure Reason,” and without doubt this is the chief
reason why, in the second edition, he suppressed the principal
idealistic passage we have referred to, and directly declared
himself opposed to the Berkeleian idealism, though by doing so
he only introduced inconsistencies into his work, without being
able to remedy its principal defect. This defect, as is known,
is the introduction of the thing in itself in the way chosen by
him, the inadmissibleness of which was exposed at length by G.
E. Schulze in “Ænesidemus,” and was soon recognised as the
untenable point of his system. The matter may be made clearAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
29
in a very few words. Kant based the assumption of the thing
in itself, though concealed under various modes of expression,
upon an inference from the law of causality—an inference that
the empirical perception, or more accurately the sensation, in our
organs of sense, from which it proceeds, must have an external
cause. But according to his own account, which is correct, the law
of causality is known to us a priori, consequently is a function of
our intellect, and is thus of subjective origin; further, sensation
itself, to which we here apply the law of causality, is undeniably
subjective; and finally, even space, in which, by means of this
application, we place the cause of this sensation as object,
is a form of our intellect given a priori, and is consequently
subjective. Therefore the whole empirical perception remains
always upon a subjective foundation, as a mere process in us,
and nothing entirely different from it and independent of it can
be brought in as a thing in itself, or shown to be a necessary
assumption. The empirical perception actually is and remains
merely our idea: it is the world as idea. An inner nature of this
we can only arrive at on the entirely different path followed by
me, by means of calling in the aid of self-consciousness, which
proclaims the will as the inner nature of our own phenomenon;
but then the thing in itself will be one which is toto genere
different from the idea and its elements, as I have explained.
The great defect of the Kantian system in this point, which,
as has been said, was soon pointed out, is an illustration of the
truth of the beautiful Indian proverb: “No lotus without a stem.”
The erroneous deduction of the thing in itself is here the stem;
yet only the method of the deduction, not the recognition of a
thing in itself belonging to the given phenomenon. But this last
was Fichte's misunderstanding of it, which could only happen
because he was not concerned with truth, but with making a
sensation for the furtherance of his individual ends. Accordingly
he was bold and thoughtless enough to deny the thing in itself
altogether, and to set up a system in which, not, as with Kant, the
[031]30
[032]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
mere form of the idea, but also the matter, its whole content, was
professedly deduced a priori from the subject. In doing this, he
counted with perfect correctness upon the want of judgment and
the stupidity of the public, which accepted miserable sophisms,
mere hocus-pocus and senseless babble, for proofs; so that he
succeeded in turning its attention from Kant to himself, and gave
the direction to German philosophy in which it was afterwards
carried further by Schelling, and ultimately reached its goal in
the mad sophistry of Hegel.
I now return to the great mistake of Kant, already touched on
above, that he has not properly separated perceptible and abstract
knowledge, whereby an inextricable confusion has arisen which
we have now to consider more closely. If he had sharply separated
ideas of perception from conceptions merely thought in abstracto,
he would have held these two apart, and in every case would
have known with which of the two he had to do. This, however,
was unfortunately not the case, although this accusation has not
yet been openly made, and may thus perhaps be unexpected. His
“object of experience,” of which he is constantly speaking, the
proper object of the categories, is not the idea of perception;
neither is it the abstract conception, but it is different from both,
and yet both at once, and is a perfect chimera. For, incredible
as it may seem, he lacked either the wisdom or the honesty
to come to an understanding with himself about this, and to
explain distinctly to himself and others whether his “object of
experience, i.e., the knowledge produced by the application of
the categories,” is the idea of perception in space and time (my
first class of ideas), or merely the abstract conception. Strange as
it is, there always runs in his mind something between the two,
and hence arises the unfortunate confusion which I must now
bring to light. For this end I must go through the whole theory of
elements in a general way.
The “Transcendental Æsthetic” is a work of such extraordinaryAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
31
merit that it alone would have been sufficient to immortalise the
name of Kant. Its proofs carry such perfect conviction, that I
number its propositions among incontestable truths, and without
doubt they are also among those that are richest in results, and
are, therefore, to be regarded as the rarest thing in the world, a
real and great discovery in metaphysics. The fact, strictly proved
by him, that a part of our knowledge is known to us a priori,
admits of no other explanation than that this constitutes the
forms of our intellect; indeed, this is less an explanation than
merely the distinct expression of the fact itself. For a priori
means nothing else than “not gained on the path of experience,
thus not come into us from without.” But what is present in the
intellect, and has not come from without, is just what belongs
originally to the intellect itself, its own nature. Now if what is
thus present in the intellect itself consists of the general mode
or manner in which it must present all its objects to itself, this
is just saying that what is thus present is the intellect's forms of
knowing, i.e., the mode, fixed once for all, in which it fulfils
this its function. Accordingly, “knowledge a priori” and “the
intellect's own forms” are at bottom only two expressions for the
same things thus to a certain extent synonyms.
Therefore from the doctrine of the Transcendental Æsthetic I
knew of nothing to take away, only of something to add. Kant did
not carry out his thought to the end, especially in this respect, that
he did not reject Euclid's whole method of demonstration, even
after having said on p. 87; V. 120, that all geometrical knowledge
has direct evidence from perception. It is most remarkable that
one of Kant's opponents, and indeed the acutest of them, G. E.
Schulze (Kritik der theoretischen Philosophie, ii. 241), draws the
conclusion that from his doctrine an entirely different treatment
of geometry from that which is actually in use would arise; and
thus he thought to bring an apagogical argument against Kant,
but, in fact, without knowing it, he only began the war against
the method of Euclid. Let me refer to § 15 of the first book of
[033]32
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
this work.
[034]
After the full exposition of the universal forms of perception
given in the Transcendental Æsthetic, one necessarily expects
to receive some explanation as to its content, as to the way in
which the empirical perception comes into our consciousness,
how the knowledge of this whole world, which is for us so
real and so important, arises in us. But the whole teaching
of Kant contains really nothing more about this than the oft-
repeated meaningless expression: “The empirical element in
perception is given from without.” Consequently here also from
the pure forms of perception Kant arrives with one spring at
thinking at the Transcendental Logic. Just at the beginning of
the Transcendental Logic (Critique of Pure Reason, p. 50; V.
74), where Kant cannot avoid touching upon the content of the
empirical perception, he takes the first false step; he is guilty of
the ÀÁÉÄ¿1⁄2 ÈμÅ ́¿Â. “Our knowledge,” he says, “has two sources,
receptivity of impressions and spontaneity of conceptions: the
first is the capacity for receiving ideas, the second that of knowing
an object through these ideas: through the first an object is given
us, through the second it is thought.” This is false; for according
to it the impression, for which alone we have mere receptivity,
which thus comes from without and alone is properly “given,”
would be already an idea, and indeed an object. But it is nothing
more than a mere sensation in the organ of sense, and only by
the application of the understanding (i.e., of the law of causality)
and the forms of perception, space and time, does our intellect
change this mere sensation into an idea, which now exists as an
object in space and time, and cannot be distinguished from the
latter (the object) except in so far as we ask after the thing in
itself, but apart from this is identical with it. I have explained
this point fully in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason,
§ 21. With this, however, the work of the understanding and
of the faculty of perception is completed, and no conceptions
and no thinking are required in addition; therefore the bruteAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
33
also has these ideas. If conceptions are added, if thinking
is added, to which spontaneity may certainly be attributed,
then knowledge of perception is entirely abandoned, and a
completely different class of ideas comes into consciousness,
non-perceptible abstract conceptions. This is the activity of the
reason, which yet obtains the whole content of its thinking
only from the previous perception, and the comparison of it
with other perceptions and conceptions. But thus Kant brings
thinking into the perception, and lays the foundation for the
inextricable confusion of intuitive and abstract knowledge which
I am now engaged in condemning. He allows the perception,
taken by itself, to be without understanding, purely sensuous, and
thus quite passive, and only through thinking (category of the
understanding) does he allow an object to be apprehended: thus he
brings thought into the perception. But then, again, the object of
thinking is an individual real object; and in this way thinking loses
its essential character of universality and abstraction, and instead
of general conceptions receives individual things as its object:
thus again he brings perception into thinking. From this springs
the inextricable confusion referred to, and the consequences of
this first false step extend over his whole theory of knowledge.
Through the whole of his theory the utter confusion of the idea
of perception with the abstract idea tends towards a something
between the two which he expounds as the object of knowledge
through the understanding and its categories, and calls this
knowledge experience. It is hard to believe that Kant really
figured to himself something fully determined and really distinct
in this object of the understanding; I shall now prove this through
the tremendous contradiction which runs through the whole
Transcendental Logic, and is the real source of the obscurity in
which it is involved.
In the “Critique of Pure Reason,” p. 67-69; V. 92-94; p. 89,
90; V. 122, 123; further, V. 135, 139, 153, he repeats and insists:
the understanding is no faculty of perception, its knowledge is
[035]34
[036]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
not intuitive but discursive; the understanding is the faculty of
judging (p. 69; V. 94), and a judgment is indirect knowledge, an
idea of an idea (p. 68; V. 93); the understanding is the faculty
of thinking, and thinking is knowledge through conceptions (p.
69; V. 94); the categories of the understanding are by no means
the conditions under which objects are given in perception (p.
89; V. 122), and perception in no way requires the functions of
thinking (p. 91; V. 123); our understanding can only think, not
perceive (V. pp. 135, 139). Further, in the “Prolegomena,” § 20,
he says that perception, sensation, perceptio, belongs merely to
the senses; judgment to the understanding alone; and in § 22, that
the work of the senses is to perceive, that of the understanding
to think, i.e., to judge. Finally, in the “Critique of Practical
Reason,” fourth edition, p. 247; Rosenkranz's edition, p. 281, he
says that the understanding is discursive; its ideas are thoughts,
not perceptions. All this is in Kant's own words.
From this it follows that this perceptible world would exist for
us even if we had no understanding at all; that it comes into our
head in a quite inexplicable manner, which he constantly indicates
by his strange expression the perception is given, without ever
explaining this indefinite and metaphorical expression further.
Now all that has been quoted is contradicted in the most
glaring manner by the whole of the rest of his doctrine of
the understanding, of its categories, and of the possibility of
experience as he explains it in the Transcendental Logic. Thus
(Critique of Pure Reason, p. 79; V. 105), the understanding
through its categories brings unity into the manifold of
perception, and the pure conceptions of the understanding refer
a priori to objects of perception. P. 94; V. 126, the “categories
are the condition of experience, whether of perception, which is
found in it, or of thought.” V. p. 127, the understanding is the
originator of experience. V. p. 128, the categories determine the
perception of objects. V. p. 130, all that we present to ourselves
as connected in the object (which is yet certainly somethingAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
35
perceptible and not an abstraction), has been so connected by an
act of the understanding. V. p. 135, the understanding is explained
anew as the faculty of combining a priori, and of bringing the
multiplicity of given ideas under the unity of apperception; but
according to all ordinary use of words, apperception is not the
thinking of a conception, but is perception. V. p. 136, we find
a first principle of the possibility of all perception in connection
with the understanding. V. p. 143, it stands as the heading,
that all sense perception is conditioned by the categories. At the
same place the logical function of the judgment also brings the
manifold of given perceptions under an apperception in general,
and the manifold of a given perception stands necessarily under
the categories. V. p. 144, unity comes into perception, by
means of the categories, through the understanding. V. p. 145,
the thinking of the understanding is very strangely explained as
synthetically combining, connecting, and arranging the manifold
of perception. V. p. 161, experience is only possible through the
categories, and consists in the connection of sensations, which,
however, are just perceptions. V. p. 159, the categories are a
priori knowledge of the objects of perception in general. Further,
here and at V. p. 163 and 165, a chief doctrine of Kant's is
given, this: that the understanding first makes Nature possible,
because it prescribes laws for it a priori, and Nature adapts itself
to the system of the understanding, and so on. Nature, however,
is certainly perceptible and not an abstraction; therefore, the
understanding must be a faculty of perception. V. p. 168, it
is said, the conceptions of the understanding are the principles
of the possibility of experience, and the latter is the condition
of phenomena in space and time in general; phenomena which,
however, certainly exist in perception. Finally, p. 189-211; V.
232-265, the long proof is given (the incorrectness of which is
shown in detail in my essay on the principle of sufficient reason,
§ 23) that the objective succession and also the coexistence of
objects of experience are not sensuously apprehended, but are
[037]36
[038]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
only brought into Nature by the understanding, and that Nature
itself first becomes possible in this way. Yet it is certain that
Nature, the course of events, and the coexistence of states, is
purely perceptible, and no mere abstract thought.
I challenge every one who shares my respect towards Kant to
reconcile these contradictions and to show that in his doctrine
of the object of experience and the way it is determined by
the activity of the understanding and its twelve functions, Kant
thought something quite distinct and definite. I am convinced
that the contradiction I have pointed out, which extends through
the whole Transcendental Logic, is the real reason of the great
obscurity of its language. Kant himself, in fact, was dimly
conscious of the contradiction, inwardly combated it, but yet
either would not or could not bring it to distinct consciousness,
and therefore veiled it from himself and others, and avoided it by
all kinds of subterfuges. This is perhaps also the reason why he
made out of the faculties of knowledge such a strange complicated
machine, with so many wheels, as the twelve categories, the
transcendental synthesis of imagination, of the inner sense, of
the transcendental unity of apperception, also the schematism
of the pure conceptions of the understanding, &c., &c. And
notwithstanding this great apparatus, not even an attempt is made
to explain the perception of the external world, which is after
all the principal fact in our knowledge; but this pressing claim
is very meanly rejected, always through the same meaningless
metaphorical expression: “The empirical perception is given
us.” On p. 145 of the fifth edition, we learn further that the
perception is given through the object; therefore the object must
be something different from the perception.
If, now, we endeavour to investigate Kant's inmost meaning,
not clearly expressed by himself, we find that in reality such an
object, different from the perception, but which is by no means
a conception, is for him the proper object for the understanding;
indeed that it must be by means of the strange assumption ofAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
37
such an object, which cannot be presented in perception, that
the perception first becomes experience. I believe that an old
deeply-rooted prejudice in Kant, dead to all investigation, is the
ultimate reason of the assumption of such an absolute object,
which is an object in itself, i.e., without a subject. It is certainly
not the perceived object, but through the conception it is added to
the perception by thought, as something corresponding to it; and
now the perception is experience, and has value and truth, which
it thus only receives through the relation to a conception (in
diametrical opposition to my exposition, according to which the
conception only receives value and truth from the perception).
It is then the proper function of the categories to add on in
thought to the perception this directly non-perceptible object.
“The object is given only through perception, and is afterwards
thought in accordance with the category” (Critique of Pure
Reason, first edition, p. 399). This is made specially clear by
a passage on p. 125 of the fifth edition: “Now the question
arises whether conceptions a priori do not also come first as
conditions under which alone a thing can be, not perceived
certainly, but yet thought as an object in general,” which he
answers in the affirmative. Here the source of the error and
the confusion in which it is involved shows itself distinctly.
For the object as such exists always only for perception and
in it; it may now be completed through the senses, or, when
it is absent, through the imagination. What is thought, on
the contrary, is always an universal non-perceptible conception,
which certainly can be the conception of an object in general;
but only indirectly by means of conceptions does thought relate
itself to objects, which always are and remain perceptible. For
our thinking is not able to impart reality to perceptions; this
they have, so far as they are capable of it (empirical reality) of
themselves; but it serves to bring together the common element
and the results of perceptions, in order to preserve them, and
to be able to use them more easily. But Kant ascribes the
[039]38
[040]
[041]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
objects themselves to thought, in order to make experience and
the objective world dependent upon understanding, yet without
allowing understanding to be a faculty of perception. In this
relation he certainly distinguishes perception from thought, but
he makes particular things sometimes the object of perception
and sometimes the object of thought. In reality, however, they
are only the object of the former; our empirical perception is at
once objective, just because it proceeds from the causal nexus.
Things, not ideas different from them, are directly its object.
Particular things as such are perceived in the understanding and
through the senses; the one-sided impression upon the latter is
at once completed by the imagination. But, on the contrary,
as soon as we pass over to thought, we leave the particular
things, and have to do with general conceptions, which cannot
be presented in perception, although we afterwards apply the
results of our thought to particular things. If we hold firmly
to this, the inadmissibleness of the assumption becomes evident
that the perception of things only obtains reality and becomes
experience through the thought of these very things applying
its twelve categories. Rather in perception itself the empirical
reality, and consequently experience, is already given; but the
perception itself can only come into existence by the application
to sensation of the knowledge of the causal nexus, which is the
one function of the understanding. Perception is accordingly in
reality intellectual, which is just what Kant denies.
Besides in the passages quoted, the assumption of Kant here
criticised will be found expressed with admirable clearness in the
“Critique of Judgment,” § 36, just at the beginning; also in the
“Metaphysical Principles of Natural Science,” in the note to the
first explanation of “Phenomenology.” But with a naïveté which
Kant ventured upon least of all with reference to this doubtful
point, it is to be found most distinctly laid down in the book of
a Kantian, Kiesewetter's “Grundriss einer algemeinen Logik,”
third edition, part i., p. 434 of the exposition, and part ii., §Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
39
52 and 53 of the exposition; similarly in Tieftrunk's “Denklehre
in rein Deutschem Gewande” (1825). It there appears so clearly
how those disciples who do not themselves think become a
magnifying mirror of the errors of every thinker. Once having
determined his doctrine of the categories, Kant was always
cautious when expounding it, but his disciples on the contrary
were quite bold, and thus exposed its falseness.
According to what has been said, the object of the categories is
for Kant, not indeed the thing in itself, but yet most closely akin to
it. It is the object in itself ; it is an object that requires no subject;
it is a particular thing, and yet not in space and time, because
not perceptible; it is an object of thought, and yet not an abstract
conception. Accordingly Kant really makes a triple division: (1.)
the idea; (2.) the object of the idea; (3.) the thing in itself. The
first belongs to the sensibility, which in its case, as in that of
sensation, includes the pure forms of perception, space and time.
The second belongs to the understanding, which thinks it through
its twelve categories. The third lies beyond the possibility of all
knowledge. (In support of this, cf. Critique of Pure Reason, first
edition, p. 108 and 109.) The distinction of the idea from the
object of the idea is however unfounded; this had already been
proved by Berkeley, and it appears from my whole exposition in
the first book, especially chap. i. of the supplements; nay, even
from Kant's own completely idealistic point of view in the first
edition. But if we should not wish to count the object of the idea
as belonging to the idea and identify it with the idea, it would
be necessary to attribute it to the thing in itself: this ultimately
depends on the sense which is attached to the word object. This,
however, always remains certain, that, when we think clearly,
nothing more can be found than idea and thing in itself. The
illicit introduction of that hybrid, the object of the idea, is the
source of Kant's errors; yet when it is taken away, the doctrine
of the categories as conceptions a priori also falls to the ground;
for they bring nothing to the perception, and are not supposed to
[042]40
[043]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
hold good of the thing in itself, but by means of them we only
think those “objects of the ideas,” and thereby change ideas into
experience. For every empirical perception is already experience;
but every perception which proceeds from sensation is empirical:
this sensation is related by the understanding, by means of its
sole function (knowledge a priori of the law of causality), to
its cause, which just on this account presents itself in space and
time (forms of pure perception) as object of experience, material
object, enduring in space through all time, yet as such always
remains idea, as do space and time themselves. If we desire to
go beyond this idea, then we arrive at the question as to the thing
in itself, the answer to which is the theme of my whole work,
as of all metaphysics in general. Kant's error here explained is
connected with his mistake, which we condemned before, that
he gives no theory of the origin of empirical perception, but,
without saying more, treats it as given, identifying it with the
mere sensation, to which he only adds the forms of intuition or
perception, space and time, comprehending both under the name
sensibility. But from these materials no objective idea arises:
this absolutely demands the relation of the idea to its cause, thus
the application of the law of causality, and thus understanding;
for without this the sensation still remains always subjective, and
does not take the form of an object in space, even if space is
given with it. But according to Kant, the understanding must
not be assigned to perception; it is supposed merely to think,
so as to remain within the transcendental logic. With this again
is connected another mistake of Kant's: that he left it to me to
adduce the only valid proof of the a priori nature of the law
of causality which he rightly recognised, the proof from the
possibility of objective empirical perception itself, and instead
of it gives a palpably false one, as I have already shown in my
essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 23. From the above
it is clear that Kant's “object of the idea” (2) is made up of what
he has stolen partly from the idea (1), and partly from the thingAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
41
in itself (3). If, in reality, experience were only brought about by
the understanding applying its twelve different functions in order
to think through as many conceptions a priori, the objects which
were previously merely perceived, then every real thing would
necessarily as such have a number of determinations, which,
as given a priori, absolutely could not be thought away, just
like space and time, but would belong quite essentially to the
existence of the thing, and yet could not be deduced from the
properties of space and time. But only one such determination is
to be found—that of causality. Upon this rests materiality, for the
essence of matter consists in action, and it is through and through
causality (cf. Bk. II. ch. iv.) But it is materiality alone that
distinguishes the real thing from the picture of the imagination,
which is then only idea. For matter, as permanent, gives to the
thing permanence through all time, in respect of its matter, while
the forms change in conformity with causality. Everything else in
the thing consists either of determinations of space or of time, or
of its empirical properties, which are all referable to its activity,
and are thus fuller determinations of causality. But causality
enters already as a condition into the empirical perception, and
this is accordingly a thing of the understanding, which makes
even perception possible, and yet apart from the law of causality
contributes nothing to experience and its possibility. What fills
the old ontologies is, with the exception of what is given here,
nothing more than relations of things to each other, or to our
reflection, and a farrago of nonsense.
The language in which the doctrine of the categories is
expressed affords an evidence of its baselessness. What a
difference in this respect between the Transcendental Æsthetic
and the Transcendental Analytic! In the former, what clearness,
definiteness, certainty, firm conviction which is freely expressed
and infallibly communicates itself! All is full of light, no dark
lurking-places are left: Kant knows what he wants and knows
that he is right. In the latter, on the other hand, all is obscure,
[044]42
[045]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
confused, indefinite, wavering, uncertain, the language anxious,
full of excuses and appeals to what is coming, or indeed of
suppression. Moreover, the whole second and third sections of
the Deduction of the Pure Conceptions of the Understanding
are completely changed in the second edition, because they did
not satisfy Kant himself, and they have become quite different
from the first edition, though not clearer. We actually see Kant
in conflict with the truth in order to carry out his hypothesis
which he has once fixed upon. In the Transcendental Æsthetic
all his propositions are really proved from undeniable facts of
consciousness, in the Transcendental Analytic, on the contrary,
we find, if we consider it closely, mere assertions that thus it
is and must be. Here, then, as everywhere, the language bears
the stamp of the thought from which it has proceeded, for style
is the physiognomy of the mind. We have still to remark, that
whenever Kant wishes to give an example for the purpose of fuller
explanation, he almost always takes for this end the category of
causality, and then what he has said turns out correct; for the law
of causality is indeed the real form of the understanding, but it is
also its only form, and the remaining eleven categories are merely
blind windows. The deduction of the categories is simpler and
less involved in the first edition than in the second. He labours
to explain how, according to the perception given by sensibility,
the understanding produces experience by means of thinking the
categories. In doing so, the words recognition, reproduction,
association, apprehension, transcendental unity of apperception,
are repeated to weariness, and yet no distinctness is attained.
It is well worth noticing, however, that in this explanation he
does not once touch upon what must nevertheless first occur to
every one—the relation of the sensation to its external cause. If
he did not intend this relation to hold good, he ought to have
expressly denied it; but neither does he do this. Thus in this way
he evades the point, and all the Kantians have in like manner
evaded it. The secret motive of this is, that he reserves the causalAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
43
nexus, under the name “ground of the phenomenon,” for his false
deduction of the thing in itself; and also that perception would
become intellectual through the relation to the cause, which he
dare not admit. Besides this, he seems to have been afraid that
if the causal nexus were allowed to hold good between sensation
and object, the latter would at once become the thing in itself,
and introduce the empiricism of Locke. But this difficulty is
removed by reflection, which shows us that the law of causality
is of subjective origin, as well as the sensation itself; and besides
this, our own body also, inasmuch as it appears in space, already
belongs to ideas. But Kant was hindered from confessing this by
his fear of the Berkeleian idealism.
“The combination of the manifold of perception” is repeatedly
given as the essential operation of the understanding, by means
of its twelve categories. Yet this is never adequately explained,
nor is it shown what this manifold of perception is before it is
combined by the understanding. But time and space, the latter
in all its three dimensions, are continua, i.e., all their parts are
originally not separate but combined. Thus, then, everything that
exhibits itself in them (is given) appears originally as a continuum,
i.e., its parts appear already combined and require no adventitious
combination of a manifold. If, however, some one should seek to
interpret that combining of the manifold of perception by saying
that I refer the different sense-impressions of one object to this
one only—thus, for example, perceiving a bell, I recognise that
what affects my eye as yellow, my hand as smooth and hard,
my ear as sounding, is yet only one and the same body,—then
I reply that this is rather a consequence of the knowledge a
priori of the causal nexus (this actual and only function of the
understanding), by virtue of which all those different effects upon
my different organs of sense yet lead me only to one common
cause of them, the nature of the body standing before me, so
that my understanding, in spite of the difference and multiplicity
of the effects, still apprehends the unity of the cause as a single
[046]44
[047]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
object, which just on that account exhibits itself in perception. In
the beautiful recapitulation of his doctrine which Kant gives at
p. 719-726 or V. 747-754 of the “Critique of Pure Reason,” he
explains the categories, perhaps more distinctly than anywhere
else, as “the mere rule of the synthesis of that which empirical
apprehension has given a posteriori.” It seems as if here he
had something in his mind, such as that, in the construction of
the triangle, the angles give the rule for the composition of the
lines; at least by this image one can best explain to oneself what
he says of the function of the categories. The preface to the
“Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science” contains a
long note which likewise gives an explanation of the categories,
and says that they “differ in no respect from the formal acts of the
understanding in judging,” except that in the latter subject and
predicate can always change places; then the judgment in general
is defined in the same passage as “an act through which given
ideas first become knowledge of an object.” According to this, the
brutes, since they do not judge, must also have no knowledge of
objects. In general, according to Kant, there are only conceptions
of objects, no perceptions. I, on the contrary, say: Objects
exist primarily only for perception, and conceptions are always
abstractions from this perception. Therefore abstract thinking
must be conducted exactly according to the world present in
perception, for it is only their relation to this that gives content
to conceptions; and we must assume for the conceptions no
other a priori determined form than the faculty of reflection in
general, the nature of which is the construction of conceptions,
i.e., of abstract non-perceptible ideas, which constitutes the sole
function of the reason, as I have shown in the first book. I
therefore require that we should reject eleven of the categories,
and only retain that of causality, and yet that we should see clearly
that its activity is indeed the condition of empirical perception,
which accordingly is not merely sensuous but intellectual, and
that the object so perceived, the object of experience, is one withAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
45
the idea, from which there remains nothing to distinguish except
the thing in itself.
After repeated study of the “Critique of Pure Reason” at
different periods of my life, a conviction has forced itself upon
me with regard to the origin of the Transcendental Logic, which I
now impart as very helpful to an understanding of it. Kant's only
discovery, which is based upon objective comprehension and the
highest human thought, is the apperçu that time and space are
known by us a priori. Gratified by this happy hit, he wished
to pursue the same vein further, and his love of architectonic
symmetry afforded him the clue. As he had found that a pure
intuition or perception a priori underlay the empirical perception
as its condition, he thought that in the same way certain pure
conceptions as presuppositions in our faculty of knowledge must
lie at the foundation of the empirically obtained conceptions,
and that real empirical thought must be only possible through a
pure thought a priori, which, however, would have no objects
in itself, but would be obliged to take them from perception.
So that as the Transcendental Æsthetic establishes an a priori
basis of mathematics, there must, he supposed, also be a similar
basis for logic; and thus, then for the sake of symmetry, the
former received a pendant in a Transcendental Logic. From
this point onwards Kant was no more free, no more in the
position of purely, investigating and observing what is present in
consciousness; but he was guided by an assumption and pursued
a purpose—the purpose of finding what he assumed, in order
to add to the Transcendental Æsthetic so happily discovered a
Transcendental Logic analogous to it, and thus symmetrically
corresponding to it, as a second storey. Now for this purpose
he hit upon the table of judgments, out of which he constructed,
as well as he could, the table of categories, the doctrine of
twelve pure a priori conceptions, which are supposed to be the
conditions of our thinking those very things the perception of
which is conditioned by the two a priori forms of sensibility:
[048]46
[049]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
thus a pure understanding now corresponded symmetrically to
a pure sensibility. Then another consideration occurred to him,
which offered a means of increasing the plausibility of the thing,
by the assumption of the schematism of the pure conceptions of
the understanding. But just through this the way in which his
procedure had, unconsciously indeed, originated betrayed itself
most distinctly. For because he aimed at finding something a
priori analogous to every empirical function of the faculty of
knowledge, he remarked that between our empirical perception
and our empirical thinking, conducted in abstract non-perceptible
conceptions, a connection very frequently, though not always,
takes place, because every now and then we try to go back
from abstract thinking to perception; but try to do so merely
in order really to convince ourselves that our abstract thought
has not strayed far from the safe ground of perception, and
perhaps become exaggeration, or, it may be, mere empty talk;
much in the same way as, when we are walking in the dark,
we stretch out our hand every now and then to the guiding
wall. We go back, then, to the perception only tentatively
and for the moment, by calling up in imagination a perception
corresponding to the conceptions which are occupying us at the
time—a perception which can yet never be quite adequate to the
conception, but is merely a temporary representative of it. I
have already adduced what is needful on this point in my essay
on the principle of sufficient reason, § 28. Kant calls a fleeting
phantasy of this kind a schema, in opposition to the perfected
picture of the imagination. He says it is like a monogram of
the imagination, and asserts that just as such a schema stands
midway between our abstract thinking of empirically obtained
conceptions, and our clear perception which comes to us through
the senses, so there are a priori schemata of the pure conceptions
of the understanding between the faculty of perception a priori
of pure sensibility and the faculty of thinking a priori of the
pure understanding (thus the categories). These schemata, asAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
47
monograms of the pure imagination a priori, he describes one by
one, and assigns to each of them its corresponding category, in the
wonderful “Chapter on the Schematism of the Pure Conceptions
of the Understanding,” which is noted as exceedingly obscure,
because no man has ever been able to make anything out of it. Its
obscurity, however, vanishes if it is considered from the point of
view here indicated, but there also comes out more clearly in it
than anywhere else the intentional nature of Kant's procedure, and
of the determination formed beforehand of finding what would
correspond to the analogy, and could assist the architectonic
symmetry; indeed this is here the case to such a degree as to
be almost comical. For when he assumes schemata of the pure
(empty) a priori conceptions of the understanding (categories)
analogous to the empirical schemata (or representatives through
the fancy of our actual conceptions), he overlooks the fact that
the end of such schemata is here entirely wanting, For the end of
the schemata in the case of empirical (real) thinking is entirely
connected with the material content of such conceptions. For
since these conceptions are drawn from empirical perception, we
assist and guide ourselves when engaged in abstract thinking by
now and then casting a momentary glance back at the perception
out of which the conceptions are framed, in order to assure
ourselves that our thought has still real content. This, however,
necessarily presupposes that the conceptions which occupy us
are sprung from perception, and it is merely a glance back at
their material content, indeed a mere aid to our weakness. But
in the case of a priori conceptions which as yet have no content
at all, clearly this is necessarily omitted. For these conceptions
are not sprung from perception, but come to it from within, in
order to receive a content first from it. Thus they have as yet
nothing on which they could look back. I speak fully upon this
point, because it is just this that throws light upon the secret
origin of the Kantian philosophising, which accordingly consists
in this, that Kant, after the happy discovery of the two forms
[050]48
[051]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of intuition or perception a priori, exerted himself, under the
guidance of the analogy, to prove that for every determination of
our empirical knowledge there is an a priori analogue, and this
finally extended, in the schemata, even to a mere psychological
fact. Here the apparent depth and the difficulty of the exposition
just serve to conceal from the reader that its content remains a
wholly undemonstrable and merely arbitrary assumption. But he
who has penetrated at last to the meaning of such an exposition
is then easily induced to mistake this understanding so painfully
attained for a conviction of the truth of the matter. If, on the
contrary, Kant had kept himself here as unprejudiced and purely
observant as in the discovery of a priori intuition or perception,
he must have found that what is added to the pure intuition or
perception of space and time, if an empirical perception arises
from it, is on the one hand the sensation, and on the other hand
the knowledge of causality, which changes the mere sensation
into objective empirical perception, but just on this account is
not first derived and learned from sensation, but exists a priori,
and is indeed the form and function of the pure understanding. It
is also, however, its sole form and function, yet one so rich in
results that all our empirical knowledge rests upon it. If, as has
often been said, the refutation of an error is only complete when
the way it originated has been psychologically demonstrated, I
believe I have achieved this, with regard to Kant's doctrine of the
categories and their schemata, in what I have said above.
After Kant had thus introduced such great errors into the first
simple outlines of a theory of the faculty of perception, he adopted
a variety of very complicated assumptions. To these belongs first
of all the synthetic unity of apperception: a very strange thing,
very strangely explained. “The I think must be able to accompany
all my ideas.” Must—be able: this is a problematic-apodictic
enunciation; in plain English, a proposition which takes with one
hand what it gives with the other. And what is the meaning ofAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
49
this carefully balanced proposition? That all knowledge of ideas
is thinking? That is not the case: and it would be dreadful; there
would then be nothing but abstract conceptions, or at any rate a
pure perception free from reflection and will, such as that of the
beautiful, the deepest comprehension of the true nature of things,
i.e., of their Platonic Ideas. And besides, the brutes would then
either think also, or else they would not even have ideas. Or is
the proposition perhaps intended to mean: no object without a
subject? That would be very badly expressed by it, and would
come too late. If we collect Kant's utterances on the subject,
we shall find that what he understands by the synthetic unity of
apperception is, as it were, the extensionless centre of the sphere
of all our ideas, whose radii converge to it. It is what I call the
subject of knowing, the correlative of all ideas, and it is also that
which I have fully described and explained in the 22d chapter of
the Supplements, as the focus in which the rays of the activity
of the brain converge. Therefore, to avoid repetition, I now refer
to that chapter.
That I reject the whole doctrine of the categories, and reckon it
among the groundless assumptions with which Kant burdened the
theory of knowledge, results from the criticism given above; and
also from the proof of the contradictions in the Transcendental
Logic, which had their ground in the confusion of perception
and abstract knowledge; also further from the proof of the
want of a distinct and definite conception of the nature of the
understanding and of the reason, instead of which we found in
Kant's writings only incoherent, inconsistent, insufficient, and
incorrect utterances with regard to these two faculties of the
mind. Finally, it results from the explanations which I myself
have given of these faculties of the mind in the first book and
its Supplements, and more fully in the essay on the principle of
sufficient reason, § 21, 26, and 34,—explanations which are very
definite and distinct, which clearly follow from the consideration
[052]50
[053]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of the nature of our knowledge, and which completely agree with
the conceptions of those two faculties of knowledge that appear
in the language and writings of all ages and all nations, but
were not brought to distinctness. Their defence against the very
different exposition of Kant has, for the most part, been given
already along with the exposure of the errors of that exposition.
Since, however, the table of judgments, which Kant makes the
foundation of his theory of thinking, and indeed of his whole
philosophy, has, in itself, as a whole, its correctness, it is still
incumbent upon me to show how these universal forms of all
judgment arise in our faculty of knowledge, and to reconcile
them with my exposition of it. In this discussion I shall always
attach to the concepts understanding and reason the sense given
them in my explanation, which I therefore assume the reader is
familiar with.
An essential difference between Kant's method and that which
I follow lies in this, that he starts from indirect, reflected
knowledge, while I start from direct or intuitive knowledge. He
may be compared to a man who measures the height of a tower by
its shadow, while I am like him who applies the measuring-rule
directly to the tower itself. Therefore, for him philosophy is a
science of conceptions, but for me it is a science in conceptions,
drawn from knowledge of perception, the one source of all
evidence, and comprehended and made permanent in general
conceptions. He passes over this whole world of perception
which surrounds us, so multifarious and rich in significance, and
confines himself to the forms of abstract thinking; and, although
he never expressly says so, this procedure is founded on the
assumption that reflection is the ectype of all perception, that,
therefore, all that is essential in perception must be expressed in
reflection, and expressed in very contracted forms and outlines,
which are thus easily surveyed. According to this, what is
essential and conformable to law in abstract knowledge would,
as it were, place in our hands all the threads by which the variedAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
51
puppet-show of the world of perception is set in motion before
our eyes. If Kant had only distinctly expressed this first principle
of his method, and then followed it consistently, he would at
least have been obliged to separate clearly the intuitive from the
abstract, and we would not have had to contend with inextricable
contradictions and confusions. But from the way in which he
solves his problem we see that that fundamental principle of his
method was only very indistinctly present to his mind, and thus
we have still to arrive at it by conjecture even after a thorough
study of his philosophy.
Now as concerns the specified method and fundamental
maxim itself, there is much to be said for it, and it is a
brilliant thought. The nature of all science indeed consists
in this, that we comprehend the endless manifold of perceptible
phenomena under comparatively few abstract conceptions, and
out of these construct a system by means of which we have all
those phenomena completely in the power of our knowledge,
can explain the past and determine the future. The sciences,
however, divide the wide sphere of phenomena among them
according to the special and manifold classes of the latter. Now
it was a bold and happy thought to isolate what is absolutely
essential to the conceptions as such and apart from their content,
in order to discover from these forms of all thought found
in this way what is essential to all intuitive knowledge also,
and consequently to the world as phenomenon in general; and
because this would be found a priori on account of the necessity
of those forms of thought, it would be of subjective origin, and
would just lead to the ends Kant had in view. Here, however,
before going further, the relation of reflection to knowledge
of perception ought to have been investigated (which certainly
presupposes the clear separation of the two, which was neglected
by Kant). He ought to have inquired in what way the former
really repeats and represents the latter, whether quite pure, or
changed and to some extent disguised by being taken up into
[054]52
[055]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
its special forms (forms of reflection); whether the form of
abstract reflective knowledge becomes more determined through
the form of knowledge of perception, or through the nature or
constitution which unalterably belongs to itself, i.e., to reflective
knowledge, so that even what is very heterogeneous in intuitive
knowledge can no longer be distinguished when it has entered
reflective knowledge, and conversely many distinctions of which
we are conscious in the reflective method of knowledge have
also sprung from this knowledge itself, and by no means point
to corresponding differences in intuitive knowledge. As the
result of this investigation, however, it would have appeared
that knowledge of perception suffers very nearly as much change
when it is taken up into reflection as food when it is taken into the
animal organism whose forms and compounds are determined by
itself, so that the nature of the food can no longer be recognised
from the result they produce. Or (for this is going a little too far) at
least it would have appeared that reflection is by no means related
to knowledge of perception as the reflection in water is related
to the reflected objects, but scarcely even as the mere shadow
of these objects stands to the objects themselves; which shadow
repeats only a few external outlines, but also unites the most
manifold in the same form and presents the most diverse through
the same outline; so that it is by no means possible, starting
from it, to construe the forms of things with completeness and
certainty.
The whole of reflective knowledge, or the reason, has only
one chief form, and that is the abstract conception. It is proper
to the reason itself, and has no direct necessary connection with
the world of perception, which therefore exists for the brutes
entirely without conceptions, and indeed, even if it were quite
another world from what it is, that form of reflection would
suit it just as well. But the combination of conceptions for
the purpose of judging has certain definite and normal forms,
which have been found by induction, and constitute the table ofAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
53
judgments. These forms are for the most part deducible from
the nature of reflective knowledge itself, thus directly from the
reason, because they spring from the four laws of thought (called
by me metalogical truths) and the dictum de omni et nullo.
Certain others of these forms, however, have their ground in the
nature of knowledge of perception, thus in the understanding; yet
they by no means point to a like number of special forms of the
understanding, but can all be fully deduced from the sole function
which the understanding has—the direct knowledge of cause and
effect. Lastly, still others of these forms have sprung from
the concurrence and combination of the reflective and intuitive
modes of knowledge, or more properly from the assumption of
the latter into the former. I shall now go through the moments
of the judgment one by one, and point out the origin of each
of them in the sources referred to; and from this it follows of
itself that a deduction of categories from them is wanting, and
the assumption of this is just as groundless as its exposition was
found to be entangled and self-conflicting.
1. The so-called Quantity of judgments springs from the nature
of concepts as such. It thus has its ground in the reason alone,
and has absolutely no direct connection with the understanding
and with knowledge of perception. It is indeed, as is explained at
length in the first book, essential to concepts, as such, that they
should have an extent, a sphere, and the wider, less determined
concept includes the narrower and more determined. The latter
can therefore be separated from the former, and this may happen
in two ways,—either the narrower concept may be indicated as
an indefinite part of the wider concept in general, or it may be
defined and completely separated by means of the addition of
a special name. The judgment which carries out this operation
is in the first case called a particular, and in the second case an
universal judgment. For example, one and the same part of the
sphere of the concept tree may be isolated through a particular
and through an universal judgment, thus—“Some trees bear gall-
[056]54
[057]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
nuts,” or “All oaks bear gall-nuts.” One sees that the difference
of the two operations is very slight; indeed, that the possibility of
it depends upon the richness of the language. Nevertheless, Kant
has explained this difference as disclosing two fundamentally
different actions, functions, categories of the pure understanding
which determines experience a priori through them.
Finally, a concept may also be used in order to arrive by means
of it at a definite particular idea of perception, from which, as well
as from many others, this concept itself is drawn; this happens
in the singular judgment. Such a judgment merely indicates the
boundary-line between abstract knowledge and knowledge of
perception, and passes directly to the latter, “This tree here bears
gall-nuts.” Kant has made of this also a special category.
After all that has been said there is no need of further polemic
here.
2. In the same way the Quality of the judgment lies entirely
within the province of reason, and is not an adumbration of any
law of that understanding which makes perception possible, i.e.,
it does not point to it. The nature of abstract concepts, which
is just the nature of the reason itself objectively comprehended,
carries with it the possibility of uniting and separating their
spheres, as was already explained in the first book, and upon
this possibility, as their presupposition, rest the universal laws
of thought of identity and contradiction, to which I have given
the name of metalogical truths, because they spring purely from
the reason, and cannot be further explained. They determine
that what is united must remain united, and what is separated
must remain separate, thus that what is established cannot at
the same time be also abolished, and thus they presuppose the
possibility of the combination and separation of spheres, i.e., of
judgment. This, however, lies, according to its form, simply and
solely in the reason, and this form has not, like the content of the
judgments, been brought over from the perceptible knowledge
of the understanding, and therefore there is no correlative orAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
55
analogue of it to be looked for there. After the perception
has been brought about through the understanding and for the
understanding, it exists complete, subject to no doubt nor error,
and therefore knows neither assertion nor denial; for it expresses
itself, and has not, like the abstract knowledge of the reason, its
value and content in its mere relation to something outside of
it, according to the principle of the ground of knowing. It is,
therefore, pure reality; all negation is foreign to its nature, can
only be added on through reflection, and just on this account
remains always in the province of abstract thought.
To the affirmative and negative Kant adds the infinite
judgment, making use of a crotchet of the old scholastics,
an ingeniously invented stop-gap, which does not even require
to be explained, a blind window, such as many others he made
for the sake of his architectonic symmetry.
3. Under the very wide conception of Relation Kant has
brought three entirely different properties of judgments, which
we must, therefore, examine singly, in order to recognise their
origin.
(a.) The hypothetical judgment in general is the abstract
expression of that most universal form of all our knowledge,
the principle of sufficient reason. In my essay on this principle,
I already showed in 1813 that it has four entirely different
meanings, and in each of these originally originates in a different
faculty of knowledge, and also concerns a different class of ideas.
It clearly follows from this, that the source of the hypothetical
judgment in general, of that universal form of thought, cannot
be, as Kant wishes to make it, merely the understanding and
its category of causality; but that the law of causality which,
according to my exposition, is the one form of knowledge
of the pure understanding, is only one of the forms of that
principle which embraces all pure or a priori knowledge—the
principle of sufficient reason—which, on the other hand, in
each of its meanings has this hypothetical form of judgment
[058]56
[059]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
as its expression. We see here, however, very distinctly how
kinds of knowledge which are quite different in their origin and
significance yet appear, if thought in abstracto by the reason,
in one and the same form of combination of concepts and
judgments, and then in this form can no longer be distinguished,
but, in order to distinguish them, we must go back to knowledge
of perception, leaving abstract knowledge altogether. Therefore
the path which was followed by Kant, starting from the point
of view of abstract knowledge, to find the elements and the
inmost spring of intuitive knowledge also, was quite a wrong
one. For the rest, my whole introductory essay on the principle
of sufficient reason is, to a certain extent, to be regarded merely
as a thorough exposition of the significance of the hypothetical
form of judgment; therefore I do not dwell upon it longer here.
(b.) The form of the categorical judgment is nothing but the
form of judgment in general, in its strictest sense. For, strictly
speaking, judging merely means thinking, the combination of, or
the impossibility of combining, the spheres of the concepts.
Therefore the hypothetical and the disjunctive combination
are properly no special forms of the judgment; for they are
only applied to already completed judgments, in which the
combination of the concepts remains unchanged the categorical.
But they again connect these judgments, for the hypothetical form
expresses their dependence upon each other, and the disjunctive
their incompatibility. Mere concepts, however, have only one
class of relations to each other, those which are expressed in
the categorical judgment. The fuller determination, or the sub-
species of this relation, are the intersection and the complete
separateness of the concept-spheres, i.e., thus affirmation and
negation; out of which Kant has made special categories, under
quite a different title, that of quality. Intersection and separateness
have again sub-species, according as the spheres lie within each
other entirely, or only in part, a determination which constitutes
the quantity of the judgments; out of which Kant has againAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
57
made a quite special class of categories. Thus he separates what
is very closely related, and even identical, the easily surveyed
modifications of the one possible relation of mere concepts to
each other, and, on the other hand, unites what is very different
under this title of relation.
Categorical judgments have as their metalogical principle the
laws of thought of identity and contradiction. But the ground
of the connection of the concept-spheres which gives truth to the
judgment, which is nothing but this connection, may be of very
different kinds; and, according to this, the truth of the judgment is
either logical, or empirical, or metaphysical, or metalogical, as is
explained in the introductory essay, § 30-33, and does not require
to be repeated here. But it is apparent from this how very various
the direct cognitions may be, all of which exhibit themselves
in the abstract, through the combination of the spheres of two
concepts, as subject and predicate, and that we can by no means
set up the sole function of the understanding as corresponding
to them and producing them. For example, the judgments,
“Water boils, the sine measures the angle, the will resolves,
business distracts, distinction is difficult,” express through the
same logical form the most different kinds of relations; but from
this we obtain the right, however irregular the beginning may be,
of placing ourselves at the standpoint of abstract knowledge to
analyse direct intuitive knowledge. For the rest, the categorical
judgment springs from knowledge of the understanding proper,
in my sense, only when causation is expressed by it; this is,
however, the case in all judgments which refer to a physical
quality. For if I say, “This body is heavy, hard, fluid, green,
sour, alkaline, organic, &c., &c.,” this always refers to its effect,
and thus is knowledge which is only possible through the pure
understanding. Now, after this, like much which is quite different
from it (for example, the subordination of very abstract concepts),
has been expressed in the abstract through subject and predicate,
these mere relations of concepts have been transferred back to
[060]58
[061]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
knowledge of perception, and it has been supposed that the
subject and predicate of the judgment must have a peculiar and
special correlative in perception, substance and accident. But I
shall show clearly further on that the conception substance has no
other true content than that of the conception matter. Accidents,
however, are quite synonymous with kinds of effects, so that
the supposed knowledge of substance and accident is never
anything more than the knowledge of cause and effect by the
understanding. But the special manner in which the idea of
matter arises is explained partly in § 4 of the first book, and still
more clearly in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason at
the end of § 21, p. 77 (3d ed., p. 82), and in some respects we
shall see it still more closely when we investigate the principle
of the permanence of substance.
(c.) Disjunctive judgments spring from the law of thought of
excluded third, which is a metalogical truth; they are, therefore,
entirely the property of the reason, and have not their origin in
the understanding. The deduction of the category of community
or reciprocity from them is, however, a glaring example of the
violence which Kant sometimes allowed to be done to truth,
merely in order to satisfy his love of architectonic symmetry.
The illegitimacy of that deduction has already often been justly
condemned and proved upon various grounds, especially by G.
E. Schulze in his “Kritik der theoretischen Philosophie,” and
by Berg in his “Epikritik der Philosophie.” What real analogy
is there, indeed, between the problematical determination of a
concept by disjunctive predicates and the thought of reciprocity?
The two are indeed absolutely opposed, for in the disjunctive
judgment the actual affirmation of one of the two alternative
propositions is also necessarily the negation of the other; if, on
the other hand, we think two things in the relation of reciprocity,
the affirmation of one is also necessarily the affirmation of
the other, and vice versa. Therefore, unquestionably, the real
logical analogue of reciprocity is the vicious circle, for in it,Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
59
as nominally in the case of reciprocity, what is proved is also
the proof, and conversely. And just as logic rejects the vicious
circle, so the conception of reciprocity ought to be banished from
metaphysics. For I now intend, quite seriously, to prove that there
is no reciprocity in the strict sense, and this conception, which
people are so fond of using, just on account of the indefiniteness
of the thought, is seen, if more closely considered, to be empty,
false, and invalid. First of all, the reader must call to mind what
causality really is, and to assist my exposition, see upon this
subject § 20 of the introductory essay, also my prize-essay on
the freedom of the will, chap. iii. p. 27 seq., and lastly the fourth
chapter of the second book of this work. Causality is the law
according to which the conditions or states of matter which appear
determine their position in time. Causality has to do merely with
conditions or states, indeed, properly, only with changes, and
neither with matter as such, nor with permanence without change.
Matter, as such, does not come under the law of causality, for
it neither comes into being nor passes away; thus neither does
the whole thing, as we commonly express ourselves, come under
this law, but only the conditions or states of matter. Further, the
law of causality has nothing to do with permanence, for where
nothing changes there is no producing of effects and no causality,
but a continuing quiet condition or state. But if, now, such a state
is changed, then the new state is either again permanent or it is
not, but immediately introduces a third state, and the necessity
with which this happens is just the law of causality, which is a
form of the principle of sufficient reason, and therefore cannot
be further explained, because the principle of sufficient reason
is the principle of all explanation and of all necessity. From
this it is clear that cause and effect stand in intimate connection
with, and necessary relation to, the course of time. Only because
the state A. precedes in time the state B., and their succession
is necessary and not accidental, i.e., no mere sequence but a
consequence—only because of this is the state A. cause and the
[062]60
[063]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
state B. effect. The conception reciprocity, however, contains
this, that both are cause and both are effect of each other; but
this really amounts to saying that each of the two is the earlier
and also the later; thus it is an absurdity. For that both states
are simultaneous, and indeed necessarily simultaneous, cannot
be admitted, because, as necessarily belonging to each other and
existing at the same time, they constitute only one state. For the
permanence of this state there is certainly required the continued
existence of all its determinations, but we are then no longer
concerned with change and causality, but with duration and rest,
and nothing further is said than that if one determination of the
whole state be changed, the new state which then appears cannot
continue, but becomes the cause of the change of all the other
determinations of the first state, so that a new third state appears;
which all happens merely in accordance with the simple law of
causality, and does not establish a new law, that of reciprocity.
I also definitely assert that the conception reciprocity cannot
be supported by a single example. Everything that one seeks to
pass off as such is either a state of rest, to which the conception of
causality, which has only significance with reference to changes,
finds no application at all, or else it is an alternating succession
of states of the same name which condition each other, for the
explanation of which simple causality is quite sufficient. An
example of the first class is afforded by a pair of scales brought
to rest by equal weights. Here there is no effect produced, for
there is no change; it is a state of rest; gravity acts, equally
divided, as in every body which is supported at its centre of
gravity, but it cannot show its force by any effect. That the
taking away of one weight produces a second state, which at
once becomes the cause of the third, the sinking of the other
scale, happens according to the simple law of cause and effect,
and requires no special category of the understanding, and not
even a special name. An example of the second class is the
continuous burning of a fire. The combination of oxygen withAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
61
the combustible body is the cause of heat, and heat, again, is the
cause of the renewed occurrence of the chemical combination.
But this is nothing more than a chain of causes and effects, the
links of which have alternately the same name. The burning,
A., produces free heat, B., this produces new burning, C. (i.e., a
new effect which has the same name as the cause A., but is not
individually identical with it), this produces new heat, D. (which
is not really identical with the effect B., but only according to
the concept, i.e., it has the same name), and so on indefinitely.
A good example of what in ordinary life is called reciprocity is
afforded by a theory about deserts given by Humboldt (Ansichten
der Natur, 2d ed., vol. ii. p. 79). In the sandy deserts it does not
rain, but it rains upon the wooded mountains surrounding them.
The cause is not the attraction of the clouds by the mountains;
but it is the column of heated air rising from the sandy plain
which prevents the particles of vapour from condensing, and
drives the clouds high into the heavens. On the mountains the
perpendicular rising stream of air is weaker, the clouds descend,
and the rainfall ensues in the cooler air. Thus, want of rain
and the absence of plants in the desert stand in the relation of
reciprocity; it does not rain because the heated sand-plain sends
out more heat; the desert does not become a steppe or prairie
because it does not rain. But clearly we have here again, as in
the example given above, only a succession of causes and effects
of the same names, and throughout nothing essentially different
from simple causality. This is also the case with the swinging of
the pendulum, and indeed also with the self-conservation of the
organised body, in which case likewise every state introduces a
new one, which is of the same kind as that by which it was itself
brought about, but individually is new. Only here the matter is
complicated, because the chain no longer consists of links of two
kinds, but of many kinds, so that a link of the same name only
recurs after several others have intervened. But we always see
before us only an application of the single and simple law of
[064]
[065]62
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
causality which gives the rule to the sequence of states, but never
anything which must be comprehended by means of a new and
special function of the understanding.
[066]
Or is it perhaps advanced in support of the conception of
reciprocity that action and reaction are equal? But the reason
of this is what I urge so strongly and have fully explained in
the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, that the cause
and the effect are not two bodies, but two successive states of
bodies, consequently each of the two states implicates all bodies
concerned; thus the effect, i.e., the newly appearing state, for
example, in the case of an impulse, extends to both bodies in the
same proportion; therefore the body impelled produces just as
great a change in the body impelling as it itself sustains (each in
proportion to its mass and velocity). If one pleases to call this
reciprocity, then absolutely every effect is a reciprocal effect,
and no new conception is introduced on this account, still less
does it require a new function of the understanding, but we only
have a superfluous synonym for causality. But Kant himself,
in a moment of thoughtlessness, exactly expressed this view in
the “Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science” at the
beginning of the proof of the fourth principle of mechanics:
“All external effect in the world is reciprocal effect.” How then
should different functions lie a priori in the understanding for
simple causality and for reciprocity, and, indeed, how should
the real succession of things only be possible and knowable by
means of the first, and their co-existence by means of the second?
According to this, if all effect is reciprocal effect, succession and
simultaneity would be the same thing, and therefore everything
in the world would take place at the same moment. If there were
true reciprocity, then perpetual motion would also be possible,
and indeed a priori certain; but it is rather the case that the
a priori conviction that there is no true reciprocity, and no
corresponding form of the understanding, is the ground of the
assertion that perpetual motion is impossible.Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
63
Aristotle also denies reciprocity in the strict sense; for he
remarks that two things may certainly be reciprocal causes of
each other, but only if this is understood in a different sense of
each of them; for example, that one acts upon the other as the
motive, but the latter acts upon the former as the cause of its
movement. We find in two passages the same words: Physic.,
lib. ii. c. 3, and Metaph., lib. v. c. 2. •ÃÄ1  ́μ Ä11⁄2± o±1

causæ, ut exercitium bonæ habitudinis, et hæc exercitii: at non
eodem modo, sed hæc ut finis, aliud ut principium motus.) If,
besides this, he had accepted a reciprocity proper, he would have
introduced it here, for in both passages he is concerned with
enumerating all the possible kinds of causes. In the Analyt. post.,
lib. ii. c. 11, he speaks of a circle of causes and effects, but not
of reciprocity.
4. The categories of Modality have this advantage over
all others, that what is expressed through each of them really
corresponds to the form of judgment from which it is derived;
which with the other categories is scarcely ever the case, because
for the most part they are deduced from the forms of judgment
with the most capricious violence.
Thus that it is the conceptions of the possible, the actual,
and the necessary which occasion the problematic, assertatory,
and apodictic forms of judgment, is perfectly true; but that
those conceptions are special, original forms of knowledge of
the understanding which cannot be further deduced is not true.
On the contrary, they spring from the single original form
of all knowledge, which is, therefore, known to us a priori,
the principle of sufficient reason; and indeed out of this the
knowledge of necessity springs directly. On the other hand, it
is only because reflection is applied to this that the conceptions
of contingency, possibility, impossibility, and actuality arise.
[067]64
[068]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Therefore all these do not by any means spring from one faculty
of the mind, the understanding, but arise through the conflict of
abstract and intuitive knowledge, as will be seen directly.
I hold that to be necessary and to be the consequent of
a given reason are absolutely interchangeable notions, and
completely identical. We can never know, nor even think,
anything as necessary, except so far as we regard it as the
consequent of a given reason; and the conception of necessity
contains absolutely nothing more than this dependence, this being
established through something else, and this inevitable following
from it. Thus it arises and exists simply and solely through the
application of the principle of sufficient reason. Therefore, there
is, according to the different forms of this principle, a physical
necessity (the effect from the cause), a logical (through the
ground of knowing, in analytical judgments, syllogisms, &c.),
a mathematical (according to the ground of being in time and
space), and finally a practical necessity, by which we intend
to signify not determination through a pretended categorical
imperative, but the necessary occurrence of an action according
to the motives presented, in the case of a given empirical
character. But everything necessary is only so relatively, that
is, under the presupposition of the reason from which it follows;
therefore absolute necessity is a contradiction. With regard to
the rest, I refer to § 49 of the essay on the principle of sufficient
reason.
The contradictory opposite, i.e., the denial of necessity, is
contingency. The content of this conception is, therefore,
negative—nothing more than this: absence of the connection
expressed by the principle of sufficient reason. Consequently
the contingent is also always merely relative. It is contingent in
relation to something which is not its reason. Every object, of
whatever kind it may be—for example, every event in the actual
world—is always at once necessary and contingent, necessary
in relation to the one condition which is its cause: contingentAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
65
in relation to everything else. For its contact in time and space
with everything else is a mere coincidence without necessary
connection: hence also the words chance, ÃÅ1⁄4ÀÄÉ1⁄4±, contingens.
Therefore an absolute contingency is just as inconceivable as an
absolute necessity. For the former would be simply an object
which stood to no other in the relation of consequent to its
reason. But the inconceivability of such a thing is just the content
of the principle of sufficient reason negatively expressed, and
therefore this principle must first be upset before we can think
an absolute contingency; and even then it itself would have lost
all significance, for the conception of contingency has meaning
only in relation to that principle, and signifies that two objects do
not stand to each other in the relation of reason and consequent.
In nature, which consists of ideas of perception, everything that
happens is necessary; for it proceeds from its cause. If, however,
we consider this individual with reference to everything else
which is not its cause, we know it as contingent; but this is
already an abstract reflection. Now, further, let us abstract
entirely from a natural object its causal relation to everything
else, thus its necessity and its contingency; then this kind of
knowledge comprehends the conception of the actual, in which
one only considers the effect, without looking for the cause, in
relation to which one would otherwise have to call it necessary,
and in relation to everything else contingent. All this rests
ultimately upon the fact that the modality of the judgment does
not indicate so much the objective nature of things as the relation
of our knowledge to them. Since, however, in nature everything
proceeds from a cause, everything actual is also necessary, yet
only so far as it is at this time, in this place; for only so far
does determination by the law of causality extend. Let us leave,
however, concrete nature and pass over to abstract thinking; then
we can present to ourselves in reflection all the natural laws which
are known to us partly a priori, partly only a posteriori, and this
abstract idea contains all that is in nature at any time, in any
[069]66
[070]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
place, but with abstraction from every definite time and place;
and just in this way, through such reflection, we have entered the
wide kingdom of the possible. But what finds no place even here
is the impossible. It is clear that possibility and impossibility
exist only for reflection, for abstract knowledge of the reason,
not for knowledge of perception; although it is the pure forms of
perception which supply the reason with the determination of the
possible and impossible. According as the laws of nature, from
which we start in the thought of the possible and impossible, are
known a priori or a posteriori, is the possibility or impossibility
metaphysical or physical.
From this exposition, which requires no proof because it rests
directly upon the knowledge of the principle of sufficient reason
and upon the development of the conceptions of the necessary,
the actual, and the possible, it is sufficiently evident how entirely
groundless is Kant's assumption of three special functions of the
understanding for these three conceptions, and that here again
he has allowed himself to be disturbed by no reflection in the
carrying out of his architectonic symmetry.
To this, however, we have to add the other great mistake, that,
certainly according to the procedure of earlier philosophy, he has
confounded the conceptions of necessity and contingency with
each other. That earlier philosophy has applied abstraction to
the following mistaken use. It was clear that that of which the
reason is given inevitably follows, i.e., cannot not be, and thus
necessarily is. But that philosophy held to this last determination
alone, and said that is necessary which cannot be otherwise,
or the opposite of which is impossible. It left, however, the
ground and root of such necessity out of account, overlooked
the relativity of all necessity which follows from it, and thereby
made the quite unthinkable fiction of an absolute necessity, i.e.,
of something the existence of which would be as inevitable as
the consequent of a reason, but which yet was not the consequent
of a reason, and therefore depended upon nothing; an additionAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

which is an absurd petitio, for it conflicts with the principle of
sufficient reason. Now, starting from this fiction, it explained,
in diametrical opposition to the truth, all that is established by a
reason as contingent, because it looked at the relative nature of its
necessity and compared this with that entirely imaginary absolute
necessity, which is self-contradictory in its conception.5 Now
Kant adheres to this fundamentally perverse definition of the
contingent and gives it as explanation. (Critique of Pure Reason,
V. p. 289-291, 243. V. 301, 419. V. 447, 486, 488.) He falls
indeed into the most evident contradiction with himself upon this
point, for on p. 301 he says: “Everything contingent has a cause,”
and adds, “That is contingent which might possibly not be.” But
whatever has a cause cannot possibly not be: thus it is necessary.
For the rest, the source of the whole of this false explanation of
the necessary and the contingent is to be found in Aristotle in
“De Generatione et Corruptione,” lib. ii. c. 9 et 11, where the
necessary is explained as that which cannot possibly not be: there
stands in opposition to it that which cannot possibly be, and
between these two lies that which can both be and not be,—thus
that which comes into being and passes away, and this would then
be the contingent. In accordance with what has been said above,
it is clear that this explanation, like so many of Aristotle's, has
resulted from sticking to abstract conceptions without going back
to the concrete and perceptible, in which, however, the source
5
Cf. Christian Wolf's “Vernünftige Gedanken von Gott, Welt und Seele,” §
577-579. It is strange that he only explains as contingent what is necessary
according to the principle of sufficient reason of becoming, i.e., what takes
place from causes, and on the contrary recognises as necessary that which is so
according to the other forms of the principle of sufficient reason; for example,
what follows from the essentia (definition), thus analytical judgments, and
further also mathematical truths. The reason he assigns for this is, that only
the law of causality gives infinite series, while the other kinds of grounds give
only finite series. Yet this is by no means the case with the forms of the
principle of sufficient reason in pure space and time, but only holds good of the
logical ground of knowledge; but he held mathematical necessity to be such
also. Compare the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 50.
[071]68
[072]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of all abstract conceptions lies, and by which therefore they
must always be controlled. “Something which cannot possibly
not be” can certainly be thought in the abstract, but if we go
with it to the concrete, the real, the perceptible, we find nothing
to support the thought, even as possible,—as even merely the
asserted consequent of a given reason, whose necessity is yet
relative and conditioned.
I take this opportunity of adding a few further remarks on
these conceptions of modality. Since all necessity rests upon
the principle of sufficient reason, and is on this account relative,
all apodictic judgments are originally, and according to their
ultimate significance, hypothetical. They become categorical
only through the addition of an assertatory minor, thus in the
conclusion. If this minor is still undecided, and this indecision is
expressed, this gives the problematical judgment.
What in general (as a rule) is apodictic (a law of nature),
is in reference to a particular case only problematical, because
the condition must actually appear which brings the case under
the rule. And conversely, what in the particular as such is
necessary (apodictic) (every particular change necessary through
the cause), is again in general, and predicated universally, only
problematical; because the causes which appear only concern the
particular case, and the apodictic, always hypothetical judgment,
always expresses merely the general law, not the particular case
directly. All this has its ground in the fact that possibility exists
only in the province of reflection and for the reason; the actual,
in the province of perception and for the understanding; the
necessary, for both. Indeed, the distinction between necessary,
actual, and possible really exists only in the abstract and according
to the conception; in the real world, on the other hand, all three
fall into one. For all that happens, happens necessarily, because
it happens from causes; but these themselves have again causes,
so that the whole of the events of the world, great and small,
are a strict concatenation of necessary occurrences. AccordinglyAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
69
everything actual is also necessary, and in the real world there is
no difference between actuality and necessity, and in the same
way no difference between actuality and possibility; for what
has not happened, i.e., has not become actual, was also not
possible, because the causes without which it could never appear
have not themselves appeared, nor could appear, in the great
concatenation of causes; thus it was an impossibility. Every
event is therefore either necessary or impossible. All this holds
good only of the empirically real world, i.e., the complex of
individual things, thus of the whole particular as such. If, on
the other hand, we consider things generally, comprehending
them in abstracto, necessity, actuality, and possibility are again
separated; we then know everything which is in accordance with
the a priori laws which belong to our intellect as possible in
general; that which corresponds to the empirical laws of nature
as possible in this world, even if it has never become actual; thus
we distinguish clearly the possible from the actual. The actual is
in itself always also necessary, but is only comprehended as such
by him who knows its cause; regarded apart from this, it is and
is called contingent. This consideration also gives us the key to
that contentio ÀμÁ1  ́Å1⁄2±ÄÉ1⁄2 between the Megaric Diodorus and
Chrysippus the Stoic which Cicero refers to in his book De Fato.
Diodorus says: “Only what becomes actual was possible, and all
that is actual is also necessary.” Chrysippus on the other hand
says: “Much that is possible never becomes actual; for only the
necessary becomes actual.” We may explain this thus: Actuality
is the conclusion of a syllogism to which possibility gives the
premises. But for this is required not only the major but also
the minor; only the two give complete possibility. The major
gives a merely theoretical, general possibility in abstracto, but
this of itself does not make anything possible, i.e., capable of
becoming actual. For this the minor also is needed, which gives
the possibility for the particular case, because it brings it under
the rule, and thereby it becomes at once actual. For example:
[073]70
[074]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Maj. All houses (consequently also my house) can be
destroyed by fire.
Min. My house is on fire.
Concl. My house is being destroyed by fire.
For every general proposition, thus every major, always
determines things with reference to actuality only under a
presupposition, therefore hypothetically; for example, the
capability of being burnt down has as a presupposition the
catching fire. This presupposition is produced in the minor. The
major always loads the cannon, but only if the minor brings the
match does the shot, i.e., the conclusion, follow. This holds
good throughout of the relation of possibility to actuality. Since
now the conclusion, which is the assertion of actuality, always
follows necessarily, it is evident from this that all that is actual
is also necessary, which can also be seen from the fact that
necessity only means being the consequent of a given reason:
this is in the case of the actual a cause: thus everything actual
is necessary. Accordingly, we see here the conceptions of the
possible, the actual, and the necessary unite, and not merely
the last presuppose the first, but also the converse. What keeps
them apart is the limitation of our intellect through the form of
time; for time is the mediator between possibility and actuality.
The necessity of the particular event may be fully seen from the
knowledge of all its causes; but the concurrence of the whole of
these different and independent causes seems to us contingent;
indeed their independence of each other is just the conception of
contingency. Since, however, each of them was the necessary
effect of its causes, the chain of which has no beginning, it is
evident that contingency is merely a subjective phenomenon,
arising from the limitation of the horizon of our understanding,
and just as subjective as the optical horizon at which the heavens
touch the earth.
Since necessity is the same thing as following from given
grounds, it must appear in a special way in the case of every formAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
71
of the principle of sufficient reason, and also have its opposite
in the possibility and impossibility which always arises only
through the application of the abstract reflection of the reason
to the object. Therefore the four kinds of necessity mentioned
above stand opposed to as many kinds of impossibility, physical,
logical, mathematical and practical. It may further be remarked
that if one remains entirely within the province of abstract
concepts, possibility is always connected with the more general,
and necessity with the more limited concept; for example, “An
animal may be a bird, a fish, an amphibious creature, &c.”
“A nightingale must be a bird, a bird must be an animal, an
animal must be an organism, an organism must be a body.”
This is because logical necessity, the expression of which is the
syllogism, proceeds from the general to the particular, and never
conversely. In the concrete world of nature (ideas of the first
class), on the contrary, everything is really necessary through
the law of causality; only added reflection can conceive it as
also contingent, comparing it with that which is not its cause,
and also as merely and purely actual, by disregarding all causal
connection. Only in this class of ideas does the conception of the
actual properly occur, as is also shown by the derivation of the
word from the conception of causality. In the third class of ideas,
that of pure mathematical perception or intuition, if we confine
ourselves strictly to it, there is only necessity. Possibility occurs
here also only through relation to the concepts of reflection:
for example, “A triangle may be right-angled, obtuse-angled, or
equiangular; its three angles must be equal to two right-angles.”
Thus here we only arrive at the possible through the transition
from the perceptible to the abstract.
After this exposition, which presupposes the recollection of
what was said both in the essay on the principle of sufficient
reason and in the first book of the present work, there will, it is
hoped, be no further doubt as to the true and very heterogeneous
source of those forms which the table of judgments lays before
[075]72
[076]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
us, nor as to the inadmissibility and utter groundlessness of the
assumption of twelve special functions of the understanding for
the explanation of them. The latter point is also supported by
a number of special circumstances very easily noted. Thus, for
example, it requires great love of symmetry and much trust in a
clue derived from it, to lead one to assume that an affirmative, a
categorical, and an assertatory judgment are three such different
things that they justify the assumption of an entirely special
function of the understanding for each of them.
Kant himself betrays his consciousness of the untenable nature
of his doctrine of the categories by the fact that in the third chapter
of the Analytic of Principles (phænomena et noumena) several
long passages of the first edition (p. 241, 242, 244-246, 248-
253) are omitted in the second—passages which displayed the
weakness of that doctrine too openly. So, for example, he says
there (p. 241) that he has not defined the individual categories,
because he could not define them even if he had wished to do
so, inasmuch as they were susceptible of no definition. In saying
this he forgot that at p. 82 of the same first edition he had said: “I
purposely dispense with the definition of the categories although
I may be in possession of it.” This then was, sit venia verbo,
wind. But this last passage he has allowed to stand. And so all
those passages wisely omitted afterwards betray the fact that
nothing distinct can be thought in connection with the categories,
and this whole doctrine stands upon a weak foundation.
This table of the categories is now made the guiding clue
according to which every metaphysical, and indeed every
scientific inquiry is to be conducted (Prolegomena, § 39). And,
in fact, it is not only the foundation of the whole Kantian
philosophy and the type according to which its symmetry is
everywhere carried out, as I have already shown above, but it has
also really become the procrustean bed into which Kant forces
every possible inquiry, by means of a violence which I shall now
consider somewhat more closely. But with such an opportunityAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
73
what must not the imitatores servum pecus have done! We have
seen. That violence then is applied in this way. The meaning
of the expressions denoted by the titles, forms of judgment and
categories, is entirely set aside and forgotten, and the expressions
alone are retained. These have their source partly in Aristotle's
Analyt. priora, i. 23 (ÀμÁ1 À¿1¿Ä·Ä¿Â o±1 À¿Ã¿Ä·Ä¿Â ÄÉ1⁄2
Ä¿Å ÃÅ»»¿31Ã1⁄4¿Å AÁÉ1⁄2: de qualitate et quantitate terminorum
syllogismi), but are arbitrarily chosen; for the extent of the
concepts might certainly have been otherwise expressed than
through the word quantity, though this word is more suited to its
object than the rest of the titles of the categories. Even the word
quality has obviously been chosen on account of the custom of
opposing quality to quantity; for the name quality is certainly
taken arbitrarily enough for affirmation and negation. But now
in every inquiry instituted by Kant, every quantity in time and
space, and every possible quality of things, physical, moral,
&c., is brought by him under those category titles, although
between these things and those titles of the forms of judgment
and of thought there is absolutely nothing in common except the
accidental and arbitrary nomenclature. It is needful to keep in
mind all the respect which in other regards is due to Kant to enable
one to refrain from expressing in hard terms one's repugnance
to this procedure. The nearest example is afforded us at once by
the pure physiological table of the general principles of natural
science. What in all the world has the quantity of judgments to do
with the fact that every perception has an extensive magnitude?
What has the quality of judgments to do with the fact that
every sensation has a degree? The former rests rather on the
fact that space is the form of our external perception, and the
latter is nothing more than an empirical, and, moreover, entirely
subjective feeling, drawn merely from the consideration of the
nature of our organs of sense. Further, in the table which gives
the basis of rational psychology (Critique of Pure Reason, p. 344;
V. 402), the simplicity of the soul is cited under quality; but this
[077]74
[078]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
is just a quantitative property, and has absolutely no relation to
the affirmation or negation in the judgment. But quantity had to
be completed by the unity of the soul, which is, however, already
included in its simplicity. Then modality is forced in in an
absurd way; the soul stands in connection with possible objects;
but connection belongs to relation, only this is already taken
possession of by substance. Then the four cosmological Ideas,
which are the material of the antinomies, are referred to the titles
of the categories; but of this we shall speak more fully further on,
when we come to the examination of these antinomies. Several,
if possible, still more glaring examples are to be found in the
table of the Categories of Freedom! in the “Critique of Practical
Reason;” also in the first book of the “Critique of Judgment,”
which goes through the judgment of taste according to the four
titles of the categories; and, finally, in the “Metaphysical First
Principles of Natural Science,” which are entirely adapted to the
table of the categories, whereby the false that is mingled here and
there with what is true and excellent in this important work is for
the most part introduced. See, for example, at the end of the first
chapter how the unity, the multiplicity, and the totality of the
directions of lines are supposed to correspond to the categories,
which are so named according to the quantity of judgments.
The principle of the Permanence of Substance is deduced
from the category of subsistence and inherence. This, however,
we know only from the form of the categorical judgment, i.e.,
from the connection of two concepts as subject and predicate.
With what violence then is that great metaphysical principle
made dependent upon this simple, purely logical form! Yet this
is only done pro forma, and for the sake of symmetry. The
proof of this principle, which is given here, sets entirely aside
its supposed origin in the understanding and in the category, and
is based upon the pure intuition or perception of time. But this
proof also is quite incorrect. It is false that in mere time there isAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
75
simultaneity and duration; these ideas only arise from the union
of space with time, as I have already shown in the essay on
the principle of sufficient reason, § 18, and worked out more
fully in § 4 of the present work. I must assume a knowledge of
both these expositions for the understanding of what follows. It
is false that time remains the same through all change; on the
contrary, it is just time itself that is fleeting; a permanent time is
a contradiction. Kant's proof is untenable, strenuously as he has
supported it with sophisms; indeed, he falls into the most palpable
contradictions. Thus, after he has falsely set up co-existence as
a mode of time (p. 177; V. 219), he says, quite rightly (p.
183; V. 226), “Co-existence is not a mode of time, for in time
there are absolutely no parts together, but all in succession.”
In truth, space is quite as much implicated in co-existence as
time. For if two things are co-existent and yet not one, they
are different in respect of space; if two states of one thing are
co-existent (e.g., the glow and the heat of iron), then they are
two contemporaneous effects of one thing, therefore presuppose
matter, and matter presupposes space. Strictly speaking, co-
existence is a negative determination, which merely signifies
that two things or states are not different in respect of time; thus
their difference is to be sought for elsewhere. But in any case,
our knowledge of the permanence of substance, i.e., of matter,
must be based upon insight a priori; for it is raised above all
doubt, and therefore cannot be drawn from experience. I deduce
it from the fact that the principle of all becoming and passing
away, the law of causality, of which we are conscious a priori, is
essentially concerned only with the changes, i.e., the successive
states of matter, is thus limited to the form, and leaves the matter
untouched, which therefore exists in our consciousness as the
foundation of all things, which is not subject to becoming or
passing away, which has therefore always been and will always
continue to be. A deeper proof of the permanence of substance,
drawn from the analysis of our perception of the empirical world
[079]76
[080]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
in general, is to be found in the first book of this work, §
4, where it is shown that the nature of matter consists in the
absolute union of space and time, a union which is only possible
by means of the idea of causality, consequently only for the
understanding, which is nothing but the subjective correlative of
causality. Hence, also, matter is never known otherwise than as
producing effects, i.e., as through and through causality; to be
and to act are with it one, which is indeed signified by the word
actuality. Intimate union of space and time—causality, matter,
actuality—are thus one, and the subjective correlative of this one
is the understanding. Matter must bear in itself the conflicting
properties of both factors from which it proceeds, and it is the
idea of causality which abolishes what is contradictory in both,
and makes their co-existence conceivable by the understanding,
through which and for which alone matter is, and whose whole
faculty consists in the knowledge of cause and effect. Thus for
the understanding there is united in matter the inconstant flux
of time, appearing as change of the accidents, with the rigid
immobility of space, which exhibits itself as the permanence of
substance. For if the substance passed away like the accidents,
the phenomenon would be torn away from space altogether, and
would only belong to time; the world of experience would be
destroyed by the abolition of matter, annihilation. Thus from
the share which space has in matter, i.e., in all phenomena of
the actual—in that it is the opposite and counterpart of time,
and therefore in itself and apart from the union with the latter
knows absolutely no change—the principle of the permanence
of substance, which recognises everything as a priori certain,
had to be deduced and explained; but not from mere time, to
which for this purpose and quite erroneously Kant has attributed
permanence.
In the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 23, I have
fully explained the incorrectness of the following proof of the a
priori nature and of the necessity of the law of causality fromAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
77
the mere succession of events in time; I must, therefore, content
myself here by referring to that passage.6 This is precisely the
case with the proof of reciprocity also, the concept of which I
was obliged to explain above as invalid. What is necessary has
also been said of modality, the working out of the principles of
which now follows.
There are still a few points in the further course of the
transcendental analytic which I should have to refute were it
not that I am afraid of trying the patience of the reader; I
therefore leave them to his own reflection. But ever anew
in the “Critique of Pure Reason” we meet that principal and
fundamental error of Kant's, which I have copiously denounced
above, the complete failure to distinguish abstract, discursive
knowledge from intuitive. It is this that throws a constant
obscurity over Kant's whole theory of the faculty of knowledge,
and never allows the reader to know what he is really speaking
about at any time, so that instead of understanding, he always
merely conjectures, for he alternately tries to understand what is
said as referring to thought and to perception, and remains always
in suspense. In the chapter “On the Division of all Objects into
Phenomena and Noumena,” Kant carries that incredible want
of reflection as to the nature of the idea of perception and the
abstract idea, as I shall explain more fully immediately, so far
as to make the monstrous assertion that without thought, that
is, without abstract conceptions, there is no knowledge of an
object; and that perception, because it is not thought, is also not
knowledge, and, in general, is nothing but a mere affection of
sensibility, mere sensation! Nay, more, that perception without
conception is absolutely void; but conception without perception
is yet always something (p. 253; V. 309). Now this is exactly
the opposite of the truth; for concepts obtain all significance,
6
With my refutation of the Kantian proof may be compared the earlier attacks
upon it by Feder, Ueber Zeit, Raum und Kausalität, § 28; and by G. E. Schulze,
Kritik der theoretischen Philosophie, Bd. ii. S. 422-442.
[081]78
[082]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
all content, only from their relation to ideas of perception, from
which they have been abstracted, derived, that is, constructed
through the omission of all that is unessential: therefore if the
foundation of perception is taken away from them, they are
empty and void. Perceptions, on the contrary, have in themselves
immediate and very great significance (in them, indeed, the thing
in itself objectifies itself); they represent themselves, express
themselves, have no mere borrowed content like concepts. For
the principle of sufficient reason governs them only as the law
of causality, and determines as such only their position in space
and time; it does not, however, condition their content and their
significance, as is the case with concepts, in which it appears as
the principle of the ground of knowing. For the rest, it looks as
if Kant really wished here to set about distinguishing the idea
of perception and the abstract idea. He objects to Leibnitz and
Locke that the former reduced everything to abstract ideas, and
the latter everything to ideas of perception. But yet he arrives at
no distinction; and although Locke and Leibnitz really committed
these errors, Kant himself is burdened with a third error which
includes them both—the error of having so mixed up knowledge
of perception and abstract knowledge that a monstrous hybrid of
the two resulted, a chimera of which no distinct idea is possible,
and which therefore necessarily only confused and stupefied
students, and set them at variance.
Certainly thought and perception are separated more in
the chapter referred to “On the Division of all Objects into
Phenomena and Noumena” than anywhere else, but the nature
of this distinction is here a fundamentally false one. On p.
253; V. 309, it is said: “If I take away all thought (through the
categories) from empirical knowledge, there remains absolutely
no knowledge of an object, for through mere perception nothing
at all is thought, and that this affection of sensibility is in me
establishes really no relation of such ideas to any object.” This
sentence contains, in some degree, all the errors of Kant in aAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
79
nutshell; for it brings out clearly that he has falsely conceived
the relation between sensation, perception, and thought, and
accordingly identifies the perception, whose form he yet supposes
to be space, and indeed space in all its three dimensions, with the
mere subjective sensation in the organs of sense, but only allows
the knowledge of an object to be given through thought, which is
different from perception. I, on the contrary, say: Objects are first
of all objects of perception, not of thought, and all knowledge of
objects is originally and in itself perception. Perception, however,
is by no means mere sensation, but the understanding is already
active in it. The thought, which is added only in the case of men,
not in the case of the brutes, is mere abstraction from perception,
gives no fundamentally new knowledge, does not itself establish
objects which were not before, but merely changes the form of the
knowledge already won through perception, makes it abstract
knowledge in concepts, whereby its concrete or perceptible
character is lost, but, on the other hand, combination of it
becomes possible, which immeasurably extends the range of its
applicability. The material of our thought is, on the other hand,
nothing else than our perceptions themselves, and not something
which the perceptions did not contain, and which was added by
the thought; therefore the material of everything that appears in
our thought must be capable of verification in our perception, for
otherwise it would be an empty thought. Although this material
is variously manipulated and transformed by thought, it must yet
be capable of being reduced to perception, and the thought traced
back to this—just as a piece of gold can be reduced from all its
solutions, oxides, sublimates, and combinations, and presented
pure and undiminished. This could not happen if thought itself
had added something, and, indeed, the principal thing, to the
object.
The whole of the chapter on the Amphiboly, which follows
this, is merely a criticism of the Leibnitzian philosophy, and as
such is on the whole correct, though the form or pattern on which
[083]80
[084]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
it is constructed is chosen merely for the sake of architectonic
symmetry, which here also is the guiding clue. Thus, to carry
out the analogy with the Aristotelian Organon, a transcendental
Topic is set up, which consists in this, that every conception
is to be considered from four points of view, in order to make
out to which faculty of knowledge it belongs. But these four
points of view are quite arbitrarily selected, and ten others might
be added to them with just as much right; but their fourfold
number corresponds to the titles of the categories, and therefore
the chief doctrine of Leibnitz is divided among them as best it
may be. By this critique, also, to some extent, certain errors are
stamped as natural to the reason, whereas they were merely false
abstractions of Leibnitz's, who, rather than learn from his great
philosophical contemporaries, Spinoza and Locke, preferred to
serve up his own strange inventions. In the chapter on the
Amphiboly of Reflection it is finally said that there may possibly
be a kind of perception entirely different from ours, to which,
however, our categories are applicable; therefore the objects of
that supposed perception would be noumena, things which can
only be thought by us; but since the perception which would give
that thought meaning is wanting to us, and indeed is altogether
quite problematical, the object of that thought would also merely
be a wholly indefinite possibility. I have shown above by
quotations that Kant, in utter contradiction with himself, sets up
the categories now as the condition of knowledge of perception,
now as the function of merely abstract thought. Here they
appear exclusively in the latter sense, and it seems quite as if
he wished to attribute them merely to discursive thought. But
if this is really his opinion, then necessarily at the beginning
of the Transcendental Logic, before specifying the different

it from perception; he ought to have shown what knowledge

thought. Then we would have known what he was really speaking
about; or rather, he would then have spoken quite differently,
first of perception, and then of thought; instead of which, as it is,
he is always dealing with something between the two, which is a
mere delusion. There would not then be that great gap between
the transcendental Æsthetic and the transcendental Logic, where,
after the exposition of the mere form of perception, he simply
dismisses its content, all that is empirically apprehended, with the
phrase “It is given,” and does not ask how it came about, whether
with or without understanding; but, with one spring, passes over
to abstract thought; and not even to thought in general, but at
once to certain forms of thought, and does not say a word about
what thought is, what the concept is, what is the relation of
abstract and discursive to concrete and intuitive, what is the
difference between the knowledge of men and that of brutes, and
what is reason.
Yet it was just this distinction between abstract knowledge and
knowledge of perception, entirely overlooked by Kant, which
the ancients denoted by Æ±11⁄2¿1⁄4μ1⁄2± and 1⁄2¿¿Å1⁄4μ1⁄2±,7 and whose
opposition and incommensurability occupied them so much in
the philosophemes of the Eleatics, in Plato's doctrine of Ideas,
in the dialectic of the Megarics, and later the Scholastics in
the controversy between Nominalism and Realism, the seed
of which, so late in developing, was already contained in the
opposite mental tendencies of Plato and Aristotle. But Kant,
who, in an inexcusable manner, entirely neglected the thing to
denote which the words Æ±11⁄2¿1⁄4μ1⁄2± and 1⁄2¿¿Å1⁄4μ1⁄2± had already
been taken, took possession of the words, as if they were still
unappropriated, in order to denote by them his thing in itself and
his phenomenon.

The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Since I have been obliged to reject Kant's doctrine of the
categories, just as he rejected that of Aristotle, I wish here to
indicate as a suggestion a third way of reaching what is aimed
at. What both Kant and Aristotle sought for under the name of
the categories were the most general conceptions under which all
things, however different, must be subsumed, and through which
therefore everything that exists would ultimately be thought. Just
on this account Kant conceived them as the forms of all thought.
[086]
Grammar is related to logic as clothes to the body. Should
not, therefore, these primary conceptions, the ground-bass of
the reason, which is the foundation of all special thought,
without whose application, therefore, no thought can take place,
ultimately lie in those conceptions which just on account of their
exceeding generality (transcendentalism) have their expression
not in single words, but in whole classes of words, because
one of them is thought along with every word whatever it may
be, whose designation would therefore have to be looked for,
not in the lexicon but in the grammar? In fact, should they
not be those distinctions of conceptions on account of which
the word which expresses them is either a substantive or an
adjective, a verb or an adverb, a pronoun, a preposition, or some
other particle—in short, the parts of speech? For undoubtedly
these denote the forms which all thought primarily assumes, and
in which it directly moves; accordingly they are the essential
forms of speech, the fundamental constituent elements of every
language, so that we cannot imagine any language which would
not consist of at least substantives, adjectives, and verbs. These
fundamental forms would then have subordinated to them those
forms of thought which are expressed through their inflections,
that is, through declension and conjugation, and it is unessential
to the chief concern whether in denoting them we call in the
assistance of the article and the pronoun. We will examine the
thing, however, somewhat more closely, and ask the question
anew: What are the forms of thought?Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
83
(1.) Thought consists throughout of judging; judgments are
the threads of its whole web, for without making use of a verb
our thought does not move, and as often as we use a verb we
judge.
(2.) Every judgment consists in the recognition of the relation
between subject and predicate, which it separates or unites with
various restrictions. It unites them from the recognition of the
actual identity of the two, which can only happen in the case of
synonyms; then in the recognition that the one is always thought
along with the other, though the converse does not hold—in the
universal affirmative proposition; up to the recognition that the
one is sometimes thought along with the other, in the particular
affirmative proposition. The negative propositions take the
opposite course. Accordingly in every judgment the subject, the
predicate, and the copula, the latter affirmative or negative, must
be to be found; even although each of these is not denoted by a
word of its own, as is however generally the case. The predicate
and the copula are often denoted by one word, as “Caius ages;”
sometimes one word denotes all three, as concurritur, i.e., “the
armies engage.” From this it is evident that the forms of thought
are not to be sought for precisely and directly in words, nor even
in the parts of speech, for even in the same language the same
judgment may be expressed in different words, and indeed in
different parts of speech, yet the thought remains the same, and
consequently also its form; for the thought could not be the same
if the form of thought itself were different. But with the same
thought and the same form of thought the form of words may
very well be different, for it is merely the outward clothing of
the thought, which, on the other hand, is inseparable from its
form. Thus grammar only explains the clothing of the forms of
thought. The parts of speech can therefore be deduced from the
original forms of thought themselves which are independent of
all language; their work is to express these forms of thought in
all their modifications. They are the instrument and the clothing
[087]84
[088]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of the forms of thought, and must be accurately adapted to the
structure of the latter, so that it may be recognised in them.
(3.) These real, unalterable, original forms of thought are
certainly those of Kant's logical table of judgments; only that in
this table are to be found blind windows for the sake of symmetry
and the table of the categories; these must all be omitted, and
also a false arrangement. Thus:—
(a.) Quality: affirmation and negation, i.e., combination and
separation of concepts: two forms. It depends on the copula.
(b.) Quantity: the subject-concept is taken either in whole or
in part: totality or multiplicity. To the first belong also individual
subjects: Socrates means “all Socrateses.” Thus two forms. It
depends on the subject.
(c.) Modality: has really three forms. It determines the quality
as necessary, actual, or contingent. It consequently depends also
on the copula.
These three forms of thought spring from the laws of thought
of contradiction and identity. But from the principle of sufficient
reason and the law of excluded middle springs—
(d.) Relation. It only appears if we judge concerning completed
judgments, and can only consist in this, that it either asserts the
dependence of one judgment upon another (also in the plurality
of both), and therefore combines them in the hypothetical
proposition; or else asserts that judgments exclude each other,
and therefore separates them in the disjunctive proposition. It
depends on the copula, which here separates or combines the
completed judgments.
The parts of speech and grammatical forms are ways
of expressing the three constituent parts of the judgment,
the subject, the predicate, and the copula, and also of the
possible relations of these; thus of the forms of thought just
enumerated, and the fuller determinations and modifications of
these. Substantive, adjective, and verb are therefore essential
fundamental constituent elements of language in general;Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
85
therefore they must be found in all languages. Yet it is possible
to conceive a language in which adjective and verb would always
be fused together, as is sometimes the case in all languages.
Provisionally it may be said, for the expression of the subject
are intended the substantive, the article, and the pronoun; for the
expression of the predicate, the adjective, the adverb, and the
preposition; for the expression of the copula, the verb, which,
however, with the exception of the verb to be, also contains the
predicate. It is the task of the philosophy of grammar to teach the
precise mechanism of the expression of the forms of thought, as
it is the task of logic to teach the operations with the forms of
thought themselves.
Note.—As a warning against a false path and to illustrate
the above, I mention S. Stern's “Vorläufige Grundlage zur
Sprachphilosophie,” 1835, which is an utterly abortive attempt
to construct the categories out of the grammatical forms. He
has entirely confused thought with perception, and therefore,
instead of the categories of thought, he has tried to deduce the
supposed categories of perception from the grammatical forms,
and consequently has placed the grammatical forms in direct
relation to perception. He is involved in the great error that
language is immediately related to perception, instead of being
directly related only to thought as such, thus to the abstract
concepts, and only by means of these to perception, to which
they, however, have a relation which introduces an entire change
of the form. What exists in perception, thus also the relations
which proceed from time and space, certainly becomes an object
of thought; thus there must also be forms of speech to express
it, yet always merely in the abstract, as concepts. Concepts are
always the primary material of thought, and the forms of logic are
always related to these, never directly to perception. Perception
always determines only the material, never the formal truth of
the proposition, for the formal truth is determined according to
the logical rules alone.
[089]86
[090]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
I return to the Kantian philosophy, and come now to the
Transcendental Dialectic. Kant opens it with the explanation of
reason, the faculty which is to play the principal part in it, for
hitherto only sensibility and understanding were on the scene.
When considering his different explanations of reason, I have
already spoken above of the explanation he gives here that “it is
the faculty of principles.” It is now taught here that all the a priori
knowledge hitherto considered, which makes pure mathematics
and pure natural science possible, affords only rules, and no
principles; because it proceeds from perceptions and forms of
knowledge, and not from mere conceptions, which is demanded
if it is to be called a principle. Such a principle must accordingly
be knowledge from pure conceptions and yet synthetical. But
this is absolutely impossible. From pure conceptions nothing
but analytical propositions can ever proceed. If conceptions are
to be synthetically and yet a priori combined, this combination
must necessarily be accomplished by some third thing, through
a pure perception of the formal possibility of experience, just
as synthetic judgments a posteriori are brought about through
empirical perception; consequently a synthetic proposition a
priori can never proceed from pure conceptions. In general,
however, we are a priori conscious of nothing more than the
principle of sufficient reason in its different forms, and therefore
no other synthetic judgments a priori are possible than those
which proceed from that which receives its content from that
principle.
However, Kant finally comes forward with a pretended
principle of the reason answering to his demand, yet only with
this one, from which others afterwards follow as corollaries. It
is the principle which Chr. Wolf set up and explained in his
“Cosmologia,” sect. i. c. 2, § 93, and in his “Ontologia,” § 178.
As now above, under the title of the Amphiboly, mere Leibnitzian
philosophemes were taken for natural and necessary aberrationsAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
87
of the reason, and were criticised as such, so here precisely the
same thing happens with the philosophemes of Wolf. Kant still
presents this principle of the reason in an obscure light, through
indistinctness, indefiniteness, and breaking of it up (p. 307; V.
361, and 322; V. 379). Clearly expressed, however, it is as
follows: “If the conditioned is given, the totality of its conditions
must also be given, and therefore also the unconditioned, through
which alone that totality becomes complete.” We become most
vividly aware of the apparent truth of this proposition if we
imagine the conditions and the conditioned as the links of a
suspended chain, the upper end of which, however, is not visible,
so that it might extend ad infinitum; since, however, the chain
does not fall, but hangs, there must be above one link which
is the first, and in some way is fixed. Or, more briefly: the
reason desires to have a point of attachment for the causal chain
which reaches back to infinity; it would be convenient for it.
But we will examine the proposition, not in figures, but in itself.
Synthetic it certainly is; for, analytically, nothing more follows
from the conception of the conditioned than that of the condition.
It has not, however, a priori truth, nor even a posteriori, but
it surreptitiously obtains its appearance of truth in a very subtle
way, which I must now point out. Immediately, and a priori,
we have the knowledge which the principle of sufficient reason
in its four forms expresses. From this immediate knowledge
all abstract expressions of the principle of sufficient reason are
derived, and they are thus indirect; still more, however, is this
the case with inferences or corollaries from them. I have already
explained above how abstract knowledge often unites a variety
of intuitive cognitions in one form or one concept in such a
way that they can no longer be distinguished; therefore abstract
knowledge stands to intuitive knowledge as the shadow to the real
objects, the great multiplicity of which it presents through one
outline comprehending them all. Now the pretended principle of
the reason makes use of this shadow. In order to deduce from the
[091]88
[092]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
principle of sufficient reason the unconditioned, which directly
contradicts it, it prudently abandons the immediate concrete
knowledge of the content of the principle of sufficient reason
in its particular forms, and only makes use of abstract concepts
which are derived from it, and have value and significance only
through it, in order to smuggle its unconditioned somehow
or other into the wide sphere of those concepts. Its procedure
becomes most distinct when clothed in dialectical form; for
example, thus: “If the conditioned exists, its condition must
also be given, and indeed all given, thus completely, thus the
totality of its conditions; consequently, if they constitute a
series, the whole series, consequently also its first beginning,
thus the unconditioned.” Here it is false that the conditions of
a conditioned can constitute a series. Rather must the totality
of the conditions of everything conditioned be contained in its
nearest ground or reason from which it directly proceeds, and
which is only thus a sufficient ground or reason. For example,
the different determinations of the state which is the cause, all
of which must be present together before the effect can take
place. But the series, for example, the chain of causes, arises
merely from the fact that we regard what immediately before was
the condition as now a conditioned; but then at once the whole
operation begins again from the beginning, and the principle of
sufficient reason appears anew with its claim. But there can never
be for a conditioned a properly successive series of conditions,
which exist merely as such, and on account of that which is at
last conditioned; it is always an alternating series of conditioneds
and conditions; as each link is laid aside the chain is broken, and
the claim of the principle of sufficient reason entirely satisfied,
it arises anew because the condition becomes the conditioned.
Thus the principle of sufficient reason always demands only
the completeness of the immediate or next condition, never
the completeness of a series. But just this conception of the
completeness of the condition leaves it undetermined whetherAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
89
this completeness should be simultaneous or successive; and
since the latter is chosen, the demand now arises for a complete
series of conditions following each other. Only through an
arbitrary abstraction is a series of causes and effects regarded as
a series of causes alone, which exists merely on account of the last
effect, and is therefore demanded as its sufficient reason. From
closer and more intelligent consideration, and by rising from
the indefinite generality of abstraction to the particular definite
reality, it appears, on the contrary, that the demand for a sufficient
reason extends only to the completeness of the determinations
of the immediate cause, not to the completeness of a series.
The demand of the principle of sufficient reason is completely
extinguished in each sufficient reason given. It arises, however,
immediately anew, because this reason is again regarded as a
consequent; but it never demands directly a series of reasons. If,
on the other hand, instead of going to the thing itself, we confine
ourselves to the abstract concepts, these distinctions vanish.
Then a chain of alternating causes and effects, or of alternating
logical reasons and consequents, is given out as simply a chain
of causes of the last effect, or reasons of the last consequent,
and the completeness of the conditions, through which alone a
reason becomes sufficient, appears as the completeness of that
assumed series of reasons alone, which only exist on account of
the last consequent. There then appears the abstract principle of
the reason very boldly with its demand for the unconditioned.
But, in order to recognise the invalidity of this claim, there is
no need of a critique of reason by means of antinomies and their
solution, but only of a critique of reason understood in my sense,
an examination of the relation of abstract knowledge to direct
intuitive knowledge, by means of ascending from the indefinite
generality of the former to the fixed definiteness of the latter.
From such a critique, then, it here appears that the nature of the
reason by no means consists in the demand for an unconditioned;
for, whenever it proceeds with full deliberation, it must itself find
[093]90
[094]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
that an unconditioned is an absurdity. The reason as a faculty of
knowledge can always have to do only with objects; but every
object for the subject is necessarily and irrevocably subordinated
to the principle of sufficient reason, both a parte ante and a
parte post. The validity of the principle of sufficient reason is so
involved in the form of consciousness that we absolutely cannot
imagine anything objective of which no why could further be
demanded; thus we cannot imagine an absolute absolute, like a
blind wall in front of us. That his convenience should lead this or
that person to stop at some point, and assume such an absolute
at pleasure, is of no avail against that incontestable certainty
a priori, even if he should put on an air of great importance
in doing so. In fact, the whole talk about the absolute, almost
the sole theme of philosophies since Kant, is nothing but the
cosmological proof incognito. This proof, in consequence of
the case brought against it by Kant, deprived of all right and
declared outlawed, dare no longer show itself in its true form, and
therefore appears in all kinds of disguises—now in distinguished
form, concealed under intellectual intuition or pure thought; now
as a suspicious vagabond, half begging, half demanding what it
wants in more unpretending philosophemes. If an absolute must
absolutely be had, then I will give one which is far better fitted
to meet all the demands which are made on such a thing than
these visionary phantoms; it is matter. It has no beginning, and
it is imperishable; thus it is really independent, and quod per se
est et per se concipitur; from its womb all proceeds, and to it all
returns; what more can be desired of an absolute? But to those
with whom no critique of reason has succeeded, we should rather
say—
“Are not ye like unto women, who ever
Return to the point from which they set out,
Though reason should have been talked by the hour?”Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
91
That the return to an unconditioned cause, to a first beginning,
by no means lies in the nature of reason, is, moreover, practically
proved by the fact that the primitive religions of our race, which
even yet have the greatest number of followers upon earth,
Brahmanism and Buddhaism, neither know nor admit such
assumptions, but carry the series of phenomena conditioning
each other into infinity. Upon this point, I refer to the note
appended to the criticism of the first antinomy, which occurs
further on; and the reader may also see Upham's “Doctrine of
Buddhaism” (p. 9), and in general all genuine accounts of the
religions of Asia. Judaism and reason ought not to be identified.
Kant, who by no means desires to maintain his pretended
principle of reason as objectively valid, but merely as subjectively
necessary, deduces it even as such only by means of a shallow
sophism, p. 307; V. 364. He says that because we seek to
subsume every truth known to us under a more general truth, as
far as this process can be carried, this is nothing else than the
pursuit of the unconditioned, which we already presuppose. But,
in truth, in this endeavour we do nothing more than apply reason,
and intentionally make use of it to simplify our knowledge by
enabling us to survey it—reason, which is that faculty of abstract,
general knowledge that distinguishes the reflective, thinking man,
endowed with speech, from the brute, which is the slave of the
present. For the use of reason just consists in this, that we know
the particular through the universal, the case through the rule, the
rule through the more general rule; thus that we seek the most
general points of view. Through such survey or general view our
knowledge is so facilitated and perfected that from it arises the
great difference between the life of the brutes and that of men, and
again between the life of educated and that of uneducated men.
Now, certainly the series of grounds of knowledge, which exist
only in the sphere of the abstract, thus of reason, always finds an
end in what is indemonstrable, i.e., in an idea which is not further
conditioned according to this form of the principle of sufficient
[095]92
[096]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
reason, thus in the a priori or a posteriori directly perceptible
ground of the first proposition of the train of reasoning. I have
already shown in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason,
§ 50, that here the series of grounds of knowledge really passes
over into grounds of becoming or of being. But one can only
desire to make this circumstance hold good as a proof of an
unconditioned according to the law of causality, or even of the
mere demand for such an unconditioned, if one has not yet
distinguished the forms of the principle of sufficient reason at
all, but, holding to the abstract expression, has confounded them
all. Kant, however, seeks to establish that confusion, through
a mere play upon words, with Universalitas and Universitas, p.
322; V. 379. Thus it is fundamentally false that our search for
higher grounds of knowledge, more general truths, springs from
the presupposition of an object unconditioned in its being, or has
anything whatever in common with this. Moreover, how should
it be essential to the reason to presuppose something which it
must know to be an absurdity as soon as it reflects? The source of
that conception of the unconditioned is rather to be found only in
the indolence of the individual who wishes by means of it to get
rid of all further questions, whether his own or of others, though
entirely without justification.
Now Kant himself denies objective validity to this pretended
principle of reason; he gives it, however, as a necessary subjective
assumption, and thus introduces an irremediable split into our
knowledge, which he soon allows to appear more clearly. With
this purpose he unfolds that principle of reason further, p. 322; V.
379, in accordance with the method of architectonic symmetry
of which he is so fond. From the three categories of relation
spring three kinds of syllogisms, each of which gives the clue
for the discovery of a special unconditioned, of which again
there are three: the soul, the world (as an object in itself and
absolute totality), and God. Now here we must at once note a
great contradiction, of which Kant, however, takes no notice,Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
93
because it would be very dangerous to the symmetry. Two of
these unconditioneds are themselves conditioned by the third,
the soul and the world by God, who is the cause of their
existence. Thus the two former have by no means the predicate
of unconditionedness in common with the latter, though this is
really the point here, but only that of inferred being according to
the principles of experience, beyond the sphere of the possibility
of experience.
Setting this aside, we recognise in the three unconditioneds,
to which, according to Kant, reason, following its essential
laws, must come, the three principal subjects round which the
whole of philosophy under the influence of Christianity, from
the Scholastics down to Christian Wolf, has turned. Accessible
and familiar as these conceptions have become through all these
philosophers, and now also through the philosophers of pure
reason, this by no means shows that, without revelation, they
would necessarily have proceeded from the development of all
reason as a production peculiar to its very nature. In order to prove
this it would be necessary to call in the aid of historical criticism,
and to examine whether the ancient and non-European nations,
especially the peoples of Hindostan and many of the oldest Greek
philosophers, really attained to those conceptions, or whether it
is only we who, by quite falsely translating the Brahma of the
Hindus and the Tien of the Chinese as “God,” good-naturedly
attribute such conceptions to them, just as the Greeks recognised
their gods everywhere; whether it is not rather the case that
theism proper is only to be found in the religion of the Jews,
and in the two religions which have proceeded from it, whose
followers just on this account comprise the adherents of all other
religions on earth under the name of heathen, which, by the way,
is a most absurd and crude expression, and ought to be banished
at least from the writings of the learned, because it identifies and
jumbles together Brahmanists, Buddhists, Egyptians, Greeks,
Romans, Germans, Gauls, Iroquois, Patagonians, Caribbeans,
[097]94
[098]
[099]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Otaheiteans, Australians, and many others. Such an expression
is all very well for priests, but in the learned world it must at once
be shown the door: it can go to England and take up its abode
at Oxford. It is a thoroughly established fact that Buddhism,
the religion which numbers more followers than any other on
earth, contains absolutely no theism, indeed rejects it. As regards
Plato, it is my opinion that he owes to the Jews the theism
with which he is periodically seized. On this account Numenius
(according to Clem. Alex., Strom., i. c. 22, Euseb. præp.
evang., xiii. 12, and Suidas under Numenius) called him the
Moses græcisans: ¤1 3±Á μÃÄ1 »±ÄÉ1⁄2, · œÉÃ·Â ±ÄÄ1o1¶É1⁄2; and
he accuses him of having stolen (±À¿ÃÅ»·Ã±Â) his doctrine of
God and the creation from the Mosaical writings. Clemens often
repeats that Plato knew and made use of Moses, e.g., Strom., i.
25.—v. c. 14, § 90, &c., &c.; Pædagog., ii. 10, and iii. 11;
also in the Cohortatio ad gentes, c. 6, where, after he has bitterly
censured and derided the whole of the Greek philosophers in
the preceding chapter because they were not Jews, he bestows
on Plato nothing but praise, and breaks out into pure exultation
that as Plato had learnt his geometry from the Egyptians, his
astronomy from the Babylonians, magic from the Thracians, and
much also from the Assyrians, so he had learnt his theism from
the Jews: Ÿ1 ́± Ã¿Å Ä¿ÅÂ  ́1 ́±Ão±»¿ÅÂ, o±1⁄2 ±À¿oÁÅÀÄμ11⁄2 μ ̧μ»ÇÂ,

(Tuos magistros novi, licet eos celare velis, ... illa de Deo
sententia suppeditata tibi est ab Hebræis). A pathetic scene of
recognition. But I see a remarkable confirmation of the matter
in what follows. According to Plutarch (in Mario), and, better,
according to Lactantius (i. 3, 19), Plato thanked Nature that he
had been born a human being and not a brute, a man and not
a woman, a Greek and not a barbarian. Now in Isaac Euchel's
“Prayers of the Jews,” from the Hebrew, second edition, 1799, p.
7, there is a morning prayer in which God is thanked and praised
that the worshipper was born a Jew and not a heathen, a freeAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
95
man and not a slave, a man and not a woman. Such an historical
investigation would have spared Kant an unfortunate necessity
in which he now becomes involved, in that he makes these three
conceptions spring necessarily from the nature of reason, and yet
explains that they are untenable and unverifiable by the reason,
and thus makes the reason itself a sophisticator; for he says, p.
339; V. 397: “There are sophistications, not of man, but of pure
reason itself, from which even the wisest cannot free himself,
and although after much trouble he may be able to avoid error,
yet he never can escape from the illusion which unceasingly
torments and mocks him.” Therefore these Kantian “Ideas of the
Reason” might be compared to the focus in which the converging
reflected rays from a concave mirror meet several inches before
its surface, in consequence of which, by an inevitable process of
the understanding, an object presents itself to us there which is a
thing without reality.
But the name “Idea” is very unfortunately chosen for these
pretended necessary productions of the pure theoretical reason,
and violently appropriated from Plato, who used it to denote the
eternal forms which, multiplied through space and time, become
partially visible in the innumerable individual fleeting things.
Plato's “Ideas” are accordingly throughout perceptible, as indeed
the word which he chose so definitely signifies, for it could
only be adequately translated by means of perceptible or visible
things; and Kant has appropriated it to denote that which lies so
far from all possibility of perception that even abstract thought
can only half attain to it. The word “Idea,” which Plato first
introduced, has, moreover, since then, through two-and-twenty
centuries, always retained the significance in which he used it;
for not only all ancient philosophers, but also all the Scholastics,
and indeed the Church Fathers and the theologians of the Middle
Ages, used it only in that Platonic sense, the sense of the Latin
word exemplar, as Suarez expressly mentions in his twenty-fifth
Disputation, sect. 1. That Englishmen and Frenchmen were
[100]96
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
later induced by the poverty of their languages to misuse this
word is bad enough, but not of importance. Kant's misuse of the
word idea, by the substitution of a new significance introduced
by means of the slender clue of not being object of experience,
which it has in common with Plato's ideas, but also in common
with every possible chimera, is thus altogether unjustifiable.
Now, since the misuse of a few years is not to be considered
against the authority of many centuries, I have always used the
word in its old, original, Platonic significance.

The refutation of rational psychology is much fuller and more
thorough in the first edition of the “Critique of Pure Reason”
than in the second and following editions, and therefore upon
this point we must make use of the first edition exclusively. This
refutation has as a whole very great merit and much truth. Yet
I am clearly of the opinion that it was merely from his love of
symmetry that Kant deduced as necessary the conception of the
soul from the paralogism of substantiality by applying the demand
for the unconditioned to the conception substance, which is the
first category of relation, and accordingly maintained that the
conception of a soul arose in this way in every speculative reason.
If this conception really had its origin in the presupposition of a
final subject of all predicates of a thing, one would have assumed
a soul not in men alone, but also just as necessarily in every
lifeless thing, for such a thing also requires a final subject of all
its predicates. Speaking generally, however, Kant makes use of a
quite inadmissible expression when he talks of something which
can exist only as subject and not as predicate (e.g., Critique of
Pure Reason, p. 323; V. 412; Prolegomena, § 4 and 47); though a
precedent for this is to be found in Aristotle's “Metaphysics,” iv.
ch. 8. Nothing whatever exists as subject and predicate, for these
expressions belong exclusively to logic, and denote the relations
of abstract conceptions to each other. Now their correlative or
representative in the world of perception must be substance andAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.

accident. But then we need not look further for that which exists
always as substance and never as accident, but have it directly
in matter. It is the substance corresponding to all properties of
things which are their accidents. It is, in fact, if one wishes to
retain the expression of Kant which has just been condemned,
the final subject of all predicates of that empirically given thing,
that which remains after the abstraction of all its properties of
every kind. And this holds good of man as of a brute, a plant, or
a stone, and is so evident, that in order not to see it a determined
desire not to see is required. That it is really the prototype of
the conception substance, I will show soon. But subject and
predicate are related to substance and accident rather as the
principle of sufficient reason in logic to the law of causality in
nature, and the substitution or identification of the former is just
as inadmissible as that of the latter. Yet in the “Prolegomena,” §
46, Kant carries this substitution and identification to its fullest
extent in order to make the conception of the soul arise from
that of the final subject of all predicates and from the form of
the categorical syllogism. In order to discover the sophistical
nature of this paragraph, one only needs to reflect that subject
and predicate are purely logical determinations, which concern
abstract conceptions solely and alone, and that according to their
relation in the judgment. Substance and accident, on the other
hand, belong to the world of perception and its apprehension
in the understanding, and are even there only as identical with
matter and form or quality. Of this more shortly.
The antithesis which has given occasion for the assumption of
two fundamentally different substances, body and soul, is in truth
that of objective and subjective. If a man apprehends himself
objectively in external perception, he finds a being extended in
space and in general merely corporeal; but if, on the other hand,
he apprehends himself in mere self-consciousness, thus purely
subjectively, he finds himself a merely willing and perceiving
being, free from all forms of perception, thus also without a single
[102]98
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
one of the properties which belong to bodies. Now he forms the
conception of the soul, like all the transcendental conceptions
called by Kant Ideas, by applying the principle of sufficient
reason, the form of all objects, to that which is not an object,
and in this case indeed to the subject of knowing and willing.
He treats, in fact, knowing, thinking, and willing as effects of
which he seeks the cause, and as he cannot accept the body as
their cause, he assumes a cause of them entirely different from
the body. In this manner the first and the last of the dogmatists
proves the existence of the soul: Plato in the “Phædrus” and
also Wolf: from thinking and willing as the effects which lead
to that cause. Only after in this way, by hypostatising a cause
corresponding to the effect, the conception of an immaterial,
simple, indestructible being had arisen, the school developed and
demonstrated this from the conception of substance. But this
conception itself they had previously constructed specially for
this purpose by the following artifice, which is worthy of notice.
[103]
With the first class of ideas, i.e., the real world of perception,
the idea of matter is also given; because the law governing this
class of ideas, the law of causality, determines the change of the
states or conditions, and these conditions themselves presuppose
something permanent, whose changes they are. When speaking
above of the principle of the permanence of substance, I showed,
by reference to earlier passages, that this idea of matter arises
because in the understanding, for which alone it exists, time and
space are intimately united, and the share of space in this product
exhibits itself as the permanence of matter, while the share of time
appears as the change of states. Purely in itself, matter can only
be thought in abstracto, and not perceived; for to perception it
always appears already in form and quality. From this conception
of matter, substance is again an abstraction, consequently a higher
genus, and arose in this way. Of the conception of matter, only the
predicate of permanence was allowed to remain, while all its other
essential properties, extension, impenetrability, divisibility, &c.,Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
99
were thought away. Like every higher genus, then, the concept
substance contains less in itself than the concept matter, but,
unlike every other higher genus, it does not contain more under it,
because it does not include several lower genera besides matter;
but this remains the one true species of the concept substance,
the only assignable thing by which its content is realised and
receives a proof. Thus the aim with which in other cases the
reason produces by abstraction a higher conception, in order that
in it several subordinate species may be thought at once through
common determinations, has here no place; consequently that
abstraction is either undertaken idly and entirely without aim, or
it has a secret secondary purpose. This secret purpose is now
brought to light; for under the conception substance, along with
its true sub-species matter, a second species is co-ordinated—the
immaterial, simple, indestructible substance, soul. But the
surreptitious introduction of this last concept arose from the fact
that the higher concept substance was framed illogically, and
in a manner contrary to law. In its legitimate procedure the
reason always frames the concept of a higher genus by placing
together the concepts of several species, and now comparing
them, proceeds discursively, and by omitting their differences
and retaining the qualities in which they agree, obtains the generic
concept which includes them all but has a smaller content. From
this it follows that the concepts of the species must always
precede the concept of the genus. But, in the present case, the
converse is true. Only the concept matter existed before the
generic concept substance. The latter was without occasion, and
consequently without justification, as it were aimlessly framed
from the former by the arbitrary omission of all its determinations
except one. Not till afterwards was the second ungenuine species
placed beside the concept matter, and so foisted in. But for the
framing of this second concept nothing more was now required
than an express denial of what had already been tacitly omitted
in the higher generic concept, extension, impenetrability, and
[104]100
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
divisibility. Thus the concept substance was framed merely to
be the vehicle for the surreptitious introduction of the concept of
the immaterial substance. Consequently, it is very far from being
capable of holding good as a category or necessary function
of the understanding; rather is it an exceedingly superfluous
concept, because its only true content lies already in the concept
of matter, besides which it contains only a great void, which
can be filled up by nothing but the illicitly introduced species
immaterial substance; and, indeed, it was solely for the purpose
of containing this that it was framed. Accordingly, in strictness,
the concept substance must be entirely rejected, and the concept
matter everywhere put in its place.
[105]
The categories were a procrustean bed for every possible
thing, but the three kinds of syllogisms are so only for the three
so-called Ideas. The Idea of the soul was compelled to find its
origin in the form of the categorical syllogism. It is now the
turn of the dogmatic ideas concerning the universe, so far as it
is thought as an object in itself, between two limits—that of the
smallest (atom), and that of the largest (limits of the universe
in time and space). These must now proceed from the form of
the hypothetical syllogism. Nor for this in itself is any special
violence necessary. For the hypothetical judgment has its form
from the principle of sufficient reason, and not the cosmological
alone but all those so-called Ideas really have their origin in the
inconsiderate and unrestricted application of that principle, and
the laying aside of it at pleasure. For, in accordance with that
principle, the mere dependence of an object upon another is ever
sought for, till finally the exhaustion of the imagination puts an
end to the journey; and thus it is lost sight of that every object, and
indeed the whole chain of objects and the principle of sufficient
reason itself, stand in a far closer and greater dependence, the
dependence upon the knowing subject, for whose objects alone,
i.e., ideas, that principle is valid, for their mere position inAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
101
space and time is determined by it. Thus, since the form of
knowledge from which here merely the cosmological Ideas are
derived, the principle of sufficient reason, is the source of all
subtle hypostases, in this case no sophisms need be resorted to;
but so much the more is sophistry required in order to classify
those Ideas according to the four titles of the categories.
(1.) The cosmological Ideas with regard to time and space,
thus of the limits of the world in both, are boldly regarded as
determined through the category of quantity, with which they
clearly have nothing in common, except the accidental denotation
in logic of the extent of the concept of the subject in the judgment
by the word quantity, a pictorial expression instead of which some
other might just as well have been chosen. But for Kant's love
of symmetry this is enough. He takes advantage of the fortunate
accident of this nomenclature, and links to it the transcendent
dogmas of the world's extension.
(2.) Yet more boldly does Kant link to quality, i.e., the
affirmation or negation in a judgment, the transcendent Ideas
concerning matter; a procedure which has not even an accidental
similarity of words as a basis. For it is just to the quantity, and
not to the quality of matter that its mechanical (not chemical)
divisibility is related. But, what is more, this whole idea of
divisibility by no means belongs to those inferences according to
the principle of sufficient reason, from which, however, as the
content of the hypothetical form, all cosmological Ideas ought
to flow. For the assertion upon which Kant there relies, that
the relation of the parts to the whole is that of the condition
to the conditioned, thus a relation according to the principle of
sufficient reason, is certainly an ingenious but yet a groundless
sophism. That relation is rather based upon the principle of
contradiction; for the whole is not through the part, nor the parts
through the whole, but both are necessarily together because
they are one, and their separation is only an arbitrary act. It
depends upon this, according to the principle of contradiction,
[106]102
[107]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
that if the parts are thought away, the whole is also thought
away, and conversely; and by no means upon the fact that the
parts as the reason conditioned the whole as the consequent,
and that therefore, in accordance with the principle of sufficient
reason, we were necessarily led to seek the ultimate parts, in
order, as its reason, to understand from them the whole. Such
great difficulties are here overcome by the love of symmetry.
(3.) The Idea of the first cause of the world would now quite
properly come under the title of relation; but Kant must reserve
this for the fourth title, that of modality, for which otherwise
nothing would remain, and under which he forces this idea
to come by saying that the contingent (i.e., according to his
explanation, which is diametrically opposed to the truth, every
consequent of its reason) becomes the necessary through the
first cause. Therefore, for the sake of symmetry, the conception
of freedom appears here as the third Idea. By this conception,
however, as is distinctly stated in the observations on the thesis
of the third conflict, what is really meant is only that Idea of the
cause of the world which alone is admissible here. The third and
fourth conflicts are at bottom tautological.
About all this, however, I find and assert that the whole
antinomy is a mere delusion, a sham fight. Only the assertions
of the antitheses really rest upon the forms of our faculty of
knowledge, i.e., if we express it objectively, on the necessary,
a priori certain, most universal laws of nature. Their proofs
alone are therefore drawn from objective grounds. On the other
hand, the assertions and proofs of the theses have no other
than a subjective ground, rest solely on the weakness of the
reasoning individual; for his imagination becomes tired with an
endless regression, and therefore he puts an end to it by arbitrary
assumptions, which he tries to smooth over as well as he can;
and his judgment, moreover, is in this case paralysed by early
and deeply imprinted prejudices. On this account the proof of
the thesis in all the four conflicts is throughout a mere sophism,Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
103
while that of the antithesis is a necessary inference of the reason
from the laws of the world as idea known to us a priori. It
is, moreover, only with great pains and skill that Kant is able
to sustain the thesis, and make it appear to attack its opponent,
which is endowed with native power. Now in this regard his first
and constant artifice is, that he does not render prominent the
nervus argumentationis, and thus present it in as isolated, naked,
and distinct a manner as he possibly can; but rather introduces
the same argument on both sides, concealed under and mixed up
with a mass of superfluous and prolix sentences.
The theses and antitheses which here appear in such conflict
remind one of the  ́1o±1¿Â and ± ́1o¿Â »¿3¿Â which Socrates, in
the “Clouds” of Aristophanes, brings forward as contending. Yet
this resemblance extends only to the form and not to the content,
though this would gladly be asserted by those who ascribe to
these most speculative of all questions of theoretical philosophy
an influence upon morality, and therefore seriously regard the
thesis as the  ́1o±1¿Â, and the antithesis as the ± ́1o¿Â »¿3¿Â. I
shall not, however, accommodate myself here with reference to
such small, narrow, and perverse minds; and, giving honour not
to them, but to the truth, I shall show that the proofs which Kant
adduced of the individual theses are sophisms, while those of
the antitheses are quite fairly and correctly drawn from objective
grounds. I assume that in this examination the reader has always
before him the Kantian antinomy itself.
If the proof of the thesis in the first conflict is to be held as
valid, then it proves too much, for it would be just as applicable
to time itself as to change in time, and would therefore prove that
time itself must have had a beginning, which is absurd. Besides,
the sophism consists in this, that instead of the beginninglessness
of the series of states, which was at first the question, suddenly
the endlessness (infinity) of the series is substituted; and now
it is proved that this is logically contradicted by completeness,
and yet every present is the end of the past, which no one
[108]104
[109]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
doubted. The end of a beginningless series can, however, always
be thought, without prejudice to the fact that it has no beginning;
just as, conversely, the beginning of an endless series can also be
thought. But against the real, true argument of the antithesis, that
the changes of the world necessarily presuppose an infinite series
of changes backwards, absolutely nothing is advanced. We can
think the possibility that the causal chain will some day end in an
absolute standstill, but we can by no means think the possibility
of an absolute beginning.8
With reference to the spatial limits of the world, it is proved
that, if it is to be regarded as a given whole, it must necessarily
have limits. The reasoning is correct, only it was just the first
link of it that was to be proved, and that remains unproved.
Totality presupposes limits, and limits presuppose totality; but
here both together are arbitrarily presupposed. For this second
point, however, the antithesis affords no such satisfactory proof
as for the first, because the law of causality provides us with
necessary determinations only with reference to time, not to
space, and affords us a priori the certainty that no occupied
time can ever be bounded by a previous empty time, and that no
8
That the assumption of a limit of the world in time is certainly not a
necessary thought of the reason may be also proved historically, for the Hindus
teach nothing of the kind, even in the religion of the people, much less in the
Vedas, but try to express mythologically by means of monstrous chronology
the infinity of this phenomenal world, this fleeting and baseless web of Mâyâ,
for they at once bring out very ingeniously the relativity of all periods of time
in the following mythus (Polier, Mythologie des Indous, vol. ii. p. 585). The
four ages, in the last of which we live, embrace together 4,320,000 years. Each
day of the creating Brahma has 1000 such periods of four ages, and his nights
have also 1000. His year has 365 days and as many nights. He lives 100 of his
years, always creating; and if he dies, at once a new Brahma is born, and so on
from eternity to eternity. The same relativity of time is also expressed in the
special myth which is quoted in Polier's work, vol. ii. p. 594, from the Puranas.
In it a Rajah, after a visit of a few seconds to Vishnu in his heaven, finds on his
return to earth that several millions of years have elapsed, and a new age has
begun; for every day of Vishnu is 100 recurrences of the four ages.Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
105
change can be the first change, but not that an occupied space can
have no empty space beside it. So far no a priori decision on the
latter point would be possible; yet the difficulty of conceiving
the world in space as limited lies in the fact that space itself is
necessarily infinite, and therefore a limited finite world in space,
however large it may be, becomes an infinitely small magnitude;
and in this incongruity the imagination finds an insuperable
stumbling-block, because there remains for it only the choice
of thinking the world either as infinitely large or infinitely
small. This was already seen by the ancient philosophers:

immediately follows), ±Àμ1Á¿ÅÂ o¿Ã1⁄4¿ÅÂ μ1⁄2 Äó ±Àμ1Áó (infinitos
mundos in infinito). This is also the sense of the Kantian
argument for the antithesis, only he has disfigured it by a
scholastic and ambiguous expression. The same argument might
be used against the limitation of the world in time, only we
have a far better one under the guidance of causality. In the
case of the assumption of a world limited in space, there arises
further the unanswerable question, What advantage has the filled
part of space enjoyed over the infinite space that has remained
empty? In the fifth dialogue of his book, “Del Infinito, Universo
e Mondi,” Giordano Bruno gives a full account of the arguments
for and against the finiteness of the world, which is very well
worth reading. For the rest, Kant himself asserts seriously, and
upon objective grounds, the infinity of the world in space in
his “Natural History of the Theory of the Heavens,” part ii. ch.
7. Aristotle also acknowledges the same, “Phys.,” iii. ch. 4,
a chapter which, together with the following one, is very well
worth reading with reference to this antinomy.
In the second conflict the thesis is at once guilty of a very
[110]106
[111]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
palpable petitio principii, for it commences, “Every compound
substance consists of simple parts.” From the compoundness here
arbitrarily assumed, no doubt it afterwards very easily proves
the simple parts. But the proposition, “All matter is compound,”
which is just the point, remains unproved, because it is simply a
groundless assumption. The opposite of simple is not compound,
but extended, that which has parts and is divisible. Here,
however, it is really tacitly assumed that the parts existed before
the whole, and were brought together, whence the whole has
arisen; for this is the meaning of the word “compound.” Yet
this can just as little be asserted as the opposite. Divisibility
means merely the possibility of separating the whole into parts,
and not that the whole is compounded out of parts and thus
came into being. Divisibility merely asserts the parts a parte
post; compoundness asserts them a parte ante. For there is
essentially no temporal relation between the parts and the whole;
they rather condition each other reciprocally, and thus always
exist at the same time, for only so far as both are there is
there anything extended in space. Therefore what Kant says in
the observations on the thesis, “Space ought not to be called a
compositum, but a totum,” &c., holds good absolutely of matter
also, which is simply space become perceptible. On the other
hand, the infinite divisibility of matter, which the antithesis
asserts, follows a priori and incontrovertibly from that of space,
which it fills. This proposition has absolutely nothing against
it; and therefore Kant also (p. 513; V. 541), when he speaks
seriously and in his own person, no longer as the mouthpiece
of the ± ́1o¿Â »¿3¿Â, presents it as objective truth; and also in
the “Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science” (p. 108,
first edition), the proposition, “Matter is infinitely divisible,” is
placed at the beginning of the proof of the first proposition of
mechanics as established truth, having appeared and been proved
as the fourth proposition in the Dynamics. But here Kant spoils
the proof of the antithesis by the greatest obscurity of style andAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
107
useless accumulation of words, with the cunning intention that
the evidence of the antithesis shall not throw the sophisms of the
thesis too much into the shade. Atoms are no necessary thought
of the reason, but merely an hypothesis for the explanation of
the difference of the specific gravity of bodies. But Kant himself
has shown, in the dynamics of his “Metaphysical First Principles
of Natural Science,” that this can be otherwise, and indeed better
and more simply explained than by atomism. In this, however,
he was anticipated by Priestley, “On Matter and Spirit,” sect. i.
Indeed, even in Aristotle, “Phys.” iv. 9, the fundamental thought
of this is to be found.
The argument for the third thesis is a very fine sophism, and
is really Kant's pretended principle of pure reason itself entirely
unadulterated and unchanged. It tries to prove the finiteness of the
series of causes by saying that, in order to be sufficient, a cause
must contain the complete sum of the conditions from which
the succeeding state, the effect, proceeds. For the completeness
of the determinations present together in the state which is
the cause, the argument now substitutes the completeness of the
series of causes by which that state itself was brought to actuality;
and because completeness presupposes the condition of being
rounded off or closed in, and this again presupposes finiteness,
the argument infers from this a first cause, closing the series and
therefore unconditioned. But the juggling is obvious. In order
to conceive the state A. as the sufficient cause of the state B., I
assume that it contains the sum of the necessary determinations
from the co-existence of which the estate B. inevitably follows.
Now by this my demand upon it as a sufficient cause is entirely
satisfied, and has no direct connection with the question how
the state A. itself came to be; this rather belongs to an entirely
different consideration, in which I regard the said state A. no
more as cause, but as itself an effect; in which case another
state again must be related to it, just as it was related to B. The
assumption of the finiteness of the series of causes and effects,
[112]108
[113]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
and accordingly of a first beginning, appears nowhere in this as
necessary, any more than the presentness of the present moment
requires us to assume a beginning of time itself. It only comes to
be added on account of the laziness of the speculating individual.
That this assumption lies in the acceptance of a cause as a
sufficient reason is thus unfairly arrived at and false, as I have
shown at length above when considering the Kantian principle
of pure reason which coincides with this thesis. In illustration
of the assertion of this false thesis, Kant is bold enough in his
observations upon it to give as an example of an unconditioned
beginning his rising from his chair; as if it were not just as
impossible for him to rise without a motive as for a ball to roll
without a cause. I certainly do not need to prove the baselessness
of the appeal which, induced by a sense of weakness, he makes to
the philosophers of antiquity, by quoting from Ocellus Lucanus,
the Eleatics, &c., not to speak of the Hindus. Against the proof
of this antithesis, as in the case of the previous ones, there is
nothing to advance.
The fourth conflict is, as I have already remarked, really
tautological with the third; and the proof of the thesis is also
essentially the same as that of the preceding one. His assertion that
every conditioned presupposes a complete series of conditions,
and therefore a series which ends with an unconditioned, is
a petitio principii, which must simply be denied. Everything
conditioned presupposes nothing but its condition; that this is
again conditioned raises a new consideration which is not directly
contained in the first.
A certain appearance of probability cannot be denied to the
antinomy; yet it is remarkable that no part of the Kantian
philosophy has met so little contradiction, indeed has found
so much acceptance, as this exceedingly paradoxical doctrine.
Almost all philosophical parties and text-books have regarded it
as valid, and have also repeatedly reconstructed it; while nearly
all Kant's other doctrines have been contested, and indeed thereAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
109
have never been wanting some perverse minds which rejected
even the transcendental æsthetic. The undivided assent which the
antinomy, on the other hand, has met with may ultimately arise
from the fact that certain persons regard with inward satisfaction
the point at which the understanding is so thoroughly brought to
a standstill, having hit upon something which at once is and is
not, so that they actually have before them here the sixth trick of
Philadelphia in Lichtenberg's broadsheet.
If we examine the real meaning of Kant's Critical Solution of
the cosmological problem which now follows, we find that it is
not what he gives it out to be, the solution of the problem by the
disclosure that both sides, starting from false assumptions, are
wrong in the first and second conflicts, and that in the third and
fourth both are right. It is really the confirmation of the antitheses
by the explanation of their assertions.
First Kant asserts, in this solution, obviously wrongly, that
both sides started from the assumption, as their first principle, that
with the conditioned the completed (thus rounded off) series of
its conditions is given. Only the thesis laid down this proposition,
Kant's principle of pure reason, as the ground of its assertions;
the antithesis, on the other hand, expressly denied it throughout,
and asserted the contrary. Further, Kant charges both sides with
this assumption, that the world exists in itself, i.e., independently
of being known and of the forms of this knowledge, but this
assumption also is only made by the thesis; indeed, it is so far
from forming the ground of the assertions of the antithesis that
it is absolutely inconsistent with them. For that it should all be
given is absolutely contradictory of the conception of an infinite
series. It is therefore essential to it that it should always exist
only with reference to the process of going through it, and not
independently of this. On the other hand, in the assumption of
definite limits also lies that of a whole which exists absolutely and
independently of the process of completely measuring it. Thus it
is only the thesis that makes the false assumption of a self-existent
[114]110
[115]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
universe, i.e., a universe given prior to all knowledge, and to
which knowledge came as to something external to itself. The
antithesis from the outset combats this assumption absolutely;
for the infinity of the series which it asserts merely under the
guidance of the principle of sufficient reason can only exist if
the regressus is fully carried out, but not independently of it. As
the object in general presupposes the subject, so also the object
which is determined as an endless chain of conditions necessarily
presupposes in the subject the kind of knowledge corresponding
to this, that is, the constant following of the links of that chain.
But this is just what Kant gives as the solution of the problem,
and so often repeats: “The infinity of the world is only through
the regressus, not before it.” This his solution of the conflict is
thus really only the decision in favour of the antithesis in the
assertion of which this truth already lies, while it is altogether
inconsistent with the assertions of the thesis. If the antithesis
had asserted that the world consisted of infinite series of reasons
and consequents, and yet existed independently of the idea and
its regressive series, thus in itself, and therefore constituted a
given whole, it would have contradicted not only the thesis but
also itself. For an infinite can never be given as a whole, nor an
endless series exist, except as an endless progress; nor can what
is boundless constitute a whole. Thus this assumption, of which
Kant asserts that it led both sides into error, belongs only to the
thesis.
It is already a doctrine of Aristotle's that an infinity can never
be actu, i.e., actual and given, but only potentiâ. ŸÅo μÃÄ11⁄2

the perfectly correct solution of the whole of the antinomies.
He expounds the antinomies in his short way, and then says,
“A mediator ( ́1±1Ä·Ä¿Å) is required;” upon which he gives the
solution that the infinite, both of the world in space and in time
and in division, is never before the regressus, or progressus, but
in it. This truth lies then in the rightly apprehended conception
of the infinite. Thus one misunderstands himself if he imagines
that he can think the infinite, of whatever kind it may be, as
something objectively present and complete, and independent of
the regressus.
Indeed if, reversing the procedure, we take as the starting-
point what Kant gives as the solution of the conflict, the assertion
of the antithesis follows exactly from it. Thus: if the world is
not an unconditioned whole and does not exist absolutely but
only in the idea, and if its series of reasons and consequents
do not exist before the regressus of the ideas of them but only
through this regressus, then the world cannot contain determined
and finite series, because their determination and limitation
would necessarily be independent of the idea, which would then
only come afterwards; but all its series must be infinite, i.e.,
inexhaustible by any idea.
On p. 506; V. 534, Kant tries to prove from the falseness of
both sides the transcendental ideality of the phenomenon, and
begins, “If the world is a whole existing by itself, it is either finite
or infinite.” But this is false; a whole existing of itself cannot
possibly be infinite. That ideality may rather be concluded from
the infinity of the series in the world in the following manner:—If
the series of reasons and consequents in the world are absolutely
without end, the world cannot be a given whole independent of
the idea; for such a world always presupposes definite limits,
just as on the contrary infinite series presuppose an infinite
regressus. Therefore, the presupposed infinity of the series must
be determined through the form of reason and consequent, and
this again through the form of knowledge of the subject; thus the
[116]112
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
world as it is known must exist only in the idea of the subject.
Now whether Kant himself was aware or not that his critical
solution of the problem is really a decision in favour of the
antithesis, I am unable to decide. For it depends upon whether
what Schelling has somewhere very happily called Kant's system
of accommodation extended so far; or whether Kant's mind was
here already involved in an unconscious accommodation to the
influence of his time and surroundings.
[117]
The solution of the third antinomy, the subject of which was
the Idea of freedom, deserves a special consideration, because it
is for us very well worth notice that it is just here in connection
with the Idea of freedom that Kant is obliged to speak more
fully of the thing in itself, which was hitherto only seen in
the background. This is very explicable to us since we have
recognised the thing in itself as the will. Speaking generally, this
is the point at which the Kantian philosophy leads to mine, or
at which mine springs out of his as its parent stem. One will be
convinced of this if one reads with attention pp. 536 and 537;
V. 564 and 565, of the “Critique of Pure Reason,” and, further,
compares these passages with the introduction to the “Critique
of Judgment,” pp. xviii. and xix. of the third edition, or p. 13 of
Rosenkranz's edition, where indeed it is said: “The conception
of freedom can in its object (that is then the will) present to the
mind a thing in itself, but not in perception; the conception of
nature, on the other hand, can present its object to the mind in
perception, but not as a thing in itself.” But specially let any
one read concerning the solution of the antinomies the fifty-third
paragraph of the Prolegomena, and then honestly answer the
question whether all that is said there does not sound like a riddle
to which my doctrine is the answer. Kant never completed his
thought; I have merely carried out his work. Accordingly, what
Kant says only of the human phenomenon I have extended to all
phenomena in general, as differing from the human phenomenonAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
113
only in degree, that their true being is something absolutely free,
i.e., a will. It appears from my work how fruitful this insight is
in connection with Kant's doctrine of the ideality of space, time,
and causality.
Kant has nowhere made the thing in itself the subject of a
special exposition or distinct deduction; but, whenever he wants
it, he introduces it at once by means of the conclusion that the
phenomenon, thus the visible world, must have a reason, an
intelligible cause, which is not a phenomenon, and therefore
belongs to no possible experience. He does this after having
assiduously insisted that the categories, and thus causality also,
had a use which was absolutely confined to possible experience;
that they were merely forms of the understanding, which served
to spell out the phenomena of the world of sense, beyond which,
on the other hand, they had no significance, &c., &c. Therefore,
he denies in the most uncompromising manner their application
to things beyond experience, and rightly explains and at once
rejects all earlier dogmatism as based upon the neglect of this
law. The incredible inconsistency which Kant here fell into was
soon noticed, and used by his first opponents to make attacks on
his philosophy to which it could offer no resistance. For certainly
we apply the law of causality entirely a priori and before all
experience to the changes felt in our organs of sense. But, on
this very account, this law is just as much of subjective origin as
these sensations themselves, and thus does not lead to a thing in
itself. The truth is, that upon the path of the idea one can never
get beyond the idea; it is a rounded-off whole, and has in its own
resources no clue leading to the nature of the thing in itself, which
is toto genere different from it. If we were merely perceiving
beings, the way to the thing in itself would be absolutely cut off
from us. Only the other side of our own being can disclose to
us the other side of the inner being of things. This path I have
followed. But Kant's inference to the thing in itself, contrary as it
is to his own teaching, obtains some excuse from the following
[118]114
[119]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
circumstance. He does not say, as truth required, simply and
absolutely that the object is conditioned by the subject, and
conversely; but only that the manner of the appearance of the
object is conditioned by the forms of knowledge of the subject,
which, therefore, also come a priori to consciousness. But that
now which in opposition to this is only known a posteriori is for
him the immediate effect of the thing in itself, which becomes
phenomenon only in its passage through these forms which are
given a priori. From this point of view it is to some extent
explicable how it could escape him that objectivity in general
belongs to the form of the phenomenon, and is just as much
conditioned by subjectivity in general as the mode of appearing
of the object is conditioned by the forms of knowledge of the
subject; that thus if a thing in itself must be assumed, it absolutely
cannot be an object, which however he always assumes it to be,
but such a thing in itself must necessarily lie in a sphere toto
genere different from the idea (from knowing and being known),
and therefore could least of all be arrived at through the laws of
the combination of objects among themselves.
With the proof of the thing in itself it has happened to Kant
precisely as with that of the a priori nature of the law of causality.
Both doctrines are true, but their proof is false. They thus belong
to the class of true conclusions from false premises. I have
retained them both, but have proved them in an entirely different
way, and with certainty.
The thing in itself I have neither introduced surreptitiously nor
inferred according to laws which exclude it, because they really
belong to its phenomenal appearance; nor, in general, have I
arrived at it by roundabout ways. On the contrary, I have shown
it directly, there where it lies immediately, in the will, which
reveals itself to every one directly as the in-itself of his own
phenomenal being.
And it is also this immediate knowledge of his own will
out of which in human consciousness the conception of freedomAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
115
springs; for certainly the will, as world-creating, as thing in itself,
is free from the principle of sufficient reason, and therewith from
all necessity, thus is completely independent, free, and indeed
almighty. Yet, in truth, this only holds good of the will in
itself, not of its manifestations, the individuals, who, just through
the will itself, are unalterably determined as its manifestations
in time. But in the ordinary consciousness, unenlightened by
philosophy, the will is at once confused with its manifestation,
and what belongs only to the former is attributed to the latter,
whence arises the illusion of the unconditioned freedom of the
individual. Therefore Spinoza says rightly that if the projected
stone had consciousness, it would believe that it flew of its own
free will. For certainly the in-itself of the stone also is the will,
which alone is free; but, as in all its manifestations, here also,
where it appears as a stone, it is already fully determined. But of
all this enough has already been said in the text of this work.
Kant fails to understand and overlooks this immediate origin
of the conception of freedom in every human consciousness,
and therefore he now places (p. 533; V. 561) the source of
that conception in a very subtle speculation, through which the
unconditioned, to which the reason must always tend, leads us
to hypostatise the conception of freedom, and it is only upon
this transcendent Idea of freedom that the practical conception
of it is supposed to be founded. In the “Critique of Practical
Reason,” § 6, and p. 158 of the fourth and 235 of Rosenkranz's
edition, he yet deduces this last conception differently by saying
that the categorical imperative presupposes it. The speculative
Idea is accordingly only the primary source of the conception of
freedom for the sake of this presupposition, but here it obtains
both significance and application. Neither, however, is the case.
For the delusion of a perfect freedom of the individual in his
particular actions is most lively in the conviction of the least
cultivated man who has never reflected, and it is thus founded
on no speculation, although often assumed by speculation from
[120]116
[121]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
without. Thus only philosophers, and indeed only the most
profound of them, are free from it, and also the most thoughtful
and enlightened of the writers of the Church.
It follows, then, from all that has been said, that the true
source of the conception of freedom is in no way essentially an
inference, either from the speculative Idea of an unconditioned
cause, nor from the fact that it is presupposed by the categorical
imperative. But it springs directly from the consciousness in
which each one recognises himself at once as the will, i.e., as that
which, as the thing in itself, has not the principle of sufficient
reason for its form, and which itself depends upon nothing, but
on which everything else rather depends. Every one, however,
does not recognise himself at once with the critical and reflective
insight of philosophy as a determined manifestation of this will
which has already entered time, as we might say, an act of will
distinguished from that will to live itself; and, therefore, instead
of recognising his whole existence as an act of his freedom, he
rather seeks for freedom in his individual actions. Upon this
point I refer the reader to my prize-essay on the freedom of the
will.
Now if Kant, as he here pretends, and also apparently did in
earlier cases, had merely inferred the thing in itself, and that with
the great inconsistency of an inference absolutely forbidden by
himself, what a remarkable accident would it then be that here,
where for the first time he approaches the thing in itself more
closely and explains it, he should recognise in it at once the
will, the free will showing itself in the world only in temporal
manifestations! I therefore really assume, though it cannot be
proved, that whenever Kant spoke of the thing in itself, in the
obscure depths of his mind he already always indistinctly thought
of the will. This receives support from a passage in the preface
to the second edition of the “Critique of Pure Reason,” pp. xxvii.
and xxviii., in Rosenkranz's edition, p. 677 of the Supplement.
For the rest, it is just this predetermined solution of the shamAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
117
third conflict that affords Kant the opportunity of expressing very
beautifully the deepest thoughts of his whole philosophy. This is
the case in the whole of the “Sixth Section of the Antinomy of
Pure Reason;” but, above all, in the exposition of the opposition
between the empirical and the intelligible character, p. 534-550;
V. 562-578, which I number among the most admirable things
that have ever been said by man. (As a supplemental explanation
of this passage, compare a parallel passage in the Critique of
Practical Reason, p. 169-179 of the fourth edition, or p. 224-231
of Rosenkranz's edition.) It is yet all the more to be regretted that
this is here not in its right place, partly because it is not found
in the way which the exposition states, and therefore could be
otherwise deduced than it is, partly because it does not fulfil the
end for which it is there—the solution of the sham antinomy.
The intelligible character, the thing in itself, is inferred from the
phenomenon by the inconsistent use of the category of causality
beyond the sphere of all phenomena, which has already been
sufficiently condemned. In this case the will of man (which
Kant entitles reason, most improperly, and with an unpardonable
breach of all use of language) is set up as the thing in itself, with
an appeal to an unconditioned ought, the categorical imperative,
which is postulated without more ado.
Now, instead of all this, the plain open procedure would
have been to start directly from the will, and prove it to be the
in-itself of our own phenomenal being, recognised without any
mediation; and then to give that exposition of the empirical and
the intelligible character to explain how all actions, although
necessitated by motives, yet, both by their author and by the
disinterested judge, are necessarily and absolutely ascribed to
the former himself and alone, as depending solely upon him,
to whom therefore guilt and merit are attributed in respect of
them. This alone was the straight path to the knowledge of that
which is not phenomenon, and therefore will not be found by the
help of the laws of the phenomenon, but is that which reveals
[122]118
[123]
[124]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
itself through the phenomenon, becomes knowable, objectifies
itself—the will to live. It would then have had to be exhibited
merely by analogy as the inner nature of every phenomenon.
Then, however, it certainly could not have been said that in
lifeless or even animal nature no faculty can be thought except
as sensuously conditioned (p. 546; V. 574), which in Kant's
language is simply saying that the explanation, according to the
law of causality, exhausts the inner nature of these phenomena,
and thus in their case, very inconsistently, the thing in itself
disappears. Through the false position and the roundabout
deduction according with it which the exposition of the thing
in itself has received from Kant, the whole conception of it has
also become falsified. For the will or the thing in itself, found
through the investigation of an unconditioned cause, appears here
related to the phenomenon as cause to effect. But this relation
exists only within the phenomenal world, therefore presupposes
it, and cannot connect the phenomenal world itself with what lies
outside it, and is toto genere different from it.
Further, the intended end, the solution of the third antinomy
by the decision that both sides, each in a different sense, are
right, is not reached at all. For neither the thesis nor the antithesis
have anything to do with the thing in itself, but entirely with the
phenomenon, the objective world, the world as idea. This it is,
and absolutely nothing else, of which the thesis tries to show,
by means of the sophistry we have laid bare, that it contains
unconditioned causes, and it is also this of which the antithesis
rightly denies that it contains such causes. Therefore the whole
exposition of the transcendental freedom of the will, so far as
it is a thing in itself, which is given here in justification of the
thesis, excellent as it is in itself, is yet here entirely a 1⁄4μÄ±2±Ã1Â
μ1Â ±»»¿ 3μ1⁄2¿Â. For the transcendental freedom of the will which
is expounded is by no means the unconditioned causality of a
cause, which the thesis asserts, because it is of the essence of a
cause that it must be a phenomenon, and not something whichAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
119
lies beyond all phenomena and is toto genere different.
If what is spoken of is cause and effect, the relation of the
will to the manifestation (or of the intelligible character to the
empirical) must never be introduced, as happens here: for it is
entirely different from causal relation. However, here also, in this
solution of the antinomy, it is said with truth that the empirical
character of man, like that of every other cause in nature, is
unalterably determined, and therefore that his actions necessarily
take place in accordance with the external influences; therefore
also, in spite of all transcendental freedom (i.e., independence of
the will in itself of the laws of the connection of its manifestation),
no man has the power of himself to begin a series of actions,
which, however, was asserted by the thesis. Thus also freedom
has no causality; for only the will is free, and it lies outside
nature or the phenomenon, which is just its objectification, but
does not stand in a causal relation to it, for this relation is only
found within the sphere of the phenomenon, thus presupposes
it, and cannot embrace the phenomenon itself and connect it
with what is expressly not a phenomenon. The world itself
can only be explained through the will (for it is the will itself,
so far as it manifests itself), and not through causality. But
in the world causality is the sole principle of explanation, and
everything happens simply according to the laws of nature. Thus
the right lies entirely on the side of the antithesis, which sticks
to the question in hand, and uses that principle of explanation
which is valid with regard to it; therefore it needs no apology.
The thesis, on the other hand, is supposed to be got out of the
matter by an apology, which first passes over to something quite
different from the question at issue, and then assumes a principle
of explanation which is inapplicable to it.
The fourth conflict is, as has already been said, in its real
meaning tautological with the third. In its solution Kant
develops still more the untenable nature of the thesis; while for
its truth, on the other hand, and its pretended consistency with
[125]120
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
the antithesis, he advances no reason, as conversely he is able
to bring no reason against the antithesis. The assumption of the
thesis he introduces quite apologetically, and yet calls it himself
(p. 562; V. 590) an arbitrary presupposition, the object of which
might well in itself be impossible, and shows merely an utterly
impotent endeavour to find a corner for it somewhere where it
will be safe from the prevailing might of the antithesis, only to
avoid disclosing the emptiness of the whole of his once-loved
assertion of the necessary antinomy in human reason.
[126]
Now follows the chapter on the transcendental ideal, which
carries us back at once to the rigid Scholasticism of the Middle
Ages. One imagines one is listening to Anselm of Canterbury
himself. The ens realissimum, the essence of all realities,
the content of all affirmative propositions, appears, and indeed
claims to be a necessary thought of the reason. I for my part must
confess that to my reason such a thought is impossible, and that
I am not able to think anything definite in connection with the
words which denote it.
Moreover, I do not doubt that Kant was compelled to write
this extraordinary chapter, so unworthy of him, simply by
his fondness for architectonic symmetry. The three principal
objects of the Scholastic philosophy (which, as we have said, if
understood in the wider sense, may be regarded as continuing
down to Kant), the soul, the world, and God, are supposed
to be deduced from the three possible major propositions of
syllogisms, though it is plain that they have arisen, and can arise,
simply and solely through the unconditioned application of the
principle of sufficient reason. Now, after the soul had been
forced into the categorical judgment, and the hypothetical was
set apart for the world, there remained for the third Idea nothing
but the disjunctive major. Fortunately there existed a previous
work in this direction, the ens realissimum of the Scholastics,
together with the ontological proof of the existence of God setAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
121
up in a rudimentary form by Anselm of Canterbury and then
perfected by Descartes. This was joyfully made use of by Kant,
with some reminiscence also of an earlier Latin work of his
youth. However, the sacrifice which Kant makes to his love
of architectonic symmetry in this chapter is exceedingly great.
In defiance of all truth, what one must regard as the grotesque
idea of an essence of all possible realities is made an essential
and necessary thought of the reason. For the deduction of this
Kant makes use of the false assertion that our knowledge of
particular things arises from a progressive limitation of general
conceptions; thus also of a most general conception of all which
contains all reality in itself. In this he stands just as much in
contradiction with his own teaching as with the truth, for exactly
the converse is the case. Our knowledge starts with the particular
and is extended to the general, and all general conceptions arise
by abstraction from real, particular things known by perception,
and this can be carried on to the most general of all conceptions,
which includes everything under it, but almost nothing in it.
Thus Kant has here placed the procedure of our faculty of
knowledge just upside down, and thus might well be accused of
having given occasion to a philosophical charlatanism that has
become famous in our day, which, instead of recognising that
conceptions are thoughts abstracted from things, makes, on the
contrary the conceptions first, and sees in things only concrete
conceptions, thus bringing to market the world turned upside
down as a philosophical buffoonery, which of course necessarily
found great acceptance.
Even if we assume that every reason must, or at least can,
attain to the conception of God, even without revelation, this
clearly takes place only under the guidance of causality. This is
so evident that it requires no proof. Therefore Chr. Wolf says
(Cosmologia Generalis, prœf., p. 1): Sane in theologia naturali
existentiam Numinis e principiis cosmologicis demonstramus.
Contingentia universi et ordinis naturæ, una cum impossibilitate
[127]122
[128]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
casus, sunt scala, per quam a mundo hoc adspectabili ad Deum
ascenditur. And, before him, Leibnitz said, in connection with
the law of causality: Sans ce grand principe on ne saurait venir à
la preuve de l'existence de Dieu. On the other hand, the thought
which is worked out in this chapter is so far from being essential
and necessary to reason, that it is rather to be regarded as a
veritable masterpiece of the monstrous productions of an age
which, through strange circumstances, fell into the most singular
aberrations and perversities, such as the age of the Scholastics
was—an age which is unparalleled in the history of the world,
and can never return again. This Scholasticism, as it advanced
to its final form, certainly derived the principal proof of the
existence of God from the conception of the ens realissimum,
and only then used the other proofs as accessory. This, however,
is mere methodology, and proves nothing as to the origin of
theology in the human mind. Kant has here taken the procedure
of Scholasticism for that of reason—a mistake which indeed
he has made more than once. If it were true that according to
the essential laws of reason the Idea of God proceeds from the
disjunctive syllogism under the form of an Idea of the most real
being, this Idea would also have existed in the philosophy of
antiquity; but of the ens realissimum there is nowhere a trace in
any of the ancient philosophers, although some of them certainly
teach that there is a Creator of the world, yet only as the giver of
form to the matter which exists without him,  ́μ1⁄41¿ÅÁ3¿Â, a being
whom they yet infer simply and solely in accordance with the
law of causality. It is true that Sextus Empiricus (adv. Math., ix.
§ 88) quotes an argument of Cleanthes, which some have held
to be the ontological proof. This, however, it is not, but merely
an inference from analogy; because experience teaches that upon
earth one being is always better than another, and man, indeed,
as the best, closes the series, but yet has many faults; therefore
there must exist beings who are still better, and finally one being
who is best of all (oÁ±Ä1ÃÄ¿1⁄2, ±Á1ÃÄ¿1⁄2), and this would be God.Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
123
On the detailed refutation of speculative theology which now
follows I have only briefly to remark that it, and in general the
whole criticism of the three so-called Ideas of reason, thus the
whole Dialectic of Pure Reason, is indeed to a certain extent
the goal and end of the whole work: yet this polemical part
has not really an absolutely universal, permanent, and purely
philosophical interest, such as is possessed by the preceding
doctrinal part, i.e., the æsthetic and analytic; but rather a
temporary and local interest, because it stands in a special
relation to the leading points of the philosophy which prevailed
in Europe up till the time of Kant, the complete overthrow of
which was yet, to his immortal credit, achieved by him through
this polemic. He has eliminated theism from philosophy; for
in it, as a science and not a system of faith, only that can
find a place which is either empirically given or established by
valid proofs. Naturally we only mean here the real seriously
understood philosophy which is concerned with the truth, and
nothing else; and by no means the jest of philosophy taught in
the universities, in which, after Kant as before him, speculative
theology plays the principal part, and where, also, after as before
him, the soul appears without ceremony as a familiar person. For
it is the philosophy endowed with salaries and fees, and, indeed,
also with titles of Hofrath, which, looking proudly down from its
height, remains for forty years entirely unaware of the existence
of little people like me, and would be thoroughly glad to be
rid of the old Kant with his Critiques, that they might drink the
health of Leibnitz with all their hearts. It is further to be remarked
here, that as Kant was confessedly led to his doctrine of the a
priori nature of the conception of causality by Hume's scepticism
with regard to that conception, it may be that in the same way
Kant's criticism of all speculative theology had its occasion in
Hume's criticism of all popular theology, which he had given in
his “Natural History of Religion,” a book so well worth reading,
[129]124
[130]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
and in the “Dialogues on Natural Religion.” Indeed, it may be
that Kant wished to a certain extent to supplement this. For
the first-named work of Hume is really a critique of popular
theology, the pitiable condition of which it seeks to show; while,
on the other hand, it points to rational or speculative theology
as the genuine, and that which is worthy of respect. But Kant
now discloses the groundlessness of the latter, and leaves, on the
other hand, popular theology untouched, nay, even establishes
it in a nobler form as a faith based upon moral feeling. This
was afterwards distorted by the philosophasters into rational
apprehensions, consciousness of God, or intellectual intuitions
of the supersensible, of the divine, &c., &c.; while Kant, as he
demolished old and revered errors, and knew the danger of doing
so, rather wished through the moral theology merely to substitute
a few weak temporary supports, so that the ruin might not fall on
him, but that he might have time to escape.
Now, as regards the performance of the task, no critique of
reason was necessary for the refutation of the ontological proof
of the existence of God; for without presupposing the æsthetic
and analytic, it is quite easy to make clear that that ontological
proof is nothing but a subtle playing with conceptions which is
quite powerless to produce conviction. There is a chapter in the
“Organon” of Aristotle which suffices as fully for the refutation
of the ontological proof as if it had been written intentionally
with that purpose. It is the seventh chapter of the second book
of the “Analyt. Post.” Among other things, it is expressly said
there: “Ä¿  ́μ μ11⁄2±1 ¿Åo ¿ÅÃ1± ¿Å ́μ1⁄21,” i.e., existentia nunquam
ad essentiam rei pertinet.
The refutation of the cosmological proof is an application to
a given case of the doctrine of the Critique as expounded up to
that point, and there is nothing to be said against it. The physico-
theological proof is a mere amplification of the cosmological,
which it presupposes, and it finds its full refutation only in the
“Critique of Judgment.” I refer the reader in this connection toAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
125
the rubric, “Comparative Anatomy,” in my work on the Will in
Nature.
In the criticism of this proof Kant has only to do, as we have
already said, with speculative theology, and limits himself to the
School. If, on the contrary, he had had life and popular theology
also in view, he would have been obliged to add a fourth proof
to the three he has considered—that proof which is really the
effective one with the great mass of men, and which in Kant's
technical language might best be called the keraunological.
It is the proof which is founded upon the needy, impotent,
and dependent condition of man as opposed to natural forces,
which are infinitely superior, inscrutable, and for the most part
threatening evil; to which is added man's natural inclination to
personify everything, and finally the hope of effecting something
by prayers and flattery, and even by gifts. In every human
undertaking there is something which is not in our power and
does not come within our calculations; the wish to win this for
oneself is the origin of the gods. “Primus in orbe Deos fecit
timor” is an old and true saying of Petronius. It is principally
this proof which is criticised by Hume, who throughout appears
as Kant's forerunner in the writings referred to above. But those
whom Kant has placed in a position of permanent embarrassment
by his criticism of speculative theology are the professors of
philosophy. Salaried by Christian governments, they dare not
give up the chief article of faith.9 Now, how do these gentlemen
9
Kant said, “It is very absurd to expect enlightenment from reason, and yet
to prescribe to her beforehand which side she must necessarily take” (“Critique
of Pure Reason,” p. 747; V. 775). On the other hand, the following is the naive
assertion of a professor of philosophy in our own time: “If a philosophy denies
the reality of the fundamental ideas of Christianity, it is either false, or, even if
true, it is yet useless.” That is to say, for professors of philosophy. It was the
late Professor Bachmann who, in the Jena Litteraturzeitung for July 1840, No.
126, so indiscreetly blurted out the maxim of all his colleagues. However, it
is worth noticing, as regards the characteristics of the University philosophy,
how here the truth, if it will not suit and adapt itself, is shown the door without

[132]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
help themselves? They simply declare that the existence of
God is self-evident. Indeed! After the ancient world, at the
expense of its conscience, had worked miracles to prove it,
and the modern world, at the expense of its understanding, had
brought into the field ontological, cosmological, and physico-
theological proofs—to these gentlemen it is self-evident. And
from this self-evident God they then explain the world: that is
their philosophy.
Till Kant came there was a real dilemma between materialism
and theism, i.e., between the assumption that a blind chance,
or that an intelligence working from without in accordance
with purposes and conceptions, had brought about the world,
neque dabatur tertium. Therefore atheism and materialism were
the same; hence the doubt whether there really could be an
atheist, i.e., a man who really could attribute to blind chance
the disposition of nature, so full of design, especially organised
nature. See, for example, Bacon's Essays (sermones fideles),
Essay 16, on Atheism. In the opinion of the great mass of men,
and of the English, who in such things belong entirely to the
great mass (the mob), this is still the case, even with their most
celebrated men of learning. One has only to look at Owen's
“Ostéologie Comparée,” of 1855, preface, p. 11, 12, where he
stands always before the old dilemma between Democritus and
Epicurus on the one side, and an intelligence on the other, in
which la connaissance d'un être tel que l'homme a existé avant
que l'homme fit son apparition. All design must have proceeded
from an intelligence; he has never even dreamt of doubting
this. Yet in the lecture based upon this now modified preface,
delivered in the Académie des Sciences on the 5th September
1853, he says, with childish naivete: “La téléologie, ou la
théologie scientifique” (Comptes Rendus, Sept. 1853), that is for
him precisely the same thing! Is anything in nature designed?
ceremony, with, “Be off, truth! we cannot make use of you. Do we owe you
anything? Do you pay us? Then be off!”Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
127
then it is a work of intention, of reflection, of intelligence. Yet,
certainly, what has such an Englishman and the Académie des
Sciences to do with the “Critique of Judgment,” or, indeed, with
my book upon the Will in Nature? These gentlemen do not see
so far below them. These illustres confrères disdain metaphysics
and the philosophie allemande: they confine themselves to the
old woman's philosophy. The validity of that disjunctive major,
that dilemma between materialism and theism, rests, however,
upon the assumption that the present given world is the world
of things in themselves; that consequently there is no other
order of things than the empirical. But after the world and its
order had through Kant become mere phenomenon, the laws
of which rest principally upon the forms of our intellect, the
existence and nature of things and of the world no longer
required to be explained according to the analogy of the changes
perceived or effected by us in the world; nor must that which
we comprehend as means and end have necessarily arisen as the
consequence of a similar knowledge. Thus, inasmuch as Kant,
through his important distinction between phenomenon and thing
in itself, withdrew the foundation from theism, he opened, on
the other hand, the way to entirely different and more profound
explanations of existence.
In the chapter on the ultimate aim of the natural dialectic of
reason it is asserted that the three transcendent Ideas are of value
as regulative principles for the advancement of the knowledge
of nature. But Kant can barely have been serious in making
this assertion. At least its opposite, that these assumptions are
restrictive and fatal to all investigation of nature, is to every
natural philosopher beyond doubt. To test this by an example,
let any one consider whether the assumption of the soul as
an immaterial, simple, thinking substance would have been
necessarily advantageous or in the highest degree impeding to
the truths which Cabanis has so beautifully expounded, or to the
discoveries of Flourens, Marshall Hall, and Ch. Bell. Indeed Kant
[133]128
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
himself says (Prolegomena, § 44), “The Ideas of the reason are
opposed and hindering to the maxims of the rational knowledge
of nature.”
It is certainly not the least merit of Frederick the Great, that
under his Government Kant could develop himself, and dared to
publish the “Critique of Pure Reason.” Hardly under any other
Government would a salaried professor have ventured such a
thing. Kant was obliged to promise the immediate successor of
the great king that he would write no more.
[134]
I might consider that I could dispense with the criticism of
the ethical part of the Kantian philosophy here because I have
given a detailed and thorough criticism of it twenty-two years
later than the present work in the “Beiden Grundproblemen der
Ethik.” However, what is here retained from the first edition,
and for the sake of completeness must not be omitted, may serve
as a suitable introduction to that later and much more thorough
criticism, to which in the main I therefore refer the reader.
On account of Kant's love of architectonic symmetry, the
theoretical reason had also to have a pendant. The intellectus
practicus of the Scholastics, which again springs from the 1⁄2¿ÅÂ
ÀÁ±oÄ1o¿Â of Aristotle (De Anima, iii. 10, and Polit., vii. c.
14: A 1⁄4μ1⁄2 3±Á ÀÁ±oÄ1o¿Â μÃÄ1 »¿3¿Â, A  ́μ  ̧μÉÁ·Ä1o¿Â), provides
the word ready made. Yet here something quite different is
denoted by it—not as there, the reason directed to technical
skill. Here the practical reason appears as the source and origin
of the undeniable ethical significance of human action, and of
all virtue, all nobleness, and every attainable degree of holiness.
All this accordingly should come from mere reason, and demand
nothing but this. To act rationally and to act virtuously, nobly,
holily, would be one and the same; and to act selfishly, wickedly,
viciously, would be merely to act irrationally. However, all
times and peoples and languages have distinguished the two, and
held them to be quite different things; and so does every oneAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
129
even at the present day who knows nothing of the language of
the new school, i.e., the whole world, with the exception of a
small company of German savants. Every one but these last
understands by virtuous conduct and a rational course of life two
entirely different things. To say that the sublime founder of the
Christian religion, whose life is presented to us as the pattern of
all virtue, was the most rational of all men would be called a
very unbecoming and even a blasphemous way of speaking; and
almost as much so if it were said that His precepts contained all
the best directions for a perfectly rational life. Further, that he
who, in accordance with these precepts, instead of taking thought
for his own future needs, always relieves the greater present
wants of others, without further motive, nay, gives all his goods
to the poor, in order then, destitute of all means of subsistence, to
go and preach to others also the virtue which he practises himself;
this every one rightly honours; but who ventures to extol it as
the highest pitch of reasonableness? And finally, who praises it
as a rational deed that Arnold von Winkelried, with surpassing
courage, clasped the hostile spears against his own body in order
to gain victory and deliverance for his countrymen? On the other
hand, if we see a man who from his youth upwards deliberates
with exceptional foresight how he may procure for himself an
easy competence, the means for the support of wife and children,
a good name among men, outward honour and distinction, and
in doing so never allows himself to be led astray or induced
to lose sight of his end by the charm of present pleasures or
the satisfaction of defying the arrogance of the powerful, or the
desire of revenging insults and undeserved humiliations he has
suffered, or the attractions of useless aesthetic or philosophical
occupations of the mind, or travels in interesting lands, but with
great consistency works towards his one end,—who ventures to
deny that such a philistine is in quite an extraordinary degree
rational, even if he has made use of some means which are
not praiseworthy but are yet without danger? Nay, more, if a
[135]130
[136]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
bad man, with deliberate shrewdness, through a well-thought-
out plan attains to riches and honours, and even to thrones
and crowns, and then with the acutest cunning gets the better
of neighbouring states, overcomes them one by one, and now
becomes a conqueror of the world, and in doing so is not led
astray by any respect for right, any sense of humanity, but with
sharp consistency tramples down and dashes to pieces everything
that opposes his plan, without compassion plunges millions into
misery of every kind, condemns millions to bleed and die, yet
royally rewards and always protects his adherents and helpers,
never forgetting anything, and thus reaches his end,—who does
not see that such a man must go to work in a most rational
manner?—that, as a powerful understanding was needed to form
the plans, their execution demanded the complete command of
the reason, and indeed properly of practical reason? Or are the
precepts which the prudent and consistent, the thoughtful and
far-seeing Machiavelli prescribes to the prince irrational?10
As wickedness is quite consistent with reason, and indeed
only becomes really terrible in this conjunction, so, conversely,
nobleness is sometimes joined with want of reason. To this may
be attributed the action of Coriolanus, who, after he had applied
all his strength for years to the accomplishment of his revenge
upon the Romans, when at length the time came, allowed himself
to be softened by the prayers of the Senate and the tears of
his mother and wife, gave up the revenge he had so long and
10
By the way, Machiavelli's problem was the solution of the question how
the prince, as a prince, was to keep himself on the throne in spite of internal
and external enemies. His problem was thus by no means the ethical problem
whether a prince, as a man, ought to will such things, but purely the political
one how, if he so wills, he can carry it out. And the solution of this problem
he gives just as one writes directions for playing chess, with which it would be
folly to mix up the answer to the question whether from an ethical point of view
it is advisable to play chess at all. To reproach Machiavelli with the immorality
of his writing is just the same as to reproach a fencing-master because he does
not begin his instructions with a moral lecture against murder and slaughter.Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
131
so painfully prepared, and indeed, by thus bringing on himself
the just anger of the Volscians, died for those very Romans
whose thanklessness he knew and desired so intensely to punish.
Finally, for the sake of completeness, it may be mentioned that
reason may very well exist along with want of understanding.
This is the case when a foolish maxim is chosen, but is followed
out consistently. An example of this is afforded by the case of
the Princess Isabella, daughter of Philip II., who vowed that she
would not put on a clean chemise so long as Ostend remained
unconquered, and kept her word through three years. In general
all vows are of this class, whose origin is a want of insight
as regards the law of causality, i.e., want of understanding;
nevertheless it is rational to fulfil them if one is of such narrow
understanding as to make them.
In agreement with what we have said, we see the writers who
appeared just before Kant place the conscience, as the seat of the
moral impulses, in opposition to the reason. Thus Rousseau, in
the fourth book of “Emile,” says: “La raison nous trompe, mais la
conscience ne trompe jamais;” and further on: “Il est impossible
d'expliquer par les conséquences de notre nature le principe
immédiat de la conscience indépendant de la raison même.”
Still further: “Mes sentimens naturels parlaient pour l'intérêt
commun, ma raison rapportait tout a moi.... On a beau vouloir
etablir la vertu par la raison seul, quelle solide base peut-on lui
donner?” In the “Rêveries du Promeneur,” prom. 4 ême, he says:
“Dans toutes les questions de morale difficiles je me suis tojours
bien trouvé de les résoudre par le dictamen de la conscience,
plutôt que par les lumières de la raison.” Indeed Aristotle already
says expressly (Eth. Magna, i. 5) that the virtues have their seat in
the ±»¿3ó 1⁄4¿Á1ó Ä·Â ÈÅÇ·Â (in parte irrationali animi), and not
in the »¿3¿1⁄2 μÇ¿1⁄2Ä1 (in parte rationali). In accordance with this,
Stobæus says (Ecl., ii, c.7), speaking of the Peripatetics: “¤·1⁄2

(Ethicam virtutem circa partem animæ ratione carentem versari
putant, cam duplicem, ad hanc disquisitionem, animam ponant,
ratione præditam, et ea carentem. In parte vero ratione
prædita collocant ingenuitatem, prudentiam, perspicacitatem,
sapientiam, docilitatem, memoriam et reliqua; in parte vero
ratione destituta temperantiam, justitiam, fortitadinem, et
reliquas virtutes, quas ethicas vocant.) And Cicero (De Nat.
Deor., iii., c. 26-31) explains at length that reason is the
necessary means, the tool, of all crime.
I have explained reason to be the faculty of framing concepts.
It is this quite special class of general non-perceptible ideas,
which are symbolised and fixed only by words, that distinguishes
man from the brutes and gives him the pre-eminence upon earth.
While the brute is the slave of the present, and knows only
immediate sensible motives, and therefore when they present
themselves to it is necessarily attracted or repelled by them, as
iron is by the magnet, in man, on the contrary, deliberation has
been introduced through the gift of reason.
This enables him easily to survey as a whole his life and
the course of the world, looking before and after; it makes
him independent of the present, enables him to go to work
deliberately, systematically, and with foresight, to do evil as well
as to do good. But what he does he does with complete self-
consciousness; he knows exactly how his will decides, what in
each case he chooses, and what other choice was in the nature of
the case possible; and from this self-conscious willing he comes
to know himself and mirrors himself in his actions. In all these
relations to the conduct of men reason is to be called practical; it
is only theoretical so far as the objects with which it is concernedAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
133
have no relation to the action of the thinker, but have purely a
theoretical interest, which very few men are capable of feeling.
What in this sense is called practical reason is very nearly what
is signified by the Latin word prudentia, which, according to
Cicero (De Nat. Deor. ii., 22), is a contraction of providentia;
while, on the other hand, ratio, if used of a faculty of the mind,
signifies for the most part theoretical reason proper, though the
ancients did not observe the distinction strictly. In nearly all men
reason has an almost exclusively practical tendency; but if this
also is abandoned thought loses the control of action, so that it
is then said, “Scio meliora, proboque, deteriora sequor,” or “Le
matin je fais des projets, et le soir je fais des sottises.” Thus the
man does not allow his conduct to be guided by his thought, but
by the impression of the moment, after the manner of the brute;
and so he is called irrational (without thereby imputing to him
moral turpitude), although he is not really wanting in reason, but
in the power of applying it to his action; and one might to a
certain extent say his reason is theoretical and not practical. He
may at the same time be a really good man, like many a one who
can never see any one in misfortune without helping him, even
making sacrifices to do so, and yet leaves his debts unpaid. Such
an irrational character is quite incapable of committing great
crimes, because the systematic planning, the discrimination and
self-control, which this always requires are quite impossible to
him. Yet, on the other hand, he will hardly attain to a very high
degree of virtue, for, however much inclined to good he may be
by nature, those single vicious and wicked emotions to which
every one is subject cannot be wanting; and where reason does
not manifest itself practically, and oppose to them unalterable
maxims and firm principles, they must become deeds.
Finally, reason manifests itself very specially as practical
in those exceedingly rational characters who on this account
are called in ordinary life practical philosophers, and who
are distinguished by an unusual equanimity in disagreeable
[139]134
[140]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
as in pleasing circumstances, an equable disposition, and a
determined perseverance in resolves once made. In fact, it is
the predominance of reason in them, i.e., the more abstract than
intuitive knowledge, and therefore the survey of life by means
of conceptions, in general and as a whole, which has enabled
them once for all to recognise the deception of the momentary
impression, the fleeting nature of all things, the shortness of
life, the emptiness of pleasures, the fickleness of fortune, and
the great and little tricks of chance. Therefore nothing comes
to them unexpectedly, and what they know in the abstract does
not surprise nor disturb them when it meets them in the actual
and in the particular case, though it does so in the case of
those less reasonable characters upon whom the present, the
perceptible, the actual, exerts such an influence that the cold,
colourless conceptions are thrown quite into the background of
consciousness, and forgetting principles and maxims, they are
abandoned to emotions and passions of every kind. I have already
explained at the end of the first book that in my opinion the ethics
of Stoicism were simply a guide to a truly reasonable life, in
this sense. Such a life is also repeatedly praised by Horace in
very many passages. This is the significance of his nil admirari,
and also of the Delphic œ· ́μ1⁄2 ±3±1⁄2. To translate nil admirari
“to admire nothing” is quite wrong. This Horatian maxim does
not concern the theoretical so much as the practical, and its real
meaning is: “Prize no object unconditionally. Do not fall in love
with anything; do not believe that the possession of anything can
give you happiness. Every intense longing for an object is only
a delusive chimera, which one may just as well, and much more
easily, get quit of by fuller knowledge as by attained possession.”
Cicero also uses admirari in this sense (De Divinatione, ii. 2).
What Horace means is thus the ± ̧±1⁄421± and ±o±Ä±À»·3⁄41Â, also
± ̧±Å1⁄4±Ã1±, which Democritus before him prized as the highest
good (see Clem. Alex. Strom., ii. 21, and cf. Strabo, i. p. 98 and
105). Such reasonableness of conduct has properly nothing to doAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
135
with virtue and vice; but this practical use of reason is what gives
man his pre-eminence over the brute, and only in this sense has
it any meaning and is it permissible to speak of a dignity of man.
In all the cases given, and indeed in all conceivable cases,
the distinction between rational and irrational action runs back
to the question whether the motives are abstract conceptions or
ideas of perception. Therefore the explanation which I have
given of reason agrees exactly with the use of language at all
times and among all peoples—a circumstance which will not
be regarded as merely accidental or arbitrary, but will be seen
to arise from the distinction of which every man is conscious,
of the different faculties of the mind, in accordance with which
consciousness he speaks, though certainly he does not raise it to
the distinctness of an abstract definition. Our ancestors did not
make the words without attaching to them a definite meaning, in
order, perhaps, that they might lie ready for philosophers who
might possibly come centuries after and determine what ought
to be thought in connection with them; but they denoted by
them quite definite conceptions. Thus the words are no longer
unclaimed, and to attribute to them an entirely different sense
from that which they have hitherto had means to misuse them,
means to introduce a licence in accordance with which every
one might use any word in any sense he chose, and thus endless
confusion would necessarily arise. Locke has already shown
at length that most disagreements in philosophy arise from a
false use of words. For the sake of illustration just glance for
a moment at the shameful misuse which philosophers destitute
of thoughts make at the present day of the words substance,
consciousness, truth, and many others. Moreover, the utterances
and explanations concerning reason of all philosophers of all
ages, with the exception of the most modern, agree no less with
my explanation of it than the conceptions which prevail among
all nations of that prerogative of man. Observe what Plato, in
the fourth book of the Republic, and in innumerable scattered
[141]136
[142]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
passages, calls the »¿311⁄4¿1⁄2, or »¿31ÃÄ1o¿1⁄2 Ä·Â ÈÅÇ·Â, what
Cicero says (De Nat. Deor., iii. 26-31), what Leibnitz and Locke
say upon this in the passages already quoted in the first book.
There would be no end to the quotations here if one sought to
show how all philosophers before Kant have spoken of reason in
general in my sense, although they did not know how to explain
its nature with complete definiteness and distinctness by reducing
it to one point. What was understood by reason shortly before
Kant's appearance is shown in general by two essays of Sulzer
in the first volume of his miscellaneous philosophical writings,
the one entitled “Analysis of the Conception of Reason,” the
other, “On the Reciprocal Influence of Reason and Language.”
If, on the other hand, we read how reason is spoken about in the
most recent times, through the influence of the Kantian error,
which after him increased like an avalanche, we are obliged to
assume that the whole of the wise men of antiquity, and also all
philosophers before Kant, had absolutely no reason at all; for the
immediate perceptions, intuitions, apprehensions, presentiments
of the reason now discovered were as utterly unknown to them
as the sixth sense of the bat is to us. And as far as I am concerned,
I must confess that I also, in my weakness, cannot comprehend
or imagine that reason which directly perceives or apprehends,
or has an intellectual intuition of the super-sensible, the absolute,
together with long yarns that accompany it, in any other way
than as the sixth sense of the bat. This, however, must be said
in favour of the invention or discovery of such a reason, which
at once directly perceives whatever you choose, that it is an
incomparable expedient for withdrawing oneself from the affair
in the easiest manner in the world, along with one's favourite
ideas, in spite of all Kants, with their Critiques of Reason. The
invention and the reception it has met with do honour to the age.
Thus, although what is essential in reason (Ä¿ »¿311⁄4¿1⁄2, !
ÆÁ¿1⁄2·Ã1Â, ratio, raison, Vernunft) was, on the whole and in
general, rightly understood by all philosophers of all ages,Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
137
though not sharply enough defined nor reduced to one point, yet
it was not so clear to them what the understanding (1⁄2¿ÅÂ,  ́1±1⁄2¿1±,
intellectus, esprit, Verstand) is. Therefore they often confuse
it with reason, and just on this account they did not attain to a
thoroughly complete, pure, and simple explanation of the nature
of the latter. With the Christian philosophers the conception
of reason received an entirely extraneous, subsidiary meaning
through the opposition of it to revelation. Starting, then, from
this, many are justly of opinion that the knowledge of the duty
of virtue is possible from mere reason, i.e., without revelation.
Indeed this aspect of the matter certainly had influence upon
Kant's exposition and language. But this opposition is properly
of positive, historical significance, and is therefore for philosophy
a foreign element, from which it must keep itself free.
We might have expected that in his critiques of theoretical and
practical reason Kant would have started with an exposition of
the nature of reason in general, and, after he had thus defined the
genus, would have gone on to the explanation of the two species,
showing how one and the same reason manifests itself in two such
different ways, and yet, by retaining its principal characteristic,
proves itself to be the same. But we find nothing of all this. I have
already shown how inadequate, vacillating, and inconsistent are
the explanations of the faculty he is criticising, which he gives
here and there by the way in the “Critique of Pure Reason.”
The practical reason appears in the “Critique of Pure Reason”
without any introduction, and afterwards stands in the “Critique”
specially devoted to itself as something already established. No
further account of it is given, and the use of language of all
times and peoples, which is treated with contempt, and the
definitions of the conception given by the greatest of earlier
philosophers, dare not lift up their voices. In general, we may
conclude from particular passages that Kant's opinion amounts
to this: the knowledge of principles a priori is the essential
characteristic of reason: since now the knowledge of the ethical
[143]138
[144]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
significance of action is not of empirical origin, it also is an a
priori principle, and accordingly proceeds from the reason, and
therefore thus far the reason is practical. I have already spoken
enough of the incorrectness of this explanation of reason. But,
independently of this, how superficial it is, and what a want of
thoroughness it shows, to make use here of the single quality of
being independent of experience in order to combine the most
heterogeneous things, while overlooking their most essential and
immeasurable difference in other respects. For, even assuming,
though we do not admit it, that the knowledge of the ethical
significance of action springs from an imperative lying in us,
an unconditioned ought, yet how fundamentally different would
such an imperative be from those universal forms of knowledge
of which, in the “Critique of Pure Reason,” Kant proves that
we are conscious a priori, and by virtue of which consciousness
we can assert beforehand an unconditioned must, valid for all
experience possible for us. But the difference between this must,
this necessary form of all objects which is already determined in
the subject, and that ought of morality is so infinitely great and
palpable that the mere fact that they agree in the one particular
that neither of them is empirically known may indeed be made
use of for the purpose of a witty comparison, but not as a
philosophical justification for regarding their origin as the same.
Moreover, the birthplace of this child of practical reason,
the absolute ought or the categorical imperative, is not in the
“Critique of Practical Reason,” but in that of “Pure Reason,”
p. 802; V. 830. The birth is violent, and is only accomplished
by means of the forceps of a therefore, which stands boldly
and audaciously, indeed one might say shamelessly, between
two propositions which are utterly foreign to each other and
have no connection, in order to combine them as reason and
consequent. Thus, that not merely perceptible but also abstract
motives determine us, is the proposition from which Kant starts,
expressing it in the following manner: “Not merely what excites,Appendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
139
i.e., what affects the senses directly, determines human will, but
we have a power of overcoming the impressions made upon our
sensuous appetitive faculty through ideas of that which is itself in
a more remote manner useful or hurtful. These deliberations as to
what is worthy of desire, with reference to our whole condition,
i.e., as to what is good and useful, rest upon reason.” (Perfectly
right; would that he only always spoke so rationally of reason!)
“Reason therefore gives! also laws, which are imperatives,
i.e., objective laws of freedom, and say what ought to take
place, though perhaps it never does take place”! Thus, without
further authentication, the categorical imperative comes into the
world, in order to rule there with its unconditioned ought—a
sceptre of wooden iron. For in the conception “ought” there lies
always and essentially the reference to threatened punishment,
or promised reward, as a necessary condition, and cannot be
separated from it without abolishing the conception itself and
taking all meaning from it. Therefore an unconditioned ought
is a contradictio in adjecto. It was necessary to censure this
mistake, closely as it is otherwise connected with Kant's great
service to ethics, which consists in this, that he has freed ethics
from all principles of the world of experience, that is, from all
direct or indirect doctrines of happiness, and has shown in a quite
special manner that the kingdom of virtue is not of this world.
This service is all the greater because all ancient philosophers,
with the single exception of Plato, thus the Peripatetics, the
Stoics, and the Epicureans, sought by very different devices
either to make virtue and happiness dependent on each other in
accordance with the principle of sufficient reason, or to identify
them in accordance with the principle of contradiction. This
charge applies with equal force to all modern philosophers down
to Kant. His merit in this respect is therefore very great; yet
justice demands that we should also remember here first that his
exposition and elaboration often does not correspond with the
tendency and spirit of his ethics, and secondly that, even so, he
[145]140
[146]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
is not really the first who separated virtue from all principles of
happiness. For Plato, especially in the “Republic,” the principal
tendency of which is just this, expressly teaches that virtue is to
be chosen for itself alone, even if unhappiness and ignominy are
inevitably connected with it. Still more, however, Christianity
preaches a perfectly unselfish virtue, which is practised not on
account of the reward in a life after death, but quite disinterestedly
from love to God, for works do not justify, but only faith, which
accompanies virtue, so to speak, as its symptom, and therefore
appears quite irrespective of reward and of its own accord. See
Luther's “De Libertate Christiana.” I will not take into account
at all the Indians, in whose sacred books the hope of a reward
for our works is everywhere described as the way of darkness,
which can never lead to blessedness. Kant's doctrine of virtue,
however, we do not find so pure; or rather the exposition remains
far behind the spirit of it, and indeed falls into inconsistency. In
his highest good, which he afterwards discussed, we find virtue
united to happiness. The ought originally so unconditioned does
yet afterwards postulate one condition, in order to escape from
the inner contradiction with which it is affected and with which
it cannot live. Happiness in the highest good is not indeed really
meant to be the motive for virtue; yet there it is, like a secret
article, the existence of which reduces all the rest to a mere
sham contract. It is not really the reward of virtue, but yet it
is a voluntary gift for which virtue, after work accomplished,
stealthily opens the hand. One may convince oneself of this from
the “Critique of Practical Reason” (p. 223-266 of the fourth, or
p. 264-295 of Rosenkranz's, edition). The whole of Kant's moral
theology has also the same tendency, and just on this account
morality really destroys itself through moral theology. For I
repeat that all virtue which in any way is practised for the sake of
a reward is based upon a prudent, methodical, far-seeing egoism.
The content of the absolute ought, the fundamental principle
of the practical reason, is the famous: “So act that the maximAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
141
of your will might always be also valid as the principle of a
universal legislation.” This principle presents to him who desires
a rule for his own will the task of seeking such a rule for the
wills of all. Then the question arises how such a rule is to be
found. Clearly, in order to discover the rule of my conduct, I
ought not to have regard to myself alone, but to the sum of all
individuals. Then, instead of my own well-being, the well-being
of all without distinction becomes my aim. Yet the aim still
always remains well-being. I find, then, that all can be equally
well off only if each limits his own egoism by that of others.
From this it certainly follows that I must injure no one, because,
since this principle is assumed to be universal, I also will not be
injured. This, however, is the sole ground on account of which I,
who do not yet possess a moral principle, but am only seeking
one, can wish this to be a universal law. But clearly in this way
the desire of well-being, i.e., egoism, remains the source of this
ethical principle. As the basis of politics it would be excellent, as
the basis of ethics it is worthless. For he who seeks to establish a
rule for the wills of all, as is demanded by that moral principle,
necessarily stands in need of a rule himself; otherwise everything
would be alike to him. But this rule can only be his own egoism,
since it is only this that is affected by the conduct of others; and
therefore it is only by means of this egoism, and with reference to
it, that each one can have a will concerning the conduct of others,
and that it is not a matter of indifference to him. Kant himself
very naively intimates this (p. 123 of the “Critique of Practical
Reason;” Rosenkranz's edition, p. 192), where he thus prosecutes
the search for maxims for the will: “If every one regarded the
need of others with complete indifference, and thou also didst
belong to such an order of things, wouldst thou consent thereto?”
Quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam! would be the
rule of the consent inquired after. So also in the “Fundamental
Principles of the Metaphysic of Morals” (p. 56 of the third, and
p. 50 of Rosenkranz's, edition): “A will which resolved to assist no one in distress would contradict itself, for cases might arise in
which it required the love and sympathy of others,” &c. &c. This
principle of ethics, which when light is thrown upon it is therefore
nothing else than an indirect and disguised expression of the old,
simple principle, “Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris,” is
related first and directly to passivity, suffering, and then only by
means of this to action. Therefore, as we have said, it would be
thoroughly serviceable as a guide for the constitution of the State,
which aims at the prevention of the suffering of wrong, and also
desires to procure for all and each the greatest sum of well-being.
But in ethics, where the object of investigation is action as action,
and in its direct significance for the actor—not its consequences,
suffering, or its relation to others—in this reference, I say, it is
altogether inadmissible, because at bottom it really amounts to a
principle of happiness, thus to egoism.

We cannot, therefore, share Kant's satisfaction that his
principle of ethics is not a material one, i.e., one which sets up
an object as a motive, but merely formal, whereby it corresponds
symmetrically to the formal laws with which the “Critique of
Pure Reason” has made us familiar. Certainly it is, instead of a
law, merely a formula for finding such a law. But, in the first
place, we had this formula already more briefly and clearly in
the “Quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne feceris;” and, secondly,
the analysis of this formula shows that it is simply and solely
the reference to one's own happiness that gives it content, and
therefore it can only be serviceable to a rational egoism, to which
also every legal constitution owes its origin.
Another mistake which, because it offends the feelings of
every one, has often been condemned, and was satirised by
Schiller in an epigram, is the pedantic rule that for an act to
be really good and meritorious it must be done simply and
solely out of respect for the known law and the conception of
duty, and in accordance with a maxim known to the reason in
abstracto, and not from any inclination, not from benevolence feltAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
143
towards others, not from tender-hearted compassion, sympathy,
or emotion of the heart, which (according to the “Critique of
Practical Reason,” p. 213; Rosenkranz's edition, p. 257) to
right-thinking persons are indeed very burdensome, as confusing
their deliberate maxims. The act must be performed unwillingly
and with self-compulsion. Remember that nevertheless the hope
of reward is not allowed to enter, and estimate the great absurdity
of the demand. But, what is saying more, this is directly opposed
to the true spirit of virtue; not the act, but the willingness to do
it, the love from which it proceeds, and without which it is a dead
work, constitutes its merit. Therefore Christianity rightly teaches
that all outward works are worthless if they do not proceed from
that genuine disposition which consists in true goodwill and pure
love, and that what makes blessed and saves is not the works
done (opera operata), but the faith, the genuine disposition,
which is the gift of the Holy Ghost alone, and which the free,
deliberative will, having only the law in view, does not produce.
This demand of Kant's, that all virtuous conduct shall proceed
from pure, deliberate respect for the law and in accordance with
its abstract maxims, coldly and without inclination, nay, opposed
to all inclination, is just the same thing as if he asserted that
every work of art must be accomplished by a well-considered
application of æsthetical rules. The one is just as perverse as
the other. The question, already handled by Plato and Seneca,
whether virtue can be taught, is to be answered in the negative.
We must finally make up our minds to see, what indeed was
the source of the Christian doctrine of election by grace, that
as regards its chief characteristic and its inner nature, virtue,
like genius, is to a certain extent inborn; and that just as little
as all the professors of æsthetics could impart to any one the
power of producing works of genius, i.e., genuine works of art,
so little could all the professors of ethics and preachers of virtue
transform an ignoble into a virtuous and noble character, the
impossibility of which is very much more apparent than that of turning lead into gold. The search for a system of ethics and a
first principle of the same, which would have practical influence
and would actually transform and better the human race, is just
like the search for the philosopher's stone. Yet I have spoken
at length at the end of the fourth book of the possibility of an
entire change of mind or conversion of man (new birth), not by
means of abstract (ethics) but of intuitive knowledge (the work
of grace). The contents of that book relieve me generally of the
necessity of dwelling longer upon this point.

That Kant by no means penetrated to the real significance of
the ethical content of actions is shown finally by his doctrine
of the highest good as the necessary combination of virtue and
happiness, a combination indeed in which virtue would be that
which merits happiness. He is here involved in the logical fallacy
that the conception of merit, which is here the measure or test,
already presupposes a theory of ethics as its own measure, and
thus could not be deducible from it. It appeared in our fourth
book that all genuine virtue, after it has attained to its highest
grade, at last leads to a complete renunciation in which all willing
finds an end. Happiness, on the other hand, is a satisfied wish;
thus the two are essentially incapable of being combined. He
who has been enlightened by my exposition requires no further
explanation of the complete perverseness of this Kantian view of
the highest good. And, independent of my positive exposition, I
have no further negative exposition to give.
Kant's love of architectonic symmetry meets us also in the
“Critique of Practical Reason,” for he has given it the shape
of the “Critique of Pure Reason,” and has again introduced the
same titles and forms with manifest intention, which becomes
specially apparent in the table of the categories of freedom.
The “Philosophy of Law” is one of Kant's latest works, and
is so poor that, although I entirely disagree with it, I think a
polemic against it is superfluous, since of its own weakness itAppendix: Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy.
145
must die a natural death, just as if it were not the work of this
great man, but the production of an ordinary mortal. Therefore,
as regards the “Philosophy of Law,” I give up the negative
mode of procedure and refer to the positive, that is, to the short
outline of it given in the fourth book. Just one or two general
remarks on Kant's “Philosophy of Law” may be made here.
The errors which I have condemned in considering the “Critique
of Pure Reason,” as clinging to Kant throughout, appear in the
“Philosophy of Law” in such excess that one often believes he is
reading a satirical parody of the Kantian style, or at least that he is
listening to a Kantian. Two principal errors, however, are these.
He desires (and many have since then desired) to separate the
Philosophy of Law sharply from ethics, and yet not to make the
former dependent upon positive legislation, i.e., upon arbitrary
sanction, but to let the conception of law exist for itself pure and
a priori. But this is not possible; because conduct, apart from
its ethical significance, and apart from the physical relation to
others, and thereby from external sanction, does not admit even
of the possibility of any third view. Consequently, when he says,
“Legal obligation is that which can be enforced,” this can is
either to be understood physically, and then all law is positive
and arbitrary, and again all arbitrariness that achieves its end is
law; or the can is to be understood ethically, and we are again in
the province of ethics. With Kant the conception of legal right
hovers between heaven and earth, and has no ground on which to
stand; with me it belongs to ethics. Secondly, his definition of the
conception law is entirely negative, and thereby inadequate.11
Legal right is that which is consistent with the compatibility of
the respective freedom of individuals together, according to a
general law. Freedom (here the empirical, i.e., physical, not
the moral freedom of the will) signifies not being hindered or
11
Although the conception of legal right is properly negative in opposition to
that of wrong, which is the positive starting-point, yet the explanation of these
conceptions must not on this account be entirely negative.
[151]146
[152]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
interfered with, and is thus a mere negation; compatibility, again,
has exactly the same significance. Thus we remain with mere
negations and obtain no positive conception, indeed do not learn
at all, what is really being spoken about, unless we know it
already from some other source. In the course of the exposition
the most perverse views afterwards develop themselves, such as
that in the state of nature, i.e., outside the State, there is no right to
property at all, which really means that all right or law is positive,
and involves that natural law is based upon positive law, instead
of which the case ought to be reversed. Further, the founding of
legal acquisition on possession; the ethical obligation to establish
the civil constitution; the ground of the right of punishment, &c.,
&c., all of which, as I have said, I do not regard as worth a
special refutation. However, these Kantian errors have exercised
a very injurious influence. They have confused and obscured
truths long known and expressed, and have occasioned strange
theories and much writing and controversy. This certainly cannot
last, and we see already how truth and sound reason again make
way for themselves. Of the latter, the “Naturrecht” of J. C. F.
Meister specially bears evidence, and is thus a contrast to many a
preposterous theory, though I do not regard it as on this account
a pattern of perfection.

On the “Critique of Judgment” also, after what has been said,
I must be very short. We cannot but be surprised that Kant, to
whom art certainly was very foreign, and who to all appearance
had little susceptibility for the beautiful, indeed probably never
had the opportunity of seeing an important work of art, and who
seems, finally, to have had no knowledge of Goethe, the only
man of his century and nation who was fit to be placed by his side
as his giant equal,—it is, I say, surprising how, notwithstanding
all this, Kant was able to render a great and permanent service to
the philosophical consideration of art and the beautiful. His merit
lies in this, that much as men had reflected upon the beautiful and upon art, they had yet really always considered it only from
the empirical point of view, and had investigated upon a basis
of facts what quality distinguished the object of any kind which
was called beautiful from other objects of the same kind. On
this path they first arrived at quite special principles, and then at
more general ones. They sought to separate true artistic beauty
from false, and to discover marks of this genuineness, which
could then serve again as rules. What gives pleasure as beautiful
and what does not, what therefore is to be imitated, what is to
be striven against, what is to be avoided, what rules, at least
negative rules, are to be established, in short, what are the means
of exciting æsthetic satisfaction, i.e., what are the conditions of
this residing in the object—this was almost exclusively the theme
of all treatises upon art. This path was followed by Aristotle,
and in the most recent times we find it chosen by Home,
Burke, Winckelmann, Lessing, Herder, and many others. It is
true that the universality of the æsthetical principles discovered
finally led back to the subject, and it was observed that if the
effect upon the subject were adequately known we would then
also be able to determine a priori the causes of this which lie
in the object, and thus alone this method of treatment could
attain to the certainty of a science. This occasioned once and
again psychological disquisitions. Specially however, Alexander
Baumgarten produced with this intention a general æsthetic of all
beauty, in which he started from the conception of the perfection
of sensuous knowledge, that is, of knowledge of perception.
With him also, however, the subjective part is done with as soon
as this conception has been established, and he passes on to the
objective part and to the practical, which is connected with it.
But here also the merit was reserved for Kant of investigating
seriously and profoundly the feeling itself, in consequence of
which we call the object occasioning it beautiful, in order to
discover, wherever it was possible, the constituent elements and
conditions of it in our nature. 

His investigation, therefore, took an entirely subjective direction. This path was clearly the right
one, for in order to explain a phenomenon which is given in its
effects, one must know accurately this effect itself, if one is to
determine thoroughly the nature of the cause. Yet Kant's merit
in this regard does not really extend much further than this, that
he has indicated the right path, and by a provisional attempt has
given an example of how, more or less, it is to be followed. For
what he gave cannot be regarded as objective truth and as a real
gain. He gave the method for this investigation, he broke ground
in the right direction, but otherwise he missed the mark.
In the “Critique of Æsthetical Judgment” the observation first
of all forces itself upon us that Kant retains the method which is
peculiar to his whole philosophy, and which I have considered
at length above—I mean the method of starting from abstract
knowledge in order to establish knowledge of perception, so
that the former serves him, so to speak, as a camera obscura
in which to receive and survey the latter. As in the “Critique
of Pure Reason” the forms of judgment are supposed to unfold
to him the knowledge of our whole world of perception, so in
this “Critique of Æsthetical Judgment” he does not start from the
beautiful itself, from the perceptible and immediately beautiful,
but from the judgment of the beautiful, the so-called, and very
badly so-called, judgment of taste. This is his problem. His
attention is especially aroused by the circumstance that such a
judgment is clearly the expression of something that takes place
in the subject, but yet is just as universally valid as if it concerned
a quality of the object. It is this that struck him, not the beautiful
itself. He starts always merely from the assertions of others,
from the judgment of the beautiful, not from the beautiful itself.
It is therefore as if he knew it simply from hearsay, not directly.
A blind man of high understanding could almost in the same
way make up a theory of colours from very accurate reports
which he had heard concerning them. And really we can only
venture to regard Kant's philosophemes concerning the beautiful as in almost the same position. Then we shall find that his
theory is very ingenious indeed, that here and there telling and
true observations are made; but his real solution of the problem
is so very insufficient, remains so far below the dignity of the
subject, that it can never occur to us to accept it as objective
truth. Therefore I consider myself relieved from the necessity of
refuting it; and here also I refer to the positive part of my work.
With regard to the form of his whole book, it is to be observed
that it originated in the idea of finding in the teleological
conception the key to the problem of the beautiful. This
inspiration is deduced, which is always a matter of no difficulty,
as we have learnt from Kant's successors. Thus there now arises
the strange combination of the knowledge of the beautiful with
that of the teleology of natural bodies in one faculty of knowledge
called judgment, and the treatment of these two heterogeneous
subjects in one book. With these three powers of knowledge,
reason, judgment, and understanding, a variety of symmetrical-
architectonic amusements are afterwards undertaken, the general
inclination to which shows itself in many ways in this book;
for example, in the forcible adaptation of the whole of it to the
pattern of the “Critique of Pure Reason,” and very specially in
the antinomy of the æsthetical judgment, which is dragged in by
the hair. One might also extract a charge of great inconsistency
from the fact that after it has been incessantly repeated in the
“Critique of Pure Reason” that the understanding is the faculty
of judgment, and after the forms of its judgment have been made
the foundation-stone of all philosophy, a quite special faculty of
judgment now appears, which is completely different from the
former. For the rest, what I call the faculty of judgment, the
capacity for translating knowledge of perception into abstract
knowledge, and again of applying the latter correctly to the
former, is explained in the positive part of my work.
By far the best part of the “Critique of Æsthetical Judgment”
is the theory of the sublime. It is incomparably more successful
[155]
[156]150
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
than that of the beautiful, and does not only give, as that does,
the general method of investigation, but also a part of the right
way to it—so much so that even though it does not give the real
solution of the problem, it yet touches very closely upon it.
[157]
In the “Critique of the Teleological Judgment,” on account
of the simplicity of the matter, we can recognise perhaps more
than anywhere else Kant's rare talent of turning a thought this
way and that way, and expressing it in a multitude of different
ways, until out of it there grows a book. The whole book is
intended to say this alone: although organised bodies necessarily
appear to us as if they were constructed in accordance with a
conceived design of an end which preceded them, yet we are not
justified in assuming that this is objectively the case. For our
intellect, to which things are given from without and indirectly,
which thus never knows their inner nature through which they
arise and exist, but merely their outward side, cannot otherwise
comprehend a certain quality peculiar to organised productions
of nature than by analogy, for it compares it with the intentionally
accomplished works of man, the nature of which is determined
by a design and the conception of this design. This analogy is
sufficient to enable us to comprehend the agreement of all the
parts with the whole, and thus indeed to give us the clue to their
investigation; but it must by no means on this account be made the
actual ground of explanation of the origin and existence of such
bodies. For the necessity of so conceiving them is of subjective
origin. Somewhat in this way I would epitomise Kant's doctrine
on this question. In its most important aspect he had expounded
it already in the “Critique of Pure Reason,” p. 692-702; V., 720-
730. But in the knowledge of this truth also we find David Hume
to be Kant's worthy forerunner. He also had keenly controverted
that assumption in the second part of his “Dialogues concerning
Natural Religion.” The difference between Hume's criticism
of that assumption and Kant's is principally this, that Hume
criticised it as an assumption based upon experience, while Kant, on the other hand, criticised it as an a priori assumption. Both are
right, and their expositions supplement each other. Indeed what
is really essential in the Kantian doctrine on this point we find
already expressed in the commentary of Simplicius on Aristotle's
Physics: “!  ́μ À»±1⁄2· 3μ3¿1⁄2μ1⁄2 ±ÅÄ¿1Â ±À¿ Ä¿Å !3μ1Ã ̧±1, À±1⁄2Ä±

Ä±  ́μ ÆÅÃμ1 1⁄4· AÅÄÉÂ AÁ±1⁄2 311⁄2¿1⁄4μ1⁄2±.” (Error iis ortus est ex eo,
quod credebant, omnia, quæ propter finem aliquem fierent, ex
proposito et ratiocinio fieri, dum videbant, naturæ opera non ita
fieri.) Schol. in Arist., ex edit. Berol., p. 354. Kant is perfectly
right in the matter; and it was necessary that after it had been
shown that the conception of cause and effect is inapplicable
to the whole of nature in general, in respect of its existence, it
should also be shown that in respect of its qualities it is not to be
thought of as the effect of a cause guided by motives (designs).
If we consider the great plausibility of the physico-theological
proof, which even Voltaire held to be irrefragable, it was clearly
of the greatest importance to show that what is subjective in our
comprehension, to which Kant had relegated space, time, and
causality, extends also to our judgment of natural bodies; and
accordingly the compulsion which we feel to think of them as
having arisen as the result of premeditation, according to designs,
thus in such a way that the idea of them preceded their existence,
is just as much of subjective origin as the perception of space,
which presents itself so objectively, and that therefore it must
not be set up as objective truth. Kant's exposition of the matter,
apart from its tedious prolixity and repetitions, is excellent.
He rightly asserts that we can never succeed in explaining the
nature of organised bodies from merely mechanical causes, by
which he understands the undesigned and regular effect of all
the universal forces of nature. Yet I find here another flaw.

He denies the possibility of such an explanation merely with
regard to the teleology and apparent adaptation of organised
bodies. But we find that even where there is no organisation the grounds of explanation which apply to one province of
nature cannot be transferred to another, but forsake us as soon
as we enter a new province, and new fundamental laws appear
instead of them, the explanation of which is by no means to
be expected from the laws of the former province. Thus in
the province of the mechanical, properly so called, the laws of
gravitation, cohesion, rigidity, fluidity, and elasticity prevail,
which in themselves (apart from my explanation of all natural
forces as lower grades of the objectification of will) exist as
manifestations of forces which cannot be further explained, but
themselves constitute the principles of all further explanation,
which merely consists in reduction to them. If we leave this
province and come to the phenomena of chemistry, of electricity,
magnetism, crystallisation, the former principles are absolutely
of no use, indeed the former laws are no longer valid, the former
forces are overcome by others, and the phenomena take place in
direct contradiction to them, according to new laws, which, just
like the former ones, are original and inexplicable, i.e., cannot
be reduced to more general ones. Thus, for example, no one will
ever succeed in explaining even the dissolving of a salt in water
in accordance with the laws proper to mechanics, much less the
more complicated phenomena of chemistry. All this has already
been explained at length in the second book of the present work.


An exposition of this kind would, as it seems to me, have been
of great use in the “Critique of the Teleological Judgment,” and
would have thrown much light upon what is said there. Such an
exposition would have been especially favourable to his excellent
remark that a more profound knowledge of the real being, of
which the things of nature are the manifestation, would recognise
both in the mechanical (according to law) and the apparently
intentional effects of nature one and the same ultimate principle,
which might serve as the more general ground of explanation of
them both. Such a principle I hope I have given by establishing
the will as the real thing in itself; and in accordance with it generally in the second book and the supplements to it, but
especially in my work “On the Will in Nature,” the insight into
the inner nature of the apparent design and of the harmony and
agreement of the whole of nature has perhaps become clearer
and deeper. Therefore I have nothing more to say about it here.
The reader whom this criticism of the Kantian philosophy
interests should not neglect to read the supplement to it which
is given in the second essay of the first volume of my “Parerga
and Paralipomena,” under the title “Noch einige Erläuterungen
zur Kantischen Philosophie” (Some Further Explanations of the
Kantian Philosophy). For it must be borne in mind that my
writings, few as they are, were not composed all at once, but
successively, in the course of a long life, and with long intervals
between them. Accordingly, it must not be expected that all I
have said upon one subject should stand together in one place.
