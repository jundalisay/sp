My theory of the ludicrous also depends upon the opposition
explained in the preceding chapters between perceptible and
abstract ideas, which I have brought into such marked
prominence. Therefore what has still to be said in explanation of
this theory finds its proper place here, although according to the
order of the text it would have to come later.

The problem of the origin, which is everywhere the same,
and hence of the peculiar significance of laughter, was already
known to Cicero, but only to be at once dismissed as insoluble
(De Orat., ii. 58). The oldest attempt known to me at
a psychological explanation of laughter is to be found in
Hutcheson's “Introduction into Moral Philosophy,” Bk. I., ch. i.
§ 14. A somewhat later anonymous work, “Traité des Causes
Physiques et Morals du Rire,” 1768, is not without merit as a
ventilation of the subject. Platner, in his “Anthropology,” § 894,
has collected the opinions of the philosophers from Hume to
Kant who have attempted an explanation of this phenomenon
peculiar to human nature. Kant's and Jean Paul's theories of the
ludicrous are well known. I regard it as unnecessary to prove
their incorrectness, for whoever tries to refer given cases of the
ludicrous to them will in the great majority of instances be at
once convinced of their insufficiency.

According to my explanation given in the first volume, the
source of the ludicrous is always the paradoxical, and therefore
unexpected, subsumption of an object under a conception
which in other respects is different from it, and accordingly
the phenomenon of laughter always signifies the sudden
apprehension of an incongruity between such a conception and
the real object thought under it, thus between the abstract and the
concrete object of perception. The greater and more unexpected,
in the apprehension of the laughter, this incongruity is, the more violent will be his laughter. Therefore in everything that excites
laughter it must always be possible to show a conception and
a particular, that is, a thing or event, which certainly can be
subsumed under that conception, and therefore thought through
it, yet in another and more predominating aspect does not belong
to it at all, but is strikingly different from everything else that is
thought through that conception. If, as often occurs, especially
in witticisms, instead of such a real object of perception, the
conception of a subordinate species is brought under the higher
conception of the genus, it will yet excite laughter only through
the fact that the imagination realises it, i.e., makes a perceptible
representative stand for it, and thus the conflict between what
is thought and what is perceived takes place. Indeed if we
wish to understand this perfectly explicitly, it is possible to
trace everything ludicrous to a syllogism in the first figure,
with an undisputed major and an unexpected minor, which to
a certain extent is only sophistically valid, in consequence of
which connection the conclusion partakes of the quality of the
ludicrous.
In the first volume I regarded it as superfluous to illustrate this
theory by examples, for every one can do this for himself by a
little reflection upon cases of the ludicrous which he remembers.
Yet, in order to come to the assistance of the mental inertness of
those readers who prefer always to remain in a passive condition,
I will accommodate myself to them. Indeed in this third edition
I wish to multiply and accumulate examples, so that it may be
indisputable that here, after so many fruitless earlier attempts,
the true theory of the ludicrous is given, and the problem which
was proposed and also given up by Cicero is definitely solved.
If we consider that an angle requires two lines meeting so that
if they are produced they will intersect each other; on the other
hand, that the tangent of a circle only touches it at one point,
but at this point is really parallel to it; and accordingly have
present to our minds the abstract conviction of the impossibility of an angle between the circumference of a circle and its tangent;
and if now such an angle lies visibly before us upon paper,
this will easily excite a smile. 

The ludicrousness in this case
is exceedingly weak; but yet the source of it in the incongruity
of what is thought and perceived appears in it with exceptional
distinctness. When we discover such an incongruity, the occasion
for laughter that thereby arises is, according as we pass from the
real, i.e., the perceptible, to the conception, or conversely from
the conception to the real, either a witticism or an absurdity,
which in a higher degree, and especially in the practical sphere,
is folly, as was explained in the text. Now to consider examples
of the first case, thus of wit, we shall first of all take the familiar
anecdote of the Gascon at whom the king laughed when he saw
him in light summer clothing in the depth of winter, and who
thereupon said to the king: “If your Majesty had put on what I
have, you would find it very warm;” and on being asked what
he had put on, replied: “My whole wardrobe!” Under this last
conception we have to think both the unlimited wardrobe of a
king and the single summer coat of a poor devil, the sight of
which upon his freezing body shows its great incongruity with
the conception. The audience in a theatre in Paris once called
for the “Marseillaise” to be played, and as this was not done,
began shrieking and howling, so that at last a commissary of
police in uniform came upon the stage and explained that it
was not allowed that anything should be given in the theatre
except what was in the playbill. Upon this a voice cried: “Et
vous, Monsieur, êtes-vous aussi sur l'affiche?”—a hit which was
received with universal laughter. For here the subsumption of
what is heterogeneous is at once distinct and unforced. The
epigramme:
“Bav is the true shepherd of whom the Bible spake:
Though his flock be all asleep, he alone remains awake:”
[273]268
[274]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
subsumes, under the conception of a sleeping flock and a
waking shepherd, the tedious preacher who still bellows on
unheard when he has sent all the people to sleep. Analogous to
this is the epitaph on a doctor: “Here lies he like a hero, and those
he has slain lie around him;” it subsumes under the conception,
honourable to the hero, of “lying surrounded by dead bodies,”
the doctor, who is supposed to preserve life. Very commonly
the witticism consists in a single expression, through which
only the conception is given, under which the case presented
can be subsumed, though it is very different from everything
else that is thought under it. So is it in “Romeo” when the
vivacious Mercutio answers his friends who promise to visit him
on the morrow: “Ask for me to-morrow, and you shall find
me a grave man.” Under this conception a dead man is here
subsumed; but in English there is also a play upon the words,
for “a grave man” means both a serious man and a man of the
grave. Of this kind is also the well-known anecdote of the actor
Unzelmann. In the Berlin theatre he was strictly forbidden to
improvise. Soon afterwards he had to appear on the stage on
horseback, and just as he came on the stage the horse dunged,
at which the audience began to laugh, but laughed much more
when Unzelmann said to the horse: “What are you doing? Don't
you know we are forbidden to improvise?” Here the subsumption
of the heterogeneous under the more general conception is very
distinct, but the witticism is exceedingly happy, and the ludicrous
effect produced by it excessively strong. To this class also belongs
the following announcement from Hall in a newspaper of March
1851: “The band of Jewish swindlers to which we have referred
were again delivered over to us with obligato accompaniment.”
This subsuming of a police escort under a musical term is very
happy, though it approaches the mere play upon words. On the
other hand, it is exactly a case of the kind we are considering
when Saphir, in a paper-war with the actor Angeli, describes
him as “Angeli, who is equally great in mind and body.” 

The small statue of the actor was known to the whole town, and thus
under the conception “great” unusual smallness was presented
to the mind. Also when the same Saphir calls the airs of a
new opera “good old friends,” and so brings the quality which
is most to be condemned under a conception which is usually
employed to commend. Also, if we should say of a lady whose
favour could be influenced by presents, that she knew how to
combine the utile with the dulci. For here we bring the moral life
under the conception of a rule which Horace has recommended
in an æsthetical reference. Also if to signify a brothel we should
call it the “modest abode of quiet joys.” Good society, in order
to be thoroughly insipid, has forbidden all decided utterances,
and therefore all strong expressions. Therefore it is wont, when
it has to signify scandalous or in any way indecent things, to
mitigate or extenuate them by expressing them through general
conceptions. But in this way it happens that they are more or
less incongruously subsumed, and in a corresponding degree the
effect of the ludicrous is produced. To this class belongs the
use of utile dulci referred to above, and also such expressions
as the following: “He had unpleasantness at the ball” when
he was thrashed and kicked out; or, “He has done too well”
when he is drunk; and also, “The woman has weak moments”
if she is unfaithful to her husband, &c. Equivocal sayings
also belong to the same class. They are conceptions which in
themselves contain nothing improper, but yet the case brought
under them leads to an improper idea. They are very common
in society. But a perfect example of a full and magnificent
equivocation is Shenstone's incomparable epitaph on a justice
of the peace, which, in its high-flown lapidary style, seems to
speak of noble and sublime things, while under each of their
conceptions something quite different is to be subsumed, which
only appears in the very last word as the unexpected key to the
whole, and the reader discovers with loud laughter that he has
only read a very obscene equivocation. 

In this smooth-combed age it is altogether impossible to quote this here, not to speak
of translating it; it will be found in Shenstone's poetical works,
under the title “Inscription.” Equivocations sometimes pass over
into mere puns, about which all that is necessary has been said
in the text.

Further, the ultimate subsumption, ludicrous to all, of what in
one respect is heterogeneous, under a conception which in other
respects agrees with it, may take place contrary to our intention.
For example, one of the free negroes in North America, who take
pains to imitate the whites in everything, quite recently placed an
epitaph over his dead child which begins, “Lovely, early broken
lily.” If, on the contrary, something real and perceptible is, with
direct intention, brought under the conception of its opposite, the
result is plain, common irony. For example, if when it is raining
hard we say, “Nice weather we are having to-day;” or if we say
of an ugly bride, “That man has found a charming treasure;”
or of a knave, “This honest man,” &c. &c. Only children and
quite uneducated people will laugh at such things; for here the
incongruity between what is thought and what is perceived is
total. Yet just in this direct exaggeration in the production of
the ludicrous its fundamental character, incongruity, appears
very distinctly. This species of the ludicrous is, on account of
its exaggeration and distinct intention, in some respects related
to parody. The procedure of the latter consists in this. It
substitutes for the incidents and words of a serious poem or
drama insignificant low persons or trifling motives and actions.
It thus subsumes the commonplace realities which it sets forth
under the lofty conceptions given in the theme, under which in
a certain respect they must come, while in other respects they
are very incongruous; and thereby the contrast between what is
perceived and what is thought appears very glaring. There is no
lack of familiar examples of this, and therefore I shall only give
one, from the “Zobeide” of Carlo Gozzi, act iv., scene 3, where
the famous stanza of Ariosto (Orl. Fur., i. 22), “Oh gran bontàChapter VIII. On The Theory Of The Ludicrous.
271
de' cavalieri antichi,” &c., is put word for word into the mouth
of two clowns who have just been thrashing each other, and tired
with this, lie quietly side by side. This is also the nature of the
application so popular in Germany of serious verses, especially of
Schiller, to trivial events, which clearly contains a subsumption
of heterogeneous things under the general conception which the
verse expresses. Thus, for example, when any one has displayed
a very characteristic trait, there will rarely be wanting some one
to say, “From that I know with whom I have to do.” But it was
original and very witty of a man who was in love with a young
bride to quote to the newly married couple (I know not how
loudly) the concluding words of Schiller's ballad, “The Surety:”
“Let me be, I pray you,
In your bond the third.”

The effect of the ludicrous is here strong and inevitable,
because under the conceptions through which Schiller presents
to the mind a moral and noble relation, a forbidden and immoral
relation is subsumed, and yet correctly and without change,
thus is thought through it. In all the examples of wit given
here we find that under a conception, or in general an abstract
thought, a real thing is, directly, or by means of a narrower
conception, subsumed, which indeed, strictly speaking, comes
under it, and yet is as different as possible from the proper and
original intention and tendency of the thought. Accordingly wit,
as a mental capacity, consists entirely in a facility for finding for
every object that appears a conception under which it certainly
can be thought, though it is very different from all the other
objects which come under this conception.

The second species of the ludicrous follows, as we have
mentioned, the opposite path from the abstract conception to
the real or perceptible things thought through it. But this now
brings to light any incongruity with the conception which was overlooked, and hence arises an absurdity, and therefore in the
practical sphere a foolish action. Since the play requires action,
this species of the ludicrous is essential to comedy. Upon this
depends the observation of Voltaire: “J'ai cru remarquer aux
spectacles, qu'il ne s'élève presque jamais de ces éclats de rire
universels, qu'à l'occasion d'une MÉPRISE” (Preface de L'Enfant
Prodigue). The following may serve as examples of this species
of the ludicrous. When some one had declared that he was fond
of walking alone, an Austrian said to him: “You like walking
alone; so do I: therefore we can go together.” He starts from
the conception, “A pleasure which two love they can enjoy in
common,” and subsumes under it the very case which excludes
community. Further, the servant who rubbed a worn sealskin
in his master's box with Macassar oil, so that it might become
covered with hair again; in doing which he started from the
conception, “Macassar oil makes hair grow.” The soldiers in the
guard-room who allowed a prisoner who was brought in to join
in their game of cards, then quarrelled with him for cheating,
and turned him out. They let themselves be led by the general
conception, “Bad companions are turned out,” and forget that
he is also a prisoner, i.e., one whom they ought to hold fast. Two
young peasants had loaded their gun with coarse shot, which
they wished to extract, in order to substitute fine, without losing
the powder. So one of them put the mouth of the barrel in
his hat, which he took between his legs, and said to the other:
“Now you pull the trigger slowly, slowly, slowly; then the shot
will come first.” He starts from the conception, “Prolonging
the cause prolongs the effect.” Most of the actions of Don
Quixote are also cases in point, for he subsumes the realities
he encounters under conceptions drawn from the romances of
chivalry, from which they are very different. For example, in
order to support the oppressed he frees the galley slaves. Properly
all Münchhausenisms are also of this nature, only they are
not actions which are performed, but impossibilities, which areChapter VIII. On The Theory Of The Ludicrous.

passed off upon the hearer as having really happened. In them the
fact is always so conceived that when it is thought merely in the
abstract, and therefore comparatively a priori, it appears possible
and plausible; but afterwards, if we come down to the perception
of the particular case, thus a posteriori the impossibility of the
thing, indeed the absurdity of the assumption, is brought into
prominence, and excites laughter through the evident incongruity
of what is perceived and what is thought. For example, when
the melodies frozen up in the post-horn are thawed in the warm
room—when Münchhausen, sitting upon a tree during a hard
frost, draws up his knife which has dropped to the ground by
the frozen jet of his own water, &c. Such is also the story of
the two lions who broke down the partition between them during
the night and devoured each other in their rage, so that in the
morning there was nothing to be found but the two tails.
There are also cases of the ludicrous where the conception
under which the perceptible facts are brought does not require to
be expressed or signified, but comes into consciousness itself
through the association of ideas. The laughter into which Garrick
burst in the middle of playing tragedy because a butcher in the
front of the pit, who had taken off his wig to wipe the sweat
from his head, placed the wig for a while upon his large dog,
who stood facing the stage with his fore paws resting on the pit
railings, was occasioned by the fact that Garrick started from the
conception of a spectator, which was added in his own mind. This
is the reason why certain animal forms, such as apes, kangaroos,
jumping-hares, &c., sometimes appear to us ludicrous because
something about them resembling man leads us to subsume them
under the conception of the human form, and starting from this
we perceive their incongruity with it.
Now the conceptions whose observed incongruity with the
perceptions moves us to laughter are either those of others or
our own. In the first case we laugh at others, in the second we
feel a surprise, often agreeable, at the least amusing. Therefore
[279]274
[280]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
children and uneducated people laugh at the most trifling things,
even at misfortunes, if they were unexpected, and thus convicted
their preconceived conception of error. As a rule laughing
is a pleasant condition; accordingly the apprehension of the
incongruity between what is thought and what is perceived, that
is, the real, gives us pleasure, and we give ourselves up gladly to
the spasmodic convulsions which this apprehension excites. The
reason of this is as follows. In every suddenly appearing conflict
between what is perceived and what is thought, what is perceived
is always unquestionably right; for it is not subject to error at
all, requires no confirmation from without, but answers for itself.
Its conflict with what is thought springs ultimately from the fact
that the latter, with its abstract conceptions, cannot get down
to the infinite multifariousness and fine shades of difference
of the concrete. This victory of knowledge of perception over
thought affords us pleasure. For perception is the original kind of
knowledge inseparable from animal nature, in which everything
that gives direct satisfaction to the will presents itself. It is the
medium of the present, of enjoyment and gaiety; moreover it
is attended with no exertion. With thinking the opposite is the
case; it is the second power of knowledge, the exercise of which
always demands some, and often considerable, exertion. Besides,
it is the conceptions of thought that often oppose the gratification
of our immediate desires, for, as the medium of the past, the
future, and of seriousness, they are the vehicle of our fears, our
repentance, and all our cares. It must therefore be diverting to us
to see this strict, untiring, troublesome governess, the reason, for
once convicted of insufficiency. On this account then the mien
or appearance of laughter is very closely related to that of joy.
On account of the want of reason, thus of general conceptions,
the brute is incapable of laughter, as of speech. This is therefore
a prerogative and characteristic mark of man. Yet it may be
remarked in passing that his one friend the dog has an analogous
characteristic action peculiar to him alone in distinction fromChapter VIII. On The Theory Of The Ludicrous.

all other brutes, the very expressive, kindly, and thoroughly
honest fawning and wagging of its tail. But how favourably
does this salutation given him by nature compare with the bows
and simpering civilities of men. At least for the present, it is
a thousand times more reliable than their assurance of inward
friendship and devotion.
The opposite of laughing and joking is seriousness.
Accordingly it consists in the consciousness of the perfect
agreement and congruity of the conception, or thought, with
what is perceived, or the reality. The serious man is convinced
that he thinks the things as they are, and that they are as he thinks
them. This is just why the transition from profound seriousness
to laughter is so easy, and can be effected by trifles. For the more
perfect that agreement assumed by seriousness may seem to be,
the more easily is it destroyed by the unexpected discovery of
even a slight incongruity. Therefore the more a man is capable
of entire seriousness, the more heartily can he laugh. Men
whose laughter is always affected and forced are intellectually
and morally of little worth; and in general the way of laughing,
and, on the other hand, the occasions of it, are very characteristic
of the person. That the relations of the sexes afford the easiest
materials for jokes always ready to hand and within the reach of
the weakest wit, as is proved by the abundance of obscene jests,
could not be if it were not that the deepest seriousness lies at
their foundation.
That the laughter of others at what we do or say seriously
offends us so keenly depends on the fact that it asserts that there
is a great incongruity between our conceptions and the objective
realities. For the same reason, the predicate “ludicrous” or
“absurd” is insulting. The laugh of scorn announces with triumph
to the baffled adversary how incongruous were the conceptions
he cherished with the reality which is now revealing itself to
him. Our own bitter laughter at the fearful disclosure of the truth
through which our firmly cherished expectations are proved to
[281]276
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
be delusive is the active expression of the discovery now made
of the incongruity between the thoughts which, in our foolish
confidence in man or fate, we entertained, and the truth which is
now unveiled.


The intentionally ludicrous is the joke. It is the effort to
bring about a discrepancy between the conceptions of another
and the reality by disarranging one of the two; while its opposite,
seriousness, consists in the exact conformity of the two to each
other, which is at least aimed at. But if now the joke is concealed
behind seriousness, then we have irony. For example, if with
apparent seriousness we acquiesce in the opinions of another
which are the opposite of our own, and pretend to share them
with him, till at last the result perplexes him both as to us and
them. This is the attitude of Socrates as opposed to Hippias,
Protagoras, Gorgias, and other sophists, and indeed often to
his collocutors in general. The converse of irony is accordingly
seriousness concealed behind a joke, and this is humour. It
might be called the double counterpoint of irony. Explanations
such as “Humour is the interpenetration of the finite and the
infinite” express nothing more than the entire incapacity for
thought of those who are satisfied with such empty phrases.
Irony is objective, that is, intended for another; but humour
is subjective, that is, it primarily exists only for one's own
self. Accordingly we find the masterpieces of irony among
the ancients, but those of humour among the moderns. For,
more closely considered, humour depends upon a subjective,
yet serious and sublime mood, which is involuntarily in conflict
with a common external world very different from itself, which
it cannot escape from and to which it will not give itself up;
therefore, as an accommodation, it tries to think its own point
of view and that external world through the same conceptions,
and thus a double incongruity arises, sometimes on the one side,
sometimes on the other, between these concepts and the realities
thought through them. Hence the impression of the intentionally ludicrous, thus of the joke, is produced, behind which, however,
the deepest seriousness is concealed and shines through. Irony
begins with a serious air and ends with a smile; with humour
the order is reversed. The words of Mercutio quoted above may
serve as an example of humour. Also in “Hamlet”—Polonius:
“My honourable lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
Hamlet: You cannot, sir, take from me anything that I will more
willingly part withal, except my life, except my life, except my
life.” Again, before the introduction of the play at court, Hamlet
says to Ophelia: “What should a man do but be merry? for, look
you, how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within
these two hours. Ophelia: Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
Hamlet: So long? Nay, then let the devil wear black, for I'll have
a suit of sables.”
Again, in Jean Paul's “Titan,” when Schoppe, melancholy and
now brooding over himself, frequently looking at his hands, says
to himself, “There sits a lord in bodily reality, and I in him; but
who is such?” Heinrich Heine appears as a true humourist in
his “Romancero.” Behind all his jokes and drollery we discern
a profound seriousness, which is ashamed to appear unveiled.
Accordingly humour depends upon a special kind of mood or
temper (German, Laune, probably from Luna) through which
conception in all its modifications, a decided predominance of
the subjective over the objective in the apprehension of the
external world, is thought. Moreover, every poetical or artistic
presentation of a comical, or indeed even a farcical scene,
through which a serious thought yet glimmers as its concealed
background, is a production of humour, thus is humorous.
Such, for example, is a coloured drawing of Tischbein's, which
represents an empty room, lighted only by the blazing fire in the
grate. Before the fire stands a man with his coat off, in such a
position that his shadow, going out from his feet, stretches across
the whole room. Tischbein comments thus on the drawing: “This
is a man who has succeeded in nothing in the world, and who
[283]278
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
has made nothing of it; now he rejoices that he can throw such
a large shadow.” Now, if I had to express the seriousness that
lies concealed behind this jest, I could best do so by means
of the following verse taken from the Persian poem of Anwari
Soheili:—
“If thou hast lost possession of a world,
Be not distressed, for it is nought;
Or hast thou gained possession of a world,
Be not o'erjoyed, for it is nought.
Our pains, our gains, all pass away;
Get thee beyond the world, for it is nought.”

Nowadays, the word 'humorous' is used in German literature in the sense of comical arises from the
miserable desire to give things a more distinguished name than
belongs to them, the name of a class that stands above them. Thus
every inn must be called a hotel, every money-changer a banker,
every concert a musical academy, the merchant's counting-house
a bureau, the potter an artist in clay, and therefore also every
clown a humourist. 

The word humour is borrowed from the
English to denote a quite peculiar species of the ludicrous, which
indeed, as was said above, is related to the sublime, and which
was first remarked by them. But it is not intended to be used
as the title for all kinds of jokes and buffoonery, as is now
universally the case in Germany, without opposition from men of
letters and scholars; for the true conception of that modification,
that tendency of the mind, that child of the sublime and the
ridiculous, would be too subtle and too high for their public, to
please which they take pains to make everything flat and vulgar.
Well, “high words and a low meaning” is in general the motto
of the noble present, and accordingly now-a-days he is called a
humourist who was formerly, called a buffoon.
