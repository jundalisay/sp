Logic In General.

Logic, Dialectic, and Rhetoric go together, because they make up
the whole of a technic of reason, and under this title they ought
also to be taught—Logic as the technic of our own thinking,
Dialectic of disputing with others, and Rhetoric of speaking to
many (concionatio); thus corresponding to the singular, dual, and
plural, and to the monologue, the dialogue, and the panegyric.
Under Dialectic I understand, in agreement with Aristotle
(Metaph., iii. 2, and Analyt. Post., i. 11), the art of
conversation directed to the mutual investigation of truth,
especially philosophical truth. But a conversation of this
kind necessarily passes more or less into controversy; therefore
dialectic may also be explained as the art of disputation. We
have examples and patterns of dialectic in the Platonic dialogues;
but for the special theory of it, thus for the technical rules of
disputation, eristics, very little has hitherto been accomplished. I
have worked out an attempt of the kind, and given an example of
it, in the second volume of the “Parerga,” therefore I shall pass
over the exposition of this science altogether here.
In Rhetoric the rhetorical figures are very much what the
syllogistic figures are in Logic; at all events they are worth
considering. In Aristotle's time they seem to have not yet become
the object of theoretical investigation, for he does not treat of
them in any of his rhetorics, and in this reference we are referred
to Rutilius Lupus, the epitomiser of a later Gorgias.
All the three sciences have this in common, that without having
learned them we follow their rules, which indeed are themselves
first abstracted from this natural employment of them. Therefore,
although they are of great theoretical interest, they are of little
practical use; partly because, though they certainly give the rule,
they do not give the case of its application; partly because in

volume.
[286]280

practice there is generally no time to recollect the rules. Thus
they teach only what every one already knows and practises of his
own accord; but yet the abstract knowledge of this is interesting
and important. Logic will not easily have a practical value, at
least for our own thinking. For the errors of our own reasoning
scarcely ever lie in the inferences nor otherwise in the form, but
in the judgments, thus in the matter of thought. In controversy,
on the other hand, we can sometimes derive some practical use
from logic, by taking the more or less intentionally deceptive
argument of our opponent, which he advances under the garb
and cover of continuous speech, and referring it to the strict form
of regular syllogisms, and thus convicting it of logical errors; for
example, simple conversion of universal affirmative judgments,
syllogisms with four terms, inferences from the consequent to the
reason, syllogisms in the second figure with merely affirmative
premisses, and many such.
[287]
It seems to me that the doctrine of the laws of thought
might be simplified if we were only to set up two, the law
of excluded middle and that of sufficient reason. The former
thus: “Every predicate can either be affirmed or denied of every
subject.” Here it is already contained in the “either, or” that both
cannot occur at once, and consequently just what is expressed
by the laws of identity and contradiction. Thus these would
be added as corollaries of that principle which really says that
every two concept-spheres must be thought either as united or as
separated, but never as both at once; and therefore, even although
words are brought together which express the latter, these words
assert a process of thought which cannot be carried out. The
consciousness of this infeasibility is the feeling of contradiction.
The second law of thought, the principle of sufficient reason,
would affirm that the above attributing or denying must be
determined by something different from the judgment itself,
which may be a (pure or empirical) perception, or merely another
judgment. This other and different thing is then called the groundChapter IX. On Logic In General.
281
or reason of the judgment. So far as a judgment satisfies the first
law of thought, it is thinkable; so far as it satisfies the second, it
is true, or at least in the case in which the ground of a judgment
is only another judgment it is logically or formally true. But,
finally, material or absolute truth is always the relation between
a judgment and a perception, thus between the abstract and the
concrete or perceptible idea. This is either an immediate relation
or it is brought about by means of other judgments, i.e., through
other abstract ideas. From this it is easy to see that one truth can
never overthrow another, but all must ultimately agree; because
in the concrete or perceptible, which is their common foundation,
no contradiction is possible. Therefore no truth has anything to
fear from other truths. Illusion and error have to fear every truth,
because through the logical connection of all truths even the most
distant must some time strike its blow at every error. This second
law of thought is therefore the connecting link between logic and
what is no longer logic, but the matter of thought. Consequently
the agreement of the conceptions, thus of the abstract idea with
what is given in the perceptible idea, is, on the side of the object
truth, and on the side of the subject knowledge.
To express the union or separation of two concept-spheres
referred to above is the work of the copula, “is—is not.” Through
this every verb can be expressed by means of its participle.
Therefore all judging consists in the use of a verb, and vice versâ.
Accordingly the significance of the copula is that the predicate is
to be thought in the subject, nothing more. Now, consider what
the content of the infinitive of the copula “to be” amounts to.
But this is a principal theme of the professors of philosophy of
the present time. However, we must not be too strict with them;
most of them wish to express by it nothing but material things,
the corporeal world, to which, as perfectly innocent realists at the
bottom of their hearts, they attribute the highest reality. To speak,
however, of the bodies so directly appears to them too vulgar;
and therefore they say “being,” which they think sounds better,
[288]282
[289]

and think in connection with it the tables and chairs standing
before them.
“For, because, why, therefore, thus, since, although, indeed,
yet, but, if, then, either, or,” and more like these, are properly
logical particles, for their only end is to express the form of the
thought processes. They are therefore a valuable possession of a
language, and do not belong to all in equal numbers. Thus “zwar”
(the contracted “es ist wahr”) seems to belong exclusively to the
German language. It is always connected with an “aber” which
follows or is added in thought, as “if” is connected with “then.”
The logical rule that, as regards quantity, singular judgments,
that is, judgments which have a singular conception (notio
singularis) for their subject, are to be treated as universal
judgments, depends upon the circumstance that they are in fact
universal judgments, which have merely the peculiarity that their
subject is a conception which can only be supported by a single
real object, and therefore only contains a single real object under
it; as when the conception is denoted by a proper name. This,
however, has really only to be considered when we proceed from
the abstract idea to the concrete or perceptible, thus seek to realise
the conceptions. In thinking itself, in operating with judgments,
this makes no difference, simply because between singular and
universal conceptions there is no logical difference. “Immanuel
Kant” signifies logically, “all Immanuel Kant.” Accordingly the
quantity of judgments is really only of two kinds—universal
and particular. An individual idea cannot be the subject of a
judgment, because it is not an abstraction, it is not something
thought, but something perceived. Every conception, on the other
hand, is essentially universal, and every judgment must have a
conception as its subject.
The difference between particular judgments (propositiones
particulares) and universal judgments often depends merely on
the external and contingent circumstance that the language has
no word to express by itself the part that is here to be separatedChapter IX. On Logic In General.
283
from the general conception which forms the subject of such a
judgment. If there were such a word many a particular judgment
would be universal. For example, the particular judgment, “Some
trees bear gall-nuts,” becomes a universal judgment, because for
this part of the conception, “tree,” we have a special word,
“All oaks bear gall-nuts.” In the same way is the judgment,
“Some men are black,” related to the judgment, “All negroes
are black.” Or else this difference depends upon the fact that
in the mind of him who judges the conception which he makes
the subject of the particular judgment has not become clearly
separated from the general conception as a part of which he
defines it; otherwise he could have expressed a universal instead
of a particular judgment. For example, instead of the judgment,
“Some ruminants have upper incisors,” this, “All unhorned
ruminants have upper incisors.”
The hypothetical and disjunctive judgments are assertions as
to the relation of two (in the case of the disjunctive judgment even
several) categorical judgments to each other. The hypothetical
judgment asserts that the truth of the second of the two categorical
judgments here linked together depends upon the truth of the
first, and the falseness of the first depends upon the falseness
of the second; thus that these two propositions stand in direct
community as regards truth and falseness. The disjunctive
judgment, on the other hand, asserts that upon the truth of
one of the categorical judgments here linked together depends
the falseness of the others, and conversely; thus that these
propositions are in conflict as regards truth and falseness. The
question is a judgment, one of whose three parts is left open: thus
either the copula, “Is Caius a Roman—or not?” or the predicate,
“Is Caius a Roman—or something else?” or the subject, “Is Caius
a Roman—or is it some one else who is a Roman?” The place of
the conception which is left open may also remain quite empty;
for example, “What is Caius?”—“Who is a Roman?”
The μÀ±3É3·, inductio, is with Aristotle the opposite of the
[290]284
[291]
[292]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
±À±3É3·. The latter proves a proposition to be false by showing
that what would follow from it is not true; thus by the instantia
in contrarium. The μÀ±3É3·, on the other hand, proves the
truth of a proposition by showing that what would follow from
it is true. Thus it leads by means of examples to our accepting
something while the ±À±3É3· leads to our rejecting it. Therefore
the μÀ±3É3·, or induction, is an inference from the consequents
to the reason, and indeed modo ponente; for from many cases
it establishes the rule, from which these cases then in their turn
follow. On this account it is never perfectly certain, but at the
most arrives at very great probability. However, this formal
uncertainty may yet leave room for material certainty through
the number of the sequences observed; in the same way as in
mathematics the irrational relations are brought infinitely near
to rationality by means of decimal fractions. The ±À±3É3·, on
the contrary, is primarily an inference from the reason to the
consequents, though it is afterwards carried out modo tollente,
in that it proves the non-existence of a necessary consequent,
and thereby destroys the truth of the assumed reason. On this
account it is always perfectly certain, and accomplishes more
by a single example in contrarium than the induction does by
innumerable examples in favour of the proposition propounded.
So much easier is it to refute than to prove, to overthrow than to
establish.
