Eloquence is the faculty of awakening in others our view of a
thing, or our opinion about it, of kindling in them our feeling
concerning it, and thus putting them in sympathy with us. And
all this by conducting the stream of our thought into their minds,
through the medium of words, with such force as to carry their
thought from the direction it has already taken, and sweep it
along with ours in its course. The more their previous course of
thought differs from ours, the greater is this achievement. From
this it is easily understood how personal conviction and passion
make a man eloquent; and in general, eloquence is more the gift
of nature than the work of art; yet here, also, art will support
nature.

In order to convince another of a truth which conflicts with
an error he firmly holds, the first rule to be observed, is an easy
and natural one: let the premisses come first, and the conclusion
follow. Yet this rule is seldom observed, but reversed; for
zeal, eagerness, and dogmatic positiveness urge us to proclaim
the conclusion loudly and noisily against him who adheres to
the opposed error. This easily makes him shy, and now he
opposes his will to all reasons and premisses, knowing already
to what conclusion they lead. Therefore we ought rather to
keep the conclusion completely concealed, and only advance
the premisses distinctly, fully, and in different lights. Indeed,
if possible, we ought not to express the conclusion at all. It
will come necessarily and regularly of its own accord into the
reason of the hearers, and the conviction thus born in themselves
will be all the more genuine, and will also be accompanied by
self-esteem instead of shame. In difficult cases we may even
assume the air of desiring to arrive at a quite opposite conclusion
from that which we really have in view. An example of this is
the famous speech of Antony in Shakspeare's “Julius Cæsar.”

This chapter is connected with the conclusion of § 9 of the first volume.

In defending a thing many persons err by confidently
advancing everything imaginable that can be said for it, mixing
up together what is true, half true, and merely plausible. But the
false is soon recognised, or at any rate felt, and throws suspicion
also upon the cogent and true arguments which were brought
forward along with it. Give then the true and weighty pure and
alone, and beware of defending a truth with inadequate, and
therefore, since they are set up as adequate, sophistical reasons;
for the opponent upsets these, and thereby gains the appearance
of having upset the truth itself which was supported by them, that
is, he makes argumenta ad hominem hold good as argumenta ad
rem. The Chinese go, perhaps, too far the other way, for they
have the saying: “He who is eloquent and has a sharp tongue may
always leave half of a sentence unspoken; and he who has right
on his side may confidently yield three-tenths of his assertion.”
