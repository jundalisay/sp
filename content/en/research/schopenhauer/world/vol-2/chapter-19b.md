2. What is common to all consciousness?

What distinguishes one consciousness from another?

This will lead to the secondary element.

Consciousness is positively only known to us as a property of
animal nature.

Therefore we must not, and indeed cannot, think of
it otherwise than as animal consciousness, so that this expression
is tautological. 

Now, that which in every animal consciousness,
even the most imperfect and the weakest, is always present,
nay, lies at its foundation, is an immediate sense of longing,
and of the alternate satisfaction and non-satisfaction of it, in
very different degrees. 

This we know to a certain extent a
priori. For marvellously different as the innumerable species of
animals are, and strange as some new form, never seen before,
appears to us, we yet assume beforehand its inmost nature, with
perfect certainty, as well known, and indeed fully confided to
us.

The animal wills, indeed also what it wills,
existence, well-being, life, and propagation; and since in this
we presuppose with perfect certainty identity with us, we do
not hesitate to attribute to it unchanged all the affections of will
which we know in ourselves, and speak at once of its desire,
aversion, fear, anger, hatred, love, joy, sorrow, longing, &c. On
the other hand, whenever phenomena of mere knowledge come to
be spoken of we fall at once into uncertainty. We do not venture403
to say that the animal conceives, thinks, judges, knows: we only
attribute to it with certainty ideas in general; because without
them its will could not have those emotions referred to above. But
with regard to the definite manner of knowing of the brutes and
the precise limits of it in a given species, we have only indefinite
conceptions, and make conjectures. Hence our understanding
with them is also often difficult, and is only brought about by
skill, in consequence of experience and practice. Here then lie
distinctions of consciousness. On the other hand, a longing,
desiring, wishing, or a detesting, shunning, and not wishing, is
proper to every consciousness: man has it in common with the
polyp. 

This is accordingly the essential element in and the basis
of every consciousness. The difference of the manifestations of
this in the different species of animal beings depends upon the
various extension of their sphere of knowledge, in which the
motives of those manifestations lie. We understand directly from
our own nature all actions and behaviour of the brutes which
express movements of the will; therefore, so far, we sympathise
with them in various ways. On the other hand, the gulf between
us and them results simply and solely from the difference of
intellect. 

The gulf which lies between a very sagacious brute
and a man of very limited capacity is perhaps not much greater
than that which exists between a blockhead and a man of genius;
therefore here also the resemblance between them in another
aspect, which springs from the likeness of their inclinations and
emotions, and assimilates them again to each other, sometimes
appears with surprising prominence, and excites astonishment.
This consideration makes it clear that in all animal natures
the will is what is primary and substantial, the intellect again
is secondary, adventitious, indeed a mere tool for the service
of the former, and is more or less complete and complicated,
according to the demands of this service. As a species of
animals is furnished with hoofs, claws, hands, wings, horns, or
teeth according to the aims of its will, so also is it furnished with a more or less developed brain, whose function is the
intelligence necessary for its endurance. 

The more complicated the organisation becomes, in the ascending series of animals,
the more numerous also are its wants, and the more varied and
specially determined the objects which are capable of satisfying
them; hence the more complicated and distant the paths by which
these are to be obtained, which must now be all known and found:
therefore in the same proportion the ideas of the animal must
be more versatile, accurate, definite, and connected, and also its
attention must be more highly strung, more sustained, and more
easily roused, consequently its intellect must be more developed
and perfect. Accordingly we see the organ of intelligence, the
cerebral system, together with all the organs of sense, keep pace
with the increasing wants and the complication of the organism;
and the increase of the part of consciousness that has to do
with ideas (as opposed to the willing part) exhibits itself in a
bodily form in the ever-increasing proportion of the brain in
general to the rest of the nervous system, and of the cerebrum
to the cerebellum; for (according to Flourens) the former is the
workshop of ideas, while the latter is the disposer and orderer
of movements. The last step which nature has taken in this
respect is, however, disproportionately great. 

For in man not
only does the faculty of ideas of perception, which alone existed
hitherto, reach the highest degree of perfection, but the abstract
idea, thought, i.e., reason, and with it reflection, is added.
Through this important advance of the intellect, thus of the
secondary part of consciousness, it now gains a preponderance
over the primary part, in so far as it becomes henceforward the
predominantly active part. While in the brute the immediate sense
of its satisfied or unsatisfied desire constitutes by far the most
important part of its consciousness, and the more so indeed the
lower the grade of the animal, so that the lowest animals are only
distinguished from plants by the addition of a dull idea, in man
the opposite is the case. Vehement as are his desires, even more405
vehement than those of any brute, rising to the level of passions,
yet his consciousness remains continuously and predominantly
occupied and filled with ideas and thoughts. Without doubt this
has been the principal occasion of that fundamental error of all
philosophers on account of which they make thought that which
is essential and primary in the so-called soul, i.e., in the inner or
spiritual life of man, always placing it first, but will, as a mere
product of thought, they regard as only a subordinate addition
and consequence of it. But if willing merely proceeded from
knowing, how could the brutes, even the lower grades of them,
with so very little knowledge, often show such an unconquerable
and vehement will? Accordingly, since that fundamental error of
the philosophers makes, as it were, the accident the substance,
it leads them into mistaken paths, which there is afterwards no
way of getting out of. Now this relative predominance of the
knowing consciousness over the desiring, consequently of the
secondary part over the primary, which appears in man, may, in
particular exceptionally favoured individuals, go so far that at the
moments of its highest ascendancy, the secondary or knowing
part of consciousness detaches itself altogether from the willing
part, and passes into free activity for itself, i.e., untouched by
the will, and consequently no longer serving it. Thus it becomes
purely objective, and the clear mirror of the world, and from it
the conceptions of genius then arise, which are the subject of our
third book.
