This chapter is connected with § 14 of the first volume.Chapter XII. On The Doctrine Of Science.

For a correct use of the intellect, the following are needed:

1. The correct apprehension through perception of the real things taken into
consideration, and of all their essential properties and relations,
thus of all data.

2. The construction of correct conceptions out
of these; thus the connotation of those properties under correct
abstractions, which now become the material of the subsequent
thinking.

3. The comparison of those conceptions both with
the perceived object and among themselves, and with the rest of
our store of conceptions, so that correct judgments, pertinent to
the matter in hand, and fully comprehending and exhausting it,
may proceed from them; thus the right estimation of the matter.

4. The placing together or combination of those judgments as
the premisses of syllogisms. 

This may be done very differently
according to the choice and arrangement of the judgments, and
yet the actual result of the whole operation primarily depends
upon it. What is really of importance here is that from among so
many possible combinations of those different judgments which
have to do with the matter free deliberation should hit upon the
very ones which serve the purpose and are decisive. But if in
the first function, that is, in the apprehension through perception
of the things and relations, any single essential point has been
overlooked, the correctness of all the succeeding operations of
the mind cannot prevent the result from being false; for there lie
the data, the material of the whole investigation. Without the
certainty that these are correctly and completely collected, one
ought to abstain, in important matters, from any definite decision.

A conception is correct; a judgment is true; a body is
real; and a relation is evident. A proposition of immediate certainty is an axiom. Only the fundamental principles of logic,
and those of mathematics drawn a priori from intuition or
perception, and finally also the law of causality, have immediate
certainty. A proposition of indirect certainty is a maxim, and
that by means of which it obtains its certainty is the proof. If
immediate certainty is attributed to a proposition which has no
such certainty, this is a petitio principii. A proposition which
appeals directly to the empirical perception is an assertion: to
confront it with such perception demands judgment. Empirical
perception can primarily afford us only particular, not universal
truths. Through manifold repetition and confirmation such truths
indeed obtain a certain universality also, but it is only comparative
and precarious, because it is still always open to attack. But if a
proposition has absolute universality, the perception to which it
appeals is not empirical but a priori. Thus Logic and Mathematics
alone are absolutely certain sciences; but they really teach us
only what we already knew beforehand. For they are merely
explanations of that of which we are conscious a priori, the forms
of our own knowledge, the one being concerned with the forms
of thinking, the other with those of perceiving. Therefore we spin
them entirely out of ourselves. All other scientific knowledge is
empirical.

A proof proves too much if it extends to things or cases of
which that which is to be proved clearly does not hold good;
therefore it is refuted apagogically by these. The deductio ad
absurdum properly consists in this, that we take a false assertion
which has been made as the major proposition of a syllogism,
then add to it a correct minor, and arrive at a conclusion
which clearly contradicts facts of experience or unquestionable
truths. But by some round-about way such a refutation must
be possible of every false doctrine. For the defender of this
will yet certainly recognise and admit some truth or other, and
then the consequences of this, and on the other hand those of
the false assertion, must be followed out until we arrive at 2 propositions which directly contradict each other. We find many
examples in Plato of this beautiful artifice of genuine dialectic.

A correct hypothesis is nothing more than the true and
complete expression of the present fact, which the originator
of the hypothesis has intuitively apprehended in its real nature
and inner connection. For it tells us only what really takes place
here.

The opposition of the analytical and synthetical methods we
find already indicated by Aristotle, yet perhaps first distinctly
described by Proclus, who says quite correctly: “œμ ̧¿ ́¿1  ́μ
À±Á± ́1 ́¿1⁄2Ä±1; o±»»1ÃÄ· 1⁄4μ1⁄2 !  ́1± Ä·Â ±1⁄2±»ÅÃμÉÂ μÀ1⁄2 ±ÁÇ·1⁄2

sequentes: pulcherrima quidem ea, quæ per analysin quæsitum
refert ad principium, de quo jam convenit; quam etiam Plato
Laodamanti tradidisse dicitur.) “In Primum Euclidis Librum,”
L. iii. Certainly the analytical method consists in referring what
is given to an admitted principle; the synthetical method, on the
contrary, in deduction from such a principle. They are therefore
analogous to the μÀ±3É3· and ±À±3É3· explained in chapter ix.;
only the latter are not used to establish propositions, but always
to overthrow them. The analytical method proceeds from the
facts; the particular, to the principle or rule; the universal, or from
the consequents to the reasons; the other conversely. Therefore
it would be much more correct to call them the inductive and the
deductive methods, for the customary names are unsuitable and
do not fully express the things.

If a philosopher tries to begin by thinking out the methods
in accordance with which he will philosophise, he is like a poet
who first writes a system of æsthetics in order to poetise in
accordance with it. Both of them may be compared to a man
who first sings himself a tune and afterwards dances to it. The
thinking mind must find its way from original tendency. 

Rule
and application, method and achievement, must, like matter and form, be inseparable. But after we have reached the goal we may
consider the path we have followed. Æsthetics and methodology
are, from their nature, younger than poetry and philosophy; as
grammar is younger than language, thorough bass younger than
music, and logic younger than thought.
This is a fitting place to make, in passing, a remark by
means of which I should like to check a growing evil while
there is yet time. That Latin has ceased to be the language
of all scientific investigations has the disadvantage that there is
no longer an immediately common scientific literature for the
whole of Europe, but national literatures. And thus every
scholar is primarily limited to a much smaller public, and
moreover to a public hampered with national points of view
and prejudices. Then he must now learn the four principal
European languages, as well as the two ancient languages. In
this it will be a great assistance to him that the termini technici
of all sciences (with the exception of mineralogy) are, as an
inheritance from our predecessors, Latin or Greek. Therefore all
nations wisely retain these. Only the Germans have hit upon the
unfortunate idea of wishing to Germanise the termini technici
of all the sciences. This has two great disadvantages. First,
the foreign and also the German scholar is obliged to learn all
the technical terms of his science twice, which, when there are
many—for example, in Anatomy—is an incredibly tiresome and
lengthy business. 

If the other nations were not in this respect
wiser than the Germans, we would have the trouble of learning
every terminus technicus five times. If the Germans carry this
further, foreign men of learning will leave their books altogether
unread; for besides this fault they are for the most part too
diffuse, and are written in a careless, bad, and often affected and
objectionable style, and besides are generally conceived with a
rude disregard of the reader and his requirements. 

Secondly, those
Germanised forms of the termini technici are almost throughout
long, patched-up, stupidly chosen, awkward, jarring words, not clearly separated from the rest of the language, which therefore
impress themselves with difficulty upon the memory, while
the Greek and Latin expressions chosen by the ancient and
memorable founders of the sciences possess the whole of the
opposite good qualities, and easily impress themselves on the
memory by their sonorous sound. What an ugly, harsh-sounding
word, for instance, is “Stickstoff ” instead of azot! “Verbum,”
“substantiv,” “adjectiv,” are remembered and distinguished
more easily than “Zeitwort,” “Nennwort,” “Beiwort,” or even
“Umstandswort” instead of “adverbium.” In Anatomy it is quite
unsupportable, and moreover vulgar and low. Even “Pulsader”
and “Blutader” are more exposed to momentary confusion
than “Arterie” and “Vene;” but utterly bewildering are such
expressions as “Fruchthälter,” “Fruchtgang,” and “Fruchtleiter”
instead of “uterus,” “vagina,” and “tuba Faloppii,” which yet
every doctor must know, and which he will find sufficient
in all European languages. In the same way “Speiche” and
“Ellenbogenröhre” instead of “radius” and “ulna,” which all
Europe has understood for thousands of years. Wherefore then
this clumsy, confusing, drawling, and awkward Germanising?
Not less objectionable is the translation of the technical terms
in Logic, in which our gifted professors of philosophy are the
creators of a new terminology, and almost every one of them
has his own. With G. E. Schulze, for example, the subject
is called “Grundbegriff,” the predicate “Beilegungsbegriff ;”
then there are “Beilegungsschlüsse,” “Voraussetzungsschlüsse,”
and “Entgegensetzungsschlüsse;” the judgments have “Grösse,”
“Beschaffenheit,” “Verhältniss,” and “Zuverlässigkeit,” i.e.,
quantity, quality, relation, and modality. The same perverse
influence of this Germanising mania is to be found in all the
sciences. The Latin and Greek expressions have the further
advantage that they stamp the scientific conception as such,
and distinguish it from the words of common intercourse, and
the ideas which cling to them through association; while, for example, “Speisebrei” instead of chyme seems to refer to the
food of little children, and “Lungensack” instead of pleura, and
“Herzbeutel” instead of pericardium seem to have been invented
by butchers rather than anatomists. Besides this, the most
immediate necessity of learning the ancient languages depends
upon the old termini technici, and they are more and more in
danger of being neglected through the use of living languages
in learned investigations. But if it comes to this, if the spirit of
the ancients bound up with their languages disappears from a
liberal education, then coarseness, insipidity, and vulgarity will
take possession of the whole of literature. For the works of the
ancients are the pole-star of every artistic or literary effort; if it
sets they are lost. Even now we can observe from the miserable
and puerile style of most writers that they have never written
Latin.24 The study of the classical authors is very properly called
the study of Humanity, for through it the student first becomes
a man again, for he enters into the world which was still free
from all the absurdities of the Middle Ages and of romanticism,
which afterwards penetrated so deeply into mankind in Europe
that even now every one comes into the world covered with it,
and has first to strip it off simply to become a man again. Think
not that your modern wisdom can ever supply the place of that
initiation into manhood; ye are not, like the Greeks and Romans,
born freemen, unfettered sons of nature. Ye are first the sons
and heirs of the barbarous Middle Ages and of their madness,
of infamous priestcraft, and of half-brutal, half-childish chivalry.
Though both now gradually approach their end, yet ye cannot yet
stand on your own feet. Without the school of the ancients your

<!-- A principal use of the study of the ancients is that it preserves us from
verbosity; for the ancients always take pains to write concisely and pregnantly,
and the error of almost all moderns is verbosity, which the most recent try to
make up for by suppressing syllables and letters. Therefore we ought to pursue
the study of the ancients all our life, although reducing the time devoted to it.
The ancients knew that we ought not to write as we speak. The moderns, on
the other hand, are not even ashamed to print lectures they have delivered. -->

literature will degenerate into vulgar gossip and dull philistinism.
Thus for all these reasons it is my well-intended counsel that an
end be put at once to the Germanising mania condemned above.

I denounce the disorder introduced into German orthography. 

Scribblers of every
species have heard something of conciseness of expression,
but do not know that this consists in the careful omission of
everything superfluous (to which, it is true, the whole of their
writings belong), but imagine they can arrive at it by clipping the
words as swindlers clip coin; and every syllable which appears to
them superfluous, because they do not feel its value, they cut off
without more ado. For example, our ancestors, with true tact, said
“Beweis” and “Verweis;” but, on the other hand, “Nachweisung.”
The fine distinction analogous to that between “Versuch” and
“Versuchung,” “Betracht” and “Betrachtung,” is not perceptible
to dull ears and thick skulls; therefore they have invented the
word “Nachweis,” which has come at once into general use, for
this only requires that an idea should be thoroughly awkward
and a blunder very gross. Accordingly a similar amputation
has already been proposed in innumerable words; for example,
instead of “Untersuchung” is written “Untersuch;” nay, even
instead of “allmälig,” “mälig;” instead of “beinahe,” “nahe;”
instead of “beständig,” “ständig.” If a Frenchman took upon
himself to write “près” instead of “presque,” or if an Englishman
wrote “most” instead of “almost,” they would be laughed at by
every one as fools; but in Germany whoever does this sort of thing
passes for a man of originality. Chemists already write “löslich”
and “unlöslich” instead of “unauflöslich,” and if the grammarians
do not rap them over the knuckles they will rob the language of
a valuable word. Knots, shoe-strings, and also conglomerates
of which the cement is softened, and all analogous things are
“löslich” (can be loosed); but what is “auflöslich” (soluble), on
the other hand, is whatever vanishes in a liquid, like salt inChapter XII. On The Doctrine Of Science.

water. “Auflösen” (to dissolve) is the terminus ad hoc, which
says this and nothing else, marking out a definite conception;
but our acute improvers of the language wish to empty it into
the general rinsing-pan “lösen” (to loosen); they would therefore
in consistency be obliged to make “lösen” also take the place
everywhere of “ablösen” (to relieve, used of guards), “auslösen”
(to release), “einlösen” (to redeem), &c., and in these, as in the
former case, deprive the language of definiteness of expression.
But to make the language poorer by a word means to make
the thought of the nation poorer by a conception. Yet this is
the tendency of the united efforts of almost all our writers of
books for the last ten or twenty years. For what I have shown
here by one example can be supported by a hundred others, and
the meanest stinting of syllables prevails like a disease. The
miserable wretches actually count the letters, and do not hesitate
to mutilate a word, or to use one in a false sense, whenever by
doing so they can gain two letters. He who is capable of no
new thoughts will at least bring new words to market, and every
ink-slinger regards it as his vocation to improve the language.
Journalists practise this most shamelessly; and since their papers,
on account of the trivial nature of their contents, have the largest
public, indeed a public which for the most part reads nothing
else, a great danger threatens the language through them. I
therefore seriously advise that they should be subjected to an
orthographical censorship, or that they should be made to pay a
fine for every unusual or mutilated word; for what could be more
improper than that changes of language should proceed from the
lowest branch of literature? Language, especially a relatively
speaking original language like German, is the most valuable
inheritance of a nation, and it is also an exceedingly complicated
work of art, easily injured, and which cannot again be restored,
therefore a noli me tangere. Other nations have felt this, and
have shown great piety towards their languages, although far less
complete than German. Therefore the language of Dante and
[315]308
[316]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Petrarch differs only in trifles from that of to-day; Montaigne
is still quite readable, and so also is Shakspeare in his oldest
editions. For a German indeed it is good to have somewhat long
words in his mouth; for he thinks slowly, and they give him time
to reflect. But this prevailing economy of language shows itself in
yet more characteristic phenomena. For example, in opposition to
all logic and grammar, they use the imperfect for the perfect and
pluperfect; they often stick the auxiliary verb in their pocket; they
use the ablative instead of the genitive; for the sake of omitting
a couple of logical particles they make such intricate sentences
that one has to read them four times over in order to get at the
sense; for it is only the paper and not the reader's time that they
care to spare. In proper names, after the manner of Hottentots,
they do not indicate the case either by inflection or article: the
reader may guess it. But they are specially fond of contracting
the double vowel and dropping the lengthening h, those letters
sacred to prosody; which is just the same thing as if we wanted
to banish · and É from Greek, and make μ and ¿ take their place.
Whoever writes Scham, Märchen, Mass, Spass, ought also to
write Lon, Son, Stat, Sat, Jar, Al, &c. But since writing is the
copy of speech, posterity will imagine that one ought to speak
as one writes; and then of the German language there will only
remain a narrow, mouth-distorting, jarring noise of consonants,
and all prosody will be lost. The spelling “Literatur” instead of
the correct “Litteratur” is also very much liked, because it saves
a letter. In defence of this the participle of the verb linere is given
as the root of the word. But linere means to smear; therefore
the favoured spelling might actually be correct for the greater
part of German bookmaking; so that one could distinguish a very
small “Litteratur” from a very extensive “Literatur.” In order to
write concisely let a man improve his style and shun all useless
gossip and chatter, and then he will not need to cut out syllables
and letters on account of the dearness of paper. 

But to write
so many useless pages, useless sheets, useless books, and then to want to make up this waste of time and paper at the cost of
the innocent syllables and letters—that is truly the superlative of
what is called in English being penny wise and pound foolish. It
is to be regretted that there is no German Academy to take charge
of the language against literary sans-culottism, especially in an
age when even those who are ignorant of the ancient language
venture to employ the press. I have expressed my mind more
fully on the whole subject of the inexcusable mischief being done
at the present day to the German language in my “Parerga,” vol.
ii. chap. 23.

In my essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 51, I already
proposed a first classification of the sciences in accordance with
the form of the principle of sufficient reason which reigns in
them; and I also touched upon it again in §§ 7 and 15 of the first
volume of this work. I will give here a small attempt at such a
classification, which will yet no doubt be susceptible of much
improvement and perfecting:—

I. Pure a priori Sciences.
1. The doctrine of the ground of being.
(a.) In space: Geometry.
(b.) In time: Arithmetic and Algebra.
2. The doctrine of the ground of knowing: Logic.
II. Empirical or a posteriori Sciences. All based upon the
ground of becoming, i.e., the law of causality, and upon the
three modes of that law.
1. The doctrine of causes.
(a.) Universal: Mechanics, Hydrodynamics, Physics,
Chemistry.
(b.) Particular: Astronomy, Mineralogy, Geology,
Technology, Pharmacy.
2. The doctrine of stimuli.
(a.) Universal: Physiology of plants and animals, together
with the ancillary science, Anatomy.
[317]310
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
(b.) Particular: Botany, Zoology, Zootomy, Comparative
Physiology, Pathology, Therapeutics.
3. The doctrine of motives.
(a.) Universal: Ethics, Psychology.
(b.) Particular: Jurisprudence, History.

Philosophy or Metaphysics, as the doctrine of consciousness
and its contents in general, or of the whole of experience as
such, does not appear in the list, because it does not at once
pursue the investigation which the principle of sufficient reason
prescribes, but first has this principle itself as its object. It is to
be regarded as the thorough bass of all sciences, but belongs to a
higher class than they do, and is almost as much related to art as
to science. As in music every particular period must correspond
to the tonality to which thorough bass has advanced, so every
author, in proportion to the line he follows, must bear the stamp
of the philosophy which prevails in his time. But besides this,
every science has also its special philosophy; and therefore we
speak of the philosophy of botany, of zoology, of history, &c.
By this we must reasonably understand nothing more than the
chief results of each science itself, regarded and comprehended
from the highest, that is the most general, point of view which
is possible within that science. These general results connect
themselves directly with general philosophy, for they supply it
with important data, and relieve it from the labour of seeking these
itself in the philosophically raw material of the special sciences.
These special philosophies therefore stand as a mediating link
between their special sciences and philosophy proper. For since
the latter has to give the most general explanations concerning
the whole of things, these must also be capable of being brought
down and applied to the individual of every species of thing.
The philosophy of each science, however, arises independently
of philosophy in general, from the data of its own science
itself. Therefore it does not need to wait till that philosophy at last be found; but if worked out in advance it will certainly
agree with the true universal philosophy. 

This, on the other
hand, must be capable of receiving confirmation and illustration
from the philosophies of the particular sciences; for the most
general truth must be capable of being proved through the more
special truths. Goethe has afforded a beautiful example of the
philosophy of zoology in his reflections on Dalton's and Pander's
skeletons of rodents (Hefte zur Morphologie, 1824). And like
merit in connection with the same science belongs to Kielmayer,
Delamark, Geoffroy St. Hilaire, Cuvier, and many others, in that
they have all brought out clearly the complete analogy, the inner
relationship, the permanent type, and systematic connection of
animal forms. Empirical sciences pursued purely for their own
sake and without philosophical tendency are like a face without
eyes. They are, however, a suitable occupation for men of good
capacity who yet lack the highest faculties, which would even
be a hindrance to minute investigations of such a kind. Such
men concentrate their whole power and their whole knowledge
upon one limited field, in which, therefore, on condition of
remaining in entire ignorance of everything else, they can attain
to the most complete knowledge possible; while the philosopher
must survey all fields of knowledge, and indeed to a certain
extent be at home in them; and thus that complete knowledge
which can only be attained by the study of detail is necessarily
denied him. Therefore the former may be compared to those
Geneva workmen of whom one makes only wheels, another only
springs, and a third only chains. The philosopher, on the other
hand, is like the watchmaker, who alone produces a whole out
of all these which has motion and significance. They may also
be compared to the musicians of an orchestra, each of whom
is master of his own instrument; and the philosopher, on the
other hand, to the conductor, who must know the nature and
use of every instrument, yet without being able to play them
all, or even one of them, with great perfection. Scotus Erigena

includes all sciences under the name Scientia, in opposition to
philosophy, which he calls Sapientia. The same distinction was
already made by the Pythagoreans; as may be seen from Stobæus
(Floril., vol. i. p. 20), where it is very clearly and neatly
explained. But a much happier and more piquant comparison of
the relation of the two kinds of mental effort to each other has
been so often repeated by the ancients that we no longer know
to whom it belongs. Diogenes Laertius (ii. 79) attributes it to
Aristippus, Stobæus (Floril., tit. iv. 110) to Aristo of Chios;
the Scholiast of Aristotle ascribes it to him (p. 8 of the Berlin
edition), but Plutarch (De Puer. Educ., c. 10) attributes it to
Bio—“Qui ajebat, sicut Penelopes proci, quum non possent cum
Penelope concumbere, rem cum ejus ancillis habuissent; ita qui
philosophiam nequeunt apprehendere eos in alliis nullius pretii
disciplinis sese conterere.” In our predominantly empirical and
historical age it can do no harm to recall this.
