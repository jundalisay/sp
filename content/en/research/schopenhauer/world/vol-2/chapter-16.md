Chapter XVI.26 On The Practical Use Of Reason
And On Stoicism.

In the seventh chapter I have shown that, in the theoretical
sphere, procedure based upon conceptions suffices for mediocre
achievements only, while great achievements, on the other hand,
demand that we should draw from perception itself as the primary
source of all knowledge. In the practical sphere, however, the
converse is the case. Here determination by what is perceived
is the way of the brutes, but is unworthy of man, who has
conceptions to guide his conduct, and is thus emancipated from
the power of what is actually perceptibly present, to which the
brute is unconditionally given over. In proportion as a man
makes good this prerogative his conduct may be called rational,
and only in this sense can we speak of practical reason, not in
the Kantian sense, the inadmissibility of which I have thoroughly
exposed in my prize essay on the foundation of morals.
It is not easy, however, to let oneself be determined by
conceptions alone; for the directly present external world, with
its perceptible reality, intrudes itself forcibly even on the strongest
mind. But it is just in conquering this impression, in destroying
its illusion, that the human spirit shows its worth and greatness.
Thus if incitements to lust and pleasure leave it unaffected, if
the threats and fury of enraged enemies do not shake it, if the
entreaties of erring friends do not make its purpose waver, and
the delusive forms with which preconcerted plots surround it
leave it unmoved, if the scorn of fools and of the vulgar herd
does not disturb it nor trouble it as to its own worth, then it
seems to stand under the influence of a spirit-world, visible to it
alone (and this is the world of conceptions), before which that
perceptibly present world which lies open to all dissolves like
a phantom. But, on the other hand, what gives to the external
26

world and visible reality their great power over the mind is their
nearness and directness. As the magnetic needle, which is kept in
its position by the combined action of widely distributed forces of
nature embracing the whole earth, can yet be perturbed and set in
violent oscillation by a small piece of iron, if only it comes quite
close to it, so even a great mind can sometimes be disconcerted
and perturbed by trifling events and insignificant men, if only
they affect it very closely, and the deliberate purpose can be for
the moment shaken by a trivial but immediately present counter
motive. For the influence of the motives is subject to a law
which is directly opposed to the law according to which weights
act on a balance, and in consequence of it a very small motive,
which, however, lies very near to us, can outweigh one which
in itself is much stronger, but which only affects us from a
distance. But it is this quality of the mind, by reason of which
it allows itself to be determined in accordance with this law,
and does not withdraw itself from it by the strength of actual
practical reason, which the ancients denoted by animi impotentia,
which really signifies ratio regendæ voluntatis impotens. Every
emotion (animi perturbatio) simply arises from the fact that an
idea which affects our will comes so excessively near to us that
it conceals everything else from us, and we can no longer see
anything but it, so that for the moment we become incapable of
taking account of things of another kind. It would be a valuable
safeguard against this if we were to bring ourselves to regard
the present, by the assistance of imagination, as if it were past,
and should thus accustom our apperception to the epistolary
style of the Romans. Yet conversely we are very well able to
regard what is long past as so vividly present that old emotions
which have long been asleep are thereby reawakened in their full
strength. Thus also no one would be irritated or disconcerted
by a misfortune, a disappointment, if reason always kept present
to him what man really is: the most needy of creatures, daily
and hourly abandoned to innumerable misfortunes, great and
[347]338
[348]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
small, Ä¿  ́μ1»¿Ä±Ä¿1⁄2 ¶É¿1⁄2, who has therefore to live in constant
care and fear. Herodotus already says, “ ±1⁄2 μÃÄ1 ±1⁄2 ̧ÁÉÀ¿Â
ÃÅ1⁄4Æ¿Á±” (homo totus est calamitas).
The application of reason to practice primarily accomplishes
this. It reconstructs what is one-sided and defective in knowledge
of mere perception, and makes use of the contrasts or oppositions
which it presents, to correct each other, so that thus the objectively
true result is arrived at. For example, if we look simply at the
bad action of a man we will condemn him; on the other hand,
if we consider merely the need that moved him to it, we will
compassionate him: reason, by means of its conceptions, weighs
the two, and leads to the conclusion that he must be restrained,
restricted, and curbed by a proportionate punishment.
I am again reminded here of Seneca's saying: “Si vis tibi omnia
subjicere, te subjice rationi.” Since, however, as was shown in
the fourth book, the nature of suffering is positive, and that of
pleasure negative, he who takes abstract or rational knowledge
as the rule of his conduct, and therefore constantly reflects on
its consequences and on the future, will very frequently have to
practise sustine et abstine, for in order to obtain the life that is
most free from pain he generally sacrifices its keenest joys and
pleasures, mindful of Aristotle's “A ÆÁ¿1⁄211⁄4¿Â Ä¿ ±»ÅÀ¿1⁄2  ́1Éoμ1,
¿Å Ä¿ ! ́Å” (quod dolore vacat, non quod suave est, persequitur
vir prudens). Therefore with him the future constantly borrows
from the present, instead of the present borrowing from the
future, as is the case with a frivolous fool, who thus becomes
impoverished and finally bankrupt. In the case of the former
reason must, for the most part, assume the rôle of a churlish
mentor, and unceasingly call for renunciations, without being
able to promise anything in return, except a fairly painless
existence. This rests on the fact that reason, by means of its
conceptions, surveys the whole of life, whose outcome, in the
happiest conceivable case, can be no other than what we have
said.339
When this striving after a painless existence, so far as it might
be attainable by the application of and strict adherence to rational
reflection and acquired knowledge of the true nature of life,
was carried out with the greatest consistency and to the utmost
extreme, it produced cynicism, from which stoicism afterwards
proceeded. I wish briefly here to bring this out more fully for
the sake of establishing more firmly the concluding exposition
of our first book.
All ancient moral systems, with the single exception of that of
Plato, were guides to a happy life. Accordingly in them the end
of virtue was entirely in this life, not beyond death. For to them
it is only the right path to a truly happy life; and on this account
the wise choose it. Hence arise those lengthy debates chiefly
preserved for us by Cicero, those keen and constantly renewed
investigations, whether virtue quite alone and in itself is really
sufficient for a happy life, or whether this further requires some
external condition; whether the virtuous and wise may also be
happy on the rack and the wheel, or in the bull of Phalaris; or
whether it does not go as far as this. For certainly this would be the
touchstone of an ethical system of this kind; the practice of it must
give happiness directly and unconditionally. If it cannot do this
it does not accomplish what it ought, and must be rejected. It is
therefore with truth and in accordance with the Christian point of
view that Augustine prefaces his exposition of the moral systems
of the ancients (De Civ. Dei, Lib. xix. c. 1) with the explanation:
“Exponenda sunt nobis argumenta mortalium, quibus sibi ipsi
beatitudinem facere IN HUJUS VITÆ INFELICITATE moliti sunt; ut ab
eorum rebus vanis spes nostra quid differat clarescat. De finibus
bonorum et malorum multa inter se philosophi disputarunt; quam
quæstionem maxima intentione versantes, invenire conati sunt,
quid efficiat hominem beatum: illud enim est finis bonorum.” I
wish to place beyond all doubt the eudæmonistic end which we
have ascribed to all ancient ethics by several express statements
of the ancients themselves. Aristotle says in the “Eth. Magna,”
[349]340
[350]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
i. 4: “) μÅ ́±11⁄4¿1⁄21± μ1⁄2 Äó μ1⁄2 ¶Ã1⁄2 μÃÄ1, Ä¿  ́μ μÅ ¶Ã1⁄2 μ1⁄2 Äó o±Ä±
Ä±Â ±ÁμÄ±Â ¶Ã1⁄2.” (Felicitas in bene vivendo posita est: verum
bene vivere est in eo positum, ut secundum virtutem vivamus),
with which may be compared “Eth. Nicom.,” i. 5. “Cic. Tusc.,”
v. 1: “Nam, quum ea causa impulerit eos, qui primi se ad
philosophiæ studia contulerunt, ut, omnibus rebus posthabitis,
totos se in optimo vitæ statu exquirendo collocarent; profecto spe
beate vivendi tantam in eo studio curam operamque posuerunt”.
According to Plutarch (De Repugn. Stoic., c. xviii.) Chrysippus
said: “¤¿ o±Ä± o±o1±1⁄2 ¶Ã1⁄2 Äó o±o¿ ́±11⁄4¿1⁄2ÉÂ ¶Ã1⁄2 Ä±ÅÄ¿1⁄2 μÃÄ1.”
(Vitiose vivere idem est guod vivere infeliciter.) Ibid., c. 26:
“) ÆÁ¿1⁄2·Ã1Â ¿ÅÇ ÄμÁ¿1⁄2 μÃÄ1 Ä·Â μÅ ́±11⁄4¿1⁄21±Â o± ̧1⁄2 ±ÅÄ¿, ±»»1⁄2

adeo felicitas.) “Stob. Ecl.,” Lib. ii. c. 7: “¤μ»¿Â  ́μ Æ±Ã11⁄2 μ11⁄2±1

felicitatem, cujus causa fiunt omnia.) “•Å ́±11⁄4¿1⁄21±1⁄2 ÃÅ1⁄2É1⁄2Å1⁄4μ11⁄2

ad beatum statum tendit, illo ducit, illo vias aperit.”—Id., Ep.
108: “Illud admoneo auditionem philosophorum, lectionemque,
ad propositum beatæ vitæ trahendum.”
The ethics of the Cynics also adopted this end of the happiest
life, as the Emperor Julian expressly testifies (Orat. vi.): “¤·Â
šÅ1⁄21o·Â  ́μ Æ1»¿Ã¿Æ1±Â Ão¿À¿Â 1⁄4μ1⁄2 μÃÄ1 o±1 Äμ»¿Â, aÃÀμÁ  ́·

Äó ¶Ã1⁄2 o±Ä± ÆÅÃ11⁄2, ±»»± 1⁄4· ÀÁ¿Â Ä±Â ÄÉ1⁄2 À¿»»É1⁄2  ́¿3⁄4±Â.”
(Cynicæ philosophiæ ut etiam omnis philosophiæ, scopus et
finis est feliciter vivere: felicitas vitæ autem in eo posita est,
ut secundum naturam vivatur, nec vero secundum opiniones
multitudinis.) Only the Cynics followed quite a peculiar path
to this end, a path directly opposed to the ordinary one—the
path of extreme privation. They start from the insight that the341
motions of the will which are brought about by the objects which
attract and excite it, and the wearisome, and for the most part
vain, efforts to attain these, or, if they are attained, the fear of
losing them, and finally the loss itself, produce far greater pain
than the want of all these objects ever can. Therefore, in order
to attain to the life that is most free from pain, they chose the
path of the extremest destitution, and fled from all pleasures as
snares through which one was afterwards handed over to pain.
But after this they could boldly scorn happiness and its caprices.
This is the spirit of cynicism. Seneca distinctly expresses it
in the eighth chapter, “De Tranquilitate Animi:” “Cogitandum
est, quanto levior dolor sit, non habere, quam perdere: et
intelligemus paupertati eo minorem tormentorum, quo minorem
damnorum esse materiam.” Then: “Tolerabilius est, faciliusque,
non acquirere, quam amittere.... Diogenes effecit, ne quid sibi
eripi posset, ... qui se fortuitis omnibus exuit.... Videtur mihi
dixisse; age tuum negotium, fortuna: nihil apud Diogenem
jam tuum est.” The parallel passage to this last sentence is the
quotation of Stobæus (Ecl. ii. 7): “”1¿3μ1⁄2·Â μÆ· 1⁄2¿1⁄41¶μ11⁄2
AÁ±1⁄2 Ä·1⁄2 ¤ÅÇ·1⁄2 μ1⁄2¿ÁÉÃ±1⁄2 ±ÅÄ¿1⁄2 o±1 »μ3¿ÅÃ±1⁄2; Ä¿ÅÄ¿1⁄2  ́1⁄2 ¿Å

videre Fortunam, ipsum intuentem, ac dicentem: aut hunc non
potui tetigisse canem rabiosum.) The same spirit of cynicism is
also shown in the epitaph on Diogenes, in Suidas, under the word
¦1»1Ão¿Â, and in “Diogenes Laertius,” vi. 2:
““·Á±Ãoμ1 1⁄4μ1⁄2 Ç±»o¿Â QÀ¿ ÇÁ¿1⁄2¿Å; ±»»± Ã¿1⁄2 ¿ÅÄ1

(Æra quidem absumit tempus, sed tempore numquam

Quandoquidem ad vitam miseris mortalibus æquam
Monstrata est facilis, te duce, et ampla via.)
[351]342
[352]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Accordingly the fundamental thought of cynicism is that
life in its simplest and nakedest form, with the hardships that
belong to it by nature, is the most endurable, and is therefore
to be chosen; for every assistance, convenience, gratification,
and pleasure by means of which men seek to make life more
agreeable only brings with it new and greater ills than originally
belonged to it. Therefore we may regard the following sentence
as the expression of the kernel of the doctrine of cynicism:
“”1¿3μ1⁄2·Â μ2¿3 À¿»»±o1Â »μ3É1⁄2, Ä¿1⁄2 ÄÉ1⁄2 ±1⁄2 ̧ÉÀÉ1⁄2 21¿1⁄2 Á± ́1¿1⁄2

sæpius, hominum vitam facilem a diis dari, verum occultari illam
quærentibus mellita cibaria, unguenta et his similia.) (Diog.,
Laert., vi. 2.) And further: “”μ¿1⁄2, ±1⁄2Ä1 ÄÉ1⁄2 ±ÇÁ·ÃÄÉ1⁄2 À¿1⁄2É1⁄2,

(Quum igitur, repudiatis inutilibus laboribus, naturales insequi,
ac vivere beate debeamus, per summam dementiam infelices
sumus.... eandem vitæ formam, quam Hercules, se vivere
affirmans, nihil libertati præferens. Ibid.) Therefore the old,
genuine Cynics, Antisthenes, Diogenes, Krates, and their
disciples had once for all renounced every possession, all
conveniences and pleasures, in order to escape for ever from
the troubles and cares, the dependence and the pains, which are
inevitably bound up with them and are not counterbalanced by
them. Through the bare satisfaction of the most pressing wants
and the renunciation of everything superfluous they thought they
would come off best. Accordingly they contented themselves
with what in Athens or Corinth was to be had almost for nothing,
such as lupines, water, an old threadbare cloak, a wallet, and a
staff. They begged occasionally, as far as was necessary to supply
such wants, but they never worked. Yet they accepted absolutely
nothing that exceeded the wants referred to above. Independence343
in the widest sense was their aim. They occupied their time in
resting, going about, talking with all men, and much mocking,
laughing, and joking; their characteristic was carelessness and
great cheerfulness. Since now in this manner of life they had no
aims of their own, no purposes or ends to pursue, thus were lifted
above the sphere of human action, and at the same time always
enjoyed complete leisure, they were admirably fitted, as men of
proved strength of mind, to be the advisers and admonishers of
the rest. Therefore Apuleius says (Florid., iv.): “Crates, ut lar
familiaris apud homines suæ ætatis cultus est. Nulla domus ei
unquam clausa erat: nec erat patrisfamilias tam absconditum
secretum, quin eo tempestive Crates interveniret, litium omnium
et jurgiorum inter propinquos disceptator et arbiter.” Thus in
this, as in so many other respects, they show a great likeness
to the mendicant friars of modern times, that is, to the better
and more genuine among them, whose ideal may be seen in
the Capucine Christoforo in Manzoni's famous romance. Yet
this resemblance lies only in the effects, not in the cause. They
agree in the result, but the fundamental thought of the two is
quite different. With the friars, as with the Sannyâsis, who are
akin to them, it is an aim which transcends life; but with the
Cynics it is only the conviction that it is easier to reduce their
wishes and their wants to the minimum, than to attain to the
maximum in their satisfaction, which indeed is impossible, for
with their satisfaction the wishes and wants grow ad infinitum;
therefore, in order to reach the goal of all ancient ethics, the
greatest happiness possible in this life, they took the path of
renunciation as the shortest and easiest: “A ̧μ1⁄2 o±1 Ä¿1⁄2 šÅ1⁄21Ã1⁄4¿1⁄2
μ1Á·o±Ã11⁄2 ÃÅ1⁄2Ä¿1⁄4¿1⁄2 μÀ1⁄2 ±ÁμÄ·1⁄2 A ́¿1⁄2.” (Unde Cynismum dixere
compendiosam ad virtutem viam.) Diog. Laert., vi. 9. The
fundamental difference between the spirit of cynicism and that
of asceticism comes out very clearly in the humility which is
essential to the ascetic, but is so foreign to the Cynic that, on
the contrary, he is distinguished beyond everything else for pride
[353]344
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
and scorn:—
“Sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,
Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum.”—Hor.
[354]
On the other hand, the view of life held by the Cynics agrees
in spirit with that of J. J. Rousseau as he expounds it in the
“Discours sur l'Origine de l'Inégalité.” For he also would wish
to lead us back to the crude state of nature, and regards the
reduction of our wants to the minimum as the surest path to
happiness. For the rest, the Cynics were exclusively practical
philosophers: at least no account of their theoretical philosophy
is known to me.
Now the Stoics proceeded from them in this way—they
changed the practical into the theoretical. They held that the
actual dispensing with everything that can be done without is
not demanded, but that it is sufficient that we should regard
possessions and pleasures constantly as dispensable, and as held
in the hand of chance; for then the actual deprivation of them, if
it should chance to occur, would neither be unexpected nor fall
heavily. One might always have and enjoy everything; only one
must ever keep present the conviction of the worthlessness and
dispensableness of these good things on the one hand, and of
their uncertainty and perishableness on the other, and therefore
prize them all very little, and be always ready to give them up.
Nay more, he who must actually dispense with these things in
order not to be moved by them, thereby shows that in his heart
he holds them to be truly good things, which one must put quite
out of sight if one is not to long after them. The wise man, on the
other hand, knows that they are not good things at all, but rather
perfectly indifferent things, ± ́1±Æ¿Á±, in any case ÀÁ¿·31⁄4μ1⁄2±.
Therefore if they present themselves he will accept them, but
yet is always ready to let them go again, if chance, to which
they belong, should demand them back; for they are ÄÉ1⁄2 ¿Åo μÆ1⁄2345
!1⁄411⁄2. In this sense, Epictetus, chap. vii., says that the wise man,
like one who has landed from a ship, &c., will also let himself
be comforted by a wife or a child, but yet will always be ready,
whenever the captain calls, to let them go again. Thus the Stoics
perfected the theory of equanimity and independence at the cost
of the practice, for they reduced everything to a mental process,
and by arguments, such as are presented in the first chapter of
Epictetus, sophisticated themselves into all the amenities of life.
But in doing so they left out of account that everything to which
one is accustomed becomes a need, and therefore can only be
given up with pain; that the will does not allow itself to be played
with, cannot enjoy without loving the pleasures; that a dog does
not remain indifferent if one draws a piece of meat through its
mouth, and neither does a wise man if he is hungry; and that
there is no middle path between desiring and renouncing. But
they believed that they satisfied their principles if, sitting at a
luxurious Roman table, they left no dish untasted, yet at the
same time protested that they were each and all of them mere
ÀÁ¿·31⁄4μ1⁄2±, not ±3± ̧±; or in plain English, if they eat, drank, and
were merry, yet gave no thanks to God for it all, but rather made
fastidious faces, and persisted in boldly asserting that they gained
nothing whatever from the whole feast. This was the expedient
of the Stoics; they were therefore mere braggarts, and stand to
the Cynics in much the same relation as well-fed Benedictines
and Augustines stand to Franciscans and Capucines. Now the
more they neglected practice, the more they refined the theory.
I shall here add a few proofs and supplementary details to the
exposition of it given at the close of our first book.
If we search in the writings of the Stoics which remain to
us, all of which are unsystematically composed, for the ultimate
ground of that irrefragible equanimity which is unceasingly
demanded of us, we find no other than the knowledge that the
course of the world is entirely independent of our will, and
consequently, that the evil which befalls us is inevitable. If we
[355]346
[356]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
have regulated our claims by a correct insight into this, then
mourning, rejoicing, fearing, and hoping are follies of which we
are no longer capable. Further, especially in the commentaries
of Arrian, it is surreptitiously assumed that all that is ¿Åo μÆ1⁄2
!1⁄411⁄2 (i.e., does not depend upon us) is at once also ¿Å ÀÁ¿Â
!1⁄4±Â (i.e., does not concern us). Yet it remains true that all the
good things of life are in the power of chance, and therefore
whenever it makes use of this power to deprive us of them, we
are unhappy if we have placed our happiness in them. From this
unworthy fate we are, in the opinion of the Stoics, delivered by
the right use of reason, by virtue of which we regard all these
things, never as ours, but only as lent to us for an indefinite
time; only thus can we never really lose them. Therefore Seneca
says (Ep. 98): “Si, quid humanarum rerum varietas possit,
cogitaverit, ante quam senserit,” and Diogenes Laertius (vii. 1.
87): “TMÃ¿1⁄2  ́μ μÃÄ1 Ä¿ o±Ä1⁄2 ±ÁμÄ·1⁄2 ¶Ã1⁄2 Äó o±Ä1⁄2 μ1⁄4Àμ1Á1±1⁄2 ÄÉ1⁄2
ÆÅÃμ1 ÃÅ1⁄42±11⁄2¿1⁄2ÄÉ1⁄2 ¶Ã1⁄2.” (Secundum virtutem vivere idem est,
quod secundum experientiam eorum, quæ secundum naturam
accidunt, vivere.) The passage in Arrian's “Discourses of
Epictetus,” B. iii., c. 24, 84-89, is particularly in point here;
and especially, as a proof of what I have said in this reference
in § 16 of the first volume, the passage: “¤¿ÅÄ¿ 3±Á μÃÄ1 Ä¿
±1Ä1¿1⁄2 Ä¿1Â ±1⁄2 ̧Á¿À¿1Â À±1⁄2ÄÉ1⁄2 ÄÉ1⁄2 o±oÉ1⁄2 Ä¿ Ä±Â ÀÁ¿»·Èμ1Â
Ä±Â o¿11⁄2±Â 1⁄4·  ́Å1⁄2±Ã ̧±1 μÆ±Á1⁄4¿¶μ11⁄2 Ä¿1Â μÀ1 1⁄4μÁ¿ÅÂ,” Ibid. iv.,
1. 42. (Hæc enim causa est hominibus omnium malorum, quod
anticipationes generales rebus singularibus accommodare non
possunt.) Similarly the passage in “Marcus Aurelius” (iv. 29):
“•1 3⁄4μ1⁄2¿Â o¿Ã1⁄4¿Å A 1⁄4· 31⁄2ÉÁ1¶É1⁄2 Ä± μ1⁄2 ±ÅÄó ¿1⁄2Ä±, ¿ÅÇ !ÄÄ¿1⁄2
3⁄4μ1⁄2¿Â o±1 ¿ 1⁄4· 31⁄2ÉÁ1¶É1⁄2 Ä± 3131⁄2¿1⁄4μ1⁄2±;” that is: “If he is a
stranger to the universe who does not know what is in it, no less
is he a stranger who does not know how things go on in it.”
Also Seneca's eleventh chapter, “De Tranquilitate Animi,” is a
complete proof of this view. The opinion of the Stoics amounts
on the whole to this, that if a man has watched for a while the347
juggling illusion of happiness and then uses his reason, he must
recognise both the rapid changes of the dice and the intrinsic
worthlessness of the counters, and therefore must henceforth
remain unmoved. Taken generally the Stoical point of view may
be thus expressed: our suffering always arises from the want
of agreement between our wishes and the course of the world.
Therefore one of these two must be changed and adapted to the
other. Since now the course of things is not in our power (¿Åo μÆ1⁄2
!1⁄411⁄2), we must direct our volitions and desires according to the
course of things: for the will alone is μÆ1⁄2 !1⁄411⁄2. This adaptation of
volition to the course of the external world, thus to the nature of
things, is very often understood under the ambiguous o±Ä± ÆÅÃ11⁄2
¶·1⁄2. See the “Discourses of Epictetus,” ii. 17, 21, 22. Seneca
also denotes this point of view (Ep. 119) when he says: “Nihil
interest, utrum non desideres, an habeas. Summa rei in utroque
est eadem: non torqueberis.” Also Cicero (Tusc. iv. 26) by the
words: “Solum habere velle, summa dementia est.” Similarly
Arrian (iv. 1. 175): “ŸÅ 3±Á μoÀ»·ÁÉÃμ1 ÄÉ1⁄2 μÀ1 ̧Å1⁄4¿Å1⁄4μ1⁄2É1⁄2
μ»μÅ ̧μÁ1± À±Á±ÃoμÅ±¶μÄ±1, ±»»± ±1⁄2±ÃoμÅ· Ä·Â μÀ1 ̧Å1⁄41±Â.”
(Non enim explendis desideriis libertas comparatur, sed tollenda
cupiditate.)
The collected quotations in the “Historia Philosophiæ Græco-
Romanæ” of Ritter and Preller may be taken as proofs of
what I have said, in the place referred to above, about the
A1⁄4¿»¿3¿Å1⁄4μ1⁄2ÉÂ ¶Ã1⁄2 of the Stoics. Also the saying of Seneca
(Ep. 31, and again Ep. 74): “Perfecta virtus est æqualitas et
tenor vitæ per omnia consonans sibi.” The following passage
of Seneca's indicates the spirit of the Stoa generally (Ep. 92):
“Quid est beata vita? Securitas et perpetua tranquillitas. Hanc
dabit animi magnitudo, dabit constantia bene judicati tenax.” A
systematical study of the Stoics will convince every one that the
end of their ethics, like that of the ethics of Cynicism from which
they sprang, is really nothing else than a life as free as possible
from pain, and therefore as happy as possible. Whence it follows
[357]348
[358]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
that the Stoical morality is only a special form of Eudæmonism.
It has not, like the Indian, the Christian, and even the Platonic
ethics, a metaphysical tendency, a transcendental end, but a
completely immanent end, attainable in this life; the steadfast
serenity (±Ä±Á±3⁄41±) and unclouded happiness of the wise man,
whom nothing can disturb. Yet it cannot be denied that the
later Stoics, especially Arrian, sometimes lose sight of this end,
and show a really ascetic tendency, which is to be attributed
to the Christian and Oriental spirit in general which was then
already spreading. If we consider closely and seriously the goal
of Stoicism, that ±Ä±Á±3⁄41±, we find in it merely a hardening and
insensibility to the blow of fate which a man attains to because he
keeps ever present to his mind the shortness of life, the emptiness
of pleasure, the instability of happiness, and has also discerned
that the difference between happiness and unhappiness is very
much less than our anticipation of both is wont to represent.
But this is yet no state of happiness; it is only the patient
endurance of sufferings which one has foreseen as irremediable.
Yet magnanimity and worth consist in this, that one should bear
silently and patiently what is irremediable, in melancholy peace,
remaining always the same, while others pass from rejoicing
to despair and from despair to rejoicing. Accordingly one may
also conceive of Stoicism as a spiritual hygiene, in accordance
with which, just as one hardens the body against the influences
of wind and weather, against fatigue and exertion, one has also
to harden one's mind against misfortune, danger, loss, injustice,
malice, perfidy, arrogance, and the folly of men.
I remark further, that the o± ̧3o¿1⁄2Ä± of the Stoics,
which Cicero translates officia, signify as nearly as possible
Obliegenheiten, or that which it befits the occasion to do;
English, incumbencies; Italian, quel che tocca a me di fare,
o di lasciare, thus what it behoves a reasonable man to do.
Cf. Diog. Laert., vii. 1. 109. Finally, the pantheism of the
Stoics, though absolutely inconsistent with many an exhortation349
of Arrian, is most distinctly expressed by Seneca: “Quid est
Deus? Mens universi. Quid est Deus? Quod vides totum, et quod
non vides totum. Sic demum magnitudo sua illi redditur, qua
nihil majus excogitari potest: si solus est omnia, opus suum et
extra, et intra tenet.” (Quæst. Natur. 1, præfatio 12.)
