4. The intellect becomes tired; the will is never tired. After
sustained work with the head we feel the tiredness of the brain,
just like that of the arm after sustained bodily work. All knowing
is accompanied with effort; willing, on the contrary, is our very
nature, whose manifestations take place without any weariness
and entirely of their own accord. Therefore, if our will is strongly
excited, as in all emotions, thus in anger, fear, desire, grief,
&c., and we are now called upon to know, perhaps with the
view of correcting the motives of that emotion, the violence
which we must do ourselves for this purpose is evidence of the
transition from the original natural activity proper to ourselves to the derived, indirect, and forced activity. For the will alone is ±ÅÄ¿1⁄4±Ä¿Â, and therefore ±o±1⁄4±Ä¿Â o±1 ±3·Á±Ä¿Â ·1⁄4±Ä± À±1⁄2Ä±
(lassitudinis et senii expers in sempiternum). It alone is active
without being called upon, and therefore often too early and too
much, and it knows no weariness. Infants who scarcely show
the first weak trace of intelligence are already full of self-will:
through unlimited, aimless roaring and shrieking they show the
pressure of will with which they swell, while their willing has yet
no object, i.e., they will without knowing what they will. What
Cabanis has observed is also in point here: “Toutes ces passions,
qui se succèdent d'une mannière si rapide, et se peignent avec
tant de naïveté, sur le visage mobile des enfants. Tandis que les
faibles muscles de leurs bras et de leurs jambes savent encore
a peine former quelque mouvemens indécis, les muscles de la
face expriment déjà par des mouvemens distincts presque toute
la suite des affections générales propres a la nature humaine:
et l'observateur attentif reconnait facilement dans ce tableau les
traits caractéristiques de l'homme futur” (Rapports du Physique
et Moral, vol. i. p. 123). 

The intellect, on the contrary, develops
slowly, following the completion of the brain and the maturity
of the whole organism, which are its conditions, just because it
is merely a somatic function. It is because the brain attains its
full size in the seventh year that from that time forward children
become so remarkably intelligent, inquisitive, and reasonable.
But then comes puberty; to a certain extent it affords a support
to the brain, or a resounding-board, and raises the intellect at
once by a large step, as it were by an octave, corresponding to
the lowering of the voice by that amount. But at once the animal
desires and passions that now appear resist the reasonableness
that has hitherto prevailed and to which they have been added.
Further evidence is given of the indefatigable nature of the will
by the fault which is, more or less, peculiar to all men by nature,
and is only overcome by education—precipitation. It consists
in this, that the will hurries to its work before the time. This413
work is the purely active and executive part, which ought only to
begin when the explorative and deliberative part, thus the work
of knowing, has been completely and thoroughly carried out. But
this time is seldom waited for. Scarcely are a few data concerning
the circumstances before us, or the event that has occurred, or the
opinion of others conveyed to us, superficially comprehended
and hastily gathered together by knowledge, than from the depths
of our being the will, always ready and never weary, comes forth
unasked, and shows itself as terror, fear, hope, joy, desire, envy,
grief, zeal, anger, or courage, and leads to rash words and deeds,
which are generally followed by repentance when time has taught
us that the hegemonicon, the intellect, has not been able to finish
half its work of comprehending the circumstances, reflecting on
their connection, and deciding what is prudent, because the will
did not wait for it, but sprang forward long before its time with
“Now it is my turn!” and at once began the active work, without
the intellect being able to resist, as it is a mere slave and bondman
of the will, and not, like it, ±ÅÄ¿1⁄4±Ä¿Â, nor active from its own
power and its own impulse; therefore it is easily pushed aside
and silenced by a nod of the will, while on its part it is scarcely
able, with the greatest efforts, to bring the will even to a brief
pause, in order to speak. This is why the people are so rare,
and are found almost only among Spaniards, Turks, and perhaps
Englishmen, who even under circumstances of provocation keep
the head uppermost, imperturbably proceed to comprehend and
investigate the state of affairs, and when others would already be
beside themselves, con mucho sosiego, still ask further questions,
which is something quite different from the indifference founded
upon apathy and stupidity of many Germans and Dutchmen.
Iffland used to give an excellent representation of this admirable
quality, as Hetmann of the Cossacks, in Benjowski, when the
conspirators have enticed him into their tent and hold a rifle to
his head, with the warning that they will fire it if he utters a
cry, Iffland blew into the mouth of the rifle to try whether it was loaded. 

Of ten things that annoy us, nine would not be able
to do so if we understood them thoroughly in their causes, and
therefore knew their necessity and true nature; but we would do
this much oftener if we made them the object of reflection before
making them the object of wrath and indignation. For what bridle
and bit are to an unmanageable horse the intellect is for the will in
man; by this bridle it must be controlled by means of instruction,
exhortation, culture, &c., for in itself it is as wild and impetuous
an impulse as the force that appears in the descending waterfall,
nay, as we know, it is at bottom identical with this. In the height
of anger, in intoxication, in despair, it has taken the bit between
its teeth, has run away, and follows its original nature. In the
Mania sine delirio it has lost bridle and bit altogether, and shows
now most distinctly its original nature, and that the intellect is as
different from it as the bridle from the horse. In this condition it
may also be compared to a clock which, when a certain screw is
taken away, runs down without stopping.

Thus this consideration also shows us the will as that which
is original, and therefore metaphysical; the intellect, on the
other hand, as something subordinate and physical. For as such
the latter is, like everything physical, subject to vis inertiæ,
consequently only active if it is set agoing by something else,
the will, which rules it, manages it, rouses it to effort, in short,
imparts to it the activity which does not originally reside in it.
Therefore it willingly rests whenever it is permitted to do so,
often declares itself lazy and disinclined to activity; through
continued effort it becomes weary to the point of complete
stupefaction, is exhausted, like the voltaic pile, through repeated
shocks. Hence all continuous mental work demands pauses and
rest, otherwise stupidity and incapacity ensue, at first of course
only temporarily; but if this rest is persistently denied to the
intellect it will become excessively and continuously fatigued,
and the consequence is a permanent deterioration of it, which in
an old man may pass into complete incapacity, into childishness,415
imbecility, and madness. It is not to be attributed to age in and
for itself, but to long-continued tyrannical over-exertion of the
intellect or brain, if this misfortune appears in the last years of life.
This is the explanation of the fact that Swift became mad, Kant
became childish, Walter Scott, and also Wordsworth, Southey,
and many minorum gentium, became dull and incapable. Goethe
remained to the end clear, strong, and active-minded, because
he, who was always a man of the world and a courtier, never
carried on his mental occupations with self-compulsion. The
same holds good of Wieland and of Kuebel, who lived to the
age of ninety-one, and also of Voltaire. Now all this proves
how very subordinate and physical and what a mere tool the
intellect is. Just on this account it requires, during almost a third
part of its lifetime, the entire suspension of its activity in sleep,
i.e., the rest of the brain, of which it is the mere function, and
which therefore just as truly precedes it as the stomach precedes
digestion, or as a body precedes its impulsion, and with which
in old age it flags and decays. The will, on the contrary, as the
thing in itself, is never lazy, is absolutely untiring, its activity is
its essence, it never ceases willing, and when, during deep sleep,
it is forsaken of the intellect, and therefore cannot act outwardly
in accordance with motives, it is active as the vital force, cares
the more uninterruptedly for the inner economy of the organism,
and as vis naturæ medicatrix sets in order again the irregularities
that have crept into it. For it is not, like the intellect, a function
of the body; but the body is its function; therefore it is, ordine
rerum, prior to the body, as its metaphysical substratum, as the
in-itself of its phenomenal appearance. It shares its unwearying
nature, for the time that life lasts, with the heart, that primum
mobile of the organism, which has therefore become its symbol
and synonym. Moreover, it does not disappear in the old man,
but still continues to will what it has willed, and indeed becomes
firmer, more inflexible, than it was in youth, more implacable,
self-willed, and unmanageable, because the intellect has become less susceptible: therefore in old age the man can perhaps only
be matched by taking advantage of the weakness of his intellect.

Moreover, the prevailing weakness and imperfection of the
intellect, as it is shown in the want of judgment, narrow-
mindedness, perversity, and folly of the great majority of men,
would be quite inexplicable if the intellect were not subordinate,
adventitious, and merely instrumental, but the immediate and
original nature of the so-called soul, or in general of the inner
man: as all philosophers have hitherto assumed it to be. For
how could the original nature in its immediate and peculiar
function so constantly err and fail? The truly original in human
consciousness, the willing, always goes on with perfect success;
every being wills unceasingly, capably, and decidedly. To regard
the immorality in the will as an imperfection of it would be a
fundamentally false point of view. For morality has rather a
source which really lies above nature, and therefore its utterances
are in contradiction with it. Therefore morality is in direct
opposition to the natural will, which in itself is completely
egoistic; indeed the pursuit of the path of morality leads to the
abolition of the will. On this subject I refer to our fourth book
and to my prize essay, “Ueber das Fundament der Moral.”
5. That the will is what is real and essential in man, and the
intellect only subordinate, conditioned, and produced, is also to
be seen in the fact that the latter can carry on its function with
perfect purity and correctness only so long as the will is silent
and pauses. On the other hand, the function of the intellect
is disturbed by every observable excitement of the will, and
its result is falsified by the intermixture of the latter; but the
converse does not hold, that the intellect should in the same way
be a hindrance to the will. Thus the moon cannot shine when the
sun is in the heavens, but when the moon is in the heavens it does
not prevent the sun from shining.
A great fright often deprives us of our senses to such an
extent that we are petrified, or else do the most absurd things;417
for example, when fire has broken out run right into the flames.
Anger makes us no longer know what we do, still less what
we say. Zeal, therefore called blind, makes us incapable of
weighing the arguments of others, or even of seeking out and
setting in order our own. Joy makes us inconsiderate, reckless,
and foolhardy, and desire acts almost in the same way. Fear
prevents us from seeing and laying hold of the resources that
are still present, and often lie close beside us. Therefore for
overcoming sudden dangers, and also for fighting with opponents
and enemies, the most essential qualifications are coolness and
presence of mind. The former consists in the silence of the
will so that the intellect can act; the latter in the undisturbed
activity of the intellect under the pressure of events acting on
the will; therefore the former is the condition of the latter, and
the two are nearly related; they are seldom to be found, and
always only in a limited degree. But they are of inestimable
advantage, because they permit the use of the intellect just at
those times when we stand most in need of it, and therefore confer
decided superiority. He who is without them only knows what
he should have done or said when the opportunity has passed.
It is very appropriately said of him who is violently moved,
i.e., whose will is so strongly excited that it destroys the purity
of the function of the intellect, he is disarmed; for the correct
knowledge of the circumstances and relations is our defence and
weapon in the conflict with things and with men. In this sense
Balthazar Gracian says: “Es la passion enemiga declarada de la
cordura” (Passion is the declared enemy of prudence). If now
the intellect were not something completely different from the
will, but, as has been hitherto supposed, knowing and willing
had the same root, and were equally original functions of an
absolutely simple nature, then with the rousing and heightening
of the will, in which the emotion consists, the intellect would
necessarily also be heightened; but, as we have seen, it is
rather hindered and depressed by this; whence the ancients called emotion animi perturbatio. The intellect is really like the reflecting surface of water, but the water itself is like the will,
whose disturbance therefore at once destroys the clearness of
that mirror and the distinctness of its images. 

The organism is
the will itself, is embodied will, i.e., will objectively perceived
in the brain. Therefore many of its functions, such as respiration,
circulation, secretion of bile, and muscular power, are heightened
and accelerated by the pleasurable, and in general the healthy,
emotions. The intellect, on the other hand, is the mere function of
the brain, which is only nourished and supported by the organism
as a parasite. Therefore every perturbation of the will, and with
it of the organism, must disturb and paralyse the function of the
brain, which exists for itself and for no other wants than its own,
which are simply rest and nourishment.

But this disturbing influence of the activity of the will upon the
intellect can be shown, not only in the perturbations brought about
by emotions, but also in many other, more gradual, and therefore
more lasting falsifications of thought by our inclinations. Hope
makes us regard what we wish, and fear what we are apprehensive
of, as probable and near, and both exaggerate their object. Plato
(according to Ælian, V.H., 13, 28) very beautifully called hope
the dream of the waking. Its nature lies in this, that the will, when
its servant the intellect is not able to produce what it wishes,
obliges it at least to picture it before it, in general to undertake
the roll of comforter, to appease its lord with fables, as a nurse
a child, and so to dress these out that they gain an appearance
of likelihood. Now in this the intellect must do violence to its
own nature, which aims at the truth, for it compels it, contrary to
its own laws, to regard as true things which are neither true nor
probable, and often scarcely possible, only in order to appease,
quiet, and send to sleep for a while the restless and unmanageable
will. Here we see clearly who is master and who is servant. Many
may well have observed that if a matter which is of importance
to them may turn out in several different ways, and they have419
brought all of these into one disjunctive judgment which in
their opinion is complete, the actual result is yet quite another,
and one wholly unexpected by them: but perhaps they will not
have considered this, that this result was then almost always the
one which was unfavourable to them. 

The explanation of this
is, that while their intellect intended to survey the possibilities
completely, the worst of all remained quite invisible to it; because
the will, as it were, covered it with its hand, that is, it so mastered
the intellect that it was quite incapable of glancing at the worst
case of all, although, since it actually came to pass, this was also
the most probable case. Yet in very melancholy dispositions,
or in those that have become prudent through experience like
this, the process is reversed, for here apprehension plays the
part which was formerly played by hope. The first appearance
of danger throws them into groundless anxiety. If the intellect
begins to investigate the matter it is rejected as incompetent, nay,
as a deceitful sophist, because the heart is to be believed, whose
fears are now actually allowed to pass for arguments as to the
reality and greatness of the danger. So then the intellect dare
make no search for good reasons on the other side, which, if left
to itself, it would soon recognise, but is obliged at once to picture
to them the most unfortunate issue, even if it itself can scarcely
think this issue possible:
“Such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,
Because the worst is ever nearest truth.”
—BYRON (Lara, c. 1).
Love and hate falsify our judgment entirely. In our enemies we
see nothing but faults—in our loved ones nothing but excellences,
and even their faults appear to us amiable. Our interest, of
whatever kind it may be, exercises a like secret power over our
judgment; what is in conformity with it at once seems to us fair,
just, and reasonable; what runs contrary to it presents itself to us, in perfect seriousness, as unjust and outrageous, or injudicious
and absurd. 

Hence so many prejudices of position, profession,
nationality, sect, and religion. A conceived hypothesis gives us
lynx-eyes for all that confirms it, and makes us blind to all that
contradicts it. What is opposed to our party, our plan, our wish,
our hope, we often cannot comprehend and grasp at all, while
it is clear to every one else; but what is favourable to these,
on the other hand, strikes our eye from afar. What the heart
opposes the head will not admit. We firmly retain many errors
all through life, and take care never to examine their ground,
merely from a fear, of which we ourselves are conscious, that
we might make the discovery that we had so long believed and
so often asserted what is false. 

Thus then is the intellect daily
befooled and corrupted by the impositions of inclination. This
has been very beautifully expressed by Bacon of Verulam in the
words: Intellectus LUMINIS SICCI non est; sed recipit infusionem a
voluntate et affectibus: id quod generat ad quod vult scientias:
quod enim mavult homo, id potius credit. Innumeris modis,
iisque interdum imperceptibilibus, affectus intellectum imbuit et
inficit (Org. Nov., i. 14). Clearly it is also this that opposes
all new fundamental opinions in the sciences and all refutations
of sanctioned errors, for one will not easily see the truth of
that which convicts one of incredible want of thought. It is
explicable, on this ground alone, that the truths of Goethe's
doctrine of colours, which are so clear and simple, are still
denied by the physicists; and thus Goethe himself has had to
learn what a much harder position one has if one promises men
instruction than if one promises them amusement. Hence it is
much more fortunate to be born a poet than a philosopher. But
the more obstinately an error was held by the other side, the more
shameful does the conviction afterwards become. In the case of
an overthrown system, as in the case of a conquered army, the
most prudent is he who first runs away from it.
A trifling and absurd, but striking example of that mysterious421
and immediate power which the will exercises over the intellect,
is the fact that in doing accounts we make mistakes much oftener
in our own favour than to our disadvantage, and this without
the slightest dishonest intention, merely from the unconscious
tendency to diminish our Debit and increase our Credit.
Lastly, the fact is also in point here, that when advice is given
the slightest aim or purpose of the adviser generally outweighs
his insight, however great it may be; therefore we dare not
assume that he speaks from the latter when we suspect the
existence of the former. How little perfect sincerity is to be
expected even from otherwise honest persons whenever their
interests are in any way concerned we can gather from the fact
that we so often deceive ourselves when hope bribes us, or fear
befools us, or suspicion torments us, or vanity flatters us, or
an hypothesis blinds us, or a small aim which is close at hand
injures a greater but more distant one; for in this we see the
direct and unconscious disadvantageous influence of the will
upon knowledge. Accordingly it ought not to surprise us if in
asking advice the will of the person asked directly dictates the
answer even before the question could penetrate to the forum of
his judgment.

I wish in a single word to point out here what will be fully
explained in the following book, that the most perfect knowledge,
thus the purely objective comprehension of the world, i.e., the
comprehension of genius, is conditioned by a silence of the will
so profound that while it lasts even the individuality vanishes
from consciousness and the man remains as the pure subject of
knowing, which is the correlative of the Idea.

The disturbing influence of the will upon the intellect, which
is proved by all these phenomena, and, on the other hand, the
weakness and frailty of the latter, on account of which it is
incapable of working rightly whenever the will is in any way
moved, gives us then another proof that the will is the radical part
of our nature, and acts with original power, while the intellect, as adventitious and in many ways conditioned, can only act in a
subordinate and conditional manner.

There is no direct disturbance of the will by the intellect
corresponding to the disturbance and clouding of knowledge by
the will that has been shown. Indeed we cannot well conceive
such a thing. No one will wish to construe as such the fact
that motives wrongly taken up lead the will astray, for this is
a fault of the intellect in its own function, which is committed
quite within its own province, and the influence of which upon
the will is entirely indirect. It would be plausible to attribute
irresolution to this, for in its case, through the conflict of the
motives which the intellect presents to the will, the latter is
brought to a standstill, thus is hindered. But when we consider
it more closely, it becomes very clear that the cause of this
hindrance does not lie in the activity of the intellect as such, but
entirely in external objects which are brought about by it, for in
this case they stand in precisely such a relation to the will, which
is here interested, that they draw it with nearly equal strength
in different directions. This real cause merely acts through the
intellect as the medium of motives, though certainly under the
assumption that it is keen enough to comprehend the objects in
their manifold relations. Irresolution, as a trait of character, is just
as much conditioned by qualities of the will as of the intellect.
It is certainly not peculiar to exceedingly limited minds, for
their weak understanding does not allow them to discover such
manifold qualities and relations in things, and moreover is so little
fitted for the exertion of reflection and pondering these, and then
the probable consequences of each step, that they rather decide
at once according to the first impression, or according to some
simple rule of conduct. The converse of this occurs in the case
of persons of considerable understanding. Therefore, whenever
such persons also possess a tender care for their own well-being,
i.e., a very sensitive egoism, which constantly desires to come
off well and always to be safe, this introduces a certain anxiety423
at every step, and thereby irresolution. This quality therefore
indicates throughout not a want of understanding but a want of
courage. Yet very eminent minds survey the relations and their
probable developments with such rapidity and certainty, that if
they are only supported by some courage they thereby acquire that
quick decision and resolution that fits them to play an important
part in the affairs of the world, if time and circumstances afford
them the opportunity.

The only decided, direct restriction and disturbance which the
will can suffer from the intellect as such may indeed be the quite
exceptional one, which is the consequence of an abnormally
preponderating development of the intellect, thus of that high
endowment which has been defined as genius. This is decidedly a
hindrance to the energy of the character, and consequently to the
power of action. Hence it is not the really great minds that make
historical characters, because they are capable of bridling and
ruling the mass of men and carrying out the affairs of the world;
but for this persons of much less capacity of mind are qualified
when they have great firmness, decision, and persistency of
will, such as is quite inconsistent with very high intelligence.
Accordingly, where this very high intelligence exists we actually
have a case in which the intellect directly restricts the will.
6. In opposition to the hindrances and restrictions which it
has been shown the intellect suffers from the will, I wish now to
show, in a few examples, how, conversely, the functions of the
intellect are sometimes aided and heightened by the incitement
and spur of the will; so that in this also we may recognise the
primary nature of the one and the secondary nature of the other,
and it may become clear that the intellect stands to the will in the
relation of a tool.

A motive which affects us strongly, such as a yearning desire
or a pressing need, sometimes raises the intellect to a degree
of which we had not previously believed it capable. 

Difficult
circumstances, which impose upon us the necessity of certain achievements, develop entirely new talents in us, the germs of
which were hidden from us, and for which we did not credit
ourselves with any capacity. The understanding of the stupidest
man becomes keen when objects are in question that closely
concern his wishes; he now observes, weighs, and distinguishes
with the greatest delicacy even the smallest circumstances that
have reference to his wishes or fears. This has much to do
with the cunning of half-witted persons, which is often remarked
with surprise. On this account Isaiah rightly says, vexatio dat
intellectum, which is therefore also used as a proverb. Akin to
it is the German proverb, “Die Noth ist die Mutter der Künste”
(“Necessity is the mother of the arts”); when, however, the fine
arts are to be excepted, because the heart of every one of their
works, that is, the conception, must proceed from a perfectly
will-less, and only thereby purely objective, perception, if they
are to be genuine. Even the understanding of the brutes is
increased considerably by necessity, so that in cases of difficulty
they accomplish things at which we are astonished. For example,
they almost all calculate that it is safer not to run away when they
believe they are not seen; therefore the hare lies still in the furrow
of the field and lets the sportsman pass close to it; insects, when
they cannot escape, pretend to be dead, &c. We may obtain a
fuller knowledge of this influence from the special history of the
self-education of the wolf, under the spur of the great difficulty
of its position in civilised Europe; it is to be found in the second
letter of Leroy's excellent book, “Lettres sur l'intelligence et la
perfectibilité des animaux.” Immediately afterwards, in the third
letter, there follows the high school of the fox, which in an
equally difficult position has far less physical strength. In its
case, however, this is made up for by great understanding; yet
only through the constant struggle with want on the one hand and
danger on the other, thus under the spur of the will, does it attain
that high degree of cunning which distinguishes it especially in
old age. In all these enhancements of the intellect the will plays425
the part of a rider who with the spur urges the horse beyond the
natural measure of its strength.

In the same way the memory is enhanced through the pressure
of the will. Even if it is otherwise weak, it preserves perfectly
what has value for the ruling passion. The lover forgets no
opportunity favourable to him, the ambitious man forgets no
circumstance that can forward his plans, the avaricious man
never forgets the loss he has suffered, the proud man never
forgets an injury to his honour, the vain man remembers every
word of praise and the most trifling distinction that falls to his
lot. And this also extends to the brutes: the horse stops at the
inn where once long ago it was fed; dogs have an excellent
memory for all occasions, times, and places that have afforded
them choice morsels; and foxes for the different hiding-places in
which they have stored their plunder.

Self-consideration affords opportunity for finer observations
in this regard. Sometimes, through an interruption, it has entirely
escaped me what I have just been thinking about, or even what
news I have just heard. Now if the matter had in any way
even the most distant personal interest, the after-feeling of the
impression which it made upon the will has remained. I am still
quite conscious how far it affected me agreeably or disagreeably,
and also of the special manner in which this happened, whether,
even in the slightest degree, it vexed me, or made me anxious,
or irritated me, or depressed me, or produced the opposite of
these affections. Thus the mere relation of the thing to my will
is retained in the memory after the thing itself has vanished, and
this often becomes the clue to lead us back to the thing itself. The
sight of a man sometimes affects us in an analogous manner, for
we remember merely in general that we have had something to
do with him, yet without knowing where, when, or what it was,
or who he is. But the sight of him still recalls pretty accurately the
feeling which our dealings with him excited in us, whether it was
agreeable or disagreeable, and also in what degree and in what way. 

Thus our memory has preserved only the response of the
will, and not that which called it forth. We might call what lies at
the foundation of this process the memory of the heart; it is much
more intimate than that of the head. Yet at bottom the connection
of the two is so far-reaching that if we reflect deeply upon the
matter we will arrive at the conclusion that memory in general
requires the support of a will as a connecting point, or rather
as a thread upon which the memories can range themselves,
and which holds them firmly together, or that the will is, as it
were, the ground to which the individual memories cleave, and
without which they could not last; and that therefore in a pure
intelligence, i.e., in a merely knowing and absolutely will-less
being, a memory cannot well be conceived. Accordingly the
improvement of the memory under the spur of the ruling passion,
which has been shown above, is only the higher degree of that
which takes place in all retention and recollection; for its basis
and condition is always the will. Thus in all this also it becomes
clear how very much more essential to us the will is than the
intellect. The following facts may also serve to confirm this.

The intellect often obeys the will; for example, if we wish
to remember something, and after some effort succeed; so also
if we wish now to ponder something carefully and deliberately,
and in many such cases. Sometimes, again, the intellect refuses
to obey the will; for example, if we try in vain to fix our
minds upon something, or if we call in vain upon the memory
for something that was intrusted to it. The anger of the will
against the intellect on such occasions makes its relation to it
and the difference of the two very plain. Indeed the intellect,
vexed by this anger, sometimes officiously brings what was
asked of it hours afterwards, or even the following morning,
quite unexpectedly and unseasonably. On the other hand, the
will never really obeys the intellect; but the latter is only the
ministerial council of that sovereign; it presents all kinds of
things to the will, which then selects what is in conformity427
with its nature, though in doing so it determines itself with
necessity, because this nature is unchangeable and the motives
now lie before it. Hence no system of ethics is possible which
moulds and improves the will itself. For all teaching only affects
knowledge, and knowledge never determines the will itself, i.e.,
the fundamental character of willing, but only its application to
the circumstances present. Rectified knowledge can only modify
conduct so far as it proves more exactly and judges more correctly
what objects of the will's choice are within its reach; so that the
will now measures its relation to things more correctly, sees more
clearly what it desires, and consequently is less subject to error
in its choice. But over the will itself, over the main tendency or
fundamental maxim of it, the intellect has no power. To believe
that knowledge really and fundamentally determines the will is
like believing that the lantern which a man carries by night is the
primum mobile of his steps. Whoever, taught by experience or the
admonitions of others, knows and laments a fundamental fault of
his character, firmly and honestly forms the intention to reform
and give it up; but in spite of this, on the first opportunity, the
fault receives free course. New repentance, new intentions, new
transgressions. When this has been gone through several times he
becomes conscious that he cannot improve himself, that the fault
lies in his nature and personality, indeed is one with this. Now
he will blame and curse his nature and personality, will have a
painful feeling, which may rise to anguish of consciousness, but
to change these he is not able. Here we see that which condemns
and that which is condemned distinctly separate: we see the
former as a merely theoretical faculty, picturing and presenting
the praiseworthy, and therefore desirable, course of life, but the
other as something real and unchangeably present, going quite
a different way in spite of the former: and then again the first
remaining behind with impotent lamentations over the nature of
the other, with which, through this very distress, it again identifies
itself. Will and intellect here separate very distinctly. 

But here the will shows itself as the stronger, the invincible, unchangeable,
primitive, and at the same time as the essential thing in question,
for the intellect deplores its errors, and finds no comfort in the
correctness of the knowledge, as its own function. Thus the
intellect shows itself entirely secondary, as the spectator of the
deeds of another, which it accompanies with impotent praise
and blame, and also as determinable from without, because it
learns from experience, weighs and alters its precepts. Special
illustrations of this subject will be found in the “Parerga,” vol.
ii. § 118 (second ed., § 119.) Accordingly, a comparison of our
manner of thinking at different periods of our life will present
a strange mixture of permanence and changeableness. On the
one hand, the moral tendency of the man in his prime and the
old man is still the same as was that of the boy; on the other
hand, much has become so strange to him that he no longer
knows himself, and wonders how he ever could have done or
said this and that. In the first half of life to-day for the most part
laughs at yesterday, indeed looks down on it with contempt; in
the second half, on the contrary, it more and more looks back
at it with envy. But on closer examination it will be found that
the changeable element was the intellect, with its functions of
insight and knowledge, which, daily appropriating new material
from without, presents a constantly changing system of thought,
while, besides this, it itself rises and sinks with the growth and
decay of the organism. The will, on the contrary, the basis of
this, thus the inclinations, passions, and emotions, the character,
shows itself as what is unalterable in consciousness. Yet we have
to take account of the modifications that depend upon physical
capacities for enjoyment, and hence upon age. Thus, for example,
the eagerness for sensuous pleasure will show itself in childhood
as a love of dainties, in youth and manhood as the tendency to
sensuality, and in old age again as a love of dainties.
7. If, as is generally assumed, the will proceeded from
knowledge, as its result or product, then where there is much will429
there would necessarily also be much knowledge, insight, and
understanding. This, however, is absolutely not the case; rather,
we find in many men a strong, i.e., decided, resolute, persistent,
unbending, wayward, and vehement will, combined with a very
weak and incapable understanding, so that every one who has
to do with them is thrown into despair, for their will remains
inaccessible to all reasons and ideas, and is not to be got at, so
that it is hidden, as it were, in a sack, out of which it wills blindly.
Brutes have often violent, often stubborn wills, but yet very little
understanding. Finally, plants only will without any knowledge
at all.

If willing sprang merely from knowledge, our anger would
necessarily be in every case exactly proportionate to the occasion,
or at least to our relation to it, for it would be nothing more than
the result of the present knowledge. This, however, is rarely the
case; rather, anger generally goes far beyond the occasion. Our
fury and rage, the furor brevis, often upon small occasions, and
without error regarding them, is like the raging of an evil spirit
which, having been shut up, only waits its opportunity to dare to
break loose, and now rejoices that it has found it. This could not
be the case if the foundation of our nature were a knower, and
willing were merely a result of knowledge; for how came there
into the result what did not lie in the elements? The conclusion
cannot contain more than the premisses. Thus here also the will
shows itself as of a nature quite different from knowledge, which
only serves it for communication with the external world, but
then the will follows the laws of its own nature without taking
from the intellect anything but the occasion.

The intellect, as the mere tool of the will, is as different from
it as the hammer from the smith. So long as in a conversation the
intellect alone is active it remains cold. It is almost as if the man
himself were not present. Moreover, he cannot then, properly
speaking, compromise himself, but at the most can make himself
ridiculous. Only when the will comes into play is the man really
[443]430
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
present: now he becomes warm, nay, it often happens, hot. It is
always the will to which we ascribe the warmth of life; on the
other hand, we say the cold understanding, or to investigate a
thing coolly, i.e., to think without being influenced by the will.
If we attempt to reverse the relation, and to regard the will as the
tool of the intellect, it is as if we made the smith the tool of the
hammer.
[444]
Nothing is more provoking, when we are arguing against
a man with reasons and explanations, and taking all pains to
convince him, under the impression that we have only to do
with his understanding, than to discover at last that he will
not understand; that thus we had to do with his will, which
shuts itself up against the truth and brings into the field wilful
misunderstandings, chicaneries, and sophisms in order to intrench
itself behind its understanding and its pretended want of insight.
Then he is certainly not to be got at, for reasons and proofs applied
against the will are like the blows of a phantom produced by
mirrors against a solid body. Hence the saying so often repeated,
“Stat pro ratione voluntas.” Sufficient evidence of what has been
said is afforded by ordinary life. But unfortunately proofs of it
are also to be found on the path of the sciences. The recognition
of the most important truths, of the rarest achievements, will be
looked for in vain from those who have an interest in preventing
them from being accepted, an interest which either springs from
the fact that such truths contradict what they themselves daily
teach, or else from this, that they dare not make use of them and
teach them; or if all this be not the case they will not accept
them, because the watchword of mediocrity will always be, Si
quelqu'un excelle parmi nous, qu'il aille exceller ailleurs, as
Helvetius has admirably rendered the saying of the Ephesian in
the fifth book of Cicero's “Tusculanæ” (c. 36), or as a saying
of the Abyssinian Fit Arari puts it, “Among quartzes adamant
is outlawed.” Thus whoever expects from this always numerous
band a just estimation of what he has done will find himself very431
much deceived, and perhaps for a while he will not be able to
understand their behaviour, till at last he finds out that while he
applied himself to knowledge he had to do with the will, thus
is precisely in the position described above, nay, is really like a
man who brings his case before a court the judges of which have
all been bribed. Yet in particular cases he will receive the fullest
proof that their will and not their insight opposed him, when one
or other of them makes up his mind to plagiarism. Then he will
see with astonishment what good judges they are, what correct
perception of the merit of others they have, and how well they
know how to find out the best, like the sparrows, who never miss
the ripest cherries.
The counterpart of the victorious resistance of the will to
knowledge here set forth appears if in expounding our reasons
and proofs we have the will of those addressed with us. Then all
are at once convinced, all arguments are telling, and the matter is
at once clear as the day. This is well known to popular speakers.
In the one case, as in the other, the will shows itself as that which
has original power, against which the intellect can do nothing.
8. But now we shall take into consideration the individual
qualities, thus excellences and faults of the will and character on
the one hand, and of the intellect on the other, in order to make
clear, in their relation to each other, and their relative worth, the
complete difference of the two fundamental faculties. History
and experience teach that the two appear quite independently
of each other. That the greatest excellence of mind will not
easily be found combined with equal excellence of character is
sufficiently explained by the extraordinary rarity of both, while
their opposites are everywhere the order of the day; hence we
also daily find the latter in union. However, we never infer a
good will from a superior mind, nor the latter from the former,
nor the opposite from the opposite, but every unprejudiced
person accepts them as perfectly distinct qualities, the presence
of which each for itself has to be learned from experience.
[445]432
[446]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
Great narrowness of mind may coexist with great goodness of
heart, and I do not believe Balthazar Gracian was right in saying
(Discreto, p. 406), “No ay simple, que no sea malicioso” (“There
is no simpleton who would not be malicious”), though he has
the Spanish proverb in his favour, “Nunca la necedad anduvo
sin malicia” (“Stupidity is never without malice”). Yet it may be
that many stupid persons become malicious for the same reason
as many hunchbacks, from bitterness on account of the neglect
they have suffered from nature, and because they think they
can occasionally make up for what they lack in understanding
through malicious cunning, seeking in this a brief triumph. From
this, by the way, it is also comprehensible why almost every
one easily becomes malicious in the presence of a very superior
mind. On the other hand, again, stupid people have very often
the reputation of special good-heartedness, which yet so seldom
proves to be the case that I could not help wondering how they
had gained it, till I was able to flatter myself that I had found the
key to it in what follows. Moved by a secret inclination, every
one likes best to choose for his more intimate intercourse some
one to whom he is a little superior in understanding, for only in
this case does he find himself at his ease, because, according to
Hobbes, “Omnis animi voluptas, omnisgue alacritas in eo sita
est, quod quis habeat, quibuscum conferens se, possit magnifice
sentire de se ipso” (De Cive, i. 5). For the same reason every one
avoids him who is superior to himself; wherefore Lichtenberg
quite rightly observes: “To certain men a man of mind is a
more odious production than the most pronounced rogue.” And
similarly Helvetius says: “Les gens médiocres ont un instinct
sûr et prompt, pour connaître et fuir les gens d'esprit.” And
Dr. Johnson assures us that “there is nothing by which a man
exasperates most people more than by displaying a superior
ability of brilliancy in conversation. They seem pleased at the
time, but their envy makes them curse him in their hearts”
(Boswell; aet. anno 74). In order to bring this truth, so universal433
and so carefully concealed, more relentlessly to light, I add the
expression of it by Merck, the celebrated friend of Goethe's youth,
from his story “Lindor:” “He possessed talents which were given
him by nature and acquired by himself through learning; and
thus it happened that in most society he left the worthy members
of it far behind.” If, in the moment of delight at the sight of an
extraordinary man, the public swallows these superiorities also,
without actually at once putting a bad construction upon them,
yet a certain impression of this phenomenon remains behind,
which, if it is often repeated, may on serious occasions have
disagreeable future consequences for him who is guilty of it.
Without any one consciously noting that on this occasion he was
insulted, no one is sorry to place himself tacitly in the way of
the advancement of this man. Thus on this account great mental
superiority isolates more than anything else, and makes one, at
least silently, hated. Now it is the opposite of this that makes
stupid people so generally liked; especially since many can only
find in them what, according to the law of their nature referred
to above, they must seek. Yet this the true reason of such an
inclination no one will confess to himself, still less to others; and
therefore, as a plausible pretext for it, will impute to those he has
selected a special goodness of heart, which, as we have said, is
in reality only very rarely and accidentally found in combination
with mental incapacity. Want of understanding is accordingly by
no means favourable or akin to goodness of character. But, on the
other hand, it cannot be asserted that great understanding is so;
nay, rather, no scoundrel has in general been without it. Indeed
even the highest intellectual eminence can coexist with the worst
moral depravity. An example of this is afforded by Bacon of
Verulam: “Ungrateful, filled with the lust of power, wicked and
base, he at last went so far that, as Lord Chancellor and the highest
judge of the realm, he frequently allowed himself to be bribed in
civil actions. Impeached before his peers, he confessed himself
guilty, was expelled by them from the House of Lords, and
[447]434
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
condemned to a fine of forty thousand pounds and imprisonment
in the Tower” (see the review of the latest edition of Bacon's
Works in the Edinburgh Review, August 1837). Hence also Pope
called him “the wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind” (“Essay
on Man,” iv. 282). A similar example is afforded by the historian
Guicciardini, of whom Rosini says in the Notizie Storiche, drawn
from good contemporary sources, which is given in his historical
romance “Luisa Strozzi:” “Da coloro, che pongono l'ingegno e
il sapere al di sopra di tutte le umane qualità, questo uomo sarà
riguardato come fra i più grandi del suo secolo: ma da quelli,
che reputano la virtù dovere andare innanzi a tutto, non potra
esecrarsi abbastanza la sua memoria. Esso fu il più crudele fra i
cittadini a perseguitare, uccidere e confinare,” &c.32
[448]
If now it is said of one man, “He has a good heart, though a bad
head,” but of another, “He has a very good head, yet a bad heart,”
every one feels that in the first case the praise far outweighs the
blame—in the other case the reverse. Answering to this, we see
that if some one has done a bad deed his friends and he himself
try to remove the guilt from the will to the intellect, and to give
out that faults of the heart were faults of the head; roguish
tricks they will call errors, will say they were merely want
of understanding, want of reflection, light-mindedness, folly;
nay, if need be, they will plead a paroxysm, momentary mental
aberration, and if a heavy crime is in question, even madness,
only in order to free the will from the guilt. And in the same
way, we ourselves, if we have caused a misfortune or injury,
will before others and ourselves willingly impeach our stultitia,
simply in order to escape the reproach of malitia. In the same
way, in the case of the equally unjust decision of the judge, the
32
By those who place mind and learning above all other human qualities
this man will be reckoned the greatest of his century. But by those who let
virtue take precedence of everything else his memory can never be execrated
enough. He was the cruelest of the citizens in persecuting, putting to death,
and banishing.435
difference, whether he has erred or been bribed, is so infinitely
great. All this sufficiently proves that the will alone is the real
and essential, the kernel of the man, and the intellect is merely
its tool, which may be constantly faulty without the will being
concerned. The accusation of want of understanding is, at the
moral judgment-seat, no accusation at all; on the contrary, it even
gives privileges. And so also, before the courts of the world, it is
everywhere sufficient to deliver a criminal from all punishment
that his guilt should be transferred from his will to his intellect,
by proving either unavoidable error or mental derangement, for
then it is of no more consequence than if hand or foot had slipped
against the will. I have fully discussed this in the appendix,
“Ueber die Intellektuelle Freiheit,” to my prize essay on the
freedom of the will, to which I refer to avoid repetition.
Everywhere those who are responsible for any piece of work
appeal, in the event of its turning out unsatisfactorily, to their
good intentions, of which there was no lack. Hereby they believe
that they secure the essential, that for which they are properly
answerable, and their true self; the inadequacy of their faculties,
on the other hand, they regard as the want of a suitable tool.
If a man is stupid, we excuse him by saying that he cannot
help it; but if we were to excuse a bad man on the same grounds
we would be laughed at. And yet the one, like the other, is
innate. This proves that the will is the man proper, the intellect
merely its tool.
Thus it is always only our willing that is regarded as depending
upon ourselves, i.e., as the expression of our true nature, and
for which we are therefore made responsible. Therefore it is
absurd and unjust if we are taken to task for our beliefs, thus for
our knowledge: for we are obliged to regard this as something
which, although it changes in us, is as little in our power as the
events of the external world. And here, also, it is clear that the
will alone is the inner and true nature of man; the intellect, on
the contrary, with its operations, which go on as regularly as the
[449]436
[450]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
external world, stands to the will in the relation of something
external to it, a mere tool.
High mental capacities have always been regarded as the
gift of nature or the gods; and on that account they have been
called Gaben, Begabung, ingenii dotes, gifts (a man highly
gifted), regarding them as something different from the man
himself, something that has fallen to his lot through favour.
No one, on the contrary, has ever taken this view of moral
excellences, although they also are innate; they have rather
always been regarded as something proceeding from the man
himself, essentially belonging to him, nay, constituting his very
self. But it follows now from this that the will is the true nature
of man; the intellect, on the other hand, is secondary, a tool, a
gift.
Answering to this, all religions promise a reward beyond life,
in eternity, for excellences of the will or heart, but none for
excellences of the head or understanding. Virtue expects its
reward in that world; prudence hopes for it in this; genius, again,
neither in this world nor in that; it is its own reward. Accordingly
the will is the eternal part, the intellect the temporal.
Connection, communion, intercourse among men is based, as
a rule, upon relations which concern the will, not upon such as
concern the intellect. The first kind of communion may be called
the material, the other the formal. Of the former kind are the
bonds of family and relationship, and further, all connections
that rest upon any common aim or interest, such as that of trade
or profession, of the corporation, the party, the faction, &c. In
these it merely amounts to a question of views, of aims; along
with which there may be the greatest diversity of intellectual
capacity and culture. Therefore not only can any one live in
peace and unity with any one else, but can act with him and be
allied to him for the common good of both. Marriage also is a
bond of the heart, not of the head. It is different, however, with
merely formal communion, which aims only at an exchange of437
thought; this demands a certain equality of intellectual capacity
and culture. Great differences in this respect place between man
and man an impassable gulf: such lies, for example, between a
man of great mind and a fool, between a scholar and a peasant,
between a courtier and a sailor. Natures as heterogeneous as
this have therefore trouble in making themselves intelligible so
long as it is a question of exchanging thoughts, ideas, and views.
Nevertheless close material friendship may exist between them,
and they may be faithful allies, conspirators, or men under mutual
pledges. For in all that concerns the will alone, which includes
friendship, enmity, honesty, fidelity, falseness, and treachery,
they are perfectly homogeneous, formed of the same clay, and
neither mind nor culture make any difference here; indeed here
the ignorant man often shames the scholar, the sailor the courtier.
For at the different grades of culture there are the same virtues and
vices, emotions and passions; and although somewhat modified
in their expression, they very soon mutually recognise each other
even in the most heterogeneous individuals, upon which the
similarly disposed agree and the opposed are at enmity.
Brilliant qualities of mind win admiration, but never affection;
this is reserved for the moral, the qualities of the character. Every
one will choose as his friend the honest, the good-natured, and
even the agreeable, complaisant man, who easily concurs, rather
than the merely able man. Indeed many will be preferred to the
latter, on account of insignificant, accidental, outward qualities
which just suit the inclination of another. Only the man who
has much mind himself will wish able men for his society; his
friendship, on the other hand, he will bestow with reference to
moral qualities; for upon this depends his really high appreciation
of a man in whom a single good trait of character conceals and
expiates great want of understanding. The known goodness of a
character makes us patient and yielding towards weaknesses of
understanding, as also towards the dulness and childishness of
age. A distinctly noble character along with the entire absence
[451]438
[452]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of intellectual excellence and culture presents itself as lacking
nothing; while, on the contrary, even the greatest mind, if affected
with important moral faults, will always appear blamable. For
as torches and fireworks become pale and insignificant in the
presence of the sun, so intellect, nay, genius, and also beauty,
are outshone and eclipsed by the goodness of the heart. When
this appears in a high degree it can make up for the want of those
qualities to such an extent that one is ashamed of having missed
them. Even the most limited understanding, and also grotesque
ugliness, whenever extraordinary goodness of heart declares
itself as accompanying them, become as it were transfigured,
outshone by a beauty of a higher kind, for now a wisdom speaks
out of them before which all other wisdom must be dumb. For
goodness of heart is a transcendent quality; it belongs to an order
of things that reaches beyond this life, and is incommensurable
with any other perfection. When it is present in a high degree it
makes the heart so large that it embraces the world, so that now
everything lies within it, no longer without; for it identifies all
natures with its own. It then extends to others also that boundless
indulgence which otherwise each one only bestows on himself.
Such a man is incapable of becoming angry; even if the malicious
mockery and sneers of others have drawn attention to his own
intellectual or physical faults, he only reproaches himself in his
heart for having been the occasion of such expressions, and
therefore, without doing violence to his own feelings, proceeds
to treat those persons in the kindest manner, confidently hoping
that they will turn from their error with regard to him, and
recognise themselves in him also. What is wit and genius against
this?—what is Bacon of Verulam?
Our estimation of our own selves leads to the same result as we
have here obtained by considering our estimation of others. How
different is the self-satisfaction which we experience in a moral
regard from that which we experience in an intellectual regard!
The former arises when, looking back on our conduct, we see that439
with great sacrifices we have practised fidelity and honesty, that
we have helped many, forgiven many, have behaved better to
others than they have behaved to us; so that we can say with King
Lear, “I am a man more sinned against than sinning;” and to its
fullest extent if perhaps some noble deed shines in our memory.
A deep seriousness will accompany the still peace which such a
review affords us; and if we see that others are inferior to us here,
this will not cause us any joy, but we will rather deplore it, and
sincerely wish that they were as we are. How entirely differently
does the knowledge of our intellectual superiority affect us!
Its ground bass is really the saying of Hobbes quoted above:
Omnis animi voluptas, omnisque alacritas in eo sita est, quad
quis habeat, quibuscum conferens se, possit magnifice sentire
de se ipso. Arrogant, triumphant vanity, proud, contemptuous
looking down on others, inordinate delight in the consciousness
of decided and considerable superiority, akin to pride of physical
advantages,—that is the result here. This opposition between
the two kinds of self-satisfaction shows that the one concerns
our true inner and eternal nature, the other a more external,
merely temporal, and indeed scarcely more than a mere physical
excellence. The intellect is in fact simply the function of the
brain; the will, on the contrary, is that whose function is the
whole man, according to his being and nature.
If, looking without us, we reflect that A 21¿Â 2Á±ÇÅÂ, !  ́μ
ÄμÇ1⁄2· 1⁄4±oÁ± (vita brevis, ars longa), and consider how the
greatest and most beautiful minds, often when they have scarcely
reached the summit of their power, and the greatest scholars,
when they have only just attained to a thorough knowledge of
their science, are snatched away by death, we are confirmed in
this, that the meaning and end of life is not intellectual but moral.
The complete difference between the mental and moral
qualities displays itself lastly in the fact that the intellect suffers
very important changes through time, while the will and character
remain untouched by it. The new-born child has as yet no use
[453]440
[454]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
of its understanding, but obtains it within the first two months
to the extent of perception and apprehension of the things in the
external world—a process which I have described more fully in
my essay, “Ueber das Sehn und die Farben,” p. 10 of the second
(and third) edition. The growth of reason to the point of speech,
and thereby of thought, follows this first and most important step
much more slowly, generally only in the third year; yet the early
childhood remains hopelessly abandoned to silliness and folly,
primarily because the brain still lacks physical completeness,
which, both as regards its size and texture, it only attains in the
seventh year. But then for its energetic activity there is still
wanting the antagonism of the genital system; it therefore only
begins with puberty. Through this, however, the intellect has
only attained to the capacity for its psychical improvement; this
itself can only be won by practice, experience, and instruction.
Thus as soon as the mind has escaped from the folly of childhood
it falls into the snares of innumerable errors, prejudices, and
chimeras, sometimes of the absurdest and crudest kind, which it
obstinately sticks to, till experience gradually removes them, and
many of them also are insensibly lost. All this takes many years
to happen, so that one grants it majority indeed soon after the
twentieth year, yet has placed full maturity, years of discretion,
not before the fortieth year. But while this psychical education,
resting upon help from without, is still in process of growth,
the inner physical energy of the brain already begins to sink
again. This has reached its real culminating point about the
thirtieth year, on account of its dependence upon the pressure
of blood and the effect of the pulsation upon the brain, and
through this again upon the predominance of the arterial over
the venous system, and the fresh tenderness of the brain fibre,
and also on account of the energy of the genital system. After
the thirty-fifth year a slight diminution of the physical energy
of the brain becomes noticeable, which, through the gradually
approaching predominance of the venous over the arterial system,441
and also through the increasing firmer and drier consistency of
the brain fibre, more and more takes place, and would be much
more observable if it were not that, on the other hand, the
psychical perfecting, through exercise, experience, increase of
knowledge, and acquired skill in the use of it, counteracts it—an
antagonism which fortunately lasts to an advanced age, for the
brain becomes more and more like a worn-out instrument. But
yet the diminution of the original energy of the intellect, resting
entirely upon organic conditions, continues, slowly indeed, but
unceasingly: the faculty of original conception, the imagination,
the plastic power, the memory, become noticeably weaker; and
so it goes on step by step downwards into old age, garrulous,
without memory, half-unconscious, and ultimately quite childish.
The will, on the contrary, is not affected by all this becoming,
this change and vicissitude, but is from beginning to end
unalterably the same. Willing does not require to be learned
like knowing, but succeeds perfectly at once. The new-born child
makes violent movements, rages, and cries; it wills in the most
vehement manner, though it does not yet know what it wills. For
the medium of motives, the intellect, is not yet fully developed.
The will is in darkness concerning the external world, in which
its objects lie, and now rages like a prisoner against the walls
and bars of his dungeon. But little by little it becomes light:
at once the fundamental traits of universal human willing, and,
at the same time, the individual modification of it here present,
announce themselves. The already appearing character shows
itself indeed at first in weak and uncertain outline, on account
of the defective service of the intellect, which has to present it
with motives; but to the attentive observer it soon declares its
complete presence, and in a short time it becomes unmistakable.
The characteristics appear which last through the whole of life;
the principal tendencies of the will, the easily excited emotions,
the ruling passion, declare themselves. Therefore the events at
school stand to those of the future life for the most part as the
[455]442
[456]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
dumb-show in “Hamlet” that precedes the play to be given at the
court, and foretells its content in the form of pantomime, stands
to the play itself. But it is by no means possible to prognosticate
in the same way the future intellectual capacities of the man from
those shown in the boy; rather as a rule the ingenia præcocia,
prodigies, turn out block-heads; genius, on the contrary, is
often in childhood of slow conception, and comprehends with
difficulty, just because it comprehends deeply. This is how it is
that every one relates laughing and without reserve the follies
and stupidities of his childhood. For example, Goethe, how he
threw all the kitchen crockery out of the window (Dichtung und
Wahrheit, vol. i. p. 7); for we know that all this only concerns
what changes. On the other hand, a prudent man will not favour
us with the bad features, the malicious or deceitful actions, of
his youth, for he feels that they also bear witness to his present
character. I have been told that when Gall, the phrenologist and
investigator of man, had to put himself into connection with a
man as yet unknown to him, he used to get him to speak about his
youthful years and actions, in order, if possible, to gather from
these the distinctive traits of his character; because this must
still be the same now. This is the reason why we are indifferent
to the follies and want of understanding of our youthful years,
and even look back on them with smiling satisfaction, while
the bad features of character even of that time, the ill-natured
actions and the misdeeds then committed exist even in old age as
inextinguishable reproaches, and trouble our consciences. Now,
just as the character appears complete, so it remains unaltered
to old age. The advance of age, which gradually consumes the
intellectual powers, leaves the moral qualities untouched. The
goodness of the heart still makes the old man honoured and
loved when his head already shows the weaknesses which are
the commencement of second childhood. Gentleness, patience,
honesty, veracity, disinterestedness, philanthropy, &c., remain
through the whole life, and are not lost through the weaknesses443
of old age; in every clear moment of the worn-out old man
they come forth undiminished, like the sun from the winter
clouds. And, on the other hand, malice, spite, avarice, hard-
heartedness, infidelity, egoism, and baseness of every kind also
remain undiminished to our latest years. We would not believe
but would laugh at any one who said to us, “In former years I was
a malicious rogue, but now I am an honest and noble-minded
man.” Therefore Sir Walter Scott, in the “Fortunes of Nigel,” has
shown very beautifully, in the case of the old usurer, how burning
avarice, egoism, and injustice are still in their full strength, like a
poisonous plant in autumn, when the intellect has already become
childish. The only alterations that take place in our inclinations
are those which result directly from the decrease of our physical
strength, and with it of our capacities for enjoyment. Thus
voluptuousness will make way for intemperance, the love of
splendour for avarice, and vanity for ambition; just like the man
who before he has a beard will wear a false one, and later, when
his own beard has become grey, will dye it brown. Thus while
all organic forces, muscular power, the senses, the memory,
wit, understanding, genius, wear themselves out, and in old age
become dull, the will alone remains undecayed and unaltered: the
strength and the tendency of willing remains the same. Indeed
in many points the will shows itself still more decided in age:
thus, in the clinging to life, which, it is well known, increases;
also in the firmness and persistency with regard to what it has
once embraced, in obstinacy; which is explicable from the fact
that the susceptibility of the intellect for other impressions, and
thereby the movement of the will by motives streaming in upon
it, has diminished. Hence the implacable nature of the anger and
hate of old persons—
“The young man's wrath is like light straw on fire,
But like red-hot steel is the old man's ire.”

—Old Ballad.
[458]
From all these considerations it becomes unmistakable to
the more penetrating glance that, while the intellect has to run
through a long series of gradual developments, but then, like
everything physical, must encounter decay, the will takes no
part in this, except so far as it has to contend at first with the
imperfection of its tool, the intellect, and, again, at last with
its worn-out condition, but itself appears perfect and remains
unchanged, not subject to the laws of time and of becoming and
passing away in it. Thus in this way it makes itself known as that
which is metaphysical, not itself belonging to the phenomenal
world.
9. The universally used and generally very well understood
expressions heart and head have sprung from a true feeling
of the fundamental distinction here in question; therefore they
are also apt and significant, and occur in all languages. Nec
cor nec caput habet, says Seneca of the Emperor Claudius
(Ludus de morte Claudii Cæsaris, c. 8).
The heart, this
primum mobile of the animal life, has with perfect justice
been chosen as the symbol, nay, the synonym, of the will,
as the primary kernel of our phenomenon, and denotes this in
opposition to the intellect, which is exactly identical with the
head. All that, in the widest sense, is matter of the will, as
wish, passion, joy, grief, goodness, wickedness, also what we are
wont to understand under “Gemüth,” and what Homer expresses
through Æ1»¿1⁄2 Ä¿Á, is attributed to the heart. Accordingly
we say: He has a bad heart;—his heart is in the thing;—it
comes from his heart;—it cut him to the heart;—it breaks his
heart;—his heart bleeds;—the heart leaps for joy;—who can see
the heart of man?—it is heart-rending, heart-crushing, heart-
breaking, heart-inspiring, heart-touching;—he is good-hearted,
hard-hearted, heartless, stout-hearted, faint-hearted, &c. &c.
Quite specially, however, love affairs are called affairs of the445
heart, affaires de cœur; because the sexual impulse is the focus
of the will, and the selection with reference to it constitutes the
chief concern of natural, human volition, the ground of which I
shall show in a full chapter supplementary to the fourth book.
Byron in “Don Juan,” c. xi. v. 34, is satirical about love being
to women an affair of the head instead of an affair of the heart.
On the other hand, the head denotes everything that is matter
of knowledge. Hence a man of head, a good head, a fine head,
a bad head, to lose one's head, to keep one's head uppermost,
&c. Heart and head signifies the whole man. But the head is
always the second, the derived; for it is not the centre but the
highest efflorescence of the body. When a hero dies his heart is
embalmed, not his brain; on the other hand, we like to preserve
the skull of the poet, the artist, and the philosopher. So Raphael's
skull was preserved in the Academia di S. Luca at Rome, though
it has lately been proved not to be genuine; in Stockholm in 1820
the skull of Descartes was sold by auction.33
A true feeling of the real relation between will, intellect,
and life is also expressed in the Latin language. The intellect
is mens, 1⁄2¿ÅÂ; the will again is animus, which comes from
anima, and this from ±1⁄2μ1⁄4É1⁄2. Anima is the life itself, the
breath, ÈÅÇ·; but animus is the living principle, and also the
will, the subject of inclinations, intentions, passions, emotions;
hence also est mihi animus,—fert animus,—for “I have a desire
to,” also animi causa, &c.; it is the Greek  ̧Å1⁄4¿Â, the German
“Gemüth,” thus the heart but not the head. Animi perturbatio
is an emotion; mentis perturbatio would signify insanity. The
predicate immortalis is attributed to animus, not to mens. All this
is the rule gathered from the great majority of passages; though
in the case of conceptions so nearly related it cannot but be that
the words are sometimes interchanged. Under ÈÅÇ· the Greeks
appear primarily and originally to have understood the vital force,
33

[459]446
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
the living principle, whereby at once arose the dim sense that
it must be something metaphysical, which consequently would
not be reached by death. Among other proofs of this are the
investigations of the relation between 1⁄2¿ÅÂ and ÈÅÇ· preserved
by Stobæus (Ecl., Lib. i. c. 51, § 7, 8).
[460]
10. Upon what depends the identity of the person? Not upon
the matter of the body; it is different after a few years. Not upon
its form, which changes as a whole and in all its parts; all but
the expression of the glance, by which, therefore, we still know
a man even after many years; which proves that in spite of all
changes time produces in him something in him remains quite
untouched by it. It is just this by which we recognise him even
after the longest intervals of time, and find the former man entire.
It is the same with ourselves, for, however old we become, we
yet feel within that we are entirely the same as we were when
we were young, nay, when we were still children. This, which
unaltered always remains quite the same, and does not grow old
along with us, is really the kernel of our nature, which does not
lie in time. It is assumed that the identity of the person rests
upon that of consciousness. But by this is understood merely
the connected recollection of the course of life; hence it is not
sufficient. We certainly know something more of our life than of
a novel we have formerly read, yet only very little. The principal
events, the interesting scenes, have impressed themselves upon
us; in the remainder a thousand events are forgotten for one that
has been retained. The older we become the more do things pass
by us without leaving any trace. Great age, illness, injury of
the brain, madness, may deprive us of memory altogether, but
the identity of the person is not thereby lost. It rests upon the
identical will and the unalterable character of the person. It is it
also which makes the expression of the glance unchangeable. In
the heart is the man, not in the head. It is true that, in consequence
of our relation to the external world, we are accustomed to regard
as our real self the subject of knowledge, the knowing I, which447
wearies in the evening, vanishes in sleep, and in the morning
shines brighter with renewed strength. This is, however, the
mere function of the brain, and not our own self. Our true
self, the kernel of our nature, is what is behind that, and really
knows nothing but willing and not willing, being content and
not content, with all the modifications of this, which are called
feelings, emotions, and passions. This is that which produces
the other, does not sleep with it when it sleeps, and in the same
way when it sinks in death remains uninjured. Everything, on
the contrary, that belongs to knowledge is exposed to oblivion;
even actions of moral significance can sometimes, after years, be
only imperfectly recalled, and we no longer know accurately and
in detail how we acted on a critical occasion. But the character
itself, to which the actions only testify, cannot be forgotten by us;
it is now still quite the same as then. The will itself, alone and for
itself, is permanent, for it alone is unchangeable, indestructible,
not growing old, not physical, but metaphysical, not belonging
to the phenomenal appearance, but to that itself which so appears.
How the identity of consciousness also, so far as it goes, depends
upon it I have shown above in chapter 15, so I need not dwell
upon it further here.
11. Aristotle says in passing, in his book on the comparison
of the desirable, “To live well is better than to live” (2μ»Ä1¿1⁄2
Ä¿Å ¶Ã1⁄2 Ä¿ μÅ ¶Ã1⁄2, Top. iii. 2). From this we might infer, by
double contraposition, not to live is better than to live badly.
This is also evident to the intellect; yet the great majority live
very badly rather than not at all. This clinging to life cannot
therefore have its ground in the object of life, since life, as was
shown in the fourth book, is really a constant suffering, or at
the least, as will be shown further on in the 28th chapter, a
business which does not cover its expenses; thus that clinging
to life can only be founded in the subject of it. But it is not
founded in the intellect, it is no result of reflection, and in general
is not a matter of choice; but this willing of life is something
[461]448
[462]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
that is taken for granted: it is a prius of the intellect itself. We
ourselves are the will to live, and therefore we must live, well
or ill. Only from the fact that this clinging to a life which is so
little worth to them is entirely a priori and not a posteriori can
we explain the excessive fear of death that dwells in every living
thing, which Rochefoucauld has expressed in his last reflection,
with rare frankness and naïveté, and upon which the effect of
all tragedies and heroic actions ultimately rest, for it would be
lost if we prized life only according to its objective worth. Upon
this inexpressible horror mortis is also founded the favourite
principle of all ordinary minds, that whosoever takes his own
life must be mad; yet not less the astonishment, mingled with
a certain admiration, which this action always excites even in
thinking minds, because it is so opposed to the nature of all living
beings that in a certain sense we are forced to admire him who is
able to perform it. For suicide proceeds from a purpose of the
intellect, but our will to live is a prius of the intellect. Thus this
consideration also, which will be fully discussed in chapter 28,
confirms the primacy of the will in self-consciousness.
12. On the other hand, nothing proves more clearly the
secondary, dependent, conditioned nature of the intellect than its
periodical intermittance. In deep sleep all knowing and forming
of ideas ceases. But the kernel of our nature, the metaphysical
part of it which the organic functions necessarily presuppose
as their primum mobile, must never pause if life is not to
cease, and, moreover, as something metaphysical and therefore
incorporeal, it requires no rest. Therefore the philosophers who
set up a soul as this metaphysical kernel, i.e., an originally and
essentially knowing being, see themselves forced to the assertion
that this soul is quite untiring in its perceiving and knowing,
therefore continues these even in deep sleep; only that we have
no recollection of this when we awake. The falseness of this
assertion, however, was easy to see whenever one had rejected
that soul in consequence of Kant's teaching. For sleep and449
waking prove to the unprejudiced mind in the clearest manner
that knowing is a secondary function and conditioned by the
organism, just like any other. Only the heart is untiring, because
its beating and the circulation of the blood are not directly
conditioned by nerves, but are just the original manifestation
of the will. Also all other physiological functions governed
merely by ganglionic nerves, which have only a very indirect and
distant connection with the brain, are carried on during sleep,
although the secretions take place more slowly; the beating of
the heart itself, on account of its dependence upon respiration,
which is conditioned by the cerebral system (medulla oblongata),
becomes with it a little slower. The stomach is perhaps most
active in sleep, which is to be attributed to its special consensus
with the now resting brain, which occasions mutual disturbances.
The brain alone, and with it knowing, pauses entirely in deep
sleep. For it is merely the minister of foreign affairs, as the
ganglion system is the minister of the interior. The brain, with
its function of knowing, is only a vedette established by the
will for its external ends, which, up in the watch-tower of the
head, looks round through the windows of the senses and marks
where mischief threatens and where advantages are to be looked
for, and in accordance with whose report the will decides. This
vedette, like every one engaged on active service, is then in
a condition of strain and effort, and therefore it is glad when,
after its watch is completed, it is again withdrawn, as every
watch gladly retires from its post. This withdrawal is going to
sleep, which is therefore so sweet and agreeable, and to which
we are so glad to yield; on the other hand, being roused from
sleep is unwelcome, because it recalls the vedette suddenly to
its post. One generally feels also after the beneficent systole
the reappearance of the difficult diastole, the reseparation of the
intellect from the will. A so-called soul, which was originally and
radically a knowing being, would, on the contrary, necessarily
feel on awaking like a fish put back into water. In sleep, when
[463]450
[464]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
merely the vegetative life is carried on, the will works only
according to its original and essential nature, undisturbed from
without, with no diminution of its power through the activity
of the brain and the exertion of knowing, which is the heaviest
organic function, yet for the organism merely a means, not an
end; therefore, in sleep the whole power of the will is directed to
the maintenance and, where it is necessary, the improvement of
the organism. Hence all healing, all favourable crises, take place
in sleep; for the vis naturæ medicatrix has free play only when
it is delivered from the burden of the function of knowledge.
The embryo which has still to form the body therefore sleeps
continuously, and the new-born child the greater part of its time.
In this sense Burdach (Physiologie, vol. iii. p. 484) quite rightly
declares sleep to be the original state.
With reference to the brain itself, I account to myself for
the necessity of sleep more fully through an hypothesis which
appears to have been first set up in Neumann's book, “Von den
Krankheiten des Menschen,” 1834, vol. 4, § 216. It is this,
that the nutrition of the brain, thus the renewal of its substance
from the blood, cannot go on while we are awake, because the
very eminent organic function of knowing and thinking would
be disturbed or put an end to by the low and material function of
nutrition. This explains the fact that sleep is not a purely negative
condition, a mere pausing of the activity of the brain, but also
shows a positive character. This makes itself known through the
circumstance that between sleep and waking there is no mere
difference of degree, but a fixed boundary, which, as soon as
sleep intervenes, declares itself in dreams which are completely
different from our immediately preceding thoughts. A further
proof of this is that when we have dreams which frighten us we
try in vain to cry out, or to ward off attacks, or to shake off sleep;
so that it is as if the connecting-link between the brain and the
motor nerves, or between the cerebrum and the cerebellum (as the
regulator of movements) were abolished; for the brain remains in451
its isolation and sleep holds us fast as with brazen claws. Finally,
the positive character of sleep can be seen in the fact that a certain
degree of strength is required for sleeping. Therefore too great
fatigue or natural weakness prevent us from seizing it, capere
somnum. This may be explained from the fact that the process
of nutrition must be introduced if sleep is to ensue: the brain
must, as it were, begin to feed. Moreover, the increased flow of
blood into the brain during sleep is explicable from the nutritive
process; and also the position of the arms laid together above
the head, which is instinctively assumed because it furthers this
process: also why children, so long as their brain is still growing,
require a great deal of sleep, while in old age, on the other hand,
when a certain atrophy of the brain, as of all the parts, takes
place, sleep is short; and finally why excessive sleep produces
a certain dulness of consciousness, the consequence of a certain
hypertrophy of the brain, which in the case of habitual excess of
sleep may become permanent and produce imbecility: ±1⁄21· o±1
À¿»ÅÂ QÀ1⁄2¿Â (noxæ est etiam multus somnus), Od. 15, 394. The
need of sleep is therefore directly proportionate to the intensity of
the brain-life, thus to the clearness of the consciousness. Those
animals whose brain-life is weak and dull sleep little and lightly;
for example, reptiles and fishes: and here I must remind the
reader that the winter sleep is sleep almost only in name, for it is
not an inaction of the brain alone, but of the whole organism, thus
a kind of apparent death. Animals of considerable intelligence
sleep deeply and long. Men also require more sleep the more
developed, both as regards quantity and quality, and the more
active their brain is. Montaigne relates of himself that he had
always been a long sleeper, that he had passed a large part of his
life in sleeping, and at an advanced age still slept from eight to
nine hours at a time (Liv. iii., chap. 13). Descartes also is reported
to have slept a great deal (Baillet, Vie de Descartes, 1693, p.
288). Kant allowed himself seven hours for sleep, but it was so
hard for him to do with this that he ordered his servant to force
[465]452
[466]
The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 2 of 3)
him against his will, and without listening to his remonstrances,
to get up at the set time (Jachmann, Immanuel Kant, p. 162).
For the more completely awake a man is, i.e., the clearer and
more lively his consciousness, the greater for him is the necessity
of sleep, thus the deeper and longer he sleeps. Accordingly
much thinking or hard brain-work increases the need of sleep.
That sustained muscular exertion also makes us sleepy is to be
explained from the fact that in this the brain continuously, by
means of the medulla oblongata, the spinal marrow, and the
motor nerves, imparts the stimulus to the muscles which affects
their irritability, and in this way it exhausts its strength. The
fatigue which we observe in the arms and legs has accordingly
its real seat in the brain; just as the pain which these parts
feel is really experienced in the brain; for it is connected with
the motor nerves, as with the nerves of sense. The muscles
which are not actuated from the brain—for example, those of
the heart—accordingly never tire. The same grounds explain the
fact that both during and after great muscular exertion we cannot
think acutely. That one has far less energy of mind in summer
than in winter is partly explicable from the fact that in summer
one sleeps less; for the deeper one has slept, the more completely
awake, the more lively, is one afterwards. This, however, must
not mislead us into extending sleep unduly, for then it loses
in intension, i.e., in deepness and soundness, what it gains in
extension; whereby it becomes mere loss of time. This is what
Goethe means when he says (in the second part of “Faust”) of
morning slumber: “Sleep is husk: throw it off.” Thus in general
the phenomenon of sleep most specially confirms the assertion
that consciousness, apprehension, knowing, thinking, is nothing
original in us, but a conditioned and secondary state. It is a
luxury of nature, and indeed its highest, which it can therefore
the less afford to pursue without interruption the higher the pitch
to which it has been brought. It is the product, the efflorescence
of the cerebral nerve-system, which is itself nourished like a453
parasite by the rest of the organism. This also agrees with what
is shown in our third book, that knowing is so much the purer
and more perfect the more it has freed and severed itself from the
will, whereby the purely objective, the æsthetic comprehension
appears. Just as an extract is so much the purer the more it
has been separated from that out of which it is extracted and
been cleared of all sediment. The opposite is shown by the will,
whose most immediate manifestation is the whole organic life,
and primarily the untiring heart.
This last consideration is related to the theme of the following
chapter, to which it therefore makes the transition: yet the
following observation belongs to it. In magnetic somnambulism
the consciousness is doubled: two trains of knowledge, each
connected in itself, but quite different from each other, arise;
the waking consciousness knows nothing of the somnambulent.
But the will retains in both the same character, and remains
throughout identical; it expresses in both the same inclinations
and aversions. For the function may be doubled, but not the true
nature.
