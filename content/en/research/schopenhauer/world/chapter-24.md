The great Kant has said that time, space, and
causality, with their entire constitution, and the possibility of all
their forms, are present in our consciousness quite independently
of the objects which appear in them, and which constitute their
content; 

or, in other words, they can be arrived at just as well
if we start from the subject as if we start from the object.[155]
Therefore, with equal accuracy, we may call them either forms
of intuition or perception of the subject, or qualities of the
object as object (with Kant, phenomenon), i.e., idea. 

We may
also regard these forms as the irreducible boundary between
object and subject. All objects must therefore exist in them, yet


<!-- 33 Cf. Ch. xxiii. of the Supplement, and also the Ch. on the physiology of
plants in my work “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” and the Ch. on physical
astronomy, which is of great importance with regard to the kernel of my
metaphysic. -->

the subject, independently of the phenomenal object, possesses
and surveys them completely. But if the objects appearing in
these forms are not to be empty phantoms, but are to have a
meaning, they must refer to something, must be the expression of
something which is not, like themselves, object, idea, a merely
relative existence for a subject, but which exists without such
dependence upon something which stands over against it as a
condition of its being, and independent of the forms of such
a thing, i.e., is not idea, but a thing-in-itself. Consequently it
may at least be asked: Are these ideas, these objects, something
more than or apart from the fact that they are ideas, objects of
the subject? And what would they be in this sense? What is
that other side of them which is toto genere different from idea?
What is the thing-in-itself? The will, we have answered, but for
the present I set that answer aside.

Whatever the thing-in-itself may be, Kant is right in his
conclusion that time, space, and causality (which we afterwards
found to be forms of the principle of sufficient reason, the
general expression of the forms of the phenomenon) are not its
properties, but come to it only after, and so far as, it has become
idea. That is, they belong only to its phenomenal existence, not
to itself. 

For since the subject fully understands and constructs
them out of itself, independently of all object, they must be
dependent upon existence as idea as such, not upon that which
becomes idea. 

They must be the form of the idea as such; but
not qualities of that which has assumed this form. They must
be already given with the mere antithesis of subject and object [156]
(not as concepts but as facts), and consequently they must be
only the more exact determination of the form of knowledge in
general, whose most universal determination is that antithesis
itself. Now, that in the phenomenon, in the object, which is in
its turn conditioned by time, space and causality, inasmuch as
it can only become idea by means of them, namely multiplicity,
through co-existence and succession, change and permanence 
through the law of causality, matter which can only become idea
under the presupposition of causality, and lastly, all that becomes
idea only by means of these,—all this, I say, as a whole, does
not in reality belong to that which appears, to that which has
passed into the form of idea, but belongs merely to this form
itself.

Conversely, that in the phenomenon which is not
conditioned through time, space and causality, and which cannot
be referred to them, nor explained in accordance with them, is
precisely that in which the thing manifested, the thing-in-itself,
directly reveals itself. It follows from this that the most complete
capacity for being known, that is to say, the greatest clearness,
distinctness, and susceptibility of exhaustive explanation, will
necessarily belong to that which pertains to knowledge as such,
and thus to the form of knowledge; but not to that which in
itself is not idea, not object, but which has become knowledge
only through entering these forms; in other words, has become
idea, object. Thus only that which depends entirely upon being
an object of knowledge, upon existing as idea in general and
as such (not upon that which becomes known, and has only
become idea), which therefore belongs without distinction to
everything that is known, and which, on that account, is found
just as well if we start from the subject as if we start from the
object,—this alone can afford us without reserve a sufficient,
exhaustive knowledge, a knowledge which is clear to the very
foundation. But this consists of nothing but those forms of all
phenomena of which we are conscious a priori, and which[157]
may be generally expressed as the principle of sufficient reason.
Now, the forms of this principle which occur in knowledge of
perception (with which alone we are here concerned) are time,
space, and causality. The whole of pure mathematics and pure
natural science a priori is based entirely upon these. Therefore it
is only in these sciences that knowledge finds no obscurity, does
not rest upon what is incomprehensible (groundless, i.e., will),
upon what cannot be further deduced. It is on this account that
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 171
Kant wanted, as we have said, to apply the name science specially
and even exclusively to these branches of knowledge together
with logic. But, on the other hand, these branches of knowledge
show us nothing more than mere connections, relations of one
idea to another, form devoid of all content. All content which
they receive, every phenomenon which fills these forms, contains
something which is no longer completely knowable in its whole
nature, something which can no longer be entirely explained
through something else, something then which is groundless,
through which consequently the knowledge loses its evidence
and ceases to be completely lucid. This that withholds itself
from investigation, however, is the thing-in-itself, is that which
is essentially not idea, not object of knowledge, but has only
become knowable by entering that form. The form is originally
foreign to it, and the thing-in-itself can never become entirely
one with it, can never be referred to mere form, and, since this
form is the principle of sufficient reason, can never be completely
explained. If therefore all mathematics affords us an exhaustive
knowledge of that which in the phenomena is quantity, position,
number, in a word, spatial and temporal relations; if all etiology
gives us a complete account of the regular conditions under
which phenomena, with all their determinations, appear in time
and space, but, with it all, teaches us nothing more than why
in each case this particular phenomenon must appear just at [158]
this time here, and at this place now; it is clear that with
their assistance we can never penetrate to the inner nature of
things. There always remains something which no explanation
can venture to attack, but which it always presupposes; the forces
of nature, the definite mode of operation of things, the quality and
character of every phenomenon, that which is without ground,
that which does not depend upon the form of the phenomenal, the
principle of sufficient reason, but is something to which this form
in itself is foreign, something which has yet entered this form,
and now appears according to its law, a law, however, which only determines the appearance, not that which appears, only the
how, not the what, only the form, not the content. Mechanics,
physics, and chemistry teach the rules and laws according to
which the forces of impenetrability, gravitation, rigidity, fluidity,
cohesion, elasticity, heat, light, affinity, magnetism, electricity,
&c., operate; that is to say, the law, the rule which these forces
observe whenever they enter time and space. 

But do what we
will, the forces themselves remain qualitates occultæ. For it is
just the thing-in-itself, which, because it is manifested, exhibits
these phenomena, which are entirely different from itself. In
its manifestation, indeed, it is completely subordinated to the
principle of sufficient reason as the form of the idea, but it can
never itself be referred to this form, and therefore cannot be fully
explained etiologically, can never be completely fathomed. It is
certainly perfectly comprehensible so far as it has assumed that
form, that is, so far as it is phenomenon, but its inner nature is not
in the least explained by the fact that it can thus be comprehended.
Therefore the more necessity any knowledge carries with it, the
more there is in it of that which cannot be otherwise thought or
presented in perception—as, for example, space-relations—the
clearer and more sufficing then it is, the less pure objective
content it has, or the less reality, properly so called, is given[159]
in it. And conversely, the more there is in it which must be
conceived as mere chance, and the more it impresses us as given
merely empirically, the more proper objectivity and true reality
is there in such knowledge, and at the same time, the more that is
inexplicable, that is, that cannot be deduced from anything else.
It is true that at all times an etiology, unmindful of its real aim,
has striven to reduce all organised life to chemism or electricity;
all chemism, that is to say quality, again to mechanism (action
determined by the shape of the atom), this again sometimes to
the object of phoronomy, i.e., the combination of time and space,
which makes motion possible, sometimes to the object of mere
geometry, i.e., position in space (much in the same way as we
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 173
rightly deduce the diminution of an effect from the square of
the distance, and the theory of the lever in a purely geometrical
manner): geometry may finally be reduced to arithmetic, which,
on account of its one dimension, is of all the forms of the principle
of sufficient reason, the most intelligible, comprehensible, and
completely susceptible of investigation. As instances of the
method generally indicated here, we may refer to the atoms of
Democritus, the vortex of Descartes, the mechanical physics of
Lesage, which towards the end of last century tried to explain
both chemical affinities and gravitation mechanically by impact
and pressure, as may be seen in detail in “Lucrèce Neutonien;”
Reil's form and combination as the cause of animal life, also
tends in this direction. Finally, the crude materialism which even
now in the middle of the nineteenth century has been served
up again under the ignorant delusion that it is original, belongs
distinctly to this class. It stupidly denies vital force, and first
of all tries to explain the phenomena of life from physical and
chemical forces, and those again from the mechanical effects
of the matter, position, form, and motion of imagined atoms,
and thus seeks to reduce all the forces of nature to action and [160]
reaction as its thing-in-itself. According to this teaching, light
is the mechanical vibration or undulation of an imaginary ether,
postulated for this end. This ether, if it reaches the eye, beats
rapidly upon the retina, and gives us the knowledge of colour.
Thus, for example, four hundred and eighty-three billion beats in
a second give red, and seven hundred and twenty-seven billion
beats in a second give violet. Upon this theory, persons who are
colour-blind must be those who are unable to count the beats,
must they not? Such crass, mechanical, clumsy, and certainly
knotty theories, which remind one of Democritus, are quite
worthy of those who, fifty years after the appearance of Goethe's
doctrine of colour, still believe in Newton's homogeneous light,
and are not ashamed to say so. They will find that what is
overlooked in the child (Democritus) will not be forgiven to the man. 

They might come to an ignominious
end; but then every one would slink away and pretend that he
never had anything to do with them. We shall soon have to
speak again of this false reduction of the forces of nature to
each other; so much for the present. Supposing this theory were
possible, all would certainly be explained and established and
finally reduced to an arithmetical problem, which would then be
the holiest thing in the temple of wisdom, to which the principle
of sufficient reason would at last have happily conducted us. But
all content of the phenomenon would have disappeared, and the
mere form would remain. The “what appears” would be referred
to the “how it appears,” and this “how” would be what is a priori
knowable, therefore entirely dependent on the subject, therefore
only for the subject, therefore, lastly, mere phantom, idea and
form of idea, through and through: no thing-in-itself could be
demanded. Supposing, then, that this were possible, the whole
world would be derived from the subject, and in fact, that would
be accomplished which Fichte wanted to seem to accomplish by[161]
his empty bombast. But it is not possible: phantasies, sophisms,
castles in the air, have been constructed in this way, but science
never. The many and multifarious phenomena in nature have
been successfully referred to particular original forces, and as
often as this has been done, a real advance has been made.
Several forces and qualities, which were at first regarded as
different, have been derived from each other, and thus their
number has been curtailed. (For example, magnetism from
electricity.) Etiology will have reached its goal when it has
recognised and exhibited as such all the original forces of nature,
and established their mode of operation, i.e., the law according to
which, under the guidance of causality, their phenomena appear
in time and space, and determine their position with regard to
each other. But certain original forces will always remain over;
there will always remain as an insoluble residuum a content of
phenomena which cannot be referred to their form, and thus cannot be explained from something else in accordance with the
principle of sufficient reason. For in everything in nature there is
something of which no ground can ever be assigned, of which no
explanation is possible, and no ulterior cause is to be sought. This
is the specific nature of its action, i.e., the nature of its existence,
its being. Of each particular effect of the thing a cause may be
certainly indicated, from which it follows that it must act just at
this time and in this place; but no cause can ever be found from
which it follows that a thing acts in general, and precisely in the
way it does. 

If it has no other qualities, if it is merely a mote in a
sunbeam, it yet exhibits this unfathomable something, at least as
weight and impenetrability. But this, I say, is to the mote what
his will is to a man; and, like the human will, it is, according
to its inner nature, not subject to explanation; nay, more—it is
in itself identical with this will. It is true that a motive may be
given for every manifestation of will, for every act of will at [162]
a particular time and in a particular place, upon which it must
necessarily follow, under the presupposition of the character of
the man. But no reason can ever be given that the man has this
character; that he wills at all; that, of several motives, just this
one and no other, or indeed that any motive at all, moves his
will. That which in the case of man is the unfathomable character
which is presupposed in every explanation of his actions from
motives is, in the case of every unorganised body, its definitive
quality—the mode of its action, the manifestations of which are
occasioned by impressions from without, while it itself, on the
contrary, is determined by nothing outside itself, and thus is also
inexplicable. Its particular manifestations, through which alone
it becomes visible, are subordinated to the principle of sufficient
reason; it itself is groundless. This was in substance rightly
understood by the schoolmen, who called it forma substantialis.
(Cf. Suarez, Disput. Metaph., disp. xv. sect. 1.)
It is a greater and a commoner error that the phenomena
which we best understand are those which are of most frequent
176 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
occurrence, and which are most universal and simple; for, on
the contrary, these are just the phenomena that we are most
accustomed to see about us, and to be ignorant of. It is just as
inexplicable to us that a stone should fall to the earth as that an
animal should move itself. It has been supposed, as we have
remarked above, that, starting from the most universal forces of
nature (gravitation, cohesion, impenetrability), it was possible
to explain from them the rarer forces, which only operate under
a combination of circumstances (for example, chemical quality,
electricity, magnetism), and, lastly, from these to understand
the organism and the life of animals, and even the nature of
human knowing and willing. Men resigned themselves without
a word to starting from mere qualitates occultæ, the elucidation
of which was entirely given up, for they intended to build upon[163]
them, not to investigate them. Such an intention cannot, as we
have already said, be carried out. But apart from this, such
structures would always stand in the air. What is the use of
explanations which ultimately refer us to something which is
quite as unknown as the problem with which we started? Do we
in the end understand more of the inner nature of these universal
natural forces than of the inner nature of an animal? Is not the
one as much a sealed book to us as the other? Unfathomable
because it is without ground, because it is the content, that which
the phenomenon is, and which can never be referred to the form,
to the how, to the principle of sufficient reason. But we, who
have in view not etiology but philosophy, that is, not relative but
unconditioned knowledge of the real nature of the world, take
the opposite course, and start from that which is immediately
and most completely known to us, and fully and entirely trusted
by us—that which lies nearest to us, in order to understand
that which is known to us only at a distance, one-sidedly and
indirectly. 

From the most powerful, most significant, and most
distinct phenomenon we seek to arrive at an understanding of
those that are less complete and weaker. With the exception of my own body, all things are known to me only on one side, that
of the idea. Their inner nature remains hidden from me and a
profound secret, even if I know all the causes from which their
changes follow. Only by comparison with that which goes on in
me if my body performs an action when I am influenced by a
motive—only by comparison, I say, with what is the inner nature
of my own changes determined by external reasons, can I obtain
insight into the way in which these lifeless bodies change under
the influence of causes, and so understand what is their inner
nature. For the knowledge of the causes of the manifestation of
this inner nature affords me merely the rule of its appearance in
time and space, and nothing more. I can make this comparison
because my body is the only object of which I know not merely [164]
the one side, that of the idea, but also the other side which
is called will. 

Thus, instead of believing that I would better
understand my own organisation, and then my own knowing and
willing, and my movements following upon motives, if I could
only refer them to movements due to electrical, chemical, and
mechanical causes, I must, seeing that I seek philosophy and not
etiology, learn to understand from my own movements following
upon motives the inner nature of the simplest and commonest
movements of an unorganised body which I see following upon
causes. I must recognise the inscrutable forces which manifest
themselves in all natural bodies as identical in kind with that
which in me is the will, and as differing from it only in degree.
That is to say, the fourth class of ideas given in the Essay on the
Principle of Sufficient Reason must be the key to the knowledge
of the inner nature of the first class, and by means of the law of
motivation I must come to understand the inner meaning of the
law of causation.
Spinoza (Epist. 62) says that if a stone which has been
projected through the air had consciousness, it would believe
that it was moving of its own will. I add to this only that the
stone would be right. The impulse given it is for the stone what
178 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
the motive is for me, and what in the case of the stone appears
as cohesion, gravitation, rigidity, is in its inner nature the same
as that which I recognise in myself as will, and what the stone
also, if knowledge were given to it, would recognise as will.
In the passage referred to, Spinoza had in view the necessity
with which the stone flies, and he rightly desires to transfer this
necessity to that of the particular act of will of a person. I, on
the other hand, consider the inner being, which alone imparts
meaning and validity to all real necessity (i.e., effect following
upon a cause) as its presupposition. In the case of men this is
called character; in the case of a stone it is called quality, but it is
the same in both. When it is immediately known it is called will.[165]
In the stone it has the weakest, and in man the strongest degree
of visibility, of objectivity. St. Augustine recognises, with a
true instinct, this identity of the tendencies of all things with our
own willing, and I cannot refrain from quoting his naïve account
of the matter:—“Si pecora essemus, carnalem vitam et quod
secundum sensum ejusdem est amaremus, idque esset sufficiens
bonum nostrum, et secundum hoc si esset nobis bene, nihil aliud
quæreremus. Item, si arbores essemus, nihil quidem sentientes
motu amare possemus: verumtamen id quasi appetere videremur,
quo feracius essemus, uberiusque fructuosæ. Si essemus lapides,
aut fluctus, aut ventus, aut flamma, vel quid ejusmodi, sine ullo
quidem sensu atque vita, non tamen nobis deesset quasi quidam
nostrorum locorum atque ordinis appetitus. Nam velut amores
corporum momenta sunt ponderum, sive deorsum gravitate, sive
sursum levitate nitantur: ita enim corpus pondere, sicut animus
amore fertur quocunque fertur” (De Civ. Dei, xi. 28).
It ought further to be mentioned that Euler saw that the inner
nature of gravitation must ultimately be referred to an “inclination
and desire” (thus will) peculiar to material bodies (in the 68th
letter to the Princess). 

It is just this that makes him
averse to the conception of gravitation as it existed for Newton,
and he is inclined to try a modification of it in accordance with the earlier Cartesian theory, and so to derive gravitation from
the impact of an ether upon the bodies, as being “more rational
and more suitable for persons who like clear and intelligible
principles.” He wishes to banish attraction from physics as a
qualitas occulta. This is only in keeping with the dead view of
nature which prevailed at Euler's time as the correlative of the
immaterial soul. It is only worth noticing because of its bearing
upon the fundamental truth established by me, which even at
that time this fine intellect saw glimmering in the distance. He
hastened to turn in time, and then, in his anxiety at seeing all the [166]
prevalent fundamental views endangered, he sought safety in the
old and already exploded absurdities.
We know that multiplicity in general is necessarily conditioned
by space and time, and is only thinkable in them. In this respect
they are called the principium individuationis. But we have
found that space and time are forms of the principle of sufficient
reason. In this principle all our knowledge a priori is expressed,
but, as we showed above, this a priori knowledge, as such,
only applies to the knowableness of things, not to the things
themselves, i.e., it is only our form of knowledge, it is not a
property of the thing-in-itself. The thing-in-itself is, as such,
free from all forms of knowledge, even the most universal,
that of being an object for the subject. In other words, the
thing-in-itself is something altogether different from the idea.
If, now, this thing-in-itself is the will, as I believe I have fully
and convincingly proved it to be, then, regarded as such and
apart from its manifestation, it lies outside time and space, and
therefore knows no multiplicity, and is consequently one. Yet,
as I have said, it is not one in the sense in which an individual
or a concept is one, but as something to which the condition
of the possibility of multiplicity, the principium individuationis,
is foreign. The multiplicity of things in space and time, which
collectively constitute the objectification of will, does not affect
the will itself, which remains indivisible notwithstanding it. It is
180 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
not the case that, in some way or other, a smaller part of will is
in the stone and a larger part in the man, for the relation of part
and whole belongs exclusively to space, and has no longer any
meaning when we go beyond this form of intuition or perception.
The more and the less have application only to the phenomenon
of will, that is, its visibility, its objectification. Of this there
is a higher grade in the plant than in the stone; in the animal
a higher grade than in the plant: indeed, the passage of will
into visibility, its objectification, has grades as innumerable as[167]
exist between the dimmest twilight and the brightest sunshine,
the loudest sound and the faintest echo. We shall return later
to the consideration of these grades of visibility which belong
to the objectification of the will, to the reflection of its nature.
But as the grades of its objectification do not directly concern
the will itself, still less is it concerned by the multiplicity of
the phenomena of these different grades, i.e., the multitude of
individuals of each form, or the particular manifestations of each
force. For this multiplicity is directly conditioned by time and
space, into which the will itself never enters. The will reveals
itself as completely and as much in one oak as in millions. Their
number and multiplication in space and time has no meaning with
regard to it, but only with regard to the multiplicity of individuals
who know in space and time, and who are themselves multiplied
and dispersed in these. The multiplicity of these individuals itself
belongs not to the will, but only to its manifestation. We may
therefore say that if, per impossibile, a single real existence, even
the most insignificant, were to be entirely annihilated, the whole
world would necessarily perish with it. 

The great mystic Angelus
Silesius feels this when he says—

“I know God cannot live an instant without me,
He must give up the ghost if I should cease to be.”


Men have tried in various ways to bring the immeasurable
greatness of the material universe nearer to the comprehension of
us all, and then they have seized the opportunity to make edifying
remarks. They have referred perhaps to the relative smallness
of the earth, and indeed of man; or, on the contrary, they have
pointed out the greatness of the mind of this man who is so
insignificant—the mind that can solve, comprehend, and even
measure the greatness of the universe, and so forth. 

When I consider the vastness of the world, the most important point is this, that the thing-in-itself, whose
manifestation is the world—whatever else it may be—cannot
have its true self spread out and dispersed after this fashion in
boundless space, but that this endless extension belongs only to
its manifestation. The thing-in-itself, on the contrary, is present
entire and undivided in every object of nature and in every living
being. Therefore we lose nothing by standing still beside any
single individual thing, and true wisdom is not to be gained by
measuring out the boundless world, or, what would be more to
the purpose, by actually traversing endless space. It is rather to
be attained by the thorough investigation of any individual thing,
for thus we seek to arrive at a full knowledge and understanding
of its true and peculiar nature.

The subject which will therefore be fully considered in the
next book, and which has, doubtless, already presented itself to
the mind of every student of Plato, is, that these different grades
of the objectification of will which are manifested in innumerable
individuals, and exist as their unattained types or as the eternal
forms of things, not entering themselves into time and space,
which are the medium of individual things, but remaining fixed,
subject to no change, always being, never becoming, while the
particular things arise and pass away, always become and never
are,—that these grades of the objectification of will are, I say,
simply Plato's Ideas. I make this passing reference to the matter
here in order that I may be able in future to use the word Idea in this sense. In my writings, therefore, the word is always to be
understood in its true and original meaning given to it by Plato,
and has absolutely no reference to those abstract productions
of dogmatising scholastic reason, which Kant has inaptly and
illegitimately used this word to denote, though Plato had already
appropriated and used it most fitly. 

Idea is every definite and fixed grade of the objectification of will, so[169]
far as it is thing-in-itself, and therefore has no multiplicity. 

These
grades are related to individual things as their eternal forms or
prototypes. 

The shortest and most concise statement of this
famous Platonic doctrine is given us by Diogenes Laertes (iii.
12): 

<!-- “A †ª±ƒ…Ω ∆∑√π, μΩ ƒ√ ∆≈√μπ ƒ±¬ π¥μ±¬ √ƒ±Ω±π, ∫±∏±¿μ¡

notice; what it is needful to say about it will be found in the
Appendix.
