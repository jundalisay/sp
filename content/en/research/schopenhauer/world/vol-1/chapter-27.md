If, from the foregoing consideration of the forces of
nature and their phenomena, we have come to see clearly how
far an explanation from causes can go, and where it must stop if
it is not to degenerate into the vain attempt to reduce the content
of all phenomena to their mere form, in which case there would
ultimately remain nothing but form, we shall be able to settle in
general terms what is to be demanded of etiology as a whole.
It must seek out the causes of all phenomena in nature, i.e., the
circumstances under which they invariably appear. Then it must
refer the multitude of phenomena which have various forms in
various circumstances to what is active in every phenomenon, and
is presupposed in the cause,—original forces of nature. It must
correctly distinguish between a difference of the phenomenon
which arises from a difference of the force, and one which results
merely from a difference of the circumstances under which the
force expresses itself; and with equal care it must guard against
taking the expressions of one and the same force under different
circumstances for the manifestations of different forces, and
conversely against taking for manifestations of one and the[182]
same force what originally belongs to different forces. Now this
is the direct work of the faculty of judgment, and that is why
so few men are capable of increasing our insight in physics,
while all are able to enlarge experience. Indolence and ignorance
make us disposed to appeal too soon to original forces. This
is exemplified with an exaggeration that savours of irony in the
entities and quidities of the schoolmen. Nothing is further from
my desire than to favour their resuscitation. We have just as little
right to appeal to the objectification of will, instead of giving
a physical explanation, as we have to appeal to the creative
power of God. For physics demands causes, and the will is
never a cause. Its whole relation to the phenomenon is not in
accordance with the principle of sufficient reason. But that which
in itself is the will exists in another aspect as idea; that is to say, is phenomenon. As such, it obeys the laws which constitute
the form of the phenomenon. 

Every movement, for example,
although it is always a manifestation of will, must yet have a
cause from which it is to be explained in relation to a particular
time and space; that is, not in general in its inner nature, but
as a particular phenomenon. In the case of the stone, this is
a mechanical cause; in that of the movement of a man, it is a
motive; but in no case can it be wanting. On the other hand, the
universal common nature of all phenomena of one particular kind,
that which must be presupposed if the explanation from causes
is to have any sense and meaning, is the general force of nature,
which, in physics, must remain a qualitas occulta, because with
it the etiological explanation ends and the metaphysical begins.
But the chain of causes and effects is never broken by an original
force to which it has been necessary to appeal. 

It does not run
back to such a force as if it were its first link, but the nearest link,
as well as the remotest, presupposes the original force, and could
otherwise explain nothing. A series of causes and effects may [183]
be the manifestation of the most different kinds of forces, whose
successive visible appearances are conducted through it, as I
have illustrated above by the example of a metal machine. But
the difference of these original forces, which cannot be referred
to each other, by no means breaks the unity of that chain of
causes, and the connection between all its links. The etiology and
the philosophy of nature never do violence to each other, but go
hand in hand, regarding the same object from different points of
view. Etiology gives an account of the causes which necessarily
produce the particular phenomenon to be explained. It exhibits, as
the foundation of all its explanations, the universal forces which
are active in all these causes and effects. 

It accurately defines,
enumerates, and distinguishes these forces, and then indicates all
the different effects in which each force appears, regulated by
the difference of the circumstances, always in accordance with
its own peculiar character, which it discloses in obedience to an invariable rule, called a law of nature. When all this has been
thoroughly accomplished by physics in every particular, it will
be complete, and its work will be done. There will then remain
no unknown force in unorganised nature, nor any effect, which
has not been proved to be the manifestation of one of these forces
under definite circumstances, in accordance with a law of nature.
Yet a law of nature remains merely the observed rule according
to which nature invariably proceeds whenever certain definite
circumstances occur. Therefore a law of nature may be defined
as a fact expressed generally—un fait généralisé—and thus a
complete enumeration of all the laws of nature would only be a
complete register of facts. 

The consideration of nature as a whole
is thus completed in morphology, which enumerates, compares,
and arranges all the enduring forms of organised nature. Of the
causes of the appearance of the individual creature it has little
to say, for in all cases this is procreation (the theory of which[184]
is a separate matter), and in rare cases the generatio æquivoca.
But to this last belongs, strictly speaking, the manner in which
all the lower grades of the objectification of will, that is to say,
physical and chemical phenomena, appear as individual, and it is
precisely the task of etiology to point out the conditions of this
appearance. Philosophy, on the other hand, concerns itself only
with the universal, in nature as everywhere else. 

The original
forces themselves are here its object, and it recognises in them
the different grades of the objectivity of will, which is the inner
nature, the “in-itself” of this world; and when it regards the world
apart from will, it explains it as merely the idea of the subject.

But if etiology, instead of preparing the way for philosophy, and
supplying its doctrines with practical application by means of
instances, supposes that its aim is rather to deny the existence
of all original forces, except perhaps one, the most general,
for example, impenetrability, which it imagines it thoroughly
understands, and consequently seeks forcibly to refer all the
others to it—it forsakes its own province and can only give us error instead of truth. The content of nature is supplanted
by its form, everything is ascribed to the circumstances which
work from without, and nothing to the inner nature of the thing.

If it were possible to succeed by this method, a problem in
arithmetic would ultimately, as we have already remarked, solve
the riddle of the universe. But this is the method adopted by those,
referred to above, who think that all physiological effects ought to
be reduced to form and combination, this, perhaps, to electricity,
and this again to chemism, and chemism to mechanism. The
mistake of Descartes, for example, and of all the Atomists, was
of this last description. They referred the movements of the
globe to the impact of a fluid, and the qualities of matter to the
connection and form of the atoms, and hence they laboured to
explain all the phenomena of nature as merely manifestations
of impenetrability and cohesion. Although this has been given [185]
up, precisely the same error is committed in our own day
by the electrical, chemical, and mechanical physiologists, who
obstinately attempt to explain the whole of life and all the
functions of the organism from “form and combination.” In
Meckel's “Archiv für Physiologie” (1820, vol. v. p. 185) we
still find it stated that the aim of physiological explanation is
the reduction of organic life to the universal forces with which
physics deals. Lamarck also, in his “Philosophie Zoologique,”
explains life as merely the effect of warmth and electricity: le
calorique et la matière électrique suffisent parfaitement pour
composer ensemble cette cause essentielle de la vie (p. 16).
According to this, warmth and electricity would be the “thing-
in-itself,” and the world of animals and plants its phenomenal
appearance. The absurdity of this opinion becomes glaringly
apparent at the 306th and following pages of that work. It is well
known that all these opinions, that have been so often refuted,
have reappeared quite recently with renewed confidence. 

If
we carefully examine the foundation of these views, we shall
find that they ultimately involve the presupposition that the organism is merely an aggregate of phenomena of physical,
chemical, and mechanical forces, which have come together
here by chance, and produced the organism as a freak of nature
without further significance. The organism of an animal or of a
human being would therefore be, if considered philosophically,
not the exhibition of a special Idea, that is, not itself immediate
objectivity of the will at a definite higher grade, but in it would
appear only those Ideas which objectify the will in electricity,
in chemism, and in mechanism. Thus the organism would be
as fortuitously constructed by the concurrence of these forces as
the forms of men and beasts in clouds and stalactites, and would
therefore in itself be no more interesting than they are. However,
we shall see immediately how far the application of physical and
chemical modes of explanation to the organism may yet, within[186]
certain limits, be allowable and useful; for I shall explain that
the vital force certainly avails itself of and uses the forces of
unorganised nature; yet these forces no more constitute the vital
force than a hammer and anvil make a blacksmith. Therefore even
the most simple example of plant life can never be explained from
these forces by any theory of capillary attraction and endosmose,
much less animal life. The following observations will prepare
the way for this somewhat difficult discussion.

It follows from all that has been said that it is certainly an error
on the part of natural science to seek to refer the higher grades of
the objectification of will to the lower; for the failure to recognise,
or the denial of, original and self-existing forces of nature is just
as wrong as the groundless assumption of special forces when
what occurs is merely a peculiar kind of manifestation of what
is already known. Thus Kant rightly says that it would be
absurd to hope for a blade of grass from a Newton, that is,
from one who reduced the blade of grass to the manifestations of
physical and chemical forces, of which it was the chance product,
and therefore a mere freak of nature, in which no special Idea
appeared, i.e., the will did not directly reveal itself in it in a higher and specific grade, but just as in the phenomena of unorganised
nature and by chance in this form. 

The schoolmen, who certainly
would not have allowed such a doctrine, would rightly have
said that it was a complete denial of the forma substantialis,
and a degradation of it to the forma accidentalis. For the forma
substantialis of Aristotle denotes exactly what I call the grade
of the objectification of will in a thing. On the other hand, it
is not to be overlooked that in all Ideas, that is, in all forces of
unorganised, and all forms of organised nature, it is one and the
same will that reveals itself, that is to say, which enters the form
of the idea and passes into objectivity. Its unity must therefore
be also recognisable through an inner relationship between all its phenomena. Now this reveals itself in the higher grades of
the objectification of will, where the whole phenomenon is more
distinct, thus in the vegetable and animal kingdoms, through
the universally prevailing analogy of all forms, the fundamental
type which recurs in all phenomena. This has, therefore, become
the guiding principle of the admirable zoological system which
was originated by the French in this century, and it is most
completely established in comparative anatomy as l'unité de
plan, l'uniformité de l'élément anatomique. 

To discover this
fundamental type has been the chief concern, or at any rate
the praiseworthy endeavour, of the natural philosophers of the
school of Schelling, who have in this respect considerable merit,
although in many cases their hunt after analogies in nature
degenerated into mere conceits. They have, however, rightly
shown that that general relationship and family likeness exists
also in the Ideas of unorganised nature; for example, between
electricity and magnetism, the identity of which was afterwards
established; between chemical attraction and gravitation, and so
forth. They specially called attention to the fact that polarity, that
is, the sundering of a force into two qualitatively different and
opposed activities striving after reunion, which also shows itself
for the most part in space as a dispersion in opposite directions, is a fundamental type of almost all the phenomena of nature, from
the magnet and the crystal to man himself. Yet this knowledge
has been current in China from the earliest times, in the doctrine
of opposition of Yin and Yang. Indeed, since all things in
the world are the objectification of one and the same will, and
therefore in their inner nature identical, it must not only be the
case that there is that unmistakable analogy between them, and
that in every phenomenon the trace, intimation, and plan of the
higher phenomenon that lies next to it in point of development[188]
shows itself, but also because all these forms belong to the world
as idea, it is indeed conceivable that even in the most universal
forms of the idea, in that peculiar framework of the phenomenal
world space and time, it may be possible to discern and establish
the fundamental type, intimation, and plan of what fills the forms.
It seems to have been a dim notion of this that was the origin of the
Cabala and all the mathematical philosophy of the Pythagoreans,
and also of the Chinese in Y-king. In the school of Schelling also,
to which we have already referred, we find, among their efforts
to bring to light the similarity among the phenomena of nature,
several attempts (though rather unfortunate ones) to deduce laws
of nature from the laws of pure space and time. However, one
can never tell to what extent a man of genius will realise both
endeavours.

Although the difference between phenomenon and thing-
in-itself is never lost sight of, and therefore the identity of the
will which objectifies itself in all Ideas can never (because it
has different grades of its objectification) be distorted to mean
identity of the particular Ideas themselves in which it appears,
so that, for example, chemical or electrical attraction can never
be reduced to the attraction of gravitation, although this inner
analogy is known, and the former may be regarded as, so to
speak, higher powers of the latter, just as little does the similarity
of the construction of all animals warrant us in mixing and
identifying the species and explaining the more developed as mere variations of the less developed; and although, finally,
the physiological functions are never to be reduced to chemical
or physical processes, yet, in justification of this procedure,
within certain limits, we may accept the following observations
as highly probable.

If several of the phenomena of will in the lower grades of
its objectification—that is, in unorganised nature—come into
conflict because each of them, under the guidance of causality, [189]
seeks to possess a given portion of matter, there arises from
the conflict the phenomenon of a higher Idea which prevails
over all the less developed phenomena previously there, yet in
such a way that it allows the essence of these to continue to
exist in a subordinate manner, in that it takes up into itself from
them something which is analogous to them. This process is
only intelligible from the identity of the will which manifests
itself in all the Ideas, and which is always striving after higher
objectification. We thus see, for example, in the hardening of
the bones, an unmistakable analogy to crystallisation, as the
force which originally had possession of the chalk, although
ossification is never to be reduced to crystallisation. The analogy
shows itself in a weaker degree in the flesh becoming firm. The
combination of humours in the animal body and secretion are
also analogous to chemical combination and separation. Indeed,
the laws of chemistry are still strongly operative in this case,
but subordinated, very much modified, and mastered by a higher
Idea; therefore mere chemical forces outside the organism will
never afford us such humours; but
“Encheiresin naturæ nennt es die Chemie,
Spottet ihrer selbst und weiss nicht wie.”


The more developed Idea resulting from this victory over
several lower Ideas or objectifications of will, gains an entirely
new character by taking up into itself from every Idea over which it has prevailed a strengthened analogy. The will objectifies itself
in a new, more distinct way. It originally appears in generatio
æquivoca; afterwards in assimilation to the given germ, organic
moisture, plant, animal, man. Thus from the strife of lower
phenomena the higher arise, swallowing them all up, but yet
realising in the higher grade the tendency of all the lower. Here,
then, already the law applies—Serpens nisi serpentem comederit
non fit draco.

I wish it had been possible for me to dispel by clearness of
explanation the obscurity which clings to the subject of these
thoughts; but I see very well that the reader's own consideration
of the matter must materially aid me if I am not to remain
uncomprehended or misunderstood. According to the view I
have expressed, the traces of chemical and physical modes of
operation will indeed be found in the organism, but it can never
be explained from them; because it is by no means a phenomenon
even accidentally brought about through the united actions of
such forces, but a higher Idea which has overcome these lower
ideas by subduing assimilation; for the one will which objectifies
itself in all Ideas always seeks the highest possible objectification,
and has therefore in this case given up the lower grades of its
manifestation after a conflict, in order to appear in a higher
grade, and one so much the more powerful. No victory without
conflict: since the higher Idea or objectification of will can
only appear through the conquest of the lower, it endures the
opposition of these lower Ideas, which, although brought into
subjection, still constantly strive to obtain an independent and
complete expression of their being. The magnet that has attracted
a piece of iron carries on a perpetual conflict with gravitation,
which, as the lower objectification of will, has a prior right to the
matter of the iron; and in this constant battle the magnet indeed
grows stronger, for the opposition excites it, as it were, to greater
effort. In the same way every manifestation of the will, including
that which expresses itself in the human organism, wages a
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 203
constant war against the many physical and chemical forces
which, as lower Ideas, have a prior right to that matter. Thus
the arm falls which for a while, overcoming gravity, we have
held stretched out; thus the pleasing sensation of health, which
proclaims the victory of the Idea of the self-conscious organism
over the physical and chemical laws, which originally governed
the humours of the body, is so often interrupted, and is indeed [191]
always accompanied by greater or less discomfort, which arises
from the resistance of these forces, and on account of which the
vegetative part of our life is constantly attended by slight pain.
Thus also digestion weakens all the animal functions, because it
requires the whole vital force to overcome the chemical forces
of nature by assimilation. Hence also in general the burden of
physical life, the necessity of sleep, and, finally, of death; for at
last these subdued forces of nature, assisted by circumstances,
win back from the organism, wearied even by the constant
victory, the matter it took from them, and attain to an unimpeded
expression of their being. We may therefore say that every
organism expresses the Idea of which it is the image, only after
we have subtracted the part of its force which is expended in
subduing the lower Ideas that strive with it for matter. This
seems to have been running in the mind of Jacob Böhm when he
says somewhere that all the bodies of men and animals, and even
all plants, are really half dead. According as the subjection in
the organism of these forces of nature, which express the lower
grades of the objectification of will, is more or less successful,
the more or the less completely does it attain to the expression of
its Idea; that is to say, the nearer it is to the ideal or the further
from it—the ideal of beauty in its species.

Thus everywhere in nature we see strife, conflict, and
alternation of victory, and in it we shall come to recognise more
distinctly that variance with itself which is essential to the will.
Every grade of the objectification of will fights for the matter,
the space, and the time of the others. The permanent matter must constantly change its form; for under the guidance of causality,
mechanical, physical, chemical, and organic phenomena, eagerly
striving to appear, wrest the matter from each other, for each
desires to reveal its own Idea. 

<!-- This strife may be followed
through the whole of nature; indeed nature exists only through
it: μπ ≥±¡ º∑ ∑Ω ƒø Ωμπ∫ø¬ μΩ ƒøπ¬ ¿¡±≥º±√πΩ, Ω ±Ω ∑Ω ¿±Ωƒ±,[192]
a¬ ∆∑√πΩ ïº¿μ¥ø∫ª∑¬; (nam si non inesset in rebus contentio,
unum omnia essent, ut ait Empedocles. Aris. Metaph., B. 5).  -->

Yet
this strife itself is only the revelation of that variance with itself
which is essential to the will. This universal conflict becomes
most distinctly visible in the animal kingdom. 

For animals have
the whole of the vegetable kingdom for their food, and even
within the animal kingdom every beast is the prey and the food
of another; that is, the matter in which its Idea expresses itself
must yield itself to the expression of another Idea, for each animal
can only maintain its existence by the constant destruction of
some other. Thus the will to live everywhere preys upon itself,
and in different forms is its own nourishment, till finally the
human race, because it subdues all the others, regards nature as a
manufactory for its use. Yet even the human race, as we shall see
in the Fourth Book, reveals in itself with most terrible distinctness
this conflict, this variance with itself of the will, and we find
homo homini lupus. Meanwhile we can recognise this strife, this
subjugation, just as well in the lower grades of the objectification
of will. 

Many insects (especially ichneumon-flies) lay their eggs
on the skin, and even in the body of the larvæ of other insects,
whose slow destruction is the first work of the newly hatched
brood. The young hydra, which grows like a bud out of the
old one, and afterwards separates itself from it, fights while it
is still joined to the old one for the prey that offers itself, so
that the one snatches it out of the mouth of the other (Trembley,
Polypod., ii. p. 110, and iii. p. 165). But the bulldog-ant of
Australia affords us the most extraordinary example of this kind;
for if it is cut in two, a battle begins between the head and the tail.

The head seizes the tail with its teeth, and the tail defends
itself bravely by stinging the head: the battle may last for half
an hour, until they die or are dragged away by other ants. This
contest takes place every time the experiment is tried. (From a letter by Howitt in the W. Journal, reprinted in Galignani's
Messenger, 17th November 1855.) On the banks of the Missouri
one sometimes sees a mighty oak the stem and branches of which
are so encircled, fettered, and interlaced by a gigantic wild vine,
that it withers as if choked. The same thing shows itself in the
lowest grades; for example, when water and carbon are changed
into vegetable sap, or vegetables or bread into blood by organic
assimilation; and so also in every case in which animal secretion
takes place, along with the restriction of chemical forces to a
subordinate mode of activity. This also occurs in unorganised
nature, when, for example, crystals in process of formation meet,
cross, and mutually disturb each other to such an extent that they
are unable to assume the pure crystalline form, so that almost
every cluster of crystals is an image of such a conflict of will
at this low grade of its objectification; or again, when a magnet
forces its magnetism upon iron, in order to express its Idea in
it; or when galvanism overcomes chemical affinity, decomposes
the closest combinations, and so entirely suspends the laws of
chemistry that the acid of a decomposed salt at the negative
pole must pass to the positive pole without combining with the
alkalies through which it goes on its way, or turning red the
litmus paper that touches it. 

On a large scale it shows itself in the
relation between the central body and the planet, for although the
planet is in absolute dependence, yet it always resists, just like the
chemical forces in the organism; hence arises the constant tension
between centripetal and centrifugal force, which keeps the globe
in motion, and is itself an example of that universal essential
conflict of the manifestation of will which we are considering.
For as every body must be regarded as the manifestation of a
will, and as will necessarily expresses itself as a struggle, the original condition of every world that is formed into a globe
cannot be rest, but motion, a striving forward in boundless space
without rest and without end. Neither the law of inertia nor that of causality is opposed to this: for as, according to the former,
matter as such is alike indifferent to rest and motion, its original
condition may just as well be the one as the other, therefore if we
first find it in motion, we have just as little right to assume that
this was preceded by a condition of rest, and to inquire into the
cause of the origin of the motion, as, conversely, if we found it
at rest, we would have to assume a previous motion and inquire
into the cause of its suspension. 

It is, therefore, not needful to
seek for a first impulse for centrifugal force, for, according to the
hypothesis of Kant and Laplace, it is, in the case of the planets,
the residue of the original rotation of the central body, from
which the planets have separated themselves as it contracted. But
to this central body itself motion is essential; it always continues
its rotation, and at the same time rushes forward in endless space,
or perhaps circulates round a greater central body invisible to us.
This view entirely agrees with the conjecture of astronomers that
there is a central sun, and also with the observed advance of our
whole solar system, and perhaps of the whole stellar system to
which our sun belongs. From this we are finally led to assume a
general advance of fixed stars, together with the central sun, and
this certainly loses all meaning in boundless space (for motion in
absolute space cannot be distinguished from rest), and becomes,
as is already the case from its striving and aimless flight, an
expression of that nothingness, that failure of all aim, which, at
the close of this book, we shall be obliged to recognise in the
striving of will in all its phenomena. Thus boundless space and
endless time must be the most universal and essential forms of
the collective phenomena of will, which exist for the expression
of its whole being. Lastly, we can recognise that conflict which
we are considering of all phenomena of will against each other
in simple matter regarded as such; for the real characteristic of matter is correctly expressed by Kant as repulsive and attractive
force; so that even crude matter has its existence only in the
strife of conflicting forces. If we abstract from all chemical
differences in matter, or go so far back in the chain of causes and
effects that as yet there is no chemical difference, there remains
mere matter,—the world rounded to a globe, whose life, i.e.,
objectification of will, is now constituted by the conflict between
attractive and repulsive forces, the former as gravitation pressing
from all sides towards the centre, the latter as impenetrability
always opposing the former either as rigidity or elasticity; and
this constant pressure and resistance may be regarded as the
objectivity of will in its very lowest grade, and even there it
expresses its character.

We should see the will express itself here in the lowest grade
as blind striving, an obscure, inarticulate impulse, far from
susceptible of being directly known. It is the simplest and the
weakest mode of its objectification. But it appears as this blind
and unconscious striving in the whole of unorganised nature, in
all those original forces of which it is the work of physics and
chemistry to discover and to study the laws, and each of which
manifests itself to us in millions of phenomena which are exactly
similar and regular, and show no trace of individual character,
but are mere multiplicity through space and time, i.e., through
the principium individuationis, as a picture is multiplied through
the facets of a glass.

From grade to grade objectifying itself more distinctly, yet
still completely without consciousness as an obscure striving
force, the will acts in the vegetable kingdom also, in which the
bond of its phenomena consists no longer properly of causes, but
of stimuli; and, finally, also in the vegetative part of the animal
phenomenon, in the production and maturing of the animal, and
in sustaining its inner economy, in which the manifestation of
will is still always necessarily determined by stimuli. 

The ever-ascending grades of the objectification of will bring us at 
last to the point at which the individual that expresses the Idea
could no longer receive food for its assimilation through mere
movement following upon stimuli. For such a stimulus must be
waited for, but the food has now come to be of a more special
and definite kind, and with the ever-increasing multiplicity of
the individual phenomena, the crowd and confusion has become
so great that they interfere with each other, and the chance of the
individual that is moved merely by stimuli and must wait for its
food would be too unfavourable. From the point, therefore, at
which the animal has delivered itself from the egg or the womb
in which it vegetated without consciousness, its food must be
sought out and selected. For this purpose movement following
upon motives, and therefore consciousness, becomes necessary,
and consequently it appears as an agent, º∑«±Ω∑, called in at
this stage of the objectification of will for the conservation of
the individual and the propagation of the species. It appears
represented by the brain or a large ganglion, just as every
other effort or determination of the will which objectifies itself is
represented by an organ, that is to say, manifests itself for the idea
as an organ.36 But with this means of assistance, this º∑«±Ω∑, the
world as idea comes into existence at a stroke, with all its forms,
object and subject, time, space, multiplicity, and causality. The
world now shows its second side. Till now mere will, it becomes
also idea, object of the knowing subject. The will, which up to this
point followed its tendency in the dark with unerring certainty,
has at this grade kindled for itself a light as a means which
became necessary for getting rid of the disadvantage which arose
from the throng and the complicated nature of its manifestations,[197]
and which would have accrued precisely to the most perfect of
them. The hitherto infallible certainty and regularity with which
it worked in unorganised and merely vegetative nature, rested

der Natur,” p. 54 et seq., and pp. 70-79 of the first edition, or p. 46 et seq., and

upon the fact that it alone was active in its original nature, as blind
impulse, will, without assistance, and also without interruption,
from a second and entirely different world, the world as idea,
which is indeed only the image of its own inner being, but is yet
of quite another nature, and now encroaches on the connected
whole of its phenomena. Hence its infallible certainty comes to
an end. Animals are already exposed to illusion, to deception.
They have, however, merely ideas of perception, no conceptions,
no reflection, and they are therefore bound to the present; they
cannot have regard for the future. It seems as if this knowledge
without reason was not in all cases sufficient for its end, and
at times required, as it were, some assistance. For the very
remarkable phenomenon presents itself, that the blind working
of the will and the activity enlightened by knowledge encroach in
a most astonishing manner upon each other's spheres in two kinds
of phenomena. In the one case we find in the very midst of those
actions of animals which are guided by perceptive knowledge
and its motives one kind of action which is accomplished apart
from these, and thus through the necessity of the blindly acting
will. I refer to those mechanical instincts which are guided by
no motive or knowledge, and which yet have the appearance
of performing their work from abstract rational motives. The
other case, which is opposed to this, is that in which, on the
contrary, the light of knowledge penetrates into the workshop of
the blindly active will, and illuminates the vegetative functions
of the human organism. I mean clairvoyance. Finally, when
the will has attained to the highest grade of its objectification,
that knowledge of the understanding given to brutes to which the
senses supply the data, out of which there arises mere perception
confined to what is immediately present, does not suffice. That [198]
complicated, many-sided, imaginative being, man, with his many
needs, and exposed as he is to innumerable dangers, must, in
order to exist, be lighted by a double knowledge; a higher power,
as it were, of perceptive knowledge must be given him, and

also reason, as the faculty of framing abstract conceptions. With
this there has appeared reflection, surveying the future and the
past, and, as a consequence, deliberation, care, the power of
premeditated action independent of the present, and finally, the
full and distinct consciousness of one's own deliberate volition
as such. Now if with mere knowledge of perception there
arose the possibility of illusion and deception, by which the
previous infallibility of the blind striving of will was done away
with, so that mechanical and other instincts, as expressions of
unconscious will, had to lend their help in the midst of those that
were conscious, with the entrance of reason that certainty and
infallibility of the expressions of will (which at the other extreme
in unorganised nature appeared as strict conformity to law) is
almost entirely lost; instinct disappears altogether; deliberation,
which is supposed to take the place of everything else, begets (as
was shown in the First Book) irresolution and uncertainty; then
error becomes possible, and in many cases obstructs the adequate
objectification of the will in action. For although in the character
the will has already taken its definite and unchangeable bent or
direction, in accordance with which volition, when occasioned
by the presence of a motive, invariably takes place, yet error
can falsify its expressions, for it introduces illusive motives that
take the place of the real ones which they resemble;37 as, for
example, when superstition forces on a man imaginary motives
which impel him to a course of action directly opposed to the[199]
way in which the will would otherwise express itself in the
given circumstances. Agamemnon slays his daughter; a miser
dispenses alms, out of pure egotism, in the hope that he will
some day receive an hundred-fold; and so on.

Thus knowledge generally, rational as well as merely
sensuous, proceeds originally from the will itself, belongs to

the inner being of the higher grades of its objectification as
a mere º∑«±Ω∑, a means of supporting the individual and the
species, just like any organ of the body. Originally destined for
the service of the will for the accomplishment of its aims, it
remains almost throughout entirely subjected to its service: it is
so in all brutes and in almost all men. Yet we shall see in the
Third Book how in certain individual men knowledge can deliver
itself from this bondage, throw off its yoke, and, free from all
the aims of will, exist purely for itself, simply as a clear mirror
of the world, which is the source of art. Finally, in the Fourth
Book, we shall see how, if this kind of knowledge reacts on the
will, it can bring about self-surrender, i.e., resignation, which
is the final goal, and indeed the inmost nature of all virtue and
holiness, and is deliverance from the world.
