The first three books will, it is hoped, have conveyed the distinct and certain knowledge that the world as idea is the complete mirror of the will, in which it knows itself in ascending grades of distinctness and completeness, the highest of which is man, whose nature, however, receives its complete expression only through the whole connected series of his actions. 

The self-conscious connection of these actions is made possible by reason, which enables a man constantly to survey the whole in the abstract.

The will, which, considered purely in itself, is without
knowledge, and is merely a blind incessant impulse, as we
see it appear in unorganised and vegetable nature and their
laws, and also in the vegetative part of our own life, receives
through the addition of the world as idea, which is developed in
subjection to it, the knowledge of its own willing and of what it
is that it wills.

This is nothing else than the world as idea, life, precisely as it exists. Therefore we called the phenomenal
world the mirror of the will, its objectivity. And since what
the will wills is always life, just because life is nothing but the
representation of that willing for the idea, it is all one and a mere
pleonism if, instead of simply saying “the will,” we say “the will
to live.”

Will is the thing-in-itself, the inner content, the essence of
the world. Life, the visible world, the phenomenon, is only
the mirror of the will. Therefore life accompanies the will as
inseparably as the shadow accompanies the body; and if will
exists, so will life, the world, exist. Life is, therefore, assured
to the will to live; and so long as we are filled with the will
to live we need have no fear for our existence, even in the
presence of death. It is true we see the individual come into
being and pass away; but the individual is only phenomenal,
exists only for the knowledge which is bound to the principle
of sufficient reason, to the principio individuationis. Certainly,
for this kind of knowledge, the individual receives his life as a
gift, rises out of nothing, then suffers the loss of this gift through
death, and returns again to nothing. 

But we desire to consider life philosophically, i.e., according to its Ideas, and in this sphere we shall find that neither the will, the thing-in-itself in all phenomena, nor the subject of knowing, that which perceives
all phenomena, is affected at all by birth or by death. 

Birth and death belong merely to the phenomenon of will, thus to life; and
it is essential to this to exhibit itself in individuals which come
into being and pass away, as fleeting phenomena appearing in
the form of time—phenomena of that which in itself knows no
time, but must exhibit itself precisely in the way we have said, in
order to objectify its peculiar nature. Birth and death belong in
like manner to life, and hold the balance as reciprocal conditions
of each other, or, if one likes the expression, as poles of the
whole phenomenon of life. The wisest of all mythologies, the
Indian, expresses this by giving to the very god that symbolises
destruction, death (as Brahma, the most sinful and the lowest god
of the Trimurti, symbolises generation, coming into being, and
Vishnu maintaining or preserving), by giving, I say, to Siva as
an attribute not only the necklace of skulls, but also the lingam,
the symbol of generation, which appears here as the counterpart
of death, thus signifying that generation and death are essentially
correlatives, which reciprocally neutralise and annul each other.

It was precisely the same sentiment that led the Greeks and
Romans to adorn their costly sarcophagi, just as we see them
now, with feasts, dances, marriages, the chase, fights of wild
beasts, bacchanalians, &c.; thus with representations of the full
ardour of life, which they place before us not only in such revels
and sports, but also in sensual groups, and even go so far as to
represent the sexual intercourse of satyrs and goats. Clearly the
aim was to point in the most impressive manner away from the
death of the mourned individual to the immortal life of nature,
and thus to indicate, though without abstract knowledge, that the
whole of nature is the phenomenon and also the fulfilment of the
will to live. The form of this phenomenon is time, space, and[356]
causality, and by means of these individuation, which carries with
it that the individual must come into being and pass away. But
357
this no more affects the will to live, of whose manifestation the
individual is, as it were, only a particular example or specimen,
than the death of an individual injures the whole of nature.
For it is not the individual, but only the species that Nature
cares for, and for the preservation of which she so earnestly
strives, providing for it with the utmost prodigality through the
vast surplus of the seed and the great strength of the fructifying
impulse. The individual, on the contrary, neither has nor can have
any value for Nature, for her kingdom is infinite time and infinite
space, and in these infinite multiplicity of possible individuals.
Therefore she is always ready to let the individual fall, and hence
it is not only exposed to destruction in a thousand ways by the
most insignificant accident, but originally destined for it, and
conducted towards it by Nature herself from the moment it has
served its end of maintaining the species. Thus Nature naïvely
expresses the great truth that only the Ideas, not the individuals,
have, properly speaking, reality, i.e., are complete objectivity of
the will. Now, since man is Nature itself, and indeed Nature at
the highest grade of its self-consciousness, but Nature is only
the objectified will to live, the man who has comprehended
and retained this point of view may well console himself, when
contemplating his own death and that of his friends, by turning
his eyes to the immortal life of Nature, which he himself is. This
is the significance of Siva with the lingam, and of those ancient
sarcophagi with their pictures of glowing life, which say to the
mourning beholder, Natura non contristatur.
That generation and death are to be regarded as something
belonging to life, and essential to this phenomenon of the will,
arises also from the fact that they both exhibit themselves merely
as higher powers of the expression of that in which all the rest [357]
of life consists. This is through and through nothing else than
the constant change of matter in the fixed permanence of form;
and this is what constitutes the transitoriness of the individual
and the permanence of the species. Constant nourishment and
358 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
renewal differ from generation only in degree, and constant
excretion differs only in degree from death. The first shows
itself most simply and distinctly in the plant. The plant is
throughout a constant recurrence of the same impulse of its
simplest fibre, which groups itself into leaf and branch. It is
a systematic aggregate of similar plants supporting each other,
whose constant reproduction is its single impulse. It ascends to
the full satisfaction of this tendency through the grades of its
metamorphosis, finally to the blossom and fruit, that compendium
of its existence and effort in which it now attains, by a short way,
to that which is its single aim, and at a stroke produces a thousand-
fold what, up till then, it effected only in the particular case—the
repetition of itself. Its earlier growth and development stands in
the same relation to its fruit as writing stands to printing. With
the animal it is clearly quite the same. The process of nourishing
is a constant reproduction; the process of reproduction is a higher
power of nourishing. The pleasure which accompanies the act of
procreation is a higher power of the agreeableness of the sense
of life. On the other hand, excretion, the constant exhalation and
throwing off of matter, is the same as that which, at a higher
power, death, is the contrary of generation. And if here we are
always content to retain the form without lamenting the discarded
matter, we ought to bear ourselves in the same way if in death
the same thing happens, in a higher degree and to the whole,
as takes place daily and hourly in a partial manner in excretion:
if we are indifferent to the one, we ought not to shrink from
the other. Therefore, from this point of view, it appears just as
perverse to desire the continuance of an individuality which will[358]
be replaced by other individuals as to desire the permanence of
matter which will be replaced by other matter. It appears just as
foolish to embalm the body as it would be carefully to preserve
its excrement. As to the individual consciousness which is bound
to the individual body, it is absolutely interrupted every day by
sleep. Deep sleep is, while it lasts, in no way different from
359
death, into which, in fact, it often passes continuously, as in the
case of freezing to death. It differs only with regard to the future,
the awaking. Death is a sleep in which individuality is forgotten;
everything else wakes again, or rather never slept.64
Above all things, we must distinctly recognise that the form
of the phenomenon of will, the form of life or reality, is really
only the present, not the future nor the past. The latter are only
in the conception, exist only in the connection of knowledge, so
far as it follows the principle of sufficient reason. No man has
ever lived in the past, and none will live in the future; the present
alone is the form of all life, and is its sure possession which
can never be taken from it. The present always exists, together
with its content. Both remain fixed without wavering, like the
rainbow on the waterfall. For life is firm and certain in the will,
and the present is firm and certain in life. Certainly, if we reflect
on the thousands of years that are past, of the millions of men [359]
who lived in them, we ask, What were they? what has become
of them? But, on the other hand, we need only recall our own
past life and renew its scenes vividly in our imagination, and
then ask again, What was all this? what has become of it? As it
is with it, so is it with the life of those millions. Or should we
suppose that the past could receive a new existence because it
64 The following remark may assist those for whom it is not too subtle to
understand clearly that the individual is only the phenomenon, not the thing
in itself. Every individual is, on the one hand, the subject of knowing, i.e.,
the complemental condition of the possibility of the whole objective world,
and, on the other hand, a particular phenomenon of will, the same will which
objectifies itself in everything. But this double nature of our being does not rest
upon a self-existing unity, otherwise it would be possible for us to be conscious
of ourselves in ourselves, and independent of the objects of knowledge and
will. Now this is by no means possible, for as soon as we turn into ourselves
to make the attempt, and seek for once to know ourselves fully by means of
introspective reflection, we are lost in a bottomless void; we find ourselves like
the hollow glass globe, from out of which a voice speaks whose cause is not to
be found in it, and whereas we desired to comprehend ourselves, we find, with
a shudder, nothing but a vanishing spectre.

has been sealed by death? Our own past, the most recent part of
it, and even yesterday, is now no more than an empty dream of
the fancy, and such is the past of all those millions. What was?
What is? The will, of which life is the mirror, and knowledge
free from will, which beholds it clearly in that mirror. Whoever
has not yet recognised this, or will not recognise it, must add
to the question asked above as to the fate of past generations of
men this question also: Why he, the questioner, is so fortunate
as to be conscious of this costly, fleeting, and only real present,
while those hundreds of generations of men, even the heroes and
philosophers of those ages, have sunk into the night of the past,
and have thus become nothing; but he, his insignificant ego,
actually exists? or more shortly, though somewhat strangely:
Why this now, his now, is just now and was not long ago? Since
he asks such strange questions, he regards his existence and his
time as independent of each other, and the former as projected
into the latter. He assumes indeed two nows—one which belongs
to the object, the other which belongs to the subject, and marvels
at the happy accident of their coincidence. But in truth, only
the point of contact of the object, the form of which is time,
with the subject, which has no mode of the principle of sufficient
reason as its form, constitutes the present, as is shown in the
essay on the principle of sufficient reason. Now all object is the
will so far as it has become idea, and the subject is the necessary
correlative of the object. But real objects are only in the present;[360]
the past and the future contain only conceptions and fancies,
therefore the present is the essential form of the phenomenon of
the will, and inseparable from it. The present alone is that which
always exists and remains immovable. That which, empirically
apprehended, is the most transitory of all, presents itself to the
metaphysical vision, which sees beyond the forms of empirical
perception, as that which alone endures, the nunc stans of the
schoolmen. The source and the supporter of its content is the
will to live or the thing-in-itself,—which we are. 

That which constantly becomes and passes away, in that it has either already
been or is still to be, belongs to the phenomenon as such on
account of its forms, which make coming into being and passing
away possible. Accordingly, we must think:—Quid fuit?—Quod
est. Quid erit?—Quod fuit; and take it in the strict meaning of
the words; thus understand not simile but idem. For life is certain
to the will, and the present is certain to life. Thus it is that every
one can say, “I am once for all lord of the present, and through
all eternity it will accompany me as my shadow: therefore I
do not wonder where it has come from, and how it happens
that it is exactly now.” We might compare time to a constantly
revolving sphere; the half that was always sinking would be the
past, that which was always rising would be the future; but the
indivisible point at the top, where the tangent touches, would be
the extensionless present. As the tangent does not revolve with
the sphere, neither does the present, the point of contact of the
object, the form of which is time, with the subject, which has
no form, because it does not belong to the knowable, but is the
condition of all that is knowable. Or, time is like an unceasing
stream, and the present a rock on which the stream breaks itself,
but does not carry away with it. The will, as thing-in-itself, is just
as little subordinate to the principle of sufficient reason as the [361]
subject of knowledge, which, finally, in a certain regard is the
will itself or its expression. And as life, its own phenomenon, is
assured to the will, so is the present, the single form of real life.
Therefore we have not to investigate the past before life, nor the
future after death: we have rather to know the present, the one
form in which the will manifests itself.65 It will not escape from
the will, but neither will the will escape from it. If, therefore,
life as it is satisfies, whoever affirms it in every way may regard
65 “Scholastici docuerunt, quod æternitas non sit temporis sine fine aut
principio successio; sed Nunc stans, i.e., idem nobis Nunc esse, quod erat Nunc
Adamo, i.e., inter nunc et tunc nullam esse differentiam.”—Hobbes, Leviathan,
c. 46.

it with confidence as endless, and banish the fear of death as an
illusion that inspires him with the foolish dread that he can ever
be robbed of the present, and foreshadows a time in which there
is no present; an illusion with regard to time analogous to the
illusion with regard to space through which every one imagines
the position on the globe he happens to occupy as above, and
all other places as below. In the same way every one links the
present to his own individuality, and imagines that all present is
extinguished with it; that then past and future might be without a
present. But as on the surface of the globe every place is above,
so the form of all life is the present, and to fear death because it
robs us of the present, is just as foolish as to fear that we may
slip down from the round globe upon which we have now the
good fortune to occupy the upper surface. The present is the form
essential to the objectification of the will. It cuts time, which
extends infinitely in both directions, as a mathematical point,
and stands immovably fixed, like an everlasting mid-day with no
cool evening, as the actual sun burns without intermission, while
it only seems to sink into the bosom of night. 

Therefore, if a man
fears death as his annihilation, it is just as if he were to think that
the sun cries out at evening, “Woe is me! for I go down into[362]
eternal night.”66 And conversely, whoever is oppressed with the
burden of life, whoever desires life and affirms it, but abhors its
66 In Eckermann's “Conversations of Goethe” (vol. i. p. 161), Goethe says:
“Our spirit is a being of a nature quite indestructible, and its activity continues
from eternity to eternity. It is like the sun, which seems to set only to our
earthly eyes, but which, in reality, never sets, but shines on unceasingly.”
Goethe has taken the simile from me; not I from him. Without doubt he
used it in this conversation, which was held in 1824, in consequence of a
(possibly unconscious) reminiscence of the above passage, for it occurs in the
first edition, p. 401, in exactly the same words, and it is also repeated at p. 528
of that edition, as at the close of § 65 of the present work. The first edition was
sent to him in December 1818, and in March 1819, when I was at Naples, he
sent me his congratulations by letter, through my sister, and enclosed a piece
of paper upon which he had noted the places of certain passages which had
specially pleased him. Thus he had read my book.
363
torments, and especially can no longer endure the hard lot that
has fallen to himself, such a man has no deliverance to hope for
from death, and cannot right himself by suicide. The cool shades
of Orcus allure him only with the false appearance of a haven of
rest. The earth rolls from day into night, the individual dies, but
the sun itself shines without intermission, an eternal noon. Life is
assured to the will to live; the form of life is an endless present,
no matter how the individuals, the phenomena of the Idea, arise
and pass away in time, like fleeting dreams. Thus even already
suicide appears to us as a vain and therefore a foolish action;
when we have carried our investigation further it will appear to
us in a still less favourable light.

Dogmas change and our knowledge is deceptive; but Nature
never errs, her procedure is sure, and she never conceals
it. Everything is entirely in Nature, and Nature is entire in
everything. She has her centre in every brute. It has surely found
its way into existence, and it will surely find its way out of it. In
the meantime it lives, fearless and without care, in the presence
of annihilation, supported by the consciousness that it is Nature
herself, and imperishable as she is. Man alone carries about with
him, in abstract conceptions, the certainty of his death; yet this
can only trouble him very rarely, when for a single moment [363]
some occasion calls it up to his imagination. Against the mighty
voice of Nature reflection can do little. In man, as in the brute
which does not think, the certainty that springs from his inmost
consciousness that he himself is Nature, the world, predominates
as a lasting frame of mind; and on account of this no man is
observably disturbed by the thought of certain and never-distant
death, but lives as if he would live for ever. Indeed this is carried
so far that we may say that no one has really a lively conviction
of the certainty of his death, otherwise there would be no great
difference between his frame of mind and that of a condemned
criminal. Every one recognises that certainty in the abstract
and theoretically, but lays it aside like other theoretical truths which are not applicable to practice, without really receiving it
into his living consciousness. Whoever carefully considers this
peculiarity of human character will see that the psychological
explanations of it, from habit and acquiescence in the inevitable,
are by no means sufficient, and that its true explanation lies in
the deeper ground we have given. The same fact explains the
circumstance that at all times and among all peoples dogmas
of some kind or other relating to the continued existence of the
individual after death arise, and are believed in, although the
evidence in support of them must always be very insufficient,
and the evidence against them forcible and varied. But, in truth,
this really requires no proof, but is recognised by the healthy
understanding as a fact, and confirmed by the confidence that
Nature never lies any more than she errs, but openly exhibits
and naïvely expresses her action and her nature, while only we
ourselves obscure it by our folly, in order to establish what is
agreeable to our limited point of view.
But this that we have brought to clearest consciousness, that
although the particular phenomenon of the will has a temporal
beginning and end, the will itself as thing-in-itself is not affected
by it, nor yet the correlative of all object, the knowing but[364]
never known subject, and that life is always assured to the
will to live—this is not to be numbered with the doctrines of
immortality. For permanence has no more to do with the will
or with the pure subject of knowing, the eternal eye of the
world, than transitoriness, for both are predicates that are only
valid in time, and the will and the pure subject of knowing
lie outside time. Therefore the egoism of the individual (this
particular phenomenon of will enlightened by the subject of
knowing) can extract as little nourishment and consolation for
his wish to endure through endless time from the view we have
expressed, as he could from the knowledge that after his death
the rest of the eternal world would continue to exist, which is
just the expression of the same view considered objectively, and therefore temporally. For every individual is transitory only
as phenomenon, but as thing-in-itself is timeless, and therefore
endless. 

But it is also only as phenomenon that an individual
is distinguished from the other things of the world; as thing-in-itself he is the will which appears in all, and death destroys
the illusion which separates his consciousness from that of the
rest: this is immortality. His exemption from death, which
belongs to him only as thing-in-itself, is for the phenomenon
one with the immortality of the rest of the external world.67
Hence also, it arises that although the inward and merely felt
consciousness of that which we have raised to distinct knowledge
is indeed, as we have said, sufficient to prevent the thought of
death from poisoning the life of the rational being, because this
consciousness is the basis of that love of life which maintains
everything living, and enables it to live on at ease as if there [365]
were no such thing as death, so long as it is face to face with
life, and turns its attention to it, yet it will not prevent the
individual from being seized with the fear of death, and trying
in every way to escape from it, when it presents itself to him
in some particular real case, or even only in his imagination,
and he is compelled to contemplate it. For just as, so long as
his knowledge was directed to life as such, he was obliged to
recognise immortality in it, so when death is brought before his
eyes, he is obliged to recognise it as that which it is, the temporal
end of the particular temporal phenomenon. What we fear in
death is by no means the pain, for it lies clearly on this side of
death, and, moreover, we often take refuge in death from pain,
just as, on the contrary, we sometimes endure the most fearful
67 This is expressed in the Veda by saying, that when a man dies his sight
becomes one with the sun, his smell with the earth, his taste with water, his
hearing with the air, his speech with fire, &c., &c. (Oupnek'hat, vol. i. p. 249
et seq.) And also by the fact that, in a special ceremony, the dying man gives
over his senses and all his faculties singly to his son, in whom they are now
supposed to live on (Oupnek'hat, vol. ii. p. 82 et seq.)
366 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
suffering merely to escape death for a while, although it would
be quick and easy. Thus we distinguish pain and death as two
entirely different evils. What we fear in death is the end of the
individual, which it openly professes itself to be, and since the
individual is a particular objectification of the will to live itself,
its whole nature struggles against death. Now when feeling thus
exposes us helpless, reason can yet step in and for the most part
overcome its adverse influence, for it places us upon a higher
standpoint, from which we no longer contemplate the particular
but the whole. Therefore a philosophical knowledge of the nature
of the world, which extended to the point we have now reached
in this work but went no farther, could even at this point of view
overcome the terror of death in the measure in which reflection
had power over direct feeling in the given individual. A man who
had thoroughly assimilated the truths we have already advanced,
but had not come to know, either from his own experience or
from a deeper insight, that constant suffering is essential to life,
who found satisfaction and all that he wished in life, and could
calmly and deliberately desire that his life, as he had hitherto[366]
known it, should endure for ever or repeat itself ever anew, and
whose love of life was so great that he willingly and gladly
accepted all the hardships and miseries to which it is exposed
for the sake of its pleasures,—such a man would stand “with
firm-knit bones on the well-rounded, enduring earth,” and would
have nothing to fear. Armed with the knowledge we have given
him, he would await with indifference the death that hastens
towards him on the wings of time. He would regard it as a false
illusion, an impotent spectre, which frightens the weak but has
no power over him who knows that he is himself the will of
which the whole world is the objectification or copy, and that
therefore he is always certain of life, and also of the present, the
peculiar and only form of the phenomenon of the will. He could
not be terrified by an endless past or future in which he would
not be, for this he would regard as the empty delusion of the web
367
of Mâya. Thus he would no more fear death than the sun fears
the night. In the “Bhagavad-Gita” Krishna thus raises the mind
of his young pupil Arjuna, when, seized with compunction at the
sight of the arrayed hosts (somewhat as Xerxes was), he loses
heart and desires to give up the battle in order to avert the death
of so many thousands. Krishna leads him to this point of view,
and the death of those thousands can no longer restrain him; he
gives the sign for battle. This point of view is also expressed by
Goethe's Prometheus, especially when he says—
“Here sit I, form mankind
In my own image,
A race like to myself,
To suffer and to weep,
Rejoice, enjoy,
And heed thee not,
As I.”

The philosophy of Bruno and that of Spinoza might also lead
any one to this point of view whose conviction was not shaken [367]
and weakened by their errors and imperfections. That of Bruno
has properly no ethical theory at all, and the theory contained in
the philosophy of Spinoza does not really proceed from the inner
nature of his doctrine, but is merely tacked on to it by means of
weak and palpable sophisms, though in itself it is praiseworthy
and beautiful. Finally, there are many men who would occupy
this point of view if their knowledge kept pace with their will,
i.e., if, free from all illusion, they were in a position to become
clearly and distinctly themselves. For this is, for knowledge, the
point of view of the complete assertion of the will to live.
That the will asserts itself means, that while in its objectivity,
i.e., in the world and life, its own nature is completely and
distinctly given it as idea, this knowledge does not by any means
check its volition; but this very life, so known, is willed as such
by the will with knowledge, consciously and deliberately, just as up to this point it willed it as blind effort without knowledge.
The opposite of this, the denial of the will to live, shows itself
if, when that knowledge is attained, volition ends, because the
particular known phenomena no longer act as motives for willing,
but the whole knowledge of the nature of the world, the mirror
of the will, which has grown up through the comprehension of
the Ideas, becomes a quieter of the will; and thus free, the will
suppresses itself. These quite unfamiliar conceptions are difficult
to understand when expressed in this general way, but it is hoped
they will become clear through the exposition we shall give
presently, with special reference to action, of the phenomena
in which, on the one hand, the assertion in its different grades,
and, on the other hand, the denial, expresses itself. For both
proceed from knowledge, yet not from abstract knowledge,
which is expressed in words, but from living knowledge, which
is expressed in action and behaviour alone, and is independent
of the dogmas which at the same time occupy the reason as
abstract knowledge. To exhibit them both, and bring them to[368]
distinct knowledge of the reason, can alone be my aim, and not to
prescribe or recommend the one or the other, which would be as
foolish as it would be useless; for the will in itself is absolutely
free and entirely self-determining, and for it there is no law.
But before we go on to the exposition referred to, we must first
explain and more exactly define this freedom and its relation to
necessity. And also, with regard to the life, the assertion and
denial of which is our problem, we must insert a few general
remarks connected with the will and its objects. Through all
this we shall facilitate the apprehension of the inmost nature of
the knowledge we are aiming at, of the ethical significance of
methods of action.

Since, as has been said, this whole work is only the unfolding
of a single thought, it follows that all its parts have the most
intimate connection with each other. Not merely that each part
stands in a necessary relation to what immediately precedes it, and only presupposes a recollection of that by the reader, as is
the case with all philosophies which consist merely of a series
of inferences, but that every part of the whole work is related to
every other part and presupposes it. It is, therefore, necessary
that the reader should remember not only what has just been
said, but all the earlier parts of the work, so that he may be able
to connect them with what he is reading, however much may
have intervened. Plato also makes this demand upon his readers
through the intricate digressions of his dialogues, in which he
only returns to the leading thought after long episodes, which
illustrate and explain it. In our case this demand is necessary; for
the breaking up of our one single thought into its many aspects
is indeed the only means of imparting it, though not essential
to the thought itself, but merely an artificial form. The division
of four principal points of view into four books, and the most
careful bringing together of all that is related and homogeneous,
assists the exposition and its comprehension; yet the material [369]
absolutely does not admit of an advance in a straight line, such
as the progress of history, but necessitates a more complicated
exposition. This again makes a repeated study of the book
necessary, for thus alone does the connection of all the parts with
each other become distinct, and only then do they all mutually
throw light upon each other and become quite clear.68
