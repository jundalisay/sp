The will as a thing in itself is different from its phenomenal appearance.

It is free from all the forms
of the phenomenal, into which it first passes when it manifests itself, and which therefore only concern its objectivity, and are
foreign to the will itself. 

Even the most universal form of all
idea, that of being object for a subject, does not concern it;
still less the forms which are subordinate to this and which
collectively have their common expression in the principle of
sufficient reason, to which we know that time and space belong,
and consequently multiplicity also, which exists and is possible
only through these. In this last regard I shall call time and space
the principium individuationis, borrowing an expression from
the old schoolmen, and I beg to draw attention to this, once for all. 

For it is only through the medium of time and space
that what is one and the same, both according to its nature and
to its concept, yet appears as different, as a multiplicity of co-
existent and successive phenomena. Thus time and space are the
principium individuationis, the subject of so many subtleties and
disputes among the schoolmen, which may be found collected
in Suarez (Disp. 5, Sect. 3). 

The will as a thing-in-itself lies outside the province of the
principle of sufficient reason in all its forms, and is consequently
completely groundless, although all its manifestations are entirely
subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason. Further, it is
free from all multiplicity, although its manifestations in time
and space are innumerable. It is itself one, though not in the
sense in which an object is one, for the unity of an object can
only be known in opposition to a possible multiplicity; nor
yet in the sense in which a concept is one, for the unity of a
concept originates only in abstraction from a multiplicity; but it
is one as that which lies outside time and space, the principium
individuationis, i.e., the possibility of multiplicity. Only when
all this has become quite clear to us through the subsequent
examination of the phenomena and different manifestations of
the will, shall we fully understand the meaning of the Kantian
doctrine that time, space and causality do not belong to the
thing-in-itself, but are only forms of knowing.

The uncaused nature of will has been actually recognised,
where it manifests itself most distinctly, as the will of man,
and this has been called free, independent. But on account of
the uncaused nature of the will itself, the necessity to which
its manifestation is everywhere subjected has been overlooked,
and actions are treated as free, which they are not. For every
individual action follows with strict necessity from the effect of
the motive upon the character. All necessity is, as we have already
said, the relation of the consequent to the reason, and nothing more. 

The principle of sufficient reason is the universal form of
all phenomena, and man in his action must be subordinated to it
like every other phenomenon. But because in self-consciousness
the will is known directly and in itself, in this consciousness
lies also the consciousness of freedom. The fact is, however,
overlooked that the individual, the person, is not will as a thing-
in-itself, but is a phenomenon of will, is already determined
as such, and has come under the form of the phenomenal, the
principle of sufficient reason. Hence arises the strange fact that
every one believes himself a priori to be perfectly free, even in
his individual actions, and thinks that at every moment he can
commence another manner of life, which just means that he can
become another person. But a posteriori, through experience,
he finds to his astonishment that he is not free, but subjected to
necessity; that in spite of all his resolutions and reflections he
does not change his conduct, and that from the beginning of his
life to the end of it, he must carry out the very character which he
himself condemns, and as it were play the part he has undertaken
to the end. I cannot pursue this subject further at present, for it
belongs, as ethical, to another part of this work. In the meantime,
I only wish to point out here that the phenomenon of the will
which in itself is uncaused, is yet as such subordinated to the law
of necessity, that is, the principle of sufficient reason, so that in
the necessity with which the phenomena of nature follow each
other, we may find nothing to hinder us from recognising in them the manifestations of will.

Only those changes which have no other ground than a motive,
i.e., an idea, have hitherto been regarded as manifestations of
will. Therefore in nature a will has only been attributed to man,
or at the most to animals; for knowledge, the idea, is of course,
as I have said elsewhere, the true and exclusive characteristic of[148]
animal life. But that the will is also active where no knowledge
guides it, we see at once in the instinct and the mechanical skill
of animals.31 That they have ideas and knowledge is here not
to the point, for the end towards which they strive as definitely
as if it were a known motive, is yet entirely unknown to them.
Therefore in such cases their action takes place without motive,
is not guided by the idea, and shows us first and most distinctly
how the will may be active entirely without knowledge. The bird
of a year old has no idea of the eggs for which it builds a nest;
the young spider has no idea of the prey for which it spins a
web; nor has the ant-lion any idea of the ants for which he digs
a trench for the first time. The larva of the stag-beetle makes the
hole in the wood, in which it is to await its metamorphosis, twice
as big if it is going to be a male beetle as if it is going to be a
female, so that if it is a male there may be room for the horns, of
which, however, it has no idea. In such actions of these creatures
the will is clearly operative as in their other actions, but it is in
blind activity, which is indeed accompanied by knowledge but
not guided by it. If now we have once gained insight into the fact,
that idea as motive is not a necessary and essential condition of
the activity of the will, we shall more easily recognise the activity
of will where it is less apparent. For example, we shall see that
the house of the snail is no more made by a will which is foreign
to the snail itself, than the house which we build is produced
through another will than our own; but we shall recognise in
both houses the work of a will which objectifies itself in both the

phenomena—a will which works in us according to motives, but
in the snail still blindly as formative impulse directed outwards.

In us also the same will is in many ways only blindly active: in
all the functions of our body which are not guided by knowledge,
in all its vital and vegetative processes, digestion, circulation, [149]
secretion, growth, reproduction. Not only the actions of the
body, but the whole body itself is, as we have shown above,
phenomenon of the will, objectified will, concrete will. All that
goes on in it must therefore proceed through will, although here
this will is not guided by knowledge, but acts blindly according
to causes, which in this case are called stimuli.
I call a cause, in the narrowest sense of the word, that state of
matter, which, while it introduces another state with necessity,
yet suffers just as great a change itself as that which it causes;
which is expressed in the rule, “action and reaction are equal.”
Further, in the case of what is properly speaking a cause, the
effect increases directly in proportion to the cause, and therefore
also the reaction. So that, if once the mode of operation be
known, the degree of the effect may be measured and calculated
from the degree of the intensity of the cause; and conversely the
degree of the intensity of the cause may be calculated from the
degree of the effect. Such causes, properly so called, operate
in all the phenomena of mechanics, chemistry, and so forth; in
short, in all the changes of unorganised bodies. On the other
hand, I call a stimulus, such a cause as sustains no reaction
proportional to its effect, and the intensity of which does not
vary directly in proportion to the intensity of its effect, so that the
effect cannot be measured by it. On the contrary, a small increase
of the stimulus may cause a very great increase of the effect,
or conversely, it may eliminate the previous effect altogether,
and so forth. All effects upon organised bodies as such are of
this kind. All properly organic and vegetative changes of the
animal body must therefore be referred to stimuli, not to mere
causes. But the stimulus, like every cause and motive generally,
164 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
never determines more than the point of time and space at which[150]
the manifestation of every force is to take place, and does not
determine the inner nature of the force itself which is manifested.
This inner nature we know, from our previous investigation,
is will, to which therefore we ascribe both the unconscious
and the conscious changes of the body. The stimulus holds
the mean, forms the transition between the motive, which is
causality accompanied throughout by knowledge, and the cause
in the narrowest sense. In particular cases it is sometimes nearer
a motive, sometimes nearer a cause, but yet it can always be
distinguished from both. Thus, for example, the rising of the sap
in a plant follows upon stimuli, and cannot be explained from
mere causes, according to the laws of hydraulics or capillary
attraction; yet it is certainly assisted by these, and altogether
approaches very near to a purely causal change. On the other
hand, the movements of the Hedysarum gyrans and the Mimosa
pudica, although still following upon mere stimuli, are yet very
like movements which follow upon motives, and seem almost to
wish to make the transition. The contraction of the pupils of the
eyes as the light is increased is due to stimuli, but it passes into
movement which is due to motive; for it takes place, because
too strong lights would affect the retina painfully, and to avoid
this we contract the pupils. The occasion of an erection is a
motive, because it is an idea, yet it operates with the necessity
of a stimulus, i.e., it cannot be resisted, but we must put the
idea away in order to make it cease to affect us. This is also
the case with disgusting things, which excite the desire to vomit.
Thus we have treated the instinct of animals as an actual link, of
quite a distinct kind, between movement following upon stimuli,
and action following upon a known motive. Now we might be
asked to regard breathing as another link of this kind. It has been
disputed whether it belongs to the voluntary or the involuntary
movements, that is to say, whether it follows upon motive or
stimulus, and perhaps it may be explained as something which[151]
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 165
is between the two. Marshall Hall (“On the Diseases of the
Nervous System,” § 293 sq.) explains it as a mixed function, for
it is partly under the influence of the cerebral (voluntary), and
partly under that of the spinal (non-voluntary) nerves. However,
we are finally obliged to number it with the expressions of will
which result from motives. For other motives, i.e., mere ideas,
can determine the will to check it or accelerate it, and, as is
the case with every other voluntary action, it seems to us that
we could give up breathing altogether and voluntarily suffocate.
And in fact we could do so if any other motive influenced the
will sufficiently strongly to overcome the pressing desire for air.
According to some accounts Diogenes actually put an end to his
life in this way (Diog. Laert. VI. 76). Certain negroes also are
said to have done this (F. B. Osiander “On Suicide” [1813] pp.
170-180). If this be true, it affords us a good example of the
influence of abstract motives, i.e., of the victory of distinctively
rational over merely animal will. For, that breathing is at least
partially conditioned by cerebral activity is shown by the fact that
the primary cause of death from prussic acid is that it paralyses
the brain, and so, indirectly, restricts the breathing; but if the
breathing be artificially maintained till the stupefaction of the
brain has passed away, death will not ensue. We may also
observe in passing that breathing affords us the most obvious
example of the fact that motives act with just as much necessity
as stimuli, or as causes in the narrowest sense of the word, and
their operation can only be neutralised by antagonistic motives,
as action is neutralised by re-action. For, in the case of breathing,
the illusion that we can stop when we like is much weaker than
in the case of other movements which follow upon motives;
because in breathing the motive is very powerful, very near
to us, and its satisfaction is very easy, for the muscles which
accomplish it are never tired, nothing, as a rule, obstructs it, and [152]
the whole process is supported by the most inveterate habit of the
individual. And yet all motives act with the same necessity. The
166 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
knowledge that necessity is common to movements following
upon motives, and those following upon stimuli, makes it easier
for us to understand that that also which takes place in our
bodily organism in accordance with stimuli and in obedience
to law, is yet, according to its inner nature—will, which in all
its manifestations, though never in itself, is subordinated to the
principle of sufficient reason, that is, to necessity.32 Accordingly,
we shall not rest contented with recognising that animals, both in
their actions and also in their whole existence, bodily structure
and organisation, are manifestations of will; but we shall extend
to plants also this immediate knowledge of the essential nature
of things which is given to us alone. Now all the movements
of plants follow upon stimuli; for the absence of knowledge,
and the movement following upon motives which is conditioned
by knowledge, constitutes the only essential difference between
animals and plants. Therefore, what appears for the idea as plant
life, as mere vegetation, as blindly impelling force, we shall
claim, according to its inner nature, for will, and recognise it
as just that which constitutes the basis of our own phenomenal
being, as it expresses itself in our actions, and also in the whole
existence of our body itself.
It only remains for us to take the final step, the extension
of our way of looking at things to all those forces which act
in nature in accordance with universal, unchangeable laws, in
conformity with which the movements of all those bodies take
place, which are wholly without organs, and have therefore no
susceptibility for stimuli, and have no knowledge, which is the
necessary condition of motives. Thus we must also apply the[153]
key to the understanding of the inner nature of things, which the
immediate knowledge of our own existence alone can give us,
to those phenomena of the unorganised world which are most
32 This subject is fully worked out in my prize essay on the freedom of the
will, in which therefore (pp. 29-44 of the “Grundprobleme der Ethik”) the
relation of cause, stimulus, and motive has also been fully explained.

remote from us. And if we consider them attentively, if we
observe the strong and unceasing impulse with which the waters
hurry to the ocean, the persistency with which the magnet turns
ever to the north pole, the readiness with which iron flies to
the magnet, the eagerness with which the electric poles seek to
be re-united, and which, just like human desire, is increased by
obstacles; if we see the crystal quickly and suddenly take form
with such wonderful regularity of construction, which is clearly
only a perfectly definite and accurately determined impulse in
different directions, seized and retained by crystallisation; if we
observe the choice with which bodies repel and attract each other,
combine and separate, when they are set free in a fluid state,
and emancipated from the bonds of rigidness; lastly, if we feel
directly how a burden which hampers our body by its gravitation
towards the earth, unceasingly presses and strains upon it in
pursuit of its one tendency; if we observe all this, I say, it will
require no great effort of the imagination to recognise, even at
so great a distance, our own nature. That which in us pursues its
ends by the light of knowledge; but here, in the weakest of its
manifestations, only strives blindly and dumbly in a one-sided
and unchangeable manner, must yet in both cases come under the
name of will, as it is everywhere one and the same—just as the
first dim light of dawn must share the name of sunlight with the
rays of the full mid-day. For the name will denotes that which is
the inner nature of everything in the world, and the one kernel of
every phenomenon.


Yet the remoteness, and indeed the appearance of absolute
difference between the phenomena of unorganised nature and
the will which we know as the inner reality of our own [154]
being, arises chiefly from the contrast between the completely
determined conformity to law of the one species of phenomena,
and the apparently unfettered freedom of the other. For in
man, individuality makes itself powerfully felt. Every one has
a character of his own; and therefore the same motive has not the same influence over all, and a thousand circumstances which
exist in the wide sphere of the knowledge of the individual,
but are unknown to others, modify its effect. 

Therefore
action cannot be predetermined from the motive alone, for
the other factor is wanting, the accurate acquaintance with the
individual character, and with the knowledge which accompanies
it. On the other hand, the phenomena of the forces of nature
illustrate the opposite extreme. They act according to universal
laws, without variation, without individuality in accordance
with openly manifest circumstances, subject to the most exact
predetermination; and the same force of nature appears in its
million phenomena in precisely the same way. In order to
explain this point and prove the identity of the one indivisible
will in all its different phenomena, in the weakest as in the
strongest, we must first of all consider the relation of the will as
thing-in-itself to its phenomena, that is, the relation of the world
as will to the world as idea; for this will open to us the best way
to a more thorough investigation of the whole subject we are
considering in this second book.
