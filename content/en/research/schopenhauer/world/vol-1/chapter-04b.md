The object is only for the subject as its idea.

This means that every special class of ideas is only for an equally special quality in the subject.

I call this the faculty of perception.

<!-- This subjective correlative of time and space in themselves as
empty forms, has been named by  -->

Kant called as "pure sensibility" the relation of space and time with each other as empty forms. 

<!--  and we
may retain this expression, as Kant was the first to treat of the
subject, though it is not exact, for sensibility presupposes matter. -->

The relation of cause and effect, and matter and action, is understanding.

<!--  subjective correlative of matter or of causation, for these
two are the same, is understanding, which is nothing more than
this.  -->

<!-- To know causality is its one function, its only power; and
it is a great one, embracing much, of manifold application, yet
of unmistakable identity in all its manifestations. Conversely all
causation, that is to say, , through the understanding, and in
the understanding.  -->

Thus all matter, or the whole of reality, is only for the understanding.

The first, simplest, and ever-present example of understanding is the perception of the actual world. 

This is throughout knowledge of the cause from the effect.

Therefore, all perception is intellectual [mental].  

The [mind] understanding could never get perceptions without the animal body. 

Thus, the animal body is the immediate object of the subject.

The perception of all other objects becomes possible through the animal body. 

The changes which every animal body experiences, are immediately felt.

These effects are linked immediately to their causes.

This creates the perception of causal objects. 

This relation is immediate knowledge.

<!-- no conclusion in abstract conceptions; it does not arise from
reflection, nor is it arbitrary, but immediate, necessary, and
certain.  -->

<!-- It is the method of knowing of the pure understanding,
without which there could be no perception; there would only
remain a dull plant-like consciousness of the changes of the
immediate object, which would succeed each other in an utterly
unmeaning way, except in so far as they might have a meaning
for the will either as pain or pleasure. 

But as with the rising of the sun the visible world appears, so at one stroke, the
understanding, by means of its one simple function, changes the
dull, meaningless sensation into perception.  -->

What the eye, the ear, or the hand feels is data, not perception.

The [mind] understanding passes from the effect to the cause.

The world first appears as perception in space, persisting through time.

<!-- varying in
respect of form, persistent through all time in respect of matter; -->

This is because the understanding unites space and time in the idea of matter as causal action. 

The world as idea exists only through and for the [mind] understanding.

In chapter 1 of my essay on “Light and Colour” I explained how the [mind] understanding builds perceptions out of sensory data.

<!-- - compares the impressions which the various senses receive from the object , a child arrives at perceptions; 

how this alone affords the solution
of so many phenomena of the senses; the single vision of two
eyes, the double vision in the case of a squint, or when we try to
look at once at objects which lie at unequal distances behind each
other; and all illusion which is produced by a sudden alteration
in the organs of sense. But I have treated this important subject
much more fully and thoroughly in the second edition of the
essay on “The Principle of Sufficient Reason,” § 21.  -->


The following prove that perception is [mental] intellectual, and not merely of the senses*:
- blind people from birth who have been operated on to gain their eyesight
- the single vision of the double sensation of 2 eyes
- the double vision and double touch which occur when the organs of sense have been displaced from their usual position
- the upright appearance of objects while the picture on the retina is upside down
- the attributing of colour to the outward objects when it is merely an inner function 

<!-- a
division through polarisation, of the activity of the eye, and lastly
the stereoscope, -->

{{< n n="WHAT. THE. FUCK?!? This is Kantian junk!" >}}


Perception is pure knowledge through the [mind] understanding from effect to cause.

<!--  from
the effect, and that, consequently, it presupposes the law of
causality, in a knowledge of which all perception—that is to
say all experience, by virtue of its primary and only possibility,
depends.  -->


This refutes Hume's contrary doctrine that cause and effect comes from experience.

This is because the independence of the [within-the-mind] a priori property of the knowledge of causality of experience can only be deduced from the **dependence** of experience on the [within-the-mind] a priori property of the knowledge of causality.

This deduction can only be accomplished by proving that the knowledge of causality is included in the perception-idea that includes all [sensory data] experience.

Therefore the knowledge of causality (respect of experience) is:
- completely [within the mind] a priori
- does not presuppose experience 
- is a precondition by experience


{{< n n="The Kant-Schopenhauer paradigm leads to a fantasy world where the mind makes its own universe. It is totally opposite of Descartes, Berkeley, and Hume which regards the human mind as not God" >}}


<!-- This, however, cannot be deduced in the manner attempted by Kant, which I have
criticised in the essay on “The Principle of Sufficient Reason,” §
23. -->
