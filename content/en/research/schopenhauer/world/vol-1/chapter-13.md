Abstract rational knowledge is the reflex of ideas of perception and is founded on them.

But it is by no means in such entire congruity with them that it could everywhere take their place: it never corresponds to them quite accurately. 

Thus, many human actions can only be performed by the
help of reason and deliberation, and yet there are some which are
better performed without its assistance. This very incongruity
of sensuous and abstract knowledge, on account of which the
latter always merely approximates to the former, as mosaic
approximates to painting, is the cause of a very remarkable
phenomenon which, like reason itself, is peculiar to human
nature, and of which the explanations that have ever anew been
attempted, are insufficient: I mean laughter. 

On account of
the source of this phenomenon, we cannot avoid giving the
explanation of it here, though it again interrupts the course of our
work to do so. The cause of laughter in every case is simply the
sudden perception of the incongruity between a concept and the
real objects which have been thought through it in some relation,
and laughter itself is just the expression of this incongruity. It
often occurs in this way: two or more real objects are thought
through one concept, and the identity of the concept is transferred
to the objects; it then becomes strikingly apparent from the entire
difference of the objects in other respects, that the concept was
only applicable to them from a one-sided point of view. It occurs
just as often, however, that the incongruity between a single real
object and the concept under which, from one point of view,
it has rightly been subsumed, is suddenly felt. 

The more
correct the subsumption of such objects under a concept may be
from one point of view, and the greater and more glaring their
incongruity with it, from another point of view, the greater is the [077]
ludicrous effect which is produced by this contrast. All laughter
then is occasioned by a paradox, and therefore by unexpected
subsumption, whether this is expressed in words or in actions.
This, briefly stated, is the true explanation of the ludicrous.

I shall not pause here to relate anecdotes as examples to
illustrate my theory; for it is so simple and comprehensible that it does not require them, and everything ludicrous which the
reader may remember is equally valuable as a proof of it. But
the theory is confirmed and illustrated by distinguishing two
species into which the ludicrous is divided, and which result
from the theory. 

Either, we have previously known two or more
very different real objects, ideas of sense-perception, and have
intentionally identified them through the unity of a concept which
comprehends them both; this species of the ludicrous is called
wit. Or, conversely, the concept is first present in knowledge,
and we pass from it to reality, and to operation upon it, to action:
objects which in other respects are fundamentally different, but
which are all thought in that one concept, are now regarded and
treated in the same way, till, to the surprise and astonishment
of the person acting, the great difference of their other aspects
appears: this species of the ludicrous is called folly. Therefore
everything ludicrous is either a flash of wit or a foolish action,
according as the procedure has been from the discrepancy of the
objects to the identity of the concept, or the converse; the former
always intentional, the latter always unintentional, and from
without. To seem to reverse the starting-point, and to conceal wit
with the mask of folly, is the art of the jester and the clown. Being
quite aware of the diversity of the objects, the jester unites them,
with secret wit, under one concept, and then starting from this
concept he receives from the subsequently discovered diversity
of the objects the surprise which he himself prepared. It follows
from this short but sufficient theory of the ludicrous, that, if we[078]
set aside the last case, that of the jester, wit must always show
itself in words, folly generally in actions, though also in words,
when it only expresses an intention and does not actually carry it
out, or when it shows itself merely in judgments and opinions.
Pedantry is a form of folly. It arises in this way: a man
lacks confidence in his own understanding, and, therefore, does
not wish to trust to it, to recognise what is right directly in the
particular case. He, therefore, puts it entirely under the control of
97
the reason, and seeks to be guided by reason in everything; that
is to say, he tries always to proceed from general concepts, rules,
and maxims, and to confine himself strictly to them in life, in
art, and even in moral conduct. Hence that clinging to the form,
to the manner, to the expression and word which is characteristic
of pedantry, and which with it takes the place of the real nature
of the matter. The incongruity then between the concept and
reality soon shows itself here, and it becomes evident that the
former never condescends to the particular case, and that with its
generality and rigid definiteness it can never accurately apply to
the fine distinctions of difference and innumerable modifications
of the actual. Therefore, the pedant, with his general maxims,
almost always misses the mark in life, shows himself to be
foolish, awkward, useless. In art, in which the concept is
unfruitful, he produces lifeless, stiff, abortive mannerisms. Even
with regard to ethics, the purpose to act rightly or nobly cannot
always be carried out in accordance with abstract maxims; for
in many cases the excessively nice distinctions in the nature of
the circumstances necessitate a choice of the right proceeding
directly from the character; for the application of mere abstract
maxims sometimes gives false results, because the maxims only
half apply; and sometimes cannot be carried out, because they
are foreign to the individual character of the actor, and this never [079]
allows itself to be entirely discovered; therefore, inconsistencies
arise. Since then Kant makes it a condition of the moral worth
of an action, that it shall proceed from pure rational abstract
maxims, without any inclination or momentary emotion, we
cannot entirely absolve him from the reproach of encouraging
moral pedantry. This reproach is the significance of Schiller's
epigram, entitled “Scruples of Conscience.” When we speak,
especially in connection with politics, of doctrinaires, theorists,
savants, and so forth, we mean pedants, that is, persons who
know the things well in the abstract, but not in the concrete.
Abstraction consists in thinking away the less general predicates;
98 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
but it is precisely upon these that so much depends in practice.
To complete our theory it remains for us to mention a spurious
kind of wit, the play upon words, the calembourg, the pun, to
which may be added the equivocation, the double entendre, the
chief use of which is the expression of what is obscene. Just
as the witticism brings two very different real objects under one
concept, the pun brings two different concepts, by the assistance
of accident, under one word. The same contrast appears, only
familiar and more superficial, because it does not spring from the
nature of things, but merely from the accident of nomenclature.
In the case of the witticism the identity is in the concept, the
difference in the reality, but in the case of the pun the difference is
in the concepts and the identity in the reality, for the terminology
is here the reality. It would only be a somewhat far-fetched
comparison if we were to say that the pun is related to the
witticism as the parabola (sic) of the upper inverted cone to that
of the lower. The misunderstanding of the word or the quid pro
quo is the unintentional pun, and is related to it exactly as folly
is to wit. Thus the deaf man often affords occasion for laughter,
just as much as the fool, and inferior writers of comedy often[080]
use the former for the latter to raise a laugh.

I have treated laughter here only from the psychical side; with
regard to the physical side, I refer to what is said on the subject
in the “Parerga,” vol. II. ch. vi., § 98.18
