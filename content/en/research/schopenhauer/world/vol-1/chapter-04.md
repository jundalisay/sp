The flow of cognition [principle of sufficient reason] which appears in pure time is the basis of counting and arithmetical calculation


## Succession, Position, Action

It has completely mastered the nature of abstract time. 

Abstrast time is that form of the flow of cognition [principle of sufficient reason] as succession. 

<!-- It has no further significance. -->

Succession is:
- the form of the flow of cognition [principle of sufficient reason] in time
- the whole nature of time

The flow of cognition [principle of sufficient reason] in abstract space is position.

Abstract space is merely that possibility of position. 

Position is the reciprocal determination of the parts of abstract space by other parts. 

This is the subject of geometry.

The flow of cognition in cause and effect fills the forms of space and time with matter as objects of perception.  

Matter is merely causation. 

Its true being is its action.

Only as active does it fill space and time.

Its action on the immediate object (which is itself matter) determines its perception.

The consequence of the action of Material Object 1 on Material Object 2 is known only when Material Object 2 acts on Material Object 3 differently from how Material Object 1 acted on Material Object 2.

Cause and effect thus constitute the whole nature of matter.

Its true being is its action.

The nature of all material things is therefore appropriately called Physical Reality (as opposed to general Reality).

<!--  Wirklichkeit 
a word which is far more expressive than Realität.  -->

The thing acted on is always matter.

Thus the essence of matter is the orderly change of one part on another part.

The existence of matter is therefore entirely relative within [physical] time and space.

<!-- , according to a relation which is valid
only within its limits, as in the case of  -->


But time and space can be abstract whereas matter cannot. 

Matter always exists in physical space.

Its physical action is always in physical time. 

Physical space and time are revealed by matter and by cause and effect. 

<!--  not only, each for
itself, presupposed by matter, but a union of the two constitutes
its essence, for this, as we have seen, consists in action, i.e.,
in causation.  -->

All conceivable phenomena are in infinite space and eternal time. 

<!--  and
 conditions of things, might be coexistent in boundless space,
without limiting each other, or might be successive in endless time
without interfering with each other:  -->

<!-- Thus a necessary relation of these phenomena to each other, and a law which should regulate
them according to such a relation, is by no means needful, would
not, indeed, be applicable: it therefore follows that in the case of -->

There is no causation in co-existence in space and change in time that is independent of each other.

<!-- `` so long as each
of these forms preserves for itself its condition and its course
without any connection with the other, there can be no causation,
and since causation constitutes the essential nature of matter,
there can be no matter.  -->

But the law of causation receives its meaning and necessity only from this, that 

The essence of change is not a mere change in things.

<!--  but
rather in the fact that at the same part of space there is now one
thing and then another, and at one and the same point of time
there is here one thing and there another: only this reciprocal
limitation of space and time by each other gives meaning, and
at the same time necessity, to a law, according to which change
must take place. What is determined by  -->

The law of causality does not merely show a succession of things in time without space, or an existence in a space without time. 

Instead:
- this succession has reference to a definite space
- this place has a different point of time

<!--  and not merely
existence of things in a particular place, but in this place at a -->

Action leads to change.

Change:
- comes from the law of cause and effect
- involves a specific space and time

Cause and effect unites this specific space and time.

The essence of matter is cause and effect. 

Consequently, space and time is also united in matter.

<!-- s to say, matter must take to itself at once the
distinguishing qualities both of space and time, however much
these may be opposed to each other, and must unite in itself
what is impossible for each of these independently, that is, the
fleeting course of time, with the rigid unchangeable perduration
of space: infinite divisibility it receives from both.  -->

This is why co-existence is:
- not in time or in space alone
- first established through matter

<!-- , which could neither be in
time alone, for time has no contiguity, nor in space alone, for
space has no before, after, or now, is first established through
matter. But  -->

The co-existence of many things is the essence of reality.

Through reality, permanence first becomes possible.

Permanence or unchanging is only known when with something changing or impermanent. 

Changing is only known when with something unchanging or permanent. 
 

<!--  the mutation of quality and form in
the permanence of substance, that is to say, in matter.7 -->

If the world were in space alone, it would be rigid and immovable without succession and change and action.

There would be no matter since matter appears through action.

If the world were in time alone, all would be fleeting, without persistence, contiguity, co-existence, and permanence.

There would also be no matter.

Only through the union of space and time do we reach matter.

Matter is the possibility of co-existence, and, through that, of permanence.

Through permanence again matter is the possibility of the persistence of substance in the change of its states.8 

Matter has the stamp of both space and time.

<!--  it bears throughout the stamp of both. It manifests
its origin in space, partly through the form which is inseparable
from it, but especially through its persistence (substance), the a
priori certainty of which is therefore wholly deducible from that
of space9
(for variation belongs to time alone, but in it alone
and for itself nothing is persistent).  -->

Matter springs from time by change from action.

 <!-- quality (accidents), without which it never exists. -->
<!-- and which is plainly always causality, action upon other matter,
and therefore change (a time concept).  -->

The law of this action, however, always depends on space and time together.

The regulative function of causality depends on this specific time and space. 

<!-- is confined entirely to the determination of what must occupy this time and this space. The fact that  -->

We know the characteristics of matter the space and time which it occupies.

<!-- a priori the unalterable  through this derivation of its essential nature from the forms of our knowledge of which
we are conscious a priori.  -->

The unalterable characteristics of matter are known a priori:
- space-occupation, i.e., impenetrability, i.e., causal action,
- consequently, extension, infinite divisibility, persistence, i.e., indestructibility
- mobility

Weight is experiential knowledge, 

Kant, in his “Metaphysical Introduction to Natural Philosophy” p. 71 treats weight as knowable a priori.
