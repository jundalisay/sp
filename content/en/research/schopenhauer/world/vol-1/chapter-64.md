<!-- From our exposition of eternal justice, which is
not mythical but philosophical, we will now proceed to the
kindred investigation of the ethical significance of conduct and
of conscience, which is the merely felt knowledge of that
significance.  -->


What is the nature of that eternal justice?

Human nature has 2 peculiarities that make us obscurely feel:
- eternal justice
- the unity and identity of the will

<!--  in all its phenomena upon which it rests, is
known to every one, at least as an . -->

When a bad deed has been done, the sufferer and the perfectly indifferent spectator feel the desire of revenge.

<!--  affords satisfaction not only
to the sufferer, who for the most part , but also to , to see that he who caused another pain suffers himself a like measure of pain. -->

This is independent of the actual punishment, which is the basis of penal law.


This is the It seems to me that what expresses itself here is nothing but

This shows the consciousness of that eternal justice.

, which is, nevertheless,
at once  and falsified by 

The unenlightened mind, involved in the principium individuationis:
- misunderstands it
- does not see how the offender and the offended are one
<!-- for, , it produces an
amphiboly of the concepts and demands from the phenomenon
what only belongs to the thing in itself.  -->

<!-- , and
that it is the same being which, not recognising itself in its
own manifestation, bears both the pain and the guilt, but it
desires rather 

wants to see the pain also in the particular individual to whom the guilt belongs.  -->

Therefore, most persons would demand that a wicked man who had a very high degree of wickedness matched with not only a man with his own wickedness, but with more wickedness such as a conqueror.  

Most persons would demand that he get all the sufferings that he has inflicted.

<!--  which
might yet occur in many others, only not matched with other
qualities such as are found in him, a man who also far surpassed
others by extraordinary intellectual powers, and who inflicted unspeakable sufferings upon millions of others—for example,
as a conqueror,—most persons, would demand that such
a man should at some time and in some place expiate all these
sufferings by a like amount of pain;  -->

They do not recognise:
- how the inflicter of suffering and the sufferers are one
- that the same will in the sufferer also exists in the inflicter

<!--  exist and live which also appears in the former, and just through him
attains to a distinct revelation of its nature, and which likewise
suffers both in the oppressed and the oppressor; -->

<!--  in
the latter in a greater measure, as the consciousness has attained
a higher degree of clearness and distinctness and the will has
greater vehemence.  -->

The deeper knowledge no longer:
- is involved in the principium individuationis.
- 

 from which all
virtue and nobleness proceed, no longer retains the disposition
which demands requital, is shown by the 

Christian ethics:
- absolutely forbids all requital of evil with evil
- allows eternal justice to proceed in the sphere of the thing-in-itself, which is different from that of the phenomenon.

<!--  (“Vengeance is mine; I
will repay, saith the Lord,”—Rom. xii. 19.) -->


A much more striking but rarer characteristic of

Human nature has the will that wants to realize eternal justice.

<!--  into the province of experience, i.e., of individuality, and
at the same time indicates a felt consciousness that the will to live conducts at its own cost the
great tragedy and comedy, and that the same one will lives in
all manifestations,—such a characteristic, is the following. -->

A man is so deeply moved by a great injury he has experienced, that he stakes his own life to take revenge.

<!--  or, it may be, only witnessed, that he
deliberately and irretrievably 

 vengeance on the perpetrator of that wrong. 

We see him seek
for some mighty oppressor through long  -->

After many years, he murders his oppressor at last.
- Then he himself dies on the scaffold, as he had foreseen

It means that his life had value for him only as a means of vengeance. 

This was done especially by the Spaniards.

<!-- If, now, we consider the
spirit of that  -->

The desire for retribution is very different from common revenge, which seeks to mitigate the suffering.
- It endures through the sight of the suffering inflicted.

It aims at a resolution, not so much revenge as punishment [by inflicting the same pain]. 

Revenge:
- intends an effect in the future.
- has no selfish aim, either for:
  - the avenging person, for it costs him his life, o
  - society which secures its own safety by laws.

That punishment is carried out by individuals, not by the state.

Nor is it in fulfilment of a law, but, on the contrary,

<!-- 78 That Spanish bishop who, in the last war, poisoned both himself and the
French generals at his own table, is an instance of this; and also various
incidents in that war. Examples are also to be found in Montaigne, Bk. ii. ch. -->

always concerns a deed which the state either would not or
could not punish, and the punishment of which it condemns. 

The indignation which carries such a man so far beyond the limits of all self-love springs from the deepest
consciousness that he himself is the whole will to live, which
appears in all beings through all time, and that therefore the most
distant future belongs to him just as the present, and cannot be
indifferent to him. 

Asserting this will, he yet desires that in the
drama which represents its nature no such fearful wrong shall
ever appear again, and wishes to frighten ever future wrong-doer
by the example of a vengeance against which there is no means
of defence, since the avenger is not deterred by the fear of
death. 

The will to live does not here depend any longer upon the particular phenomenon, the
individual.

Instead, it:
- comprehends the Idea of man
- wishes to keep its manifestation pure from such a fearful and shocking wrong.

It is a rare, very significant, and even sublime trait of character through which the individual sacrifices himself by striving to make himself the arm of eternal justice, of the true nature of which he is yet ignorant.
