Since now, as individuals, we have no other knowledge
than that which is subject to the principle of sufficient reason,
and this form of knowledge excludes the Ideas, it is certain that
if it is possible for us to raise ourselves from the knowledge of
particular things to that of the Ideas, this can only happen by
an alteration taking place in the subject which is analogous and
corresponds to the great change of the whole nature of the object,
and by virtue of which the subject, so far as it knows an Idea, is
no more individual.

It will be remembered from the preceding book that knowledge
in general belongs to the objectification of will at its higher
grades, and sensibility, nerves, and brain, just like the other
parts of the organised being, are the expression of the will
at this stage of its objectivity, and therefore the idea which
appears through them is also in the same way bound to the
service of will as a means (º∑«±Ω∑) for the attainment of its
now complicated (¿øª≈ƒμªμ√ƒμ¡±) aims for sustaining a being
of manifold requirements. 

Thus originally and according to its
nature, knowledge is completely subject to the will, and, like
the immediate object, which, by means of the application of
the law of causality, is its starting-point, all knowledge which
proceeds in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason
remains in a closer or more distant relation to the will. 

For
the individual finds his body as an object among objects, to all
of which it is related and connected according to the principle
of sufficient reason. Thus all investigations of these relations[229]
and connections lead back to his body, and consequently to his
will. Since it is the principle of sufficient reason which places
the objects in this relation to the body, and, through it, to the
will, the one endeavour of the knowledge which is subject to
this principle will be to find out the relations in which objects are placed to each other through this principle, and thus to trace
their innumerable connections in space, time, and causality. 

For
only through these is the object interesting to the individual, i.e.,
related to the will. Therefore the knowledge which is subject
to the will knows nothing further of objects than their relations,
knows the objects only so far as they exist at this time, in this
place, under these circumstances, from these causes, and with
these effects—in a word, as particular things; and if all these
relations were to be taken away, the objects would also have
disappeared for it, because it knew nothing more about them.
We must not disguise the fact that what the sciences consider in
things is also in reality nothing more than this; their relations,
the connections of time and space, the causes of natural changes,
the resemblance of forms, the motives of actions,—thus merely
relations. 

What distinguishes science from ordinary knowledge
is merely its systematic form, the facilitating of knowledge by the
comprehension of all particulars in the universal, by means of the
subordination of concepts, and the completeness of knowledge
which is thereby attained. All relation has itself only a relative
existence; for example, all being in time is also non-being; for
time is only that by means of which opposite determinations can
belong to the same thing; therefore every phenomenon which is
in time again is not, for what separates its beginning from its
end is only time, which is essentially a fleeting, inconstant, and
relative thing, here called duration. But time is the most universal
form of all objects of the knowledge which is subject to the will, [230]
and the prototype of its other forms.

Knowledge now, as a rule, remains always subordinate to the
service of the will, as indeed it originated for this service, and
grew, so to speak, to the will, as the head to the body. In the
case of the brutes this subjection of knowledge to the will can
never be abolished. In the case of men it can be abolished only
in exceptional cases, which we shall presently consider more
closely. 

This distinction between man and brute is outwardly expressed by the difference of the relation of the head to the
body. In the case of the lower brutes both are deformed: in all
brutes the head is directed towards the earth, where the objects
of its will lie; even in the higher species the head and the body
are still far more one than in the case of man, whose head seems
freely set upon his body, as if only carried by and not serving it.
This human excellence is exhibited in the highest degree by the
Apollo of Belvedere; the head of the god of the Muses, with eyes
fixed on the far distance, stands so freely on his shoulders that it
seems wholly delivered from the body, and no more subject to
its cares.
