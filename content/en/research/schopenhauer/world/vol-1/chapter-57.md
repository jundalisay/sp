At every grade that is enlightened by knowledge, the will
appears as an individual. The human individual finds himself as
finite in infinite space and time, and consequently as a vanishing
quantity compared with them. 

He is projected into them, and, on
account of their unlimited nature, he has always a merely relative,
never absolute when and where of his existence; for his place and
duration are finite parts of what is infinite and boundless. His
real existence is only in the present, whose unchecked flight into
the past is a constant transition into death, a constant dying. For
his past life, apart from its possible consequences for the present,
and the testimony regarding the will that is expressed in it, is now
entirely done with, dead, and no longer anything; and, therefore,
it must be, as a matter of reason, indifferent to him whether the
content of that past was pain or pleasure. 

But the present is always passing through his hands into the past; the future is quite uncertain and always short. Thus his existence, even when we consider only its formal side, is a constant hurrying of the present into the dead past, a constant dying. But if we look at it from the physical side; it is clear that, as our walking is admittedly merely a constantly prevented falling, the life of our body is only a constantly prevented dying, an ever-postponed death: finally, in the same way, the activity of our mind is a constantly deferred ennui. Every breath we draw wards off the death that is constantly intruding upon us. In this way we fight with it every moment, and again, at longer intervals, through every meal we eat, every sleep we take, every time we warm ourselves, &c. In the end, death must conquer, for we became subject to him through birth, and he only plays for a little while with his prey before he swallows it up. We pursue our life, however, with great interest and much solicitude as long as possible, as we blow out a soap-bubble as long and as large as possible, although we know perfectly well that it will burst.

We saw that the inner being of unconscious nature is a constant
striving without end and without rest. And this appears to us
much more distinctly when we consider the nature of brutes and
man. Willing and striving is its whole being, which may be
very well compared to an unquenchable thirst. 

But the basis
of all willing is need, deficiency, and thus pain. Consequently,
the nature of brutes and man is subject to pain originally and
through its very being. If, on the other hand, it lacks objects
of desire, because it is at once deprived of them by a too easy
satisfaction, a terrible void and ennui comes over it, i.e., its being
and existence itself becomes an unbearable burden to it. Thus
its life swings like a pendulum backwards and forwards between
pain and ennui. This has also had to express itself very oddly in
this way; after man had transferred all pain and torments to hell,
there then remained nothing over for heaven but ennui.

But the constant striving which constitutes the inner nature of
every manifestation of will obtains its primary and most general
foundation at the higher grades of objectification, from the fact
that here the will manifests itself as a living body, with the iron
command to nourish it; and what gives strength to this command
is just that this body is nothing but the objectified will to live
itself. Man, as the most complete objectification of that will, [403]
is in like measure also the most necessitous of all beings: he
is through and through concrete willing and needing; he is a
concretion of a thousand necessities. With these he stands upon
the earth, left to himself, uncertain about everything except his
own need and misery. Consequently the care for the maintenance
of that existence under exacting demands, which are renewed
every day, occupies, as a rule, the whole of human life. 

To this is
directly related the second claim, that of the propagation of the
species. 

At the same time he is threatened from all sides by the
most different kinds of dangers, from which it requires constant watchfulness to escape. With cautious steps and casting anxious
glances round him he pursues his path, for a thousand accidents
and a thousand enemies lie in wait for him. Thus he went while
yet a savage, thus he goes in civilised life; there is no security
for him.

“Qualibus in tenebris vitæ, quantisque periclis
Degitur hocc' ævi, quodcunque est!”—LUCR. ii. 15.

The life of the great majority is only a constant struggle for
this existence itself, with the certainty of losing it at last. But
what enables them to endure this wearisome battle is not so
much the love of life as the fear of death, which yet stands in
the background as inevitable, and may come upon them at any
moment. 

Life itself is a sea, full of rocks and whirlpools, which
man avoids with the greatest care and solicitude, although he
knows that even if he succeeds in getting through with all his
efforts and skill, he yet by doing so comes nearer at every step
to the greatest, the total, inevitable, and irremediable shipwreck,
death; nay, even steers right upon it: this is the final goal of
the laborious voyage, and worse for him than all the rocks from
which he has escaped.

The suffering and misery of life may easily increase to such
an extent that death itself, in the flight from which the whole
of life consists, becomes desirable, and we hasten towards it
voluntarily; and again, on the other hand, that as soon as want
and suffering permit rest to a man, ennui is at once so near that
he necessarily requires diversion. The striving after existence is
what occupies all living things and maintains them in motion.
But when existence is assured, then they know not what to do
with it; thus the second thing that sets them in motion is the
effort to get free from the burden of existence, to make it cease
to be felt, “to kill time,” i.e., to escape from ennui. 

Accordingly we see that almost all men who are secure from want and care,
now that at last they have thrown off all other burdens, become
a burden to themselves, and regard as a gain every hour they
succeed in getting through; and thus every diminution of the
very life which, till then, they have employed all their powers
to maintain as long as possible. Ennui is by no means an evil
to be lightly esteemed; in the end it depicts on the countenance
real despair. It makes beings who love each other so little as
men do, seek each other eagerly, and thus becomes the source
of social intercourse. Moreover, even from motives of policy,
public precautions are everywhere taken against it, as against
other universal calamities. For this evil may drive men to the
greatest excesses, just as much as its opposite extreme, famine:
the people require panem et circenses. The strict penitentiary
system of Philadelphia makes use of ennui alone as a means of
punishment, through solitary confinement and idleness, and it is
found so terrible that it has even led prisoners to commit suicide.
As want is the constant scourge of the people, so ennui is that of
the fashionable world. In middle-class life ennui is represented
by the Sunday, and want by the six week-days.

Thus between desiring and attaining all human life flows on
throughout. The wish is, in its nature, pain; the attainment [405]
soon begets satiety: the end was only apparent; possession takes
away the charm; the wish, the need, presents itself under a new
form; when it does not, then follows desolateness, emptiness,
ennui, against which the conflict is just as painful as against
want. That wish and satisfaction should follow each other neither
too quickly nor too slowly reduces the suffering, which both
occasion to the smallest amount, and constitutes the happiest life.
For that which we might otherwise call the most beautiful part
of life, its purest joy, if it were only because it lifts us out of
real existence and transforms us into disinterested spectators of
it—that is, pure knowledge, which is foreign to all willing, the
pleasure of the beautiful, the true delight in art—this is granted only to a very few, because it demands rare talents, and to these
few only as a passing dream. And then, even these few, on
account of their higher intellectual power, are made susceptible
of far greater suffering than duller minds can ever feel, and are
also placed in lonely isolation by a nature which is obviously
different from that of others; thus here also accounts are squared.

But to the great majority of men purely intellectual pleasures are
not accessible. They are almost quite incapable of the joys which
lie in pure knowledge. They are entirely given up to willing. If,
therefore, anything is to win their sympathy, to be interesting
to them, it must (as is implied in the meaning of the word) in
some way excite their will, even if it is only through a distant
and merely problematical relation to it; the will must not be left
altogether out of the question, for their existence lies far more
in willing than in knowing,—action and reaction is their one
element. We may find in trifles and everyday occurrences the
naïve expressions of this quality. Thus, for example, at any place
worth seeing they may visit, they write their names, in order thus
to react, to affect the place since it does not affect them. Again,
when they see a strange rare animal, they cannot easily confine[406]
themselves to merely observing it; they must rouse it, tease it,
play with it, merely to experience action and reaction; but this
need for excitement of the will manifests itself very specially
in the discovery and support of card-playing, which is quite
peculiarly the expression of the miserable side of humanity.

But whatever nature and fortune may have done, whoever a
man be and whatever he may possess, the pain which is essential
to life cannot be thrown off:—†∑ªμπ¥∑¬ ¥Ω Ûº…æμΩ, π¥…Ω μπ¬
ø≈¡±ΩøΩ μ≈¡≈Ω (Pelides autem ejulavit, intuitus in cælum latum).
And again:—ñ∑Ωø¬ ºμΩ ¿±π¬ ∑± ö¡øΩπøΩø¬, ±≈ƒ±¡ øπ∂≈Ω μπ«øΩ
±¿μπ¡μ√π∑Ω (Jovis quidem filius eram Saturnii; verum ærumnam
habebam infinitam). The ceaseless efforts to banish suffering
accomplish no more than to make it change its form. It is
essentially deficiency, want, care for the maintenance of life. 

If we succeed, which is very difficult, in removing pain in this form,
it immediately assumes a thousand others, varying according to
age and circumstances, such as lust, passionate love, jealousy,
envy, hatred, anxiety, ambition, covetousness, sickness, &c., &c.
If at last it can find entrance in no other form, it comes in the
sad, grey garments of tediousness and ennui, against which we
then strive in various ways. If finally we succeed in driving this
away, we shall hardly do so without letting pain enter in one of
its earlier forms, and the dance begin again from the beginning;
for all human life is tossed backwards and forwards between pain
and ennui. Depressing as this view of life is, I will draw attention,
by the way, to an aspect of it from which consolation may be
drawn, and perhaps even a stoical indifference to one's own
present ills may be attained. For our impatience at these arises
for the most part from the fact that we regard them as brought
about by a chain of causes which might easily be different. We
do not generally grieve over ills which are directly necessary and
quite universal; for example, the necessity of age and of death, [407]
and many daily inconveniences. It is rather the consideration
of the accidental nature of the circumstances that brought some
sorrow just to us, that gives it its sting. But if we have recognised
that pain, as such, is inevitable and essential to life, and that
nothing depends upon chance but its mere fashion, the form
under which it presents itself, that thus our present sorrow fills
a place that, without it, would at once be occupied by another
which now is excluded by it, and that therefore fate can affect us
little in what is essential; such a reflection, if it were to become a
living conviction, might produce a considerable degree of stoical
equanimity, and very much lessen the anxious care for our own
well-being. But, in fact, such a powerful control of reason over
directly felt suffering seldom or never occurs.
Besides, through this view of the inevitableness of pain, of
the supplanting of one pain by another, and the introduction of
a new pain through the passing away of that which preceded it,
406 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
one might be led to the paradoxical but not absurd hypothesis,
that in every individual the measure of the pain essential to him
was determined once for all by his nature, a measure which
could neither remain empty, nor be more than filled, however
much the form of the suffering might change. Thus his suffering
and well-being would by no means be determined from without,
but only through that measure, that natural disposition, which
indeed might experience certain additions and diminutions from
the physical condition at different times, but yet, on the whole,
would remain the same, and would just be what is called the
temperament, or, more accurately, the degree in which he might
be μ≈∫øªø¬ or ¥≈√∫øªø¬, as Plato expresses it in the First Book
of the Republic, i.e., in an easy or difficult mood. This hypothesis
is supported not only by the well-known experience that great
suffering makes all lesser ills cease to be felt, and conversely
that freedom from great suffering makes even the most trifling
inconveniences torment us and put us out of humour; but[408]
experience also teaches that if a great misfortune, at the mere
thought of which we shuddered, actually befalls us, as soon as we
have overcome the first pain of it, our disposition remains for the
most part unchanged; and, conversely, that after the attainment
of some happiness we have long desired, we do not feel ourselves
on the whole and permanently very much better off and agreeably
situated than before. Only the moment at which these changes
occur affects us with unusual strength, as deep sorrow or exulting
joy, but both soon pass away, for they are based upon illusion.
For they do not spring from the immediately present pleasure
or pain, but only from the opening up of a new future which is
anticipated in them. Only by borrowing from the future could
pain or pleasure be heightened so abnormally, and consequently
not enduringly. It would follow, from the hypothesis advanced,
that a large part of the feeling of suffering and of well-being
would be subjective and determined a priori, as is the case with
knowing; and we may add the following remarks as evidence in favour of it. Human cheerfulness or dejection are manifestly
not determined by external circumstances, such as wealth and
position, for we see at least as many glad faces among the poor
as among the rich. 

Further, the motives which induce suicide
are so very different, that we can assign no motive that is so
great as to bring it about, even with great probability, in every
character, and few that would be so small that the like of them
had never caused it. Now although the degree of our serenity
or sadness is not at all times the same, yet, in consequence of
this view, we shall not attribute it to the change of outward
circumstances, but to that of the inner condition, the physical
state. For when an actual, though only temporary, increase of
our serenity, even to the extent of joyfulness, takes place, it
usually appears without any external occasion. It is true that
we often see our pain arise only from some definite external [409]
relation, and are visibly oppressed and saddened by this only.
Then we believe that if only this were taken away, the greatest
contentment would necessarily ensue. But this is illusion. The
measure of our pain and our happiness is on the whole, according
to our hypothesis, subjectively determined for each point of time,
and the motive for sadness is related to that, just as a blister
which draws to a head all the bad humours otherwise distributed
is related to the body. The pain which is at that period of
time essential to our nature, and therefore cannot be shaken off,
would, without the definite external cause of our suffering, be
divided at a hundred points, and appear in the form of a hundred
little annoyances and cares about things which we now entirely
overlook, because our capacity for pain is already filled by that
chief evil which has concentrated in a point all the suffering
otherwise dispersed. This corresponds also to the observation
that if a great and pressing care is lifted from our breast by its
fortunate issue, another immediately takes its place, the whole
material of which was already there before, yet could not come
into consciousness as care because there was no capacity left for it, and therefore this material of care remained indistinct
and unobserved in a cloudy form on the farthest horizon of
consciousness. But now that there is room, this prepared material
at once comes forward and occupies the throne of the reigning
care of the day (¿¡≈ƒ±Ωμ≈ø≈√±). And if it is very much lighter
in its matter than the material of the care which has vanished, it
knows how to blow itself out so as apparently to equal it in size,
and thus, as the chief care of the day, completely fills the throne.

Excessive joy and very keen suffering always occur in the
same person, for they condition each other reciprocally, and are
also in common conditioned by great activity of the mind. Both
are produced, as we have just seen, not by what is really present,
but by the anticipation of the future. But since pain is essential to[410]
life, and its degree is also determined by the nature of the subject,
sudden changes, because they are always external, cannot really
alter its degree. Thus an error and delusion always lies at
the foundation of immoderate joy or grief, and consequently
both these excessive strainings of the mind can be avoided by
knowledge. Every immoderate joy (exultatio, insolens lætitia)
always rests on the delusion that one has found in life what can
never be found there—lasting satisfaction of the harassing desires
and cares, which are constantly breeding new ones. From every
particular delusion of this kind one must inevitably be brought
back later, and then when it vanishes must pay for it with pain
as bitter as the joy its entrance caused was keen. So far, then, it
is precisely like a height from which one can come down only
by a fall. Therefore one ought to avoid them; and every sudden
excessive grief is just a fall from some such height, the vanishing
of such a delusion, and so conditioned by it. Consequently we
might avoid them both if we had sufficient control over ourselves
to survey things always with perfect clearness as a whole and in
their connection, and steadfastly to guard against really lending
them the colours which we wish they had. The principal effort
of the Stoical ethics was to free the mind from all such delusion and its consequences, and to give it instead an equanimity that
could not be disturbed. It is this insight that inspires Horace in
the well-known ode—

“Æquam memento rebus in arduiis
Servare mentem, non secus in bonis
Ab insolenti temperatam
Lætitia.”

For the most part, however, we close our minds against the
knowledge, which may be compared to a bitter medicine, that
suffering is essential to life, and therefore does not flow in upon
us from without, but that every one carries about with him its
perennial source in his own heart. We rather seek constantly [411]
for an external particular cause, as it were, a pretext for the pain
which never leaves us, just as the free man makes himself an
idol, in order to have a master. For we unweariedly strive from
wish to wish; and although every satisfaction, however much it
promised, when attained fails to satisfy us, but for the most part
comes presently to be an error of which we are ashamed, yet we
do not see that we draw water with the sieve of the Danaides, but
ever hasten to new desires.

“Sed, dum abest quod avemus, id exsuperare videtur
Cætera; post aliud, quum contigit illud, avemus;
Et sitis æqua tenet vitai semper hiantes.”—LUCR. iii. 1095.

Thus it either goes on for ever, or, what is more rare and
presupposes a certain strength of character, till we reach a wish
which is not satisfied and yet cannot be given up. In that case
we have, as it were, found what we sought, something that we
can always blame, instead of our own nature, as the source of
our suffering. And thus, although we are now at variance with
our fate, we are reconciled to our existence, for the knowledge is
again put far from us that suffering is essential to this existence
itself, and true satisfaction impossible. The result of this form of
development is a somewhat melancholy disposition, the constant
endurance of a single great pain, and the contempt for all lesser
sorrows or joys that proceeds from it; consequently an already
nobler phenomenon than that constant seizing upon ever-new
forms of illusion, which is much more common.
