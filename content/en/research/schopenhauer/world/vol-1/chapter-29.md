<!-- I here conclude the second principal division of my exposition, in the hope that, so far as is possible in the case of
an entirely new thought, which cannot be quite free from traces
of the individuality in which it originated, I have succeeded in
conveying to the reader the complete certainty that this world in
which we live and have our being is in its whole nature through
and through will, and at the same time through and through idea: -->

<!-- 42 Cf. Chaps. xxvi. and xxvii. of the Supplement. -->

This idea, as such, already presupposes a form, object and
subject, is therefore relative; and if we ask what remains if we
take away this form, and all those forms which are subordinate
to it, and which express the principle of sufficient reason, the
answer must be that as something toto genere different from
idea, this can be nothing but will, which is thus properly the
thing-in-itself. 

Every one finds that he himself is this will, in
which the real nature of the world consists, and he also finds [212]
that he is the knowing subject, whose idea the whole world is,
the world which exists only in relation to his consciousness, as
its necessary supporter. Every one is thus himself in a double
aspect the whole world, the microcosm; finds both sides whole
and complete in himself. And what he thus recognises as his
own real being also exhausts the being of the whole world—the
macrocosm; thus the world, like man, is through and through will,
and through and through idea, and nothing more than this. So we
see the philosophy of Thales, which concerned the macrocosm,
unite at this point with that of Socrates, which dealt with the
microcosm, for the object of both is found to be the same. But
all the knowledge that has been communicated in the two first
books will gain greater completeness, and consequently greater
certainty, from the two following books, in which I hope that
several questions that have more or less distinctly arisen in the
course of our work will also be sufficiently answered.

In the meantime one such question may be more particularly
considered, for it can only properly arise so long as one has not
fully penetrated the meaning of the foregoing exposition, and
may so far serve as an illustration of it. It is this: Every will is
a will towards something, has an object, an end of its willing;
what then is the final end, or towards what is that will striving
that is exhibited to us as the being-in-itself of the world? This
question rests, like so many others, upon the confusion of the
thing-in-itself with the manifestation. 

The principle of sufficient
reason, of which the law of motivation is also a form, extends only to the latter, not to the former. It is only of phenomena,
of individual things, that a ground can be given, never of the
will itself, nor of the Idea in which it adequately objectifies
itself. So then of every particular movement or change of any
kind in nature, a cause is to be sought, that is, a condition that
of necessity produced it, but never of the natural force itself which is revealed in this and innumerable similar phenomena;
and it is therefore simple misunderstanding, arising from want of
consideration, to ask for a cause of gravity, electricity, and so on.
Only if one had somehow shown that gravity and electricity were
not original special forces of nature, but only the manifestations
of a more general force already known, would it be allowable to
ask for the cause which made this force produce the phenomena
of gravity or of electricity here. All this has been explained at
length above. In the same way every particular act of will of a
knowing individual (which is itself only a manifestation of will
as the thing-in-itself) has necessarily a motive without which
that act would never have occurred; but just as material causes
contain merely the determination that at this time, in this place,
and in this matter, a manifestation of this or that natural force
must take place, so the motive determines only the act of will
of a knowing being, at this time, in this place, and under these
circumstances, as a particular act, but by no means determines
that that being wills in general or wills in this manner; this is the
expression of his intelligible character, which, as will itself, the
thing-in-itself, is without ground, for it lies outside the province
of the principle of sufficient reason. Therefore every man has
permanent aims and motives by which he guides his conduct, and
he can always give an account of his particular actions; but if he
were asked why he wills at all, or why in general he wills to exist,
he would have no answer, and the question would indeed seem
to him meaningless; and this would be just the expression of his
consciousness that he himself is nothing but will, whose willing
stands by itself and requires more particular determination by motives only in its individual acts at each point of time.

In fact, freedom from all aim, from all limits, belongs to the
nature of the will, which is an endless striving. This was already
touched on above in the reference to centrifugal force. It also discloses itself in its simplest form in the lowest grade of the
objectification of will, in gravitation, which we see constantly
exerting itself, though a final goal is obviously impossible for it.

For if, according to its will, all existing matter were collected in
one mass, yet within this mass gravity, ever striving towards the
centre, would still wage war with impenetrability as rigidity or
elasticity. The tendency of matter can therefore only be confined,
never completed or appeased. But this is precisely the case with
all tendencies of all phenomena of will. Every attained end is
also the beginning of a new course, and so on ad infinitum. The
plant raises its manifestation from the seed through the stem
and the leaf to the blossom and the fruit, which again is the
beginning of a new seed, a new individual, that runs through
the old course, and so on through endless time. Such also is
the life of the animal; procreation is its highest point, and after
attaining to it, the life of the first individual quickly or slowly
sinks, while a new life ensures to nature the endurance of the
species and repeats the same phenomena. Indeed, the constant
renewal of the matter of every organism is also to be regarded as
merely the manifestation of this continual pressure and change,
and physiologists are now ceasing to hold that it is the necessary
reparation of the matter wasted in motion, for the possible
wearing out of the machine can by no means be equivalent to the
support it is constantly receiving through nourishment. Eternal
becoming, endless flux, characterises the revelation of the inner
nature of will. Finally, the same thing shows itself in human
endeavours and desires, which always delude us by presenting
their satisfaction as the final end of will. 

As soon as we attain
to them they no longer appear the same, and therefore they soon
grow stale, are forgotten, and though not openly disowned, are yet always thrown aside as vanished illusions. We are fortunate
enough if there still remains something to wish for and to strive after, that the game may be kept up of constant transition from
desire to satisfaction, and from satisfaction to a new desire, the
rapid course of which is called happiness, and the slow course
sorrow, and does not sink into that stagnation that shows itself in
fearful ennui that paralyses life, vain yearning without a definite
object, deadening languor. 

According to all this, when the will
is enlightened by knowledge, it always knows what it wills now
and here, never what it wills in general; every particular act of
will has its end, the whole will has none; just as every particular
phenomenon of nature is determined by a sufficient cause so
far as concerns its appearance in this place at this time, but the
force which manifests itself in it has no general cause, for it
belongs to the thing-in-itself, to the groundless will. The single
example of self-knowledge of the will as a whole is the idea as
a whole, the whole world of perception. It is the objectification,
the revelation, the mirror of the will. What the will expresses in
it will be the subject of our further consideration.43

Third Book. The World As Idea.
Second Aspect. The Idea Independent Of
The Principle Of Sufficient Reason: The
Platonic Idea: The Object Of Art. -->


§ 30. In the First Book the world was explained as mere idea,
object for a subject. In the Second Book we considered it from
its other side, and found that in this aspect it is will, which
proved to be simply that which this world is besides being
idea. In accordance with this knowledge we called the world
as idea, both as a whole and in its parts, the objectification of
will, which therefore means the will become object, i.e., idea.
Further, we remember that this objectification of will was found
to have many definite grades, in which, with gradually increasing
distinctness and completeness, the nature of will appears in the
idea, that is to say, presents itself as object. 

In these grades
we already recognised the Platonic Ideas, for the grades are just
the determined species, or the original unchanging forms and
qualities of all natural bodies, both organised and unorganised,
and also the general forces which reveal themselves according to
natural laws. These Ideas, then, as a whole express themselves
in innumerable individuals and particulars, and are related to these as archetypes to their copies. The multiplicity of such
individuals is only conceivable through time and space, their
appearing and passing away through causality, and in all these
forms we recognise merely the different modes of the principle
of sufficient reason, which is the ultimate principle of all that
is finite, of all individual existence, and the universal form of
the idea as it appears in the knowledge of the individual as
such. The Platonic Idea, on the other hand, does not come[220]
under this principle, and has therefore neither multiplicity nor
change. While the individuals in which it expresses itself are
innumerable, and unceasingly come into being and pass away,
it remains unchanged as one and the same, and the principle of
sufficient reason has for it no meaning. As, however, this is the
form under which all knowledge of the subject comes, so far as
the subject knows as an individual, the Ideas lie quite outside the
sphere of its knowledge. If, therefore, the Ideas are to become
objects of knowledge, this can only happen by transcending the
individuality of the knowing subject. The more exact and detailed
explanation of this is what will now occupy our attention.
