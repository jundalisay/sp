The meaning for which we seek of that world which is present to us only as our idea, or the transition from
the world as mere idea of the knowing subject to whatever it
may be besides this, would never be found if the investigator
himself were nothing more than the pure knowing subject (a
winged cherub without a body). 

But he is himself rooted in that world; he finds himself in it as an individual, that is to say,
his knowledge, which is the necessary supporter of the whole
world as idea, is yet always given through the medium of a
body, whose affections are, as we have shown, the starting-point
for the understanding in the perception of that world. 

His body
is, for the pure knowing subject, an idea like every other idea,
an object among objects. 

Its movements and actions are so
far known to him in precisely the same way as the changes of
all other perceived objects, and would be just as strange and
incomprehensible to him if their meaning were not explained
for him in an entirely different way. Otherwise he would see
his actions follow upon given motives with the constancy of a
law of nature, just as the changes of other objects follow upon
causes, stimuli, or motives. 

But he would not understand the
influence of the motives any more than the connection between
every other effect which he sees and its cause. He would then call
the inner nature of these manifestations and actions of his body
which he did not understand a force, a quality, or a character,
as he pleased, but he would have no further insight into it. But
all this is not the case; indeed the answer to the riddle is given
to the subject of knowledge who appears as an individual, and
the answer is will. This and this alone gives him the key to his
own existence, reveals to him the significance, shows him the
inner mechanism of his being, of his action, of his movements.
The body is given in two entirely different ways to the subject of
knowledge, who becomes an individual only through his identity
with it. It is given as an idea in intelligent perception, as an
object among objects and subject to the laws of objects. And it is[130]
also given in quite a different way as that which is immediately
known to every one, and is signified by the word will. 

Every true
act of his will is also at once and without exception a movement of his body. The act of will and the movement of the body
are not two different things objectively known, which the bond
of causality unites; they do not stand in the relation of cause
and effect; they are one and the same, but they are given in
entirely different ways,—immediately, and again in perception
for the understanding. The action of the body is nothing but the
act of the will objectified, i.e., passed into perception. It will
appear later that this is true of every movement of the body, not
merely those which follow upon motives, but also involuntary
movements which follow upon mere stimuli, and, indeed, that
the whole body is nothing but objectified will, i.e., will become
idea. 

All this will be proved and made quite clear in the course
of this work. In one respect, therefore, I shall call the body the
objectivity of will; as in the previous book, and in the essay on the
principle of sufficient reason, in accordance with the one-sided
point of view intentionally adopted there (that of the idea), I
called it the immediate object. Thus in a certain sense we may
also say that will is the knowledge a priori of the body, and the
body is the knowledge a posteriori of the will. 

Resolutions of the will which relate to the future are merely deliberations of
the reason about what we shall will at a particular time, not real
acts of will. Only the carrying out of the resolve stamps it as
will, for till then it is never more than an intention that may be
changed, and that exists only in the reason in abstracto. It is only
in reflection that to will and to act are different; in reality they are
one. Every true, genuine, immediate act of will is also, at once
and immediately, a visible act of the body. And, corresponding
to this, every impression upon the body is also, on the other hand,
at once and immediately an impression upon the will. 

As such it is called pain when it is opposed to the will; gratification or
pleasure when it is in accordance with it. The degrees of both
are widely different. It is quite wrong, however, to call pain and
pleasure ideas, for they are by no means ideas, but immediate
affections of the will in its manifestation, the body; compulsory, instantaneous willing or not-willing of the impression which the
body sustains. There are only a few impressions of the body
which do not touch the will, and it is through these alone that
the body is an immediate object of knowledge, for, as perceived
by the understanding, it is already an indirect object like all
others. These impressions are, therefore, to be treated directly
as mere ideas, and excepted from what has been said. 

The impressions we refer to are the affections of the purely objective
senses of sight, hearing, and touch, though only so far as these
organs are affected in the way which is specially peculiar to
their specific nature. This affection of them is so excessively
weak an excitement of the heightened and specifically modified
sensibility of these parts that it does not affect the will, but
only furnishes the understanding with the data out of which the
perception arises, undisturbed by any excitement of the will. But
every stronger or different kind of affection of these organs of
sense is painful, that is to say, against the will, and thus they also
belong to its objectivity. Weakness of the nerves shows itself
in this, that the impressions which have only such a degree of
strength as would usually be sufficient to make them data for the
understanding reach the higher degree at which they influence the
will, that is to say, give pain or pleasure, though more often pain,
which is, however, to some extent deadened and inarticulate,
so that not only particular tones and strong light are painful to
us, but there ensues a generally unhealthy and hypochondriacal
disposition which is not distinctly understood. The identity of
the body and the will shows itself further, among other ways, in[132]
the circumstance that every vehement and excessive movement
of the will, i.e., every emotion, agitates the body and its inner
constitution directly, and disturbs the course of its vital functions.
This is shown in detail in “Will in Nature,” p. 27 of the second
edition and p. 28 of the third.
Lastly, the knowledge which I have of my will, though it
is immediate, cannot be separated from that which I have of
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 147
my body. I know my will, not as a whole, not as a unity, not
completely, according to its nature, but I know it only in its
particular acts, and therefore in time, which is the form of the
phenomenal aspect of my body, as of every object. Therefore the
body is a condition of the knowledge of my will. 

Thus, I cannot
really imagine this will apart from my body. In the essay on
the principle of sufficient reason, the will, or rather the subject
of willing, is treated as a special class of ideas or objects. But
even there we saw this object become one with the subject; that
is, we saw it cease to be an object. We there called this union
the miracle ∫±ƒΩ μæø«∑Ω, and the whole of the present work is
to a certain extent an explanation of this. 

So far as I know
my will specially as object, I know it as body. But then I am
again at the first class of ideas laid down in that essay, i.e., real
objects. As we proceed we shall see always more clearly that
these ideas of the first class obtain their explanation and solution
from those of the fourth class given in the essay, which could
no longer be properly opposed to the subject as object, and that,
therefore, we must learn to understand the inner nature of the
law of causality which is valid in the first class, and of all that
happens in accordance with it from the law of motivation which
governs the fourth class.

The identity of the will and the body, of which we have
now given a cursory explanation, can only be proved in the
manner we have adopted here. We have proved this identity
for the first time, and shall do so more and more fully in the course of this work. By “proved” we mean raised from the
immediate consciousness, from knowledge in the concrete to
abstract knowledge of the reason, or carried over into abstract
knowledge. On the other hand, from its very nature it can never
be demonstrated, that is, deduced as indirect knowledge from
some other more direct knowledge, just because it is itself the
most direct knowledge; and if we do not apprehend it and stick
to it as such, we shall expect in vain to receive it again in some indirect way as derivative knowledge. It is knowledge of quite
a special kind, whose truth cannot therefore properly be brought
under any of the four rubrics under which I have classified all
truth in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason, § 29,
the logical, the empirical, the metaphysical, and the metalogical,
for it is not, like all these, the relation of an abstract idea to
another idea, or to the necessary form of perceptive or of abstract
ideation, but it is the relation of a judgment to the connection
which an idea of perception, the body, has to that which is not
an idea at all, but something toto genere different, will. I should
like therefore to distinguish this from all other truth, and call it
∫±ƒΩ μæø«∑Ω philosophical truth. We can turn the expression of
this truth in different ways and say: My body and my will are
one;—or, What as an idea of perception I call my body, I call
my will, so far as I am conscious of it in an entirely different
way which cannot be compared to any other;—or, My body is
the objectivity of my will;—or, My body considered apart from
the fact that it is my idea is still my will, and so forth.
