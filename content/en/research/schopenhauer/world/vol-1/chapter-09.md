Concepts form a distinct class of ideas.

These:
- exist only in the mind of man
- are entirely different from the ideas of perception

We can therefore never attain to a sensuous and, properly speaking, evident knowledge
of their nature, but only to a knowledge which is abstract and
discursive. 

It would, therefore, be absurd to demand that they
should be verified in experience, if by experience is meant the real
external world, which consists of ideas of perception, or that they
should be brought before the eyes or the imagination like objects
of perception. 

They can only be thought, not perceived, and only
the effects which men accomplish through them are properly
objects of experience. Such effects are language, preconceived
and planned action and science, and all that results from these.

Speech, as an object of outer experience, is obviously nothing more than a very complete telegraph, which communicates
arbitrary signs with the greatest rapidity and the finest distinctions
of difference.

But what do these signs mean? How are they interpreted? 

When some one speaks, do we at once translate
his words into pictures of the fancy, which instantaneously flash
upon us, arrange and link themselves together, and assume form
and colour according to the words that are poured forth, and
their grammatical inflections? 

What a tumult there would be in
our brains while we listened to a speech, or to the reading of a
book? But what actually happens is not this at all. 

The meaning
of a speech is, as a rule, immediately grasped, accurately and
distinctly taken in, without the imagination being brought into
play. It is reason which speaks to reason, keeping within its own
province. It communicates and receives abstract conceptions,
ideas that cannot be presented in perceptions, which are framed
once for all, and are relatively few in number, but which yet
encompass, contain, and represent all the innumerable objects of
the actual world. 

This itself is sufficient to prove that the lower
animals can never learn to speak or comprehend, although they
have the organs of speech and ideas of perception in common
with us. But because words represent this perfectly distinct class
of ideas, whose subjective correlative is reason, they are without
sense and meaning for the brutes. 

Thus language, like every other
manifestation which we ascribe to reason, and like everything
which distinguishes man from the brutes, is to be explained
from this as its one simple source—conceptions, abstract ideas
which cannot be presented in perception, but are general, and
have no individual existence in space and time. Only in single
cases do we pass from the conception to the perception, do we
construct images as representatives of concepts in perception,
to which, however, they are never adequate. These cases are [052]
fully discussed in the essay on the principle of sufficient reason,
§ 28, and therefore I shall not repeat my explanation here. It
may be compared, however, with what is said by Hume in the
twelfth of his “Philosophical Essays,” p. 244, and by Herder in
the “Metacritik,” pt. i. p. 274 (an otherwise worthless book). The
Platonic idea, the possibility of which depends upon the union of
72 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
imagination and reason, is the principal subject of the third book
of this work.
Although concepts are fundamentally different from ideas of
perception, they stand in a necessary relation to them, without
which they would be nothing. This relation therefore constitutes
the whole nature and existence of concepts. Reflection is the
necessary copy or repetition of the originally presented world
of perception, but it is a special kind of copy in an entirely
different material. Thus concepts may quite properly be called
ideas of ideas. The principle of sufficient reason has here also a
special form. Now we have seen that the form under which the
principle of sufficient reason appears in a class of ideas always
constitutes and exhausts the whole nature of the class, so far as
it consists of ideas, so that time is throughout succession, and
nothing more; space is throughout position, and nothing more;
matter is throughout causation, and nothing more. In the same
way the whole nature of concepts, or the class of abstract ideas,
consists simply in the relation which the principle of sufficient
reason expresses in them; and as this is the relation to the ground
of knowledge, the whole nature of the abstract idea is simply
and solely its relation to another idea, which is its ground of
knowledge. This, indeed, may, in the first instance, be a concept,
an abstract idea, and this again may have only a similar abstract
ground of knowledge; but the chain of grounds of knowledge
does not extend ad infinitum; it must end at last in a concept
which has its ground in knowledge of perception; for the whole
world of reflection rests on the world of perception as its ground[053]
of knowledge. Hence the class of abstract ideas is in this respect
distinguished from other classes; in the latter the principle of
sufficient reason always demands merely a relation to another
idea of the same class, but in the case of abstract ideas, it at last
demands a relation to an idea of another class.

Those concepts which, as has just been pointed out, are not
immediately related to the world of perception, but only through the medium of one, or it may be several other concepts, have
been called by preference abstracta, and those which have their
ground immediately in the world of perception have been called
concreta. But this last name is only loosely applicable to the
concepts denoted by it, for they are always merely abstracta,
and not ideas of perception. 

These names, which have originated
in a very dim consciousness of the distinctions they imply, may
yet, with this explanation, be retained. As examples of the first
kind of concepts, i.e., abstracta in the fullest sense, we may take
“relation,” “virtue,” “investigation,” “beginning,” and so on. As
examples of the second kind, loosely called concreta, we may
take such concepts as “man,” “stone,” “horse,” &c. If it were not
a somewhat too pictorial and therefore absurd simile, we might
very appropriately call the latter the ground floor, and the former
the upper stories of the building of reflection.13

It is not, as is commonly supposed, an essential characteristic
of a concept that it should contain much under it, that is to say,
that many ideas of perception, or it may be other abstract ideas,
should stand to it in the relation of its ground of knowledge, i.e.,
be thought through it. This is merely a derived and secondary
characteristic, and, as a matter of fact, does not always exist,
though it must always exist potentially. This characteristic arises
from the fact that a concept is an idea of an idea, i.e., its whole [054]
nature consists in its relation to another idea; but as it is not this
idea itself, which is generally an idea of perception and therefore
belongs to quite a different class, the latter may have temporal,
spacial, and other determinations, and in general many relations
which are not thought along with it in the concept. Thus we see
that several ideas which are different in unessential particulars
may be thought by means of one concept, i.e., may be brought
under it. Yet this power of embracing several things is not an
essential but merely an accidental characteristic of the concept.

74 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
There may be concepts through which only one real object is
thought, but which are nevertheless abstract and general, by no
means capable of presentation individually and as perceptions.
Such, for example, is the conception which any one may have of
a particular town which he only knows from geography; although
only this one town is thought under it, it might yet be applied
to several towns differing in certain respects. We see then
that a concept is not general because of being abstracted from
several objects; but conversely, because generality, that is to say,
non-determination of the particular, belongs to the concept as an
abstract idea of the reason, different things can be thought by
means of the same one.
It follows from what has been said that every concept, just
because it is abstract and incapable of presentation in perception,
and is therefore not a completely determined idea, has what is
called extension or sphere, even in the case in which only one real
object exists that corresponds to it. Now we always find that the
sphere of one concept has something in common with the sphere
of other concepts. That is to say, part of what is thought under
one concept is the same as what is thought under other concepts;
and conversely, part of what is thought under these concepts is
the same as what is thought under the first; although, if they
are really different concepts, each of them, or at least one of[055]
them, contains something which the other does not contain; this
is the relation in which every subject stands to its predicate. The
recognition of this relation is called judgment. The representation
of these spheres by means of figures in space, is an exceedingly
happy idea. It first occurred to Gottfried Plouquet, who used
squares for the purpose. Lambert, although later than him, used
only lines, which he placed under each other. Euler carried
out the idea completely with circles. Upon what this complete
analogy between the relations of concepts, and those of figures in
space, ultimately rests, I am unable to say. It is, however, a very
fortunate circumstance for logic that all the relations of concepts,
75
according to their possibility, i.e., a priori, may be made plain in
perception by the use of such figures, in the following way:—
(1.) The spheres of two concepts coincide: for example the
concept of necessity and the concept of following from given
grounds, in the same way the concepts of Ruminantia and Bisulca
(ruminating and cloven-hoofed animals), also those of vertebrate
and red-blooded animals (although there might be some doubt
about this on account of the annelida): they are convertible
concepts. Such concepts are represented by a single circle which
stands for either of them.

(2.) The sphere of one concept includes that of the other.

(3.) A sphere includes two or more spheres which exclude
each other and fill it.

(4.) Two spheres include each a part of the other.

(5.) Two spheres lie in a third, but do not fill it.

This last case applies to all concepts whose spheres have
nothing immediately in common, for there is always a third
sphere, often a much wider one, which includes both.

To these cases all combinations of concepts may be referred,
and from them the entire doctrine of the judgment, its conversion,
contraposition, equipollence, disjunction (this according to the
third figure) may be deduced. From these also may be derived the[057]
properties of the judgment, upon which Kant based his pretended
categories of the understanding, with the exception however of
the hypothetical form, which is not a combination of concepts,
but of judgments. A full account is given in the Appendix of
“Modality,” and indeed of every property of judgments on which
the categories are founded.

With regard to the possible combinations of concepts which
we have given, it has only further to be remarked that they may
also be combined with each other in many ways. 

For example, the fourth figure with the second. Only if one sphere, which
partly or wholly contains another, is itself contained in a third
sphere, do these together exemplify the syllogism in the first
figure, i.e., that combination of judgments, by means of which
it is known that a concept which is partly or wholly contained
in another concept, is also contained in a third concept, which
again contains the first: and also, conversely, the negation; the
pictorial representation of which can, of course, only be two
connected spheres which do not lie within a third sphere. If many
spheres are brought together in this way we get a long train of
syllogisms. This schematism of concepts, which has already been
fairly well explained in more than one textbook, may be used
as the foundation of the doctrine of the judgment, and indeed
of the whole syllogistic theory, and in this way the treatment
of both becomes very easy and simple. Because, through it, all
syllogistic rules may be seen in their origin, and may be deduced
and explained. It is not necessary, however, to load the memory
with these rules, as logic is never of practical use, but has only a
theoretical interest for philosophy. 

For although it may be said
that logic is related to rational thinking as thorough-bass is to
music, or less exactly, as ethics is to virtue, or æsthetics to art; we
must yet remember that no one ever became an artist by the study
of æsthetics; that a noble character was never formed by the study [058]
of ethics; that long before Rameau, men composed correctly and
beautifully, and that we do not need to know thorough-bass in
order to detect discords: and just as little do we need to know
logic in order to avoid being misled by fallacies. Yet it must be
conceded that thorough-bass is of the greatest use in the practice
of musical composition, although it may not be necessary for
the understanding of it; and indeed æsthetics and even ethics,
though in a much less degree, and for the most part negatively,
may be of some use in practice, so that we cannot deny them all
practical worth, but of logic even this much cannot be conceded.
It is nothing more than the knowledge in the abstract of what
78 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
every one knows in the concrete. Therefore we call in the aid
of logical rules, just as little to enable us to construct a correct
argument as to prevent us from consenting to a false one, and
the most learned logician lays aside the rules of logic altogether
in his actual thought. This may be explained in the following
way. Every science is a system of general and therefore abstract
truths, laws, and rules with reference to a special class of objects.
The individual case coming under these laws is determined in
accordance with this general knowledge, which is valid once
for all; because such application of the general principle is far
easier than the exhaustive investigation of the particular case; for
the general abstract knowledge which has once been obtained is
always more within our reach than the empirical investigation of
the particular case. With logic, however, it is just the other way. It
is the general knowledge of the mode of procedure of the reason
expressed in the form of rules. It is reached by the introspection
of reason, and by abstraction from all content. But this mode
of procedure is necessary and essential to reason, so that it will
never depart from it if left to itself. It is, therefore, easier and surer
to let it proceed itself according to its nature in each particular
case, than to present to it the knowledge abstracted from this[059]
procedure in the form of a foreign and externally given law. It
is easier, because, while in the case of all other sciences, the
general rule is more within our reach than the investigation of
the particular case taken by itself; with the use of reason, on the
contrary, its necessary procedure in a given case is always more
within our reach than the general rule abstracted from it; for that
which thinks in us is reason itself. It is surer, because a mistake
may more easily occur in such abstract knowledge, or in its
application, than that a process of reason should take place which
would run contrary to its essence and nature. Hence arises the
remarkable fact, that while in other sciences the particular case is
always proved by the rule, in logic, on the contrary, the rule must
always be proved from the particular case; and even the most practised logician, if he remark that in some particular case he
concludes otherwise than the rule prescribes, will always expect
to find a mistake in the rule rather than in his own conclusion.

To desire to make practical use of logic means, therefore, to
desire to derive with unspeakable trouble, from general rules,
that which is immediately known with the greatest certainty
in the particular case. It is just as if a man were to consult
mechanics as to the motion of his body, and physiology as to his
digestion; and whoever has learnt logic for practical purposes is
like him who would teach a beaver to make its own dam. 

Logic
is, therefore, without practical utility; but it must nevertheless
be retained, because it has philosophical interest as the special
knowledge of the organisation and action of reason. It is rightly
regarded as a definite, self-subsisting, self-contained, complete,
and thoroughly safe discipline; to be treated scientifically for
itself alone and independently of everything else, and therefore
to be studied at the universities. But it has its real value, in
relation to philosophy as a whole, in the inquiry into the nature
of knowledge, and indeed of rational and abstract knowledge. [060]
Therefore the exposition of logic should not have so much the
form of a practical science, should not contain merely naked
arbitrary rules for the correct formation of the judgment, the
syllogism, &c., but should rather be directed to the knowledge
of the nature of reason and the concept, and to the detailed
investigation of the principle of sufficient reason of knowing.
For logic is only a paraphrase of this principle, and, more exactly,
only of that exemplification of it in which the ground that gives
truth to the judgment is neither empirical nor metaphysical, but
logical or metalogical. Besides the principle of sufficient reason
of knowing, it is necessary to take account of the three remaining
fundamental laws of thought, or judgments of metalogical truth,
so nearly related to it; and out of these the whole science of
reason grows. The nature of thought proper, that is to say,
of the judgment and the syllogism, must be exhibited in the
80 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
combination of the spheres of concepts, according to the analogy
of the special schema, in the way shown above; and from all this
the rules of the judgment and the syllogism are to be deduced by
construction. The only practical use we can make of logic is in
a debate, when we can convict our antagonist of his intentional
fallacies, rather than of his actual mistakes, by giving them their
technical names. By thus throwing into the background the
practical aim of logic, and bringing out its connection with the
whole scheme of philosophy as one of its chapters, we do not
think that we shall make the study of it less prevalent than it is
just now. For at the present day every one who does not wish
to remain uncultured, and to be numbered with the ignorant and
incompetent multitude, must study speculative philosophy. For
the nineteenth century is a philosophical age, though by this we
do not mean either that it has philosophy, or that philosophy
governs it, but rather that it is ripe for philosophy, and, therefore,
stands in need of it. This is a sign of a high degree of civilisation,[061]
and indeed, is a definite stage in the culture of the ages.14
Though logic is of so little practical use, it cannot be denied
that it was invented for practical purposes. It appears to me to
have originated in the following way:—As the love of debating
developed among the Eleatics, the Megarics, and the Sophists,
and by degrees became almost a passion, the confusion in which
nearly every debate ended must have made them feel the necessity
of a method of procedure as a guide; and for this a scientific
dialectic had to be sought. The first thing which would have to be
observed would be that both the disputing parties should always
be agreed on some one proposition, to which the disputed points
might be referred. The beginning of the methodical procedure
consisted in this, that the propositions admitted on both sides were
formally stated to be so, and placed at the head of the inquiry.
But these propositions were at first concerned only with the
14 Cf. Ch. 9 and 10 of the Supplement.
81
material of the inquiry. It was soon observed that in the process
of going back to the truth admitted on both sides, and of deducing
their assertions from it, each party followed certain forms and
laws about which, without any express agreement, there was
no difference of opinion. And from this it became evident
that these must constitute the peculiar and natural procedure of
reason itself, the form of investigation. Although this was not
exposed to any doubt or difference of opinion, some pedantically
systematic philosopher hit upon the idea that it would look
well, and be the completion of the method of dialectic, if this
formal part of all discussion, this regular procedure of reason
itself, were to be expressed in abstract propositions, just like
the substantial propositions admitted on both sides, and placed
at the beginning of every investigation, as the fixed canon of
debate to which reference and appeal must always be made.

In this way what had formerly been followed only by tacit agreement, and instinctively, would be consciously recognised
and formally expressed. By degrees, more or less perfect
expressions were found for the fundamental principles of logic,
such as the principles of contradiction, sufficient reason, excluded
middle, the dictum de omni et nullo, as well as the special rules
of the syllogism, as for example, ex meris particularibus aut
negativis nihil sequitur, a rationato ad rationem non valet
consequentia, and so on. 

That all this was only brought about
slowly, and with great pains, and up till the time of Aristotle
remained very incomplete, is evident from the awkward and
tedious way in which logical truths are brought out in many of
the Platonic dialogues, and still more from what Sextus Empiricus
tells us of the controversies of the Megarics, about the easiest
and simplest logical rules, and the laborious way in which they
were brought into a definite form (Sext. Emp. adv. Math. l.
8, p. 112). But Aristotle collected, arranged, and corrected all
that had been discovered before his time, and brought it to an
incomparably greater state of perfection. If we thus observe how

the course of Greek culture had prepared the way for, and led
up to the work of Aristotle, we shall be little inclined to believe
the assertion of the Persian author, quoted by Sir William Jones
with much approval, that Kallisthenes found a complete system
of logic among the Indians, and sent it to his uncle Aristotle
(Asiatic Researches, vol. iv. p. 163). It is easy to understand that
in the dreary middle ages the Aristotelian logic would be very
acceptable to the controversial spirit of the schoolmen, which, in
the absence of all real knowledge, spent its energy upon mere
formulas and words, and that it would be eagerly adopted even
in its mutilated Arabian form, and presently established as the
centre of all knowledge. Though its authority has since declined,
yet up to our own time logic has retained the credit of a self-
contained, practical, and highly important science. Indeed, in[063]
our own day, the Kantian philosophy, the foundation-stone of
which is taken from logic, has excited a new interest in it; which,
in this respect, at any rate, that is, as the means of the knowledge
of the nature of reason, it deserves.
Correct and accurate conclusions may be arrived at if we
carefully observe the relation of the spheres of concepts, and
only conclude that one sphere is contained in a third sphere,
when we have clearly seen that this first sphere is contained in
a second, which in its turn is contained in the third. On the
other hand, the art of sophistry lies in casting only a superficial
glance at the relations of the spheres of the concepts, and then
manipulating these relations to suit our purposes, generally in the
following way:—When the sphere of an observed concept lies
partly within that of another concept, and partly within a third
altogether different sphere, we treat it as if it lay entirely within
the one or the other, as may suit our purpose. For example, in
speaking of passion, we may subsume it under the concept of
the greatest force, the mightiest agency in the world, or under
the concept of the irrational, and this again under the concept of
impotency or weakness. We may then repeat the process, and start anew with each concept to which the argument leads us. 

A concept has almost always several others, which partially come
under it, and each of these contains part of the sphere of the first,
but also includes in its own sphere something more, which is
not in the first. But we draw attention only to that one of these
latter concepts, under which we wish to subsume the first, and let
the others remain unobserved, or keep them concealed. On the
possession of this skill depends the whole art of sophistry and
all finer fallacies; for logical fallacies such as mentiens, velatus,
cornatus, &c., are clearly too clumsy for actual use. I am not
aware that hitherto any one has traced the nature of all sophistry
and persuasion back to this last possible ground of its existence, [064]
and referred it to the peculiar character of concepts, i.e., to the
procedure of reason itself. Therefore, as my exposition has led
me to it, though it is very easily understood, I will illustrate it in
the following table by means of a schema. 

This table is intended
to show how the spheres of concepts overlap each other at many
points, and so leave room for a passage from each concept to
whichever one we please of several other concepts. I hope,
however, that no one will be led by this table to attach more
importance to this little explanation, which I have merely given
in passing, than ought to belong to it, from the nature of the
subject. I have chosen as an illustration the concept of travelling.
Its sphere partially includes four others, to any of which the
sophist may pass at will; these again partly include other spheres,
several of them two or more at once, and through these the
sophist takes whichever way he chooses, always as if it were the
only way, till at last he reaches, in good or evil, whatever end he
may have in view. In passing from one sphere to another, it is
only necessary always to follow the direction from the centre (the
given chief concept) to the circumference, and never to reverse
this process. Such a piece of sophistry may be either an unbroken
speech, or it may assume the strict syllogistic form, according to
what is the weak side of the hearer. Most scientific arguments, and especially philosophical demonstrations, are at bottom not
much more than this, for how else would it be possible, that so
much, in different ages, has not only been falsely apprehended
(for error itself has a different source), but demonstrated and
proved, and has yet afterwards been found to be fundamentally
wrong, for example, the Leibnitz-Wolfian Philosophy, Ptolemaic
Astronomy, Stahl's Chemistry, Newton's Theory of Colours, &c.
