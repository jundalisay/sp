A theory of morals without proof is mere moralising.

It can effect nothing because it does not act as a motive. 

A theory of morals which does act as a motive can do so only by working on self-love. 

But what springs from this source has no moral worth. 

It follows from this that no genuine virtue can be produced through moral theory or abstract knowledge in general, but that such virtue must spring from that intuitive knowledge which recognises in the individuality of others the same nature as in our own.

For virtue certainly proceeds from knowledge, but not from the abstract knowledge that can be communicated through words. If it were so, virtue could be taught, and by here expressing in abstract language its nature and the knowledge which lies at its foundation, we should make every one who comprehends this even ethically better. 

But this is by no means the case.

On the contrary, ethical discourses and preaching will just as little produce a virtuous man as all the systems of æsthetics from Aristotle downwards have succeeded in producing a poet.

For the real inner nature of virtue the concept is unfruitful, just as it is in art, and it is only in a completely subordinate position that it can be of use as a tool in the elaboration and preserving of what has been ascertained and inferred by other means. Velle non discitur. Abstract dogmas are, in fact, without influence upon virtue, i.e., upon the goodness of the disposition. False dogmas do not disturb it; true ones will scarcely assist it. 

It would, in fact, be a bad look-out if the cardinal fact in the life of man, his ethical worth, that worth which counts for eternity, were dependent upon anything the attainment of which is so much a matter of chance as is the case with dogmas, religious doctrines, and philosophical theories. 

For morality dogmas have this value only: The man who has become virtuous from knowledge of another kind, which is presently to be considered, possesses in them a scheme or formula according to which he accounts to his own reason, for the most part fictitiously, for his non- egoistical action, the nature of which it, i.e., he himself, does not comprehend, and with which account he has accustomed it to be content.

Upon conduct, outward action, dogmas may certainly exercise a powerful influence, as also custom and example (the last[476] because the ordinary man does not trust his judgment, of the weakness of which he is conscious, but only follows his own or some one else's experience), but the disposition is not altered in this way.80 All abstract knowledge gives only motives; but, as was shown above, motives can only alter the direction of the will, not the will itself. All communicable knowledge, however, can only affect the will as a motive. Thus when dogmas lead it, what the man really and in general wills remains still the same. He has only received different thoughts as to the ways in which it is to be attained, and imaginary motives guide him just like real ones. Therefore, for example, it is all one, as regards his ethical worth, whether he gives large gifts to the poor, firmly persuaded that he will receive everything tenfold in a future life, or expends the same sum on the improvement of an estate which will yield interest, certainly late, but all the more surely and largely. And he who for the sake of orthodoxy commits the heretic to the flames is as much a murderer as the bandit who does it for gain; and indeed, as regards inward circumstances, so also was he who slaughtered the Turks in the Holy Land, if, like the burner of heretics, he really did so because he thought that he would thereby gain a place in heaven. For these are careful only for themselves, for their own egoism, just like the bandit, from whom they are only distinguished by the absurdity of their means. From without, as has been said, the will can only be reached through motives, and these only alter the way in which it expresses itself, never the will itself. Velle non discitur. In the case of good deeds, however, the doer of which appeals to dogmas, we must always distinguish whether these dogmas

<!-- 80 The Church would say that these are merely opera operata, which do not
avail unless grace gives the faith which leads to the new birth. But of this
farther on. -->

really are the motives which lead to the good deeds, or whether,
as was said above, they are merely the illusive account of them [477]
with which he seeks to satisfy his own reason with regard to
a good deed which really flows from quite a different source,
a deed which he does because he is good, though he does not
understand how to explain it rightly, and yet wishes to think
something with regard to it. But this distinction is very hard
to make, because it lies in the heart of a man. Therefore we
can scarcely ever pass a correct moral judgment on the action
of others, and very seldom on our own. The deeds and conduct
of an individual and of a nation may be very much modified
through dogmas, example, and custom. But in themselves all
deeds (opera operata) are merely empty forms, and only the
disposition which leads to them gives them moral significance.
This disposition, however, may be quite the same when its
outward manifestation is very different. With an equal degree of
wickedness, one man may die on the wheel, and another in the
bosom of his family. It may be the same grade of wickedness
which expresses itself in one nation in the coarse characteristics
of murder and cannibalism, and in another finely and softly in
miniature, in court intrigues, oppressions, and delicate plots of
every kind; the inner nature remains the same. It is conceivable
that a perfect state, or perhaps indeed a complete and firmly
believed doctrine of rewards and punishments after death, might
prevent every crime; politically much would be gained thereby;
morally, nothing; only the expression of the will in life would be
restricted.

Thus genuine goodness of disposition, disinterested virtue,
and pure nobility do not proceed from abstract knowledge. Yet
they do proceed from knowledge; but it is a direct intuitive
knowledge, which can neither be reasoned away, nor arrived at
by reasoning, a knowledge which, just because it is not abstract,
cannot be communicated, but must arise in each for himself,
which therefore finds its real and adequate expression not in words, but only in deeds, in conduct, in the course of the life
of man. We who here seek the theory of virtue, and have
therefore also to express abstractly the nature of the knowledge
which lies at its foundation, will yet be unable to convey that
knowledge itself in this expression. We can only give the concept
of this knowledge, and thus always start from action in which
alone it becomes visible, and refer to action as its only adequate
expression. We can only explain and interpret action, i.e., express
abstractly what really takes place in it.

Before we speak of the good proper, in opposition to the bad,
which has been explained, we must touch on an intermediate
grade, the mere negation of the bad: this is justice. 

The nature of
right and wrong has been fully explained above; therefore we may
briefly say here, that he who voluntarily recognises and observes
those merely moral limits between wrong and right, even where
this is not secured by the state or any other external power, thus
he who, according to our explanation, never carries the assertion
of his own will so far as to deny the will appearing in another
individual, is just. Thus, in order to increase his own well-being,
he will not inflict suffering upon others, i.e., he will commit no
crime, he will respect the rights and the property of others. We
see that for such a just man the principium individuationis is no
longer, as in the case of the bad man, an absolute wall of partition.
We see that he does not, like the bad man, merely assert his own
manifestation of will and deny all others; that other persons are
not for him mere masks, whose nature is quite different from
his own; but he shows in his conduct that he also recognises his
own nature—the will to live as a thing-in-itself, in the foreign
manifestation which is only given to him as idea. Thus he finds
himself again in that other manifestation, up to a certain point,
that of doing no wrong, i.e., abstaining from injury. To this
extent, therefore, he sees through the principium individuationis,
the veil of Mâyâ; so far he sets the being external to him on a[479]
level with his own—he does it no injury.

If we examine the inmost nature of this justice, there already
lies in it the resolution not to go so far in the assertion of one's
own will as to deny the manifestations of will of others, by
compelling them to serve one's own. One will therefore wish
to render to others as much as one receives from them. The
highest degree of this justice of disposition, which is, however,
always united with goodness proper, whose character is no longer
merely negative, extends so far that a man doubts his right to
inherited property, wishes to support his body only by his own
powers, mental and physical, feels every service of others and
every luxury a reproach, and finally embraces voluntary poverty.
Thus we see how Pascal, when he became an ascetic, would no
longer permit any services to be rendered him, although he had
servants enough; in spite of his constant bad health he made
his bed himself, brought his own food from the kitchen, &c.
(“Vie de Pascal, par sa Sœur,” p. 19). Quite in keeping with
this, it is reported that many Hindus, even Rajas with great
wealth, expend it merely on the maintenance of their position,
their court and attendants, and themselves observe with the
greatest scrupulousness the maxim that a man should eat nothing
that he has not himself both sowed and reaped. Yet a certain
misunderstanding lies at the bottom of this; for one man, just
because he is rich and powerful, can render such signal services
to the whole of human society that they counterbalance the
wealth he has inherited, for the secure possession of which he
is indebted to society. In reality that excessive justice of such
Hindus is already more than justice; it is actual renunciation,
denial of the will to live,—asceticism, of which we shall speak
last. On the other hand, pure idleness and living through the
exertions of others, in the case of inherited wealth, without
accomplishing anything, may be regarded as morally wrong, [480]
even if it must remain right according to positive laws.
We have found that voluntary justice has its inmost source in
a certain degree of penetration of the principium individuationis,
476 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
while the unjust remain entirely involved in this principle.
This penetration may exist not only in the degree which is
required for justice, but also in the higher degree which leads
to benevolence and well-doing, to love of mankind. And this
may take place however strong and energetic in itself the will
which appears in such an individual may be. Knowledge can
always counterbalance it in him, teach him to resist the tendency
to wrong, and even produce in him every degree of goodness,
and indeed of resignation. Thus the good man is by no means
to be regarded as originally a weaker manifestation of will than
the bad man, but it is knowledge which in him masters the blind
striving of will. There are certainly individuals who merely seem
to have a good disposition on account of the weakness of the
will appearing in them, but what they are soon appears from the
fact that they are not capable of any remarkable self-conquest in
order to perform a just or good deed.
If, however, as a rare exception, we meet a man who possesses
a considerable income, but uses very little of it for himself and
gives all the rest to the poor, while he denies himself many
pleasures and comforts, and we seek to explain the action of this
man, we shall find, apart altogether from the dogmas through
which he tries to make his action intelligible to his reason, that
the simplest general expression and the essential character of his
conduct is that he makes less distinction than is usually made
between himself and others. This distinction is so great in the
eyes of many that the suffering of others is a direct pleasure to
the wicked and a welcome means of happiness to the unjust.
The merely just man is content not to cause it; and, in general,
most men know and are acquainted with innumerable sufferings[481]
of others in their vicinity, but do not determine to mitigate
them, because to do so would involve some self-denial on their
part. Thus, in each of all these a strong distinction seems to
prevail between his own ego and that of others; on the other
hand, to the noble man we have imagined, this distinction is
477
not so significant. The principium individuationis, the form of
the phenomenon, no longer holds him so tightly in its grasp,
but the suffering which he sees in others touches him almost as
closely as his own. He therefore tries to strike a balance between
them, denies himself pleasures, practises renunciation, in order
to mitigate the sufferings of others. He sees that the distinction
between himself and others, which to the bad man is so great
a gulf, only belongs to a fleeting and illusive phenomenon. He
recognises directly and without reasoning that the in-itself of his
own manifestation is also that of others, the will to live, which
constitutes the inner nature of everything and lives in all; indeed,
that this applies also to the brutes and the whole of nature, and
therefore he will not cause suffering even to a brute.81
He is now just as little likely to allow others to starve, while
he himself has enough and to spare, as any one would be to
suffer hunger one day in order to have more the next day than
he could enjoy. For to him who does works of love the veil
of Mâyâ has become transparent, the illusion of the principium [482]
individuationis has left him. He recognises himself, his will,
in every being, and consequently also in the sufferer. He is
now free from the perversity with which the will to live, not
recognising itself, here in one individual enjoys a fleeting and
81 The right of man over the life and powers of the brutes rests on the fact that,
because with the growing clearness of consciousness suffering increases in like
measure; the pain which the brute suffers through death or work is not so great
as man would suffer by merely denying himself the flesh, or the powers of the
brutes. Therefore man may carry the assertion of his existence to the extent of
denying the existence of the brute, and the will to live as a whole endures less
suffering in this way than if the opposite course were adopted. This at once
determines the extent of the use man may make of the powers of the brutes
without wrong; a limit, however, which is often transgressed, especially in the
case of beasts of burden and dogs used in the chase; to which the activity of
societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals is principally devoted. In my
opinion, that right does not extend to vivisection, particularly of the higher
animals. On the other hand, the insect does not suffer so much through its
death as a man suffers from its sting. The Hindus do not understand this.
478 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
precarious pleasure, and there in another pays for it with suffering
and starvation, and thus both inflicts and endures misery, not
knowing that, like Thyestes, it eagerly devours its own flesh;
and then, on the one hand, laments its undeserved suffering, and
on the other hand transgresses without fear of Nemesis, always
merely because, involved in the principium individuationis, thus
generally in the kind of knowledge which is governed by the
principle of sufficient reason, it does not recognise itself in the
foreign phenomenon, and therefore does not perceive eternal
justice. To be cured of this illusion and deception of Mâyâ, and
to do works of love, are one and the same. But the latter is the
necessary and inevitable symptom of that knowledge.
The opposite of the sting of conscience, the origin and
significance of which is explained above, is the good conscience,
the satisfaction which we experience after every disinterested
deed. It arises from the fact that such a deed, as it proceeds from
the direct recognition of our own inner being in the phenomenon
of another, affords us also the verification of this knowledge, the
knowledge that our true self exists not only in our own person,
this particular manifestation, but in everything that lives. By
this the heart feels itself enlarged, as by egoism it is contracted.
For as the latter concentrates our interest upon the particular
manifestation of our own individuality, upon which knowledge
always presents to us the innumerable dangers which constantly
threaten this manifestation, and anxiety and care becomes the
key-note of our disposition; the knowledge that everything living
is just as much our own inner nature, as is our own person,
extends our interest to everything living; and in this way the[483]
heart is enlarged. Thus through the diminished interest in our
own self, the anxious care for the self is attacked at its very
root and limited; hence the peace, the unbroken serenity, which
a virtuous disposition and a good conscience affords, and the
more distinct appearance of this with every good deed, for it
proves to ourselves the depth of that disposition. The egoist feels himself surrounded by strange and hostile individuals, and all
his hope is centred in his own good. The good man lives in a
world of friendly individuals, the well-being of any of whom
he regards as his own. Therefore, although the knowledge of
the lot of mankind generally does not make his disposition a
joyful one, yet the permanent knowledge of his own nature
in all living beings, gives him a certain evenness, and even
serenity of disposition. For the interest which is extended to
innumerable manifestations cannot cause such anxiety as that
which is concentrated upon one. The accidents which concern
individuals collectively, equalise themselves, while those which
happen to the particular individual constitute good or bad fortune.
Thus, though others have set up moral principles which they
give out as prescriptions for virtue, and laws which it was
necessary to follow, I, as has already been said, cannot do this
because I have no “ought” or law to prescribe to the eternally
free-will. Yet on the other hand, in the connection of my system,
what to a certain extent corresponds and is analogous to that
undertaking is the purely theoretical truth, of which my whole
exposition may be regarded as merely an elaboration, that the
will is the in-itself of every phenomenon but itself, as such, is
free from the forms of the phenomenal, and consequently from
multiplicity; a truth, which, with reference to action, I do not
know how to express better than by the formula of the Vedas
already quoted: “Tat twam asi!” (This thou art!) Whoever is able
to say this to himself, with regard to every being with whom
he comes in contact, with clear knowledge and firm inward [484]
conviction, is certain of all virtue and blessedness, and is on the
direct road to salvation.
But before I go further, and, as the conclusion of my exposition,
show how love, the origin and nature of which we recognised
as the penetration of the principium individuationis, leads to
salvation, to the entire surrender of the will to live, i.e., of all
volition, and also how another path, less soft but more frequented,
480 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
leads men to the same goal, a paradoxical proposition must first
be stated and explained; not because it is paradoxical, but because
it is true, and is necessary to the completeness of the thought I
have present. It is this: “All love (±≥±¿∑, caritas) is sympathy.”
§ 67. We have seen how justice proceeds from the penetration
of the principium individuationis in a less degree, and how
from its penetration in a higher degree there arises goodness of
disposition proper, which shows itself as pure, i.e., disinterested
love towards others. When now the latter becomes perfect, it
places other individuals and their fate completely on a level
with itself and its own fate. Further than this it cannot go, for
there exists no reason for preferring the individuality of another
to its own. Yet the number of other individuals whose whole
happiness or life is in danger may outweigh the regard for one's
own particular well-being. In such a case, the character that has
attained to the highest goodness and perfect nobility will entirely
sacrifice its own well-being, and even its life, for the well-being
of many others. So died Codrus, and Leonidas, and Regulus, and
Decius Mus, and Arnold von Winkelried; so dies every one who
voluntarily and consciously faces certain death for his friends
or his country. And they also stand on the same level who
voluntarily submit to suffering and death for maintaining what
conduces and rightly belongs to the welfare of all mankind; that
is, for maintaining universal and important truths and destroying[485]
great errors. So died Socrates and Giordano Bruno, and so many
a hero of the truth suffered death at the stake at the hands of the
priests.

Suffering is essential to life as a whole, and inseparable from it. And that
we saw that every wish proceeds from a need, from a want,
from suffering, and that therefore every satisfaction is only the
removal of a pain, and brings no positive happiness; that the
joys certainly lie to the wish, presenting themselves as a positive good, but in truth they have only a negative nature, and are
only the end of an evil. Therefore what goodness, love, and
nobleness do for others, is always merely an alleviation of their
suffering, and consequently all that can influence them to good
deeds and works of love, is simply the knowledge of the suffering
of others, which is directly understood from their own suffering
and placed on a level with it. But it follows from this that
pure love (±≥±¿∑, caritas) is in its nature sympathy; whether the
suffering it mitigates, to which every unsatisfied wish belongs,
be great or small. Therefore we shall have no hesitation, in
direct contradiction to Kant, who will only recognise all true
goodness and all virtue to be such, if it has proceeded from
abstract reflection, and indeed from the conception of duty and
of the categorical imperative, and explains felt sympathy as
weakness, and by no means virtue, we shall have no hesitation, I
say, in direct contradiction to Kant, in saying: the mere concept
is for genuine virtue just as unfruitful as it is for genuine art:
all true and pure love is sympathy, and all love which is not
sympathy is selfishness. ï¡ø¬ is selfishness, ±≥±¿∑ is sympathy.
Combinations of the two frequently occur. Indeed genuine
friendship is always a mixture of selfishness and sympathy; the
former lies in the pleasure experienced in the presence of the
friend, whose individuality corresponds to our own, and this [486]
almost always constitutes the greatest part; sympathy shows
itself in the sincere participation in his joy and grief, and the
disinterested sacrifices made in respect of the latter. Thus
Spinoza says: Benevolentia nihil aliud est, quam cupiditas ex
commiseratione orta (Eth. iii. pr. 27, cor. 3, schol.) As a
confirmation of our paradoxical proposition it may be observed
that the tone and words of the language and caresses of pure
love, entirely coincide with the tones of sympathy; and we may
also remark in passing that in Italian sympathy and true love are
denoted by the same word pietà.

This is also the place to explain one of the most striking

peculiarities of human nature, weeping, which, like laughter,
belongs to those qualities which distinguish man from the brutes.
Weeping is by no means a direct expression of pain, for it occurs
where there is very little pain. In my opinion, indeed, we never
weep directly on account of the pain we experience, but always
merely on account of its repetition in reflection. We pass from
the felt pain, even when it is physical, to a mere idea of it, and
then find our own state so deserving of sympathy that we are
firmly and sincerely convinced that if another were the sufferer,
we would be full of sympathy, and love to relieve him. But now
we ourselves are the object of our own sympathy; with the most
benevolent disposition we are ourselves most in need of help; we
feel that we suffer more than we could see another suffer; and
in this very complex frame of mind, in which the directly felt
suffering only comes to perception by a doubly circuitous route,
imagined as the suffering of another, sympathised with as such,
and then suddenly perceived again as directly our own,—in this
complex frame of mind, I say, Nature relieves itself through that
remarkable physical conflict. Weeping is accordingly sympathy
with our own selves, or sympathy directed back on its source. It
is therefore conditional upon the capacity for love and sympathy,
and also upon imagination. Therefore men who are either[487]
hard-hearted or unimaginative do not weep easily, and weeping
is even always regarded as a sign of a certain degree of goodness
of character, and disarms anger, because it is felt that whoever
can still weep, must necessarily always be capable of love, i.e.,
sympathy towards others, for this enters in the manner described
into the disposition that leads to weeping. The description which
Petrarch gives of the rising of his own tears, naïvely and truly
expressing his feeling, entirely agrees with the explanation we
have given—
“I vo pensando: e nel pensar m' assale
Una pietà si forte di me stesso,
483
Che mi conduce spesso,
Ad alto lagrimar, ch'i non soleva.”82

What has been said is also confirmed by the fact that
children who have been hurt generally do not cry till some
one commiserates them; thus not on account of the pain, but on
account of the idea of it. When we are moved to tears, not through
our own suffering but through that of another, this happens as
follows. Either we vividly put ourselves in the place of the
sufferer by imagination, or see in his fate the lot of humanity as
a whole, and consequently, first of all, our own lot; and thus,
in a very roundabout way, it is yet always about ourselves that
we weep, sympathy with ourselves which we feel. This seems
to be the principal reason of the universal, and thus natural,
weeping in the case of death. The mourner does not weep for
his loss; he would be ashamed of such egotistical tears, instead
of which he is sometimes ashamed of not weeping. First of all
he certainly weeps for the fate of the dead, but he also weeps
when, after long, heavy, and incurable suffering, death was to
this man a wished-for deliverance. Thus, principally, he is seized
with sympathy for the lot of all mankind, which is necessarily [488]
finite, so that every life, however aspiring, and often rich in
deeds, must be extinguished and become nothing. But in this lot
of mankind the mourner sees first of all his own, and this all the
more, the more closely he is related to him who has died, thus
most of all if it is his father. Although to his father his life was
misery through age and sickness, and though his helplessness
was a heavy burden to his son, yet that son weeps bitterly over
the death of his father for the reason which has been given.83
82 As I wander sunk in thought, so strong a sympathy with myself comes over
me that I must often weep aloud, which otherwise I am not wont to do.
83 Cf. Ch. xlvii. of Supplement. It is scarcely necessary to remind the reader
that the whole ethical doctrine given in outline in §§ 61-67 has been explained
fully and in detail in my prize-essay on the foundation of morals.
484 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
§ 68. After this digression about the identity of pure love and
sympathy, the final return of which upon our own individuality
has, as its symptom, the phenomenon of weeping, I now take
up the thread of our discussion of the ethical significance of
action, in order to show how, from the same source from which
all goodness, love, virtue, and nobility of character spring, there
finally arises that which I call the denial of the will to live.
We saw before that hatred and wickedness are conditioned by
egoism, and egoism rests on the entanglement of knowledge in the
principium individuationis. Thus we found that the penetration
of that principium individuationis is the source and the nature of
justice, and when it is carried further, even to its fullest extent, it
is the source and nature of love and nobility of character. For this
penetration alone, by abolishing the distinction between our own
individuality and that of others, renders possible and explains
perfect goodness of disposition, extending to disinterested love
and the most generous self-sacrifice for others.
If, however, this penetration of the principium individuationis,
this direct knowledge of the identity of will in all its
manifestations, is present in a high degree of distinctness, it
will at once show an influence upon the will which extends[489]
still further. If that veil of Mâyâ, the principium individuationis,
is lifted from the eyes of a man to such an extent that he
no longer makes the egotistical distinction between his person
and that of others, but takes as much interest in the sufferings
of other individuals as in his own, and therefore is not only
benevolent in the highest degree, but even ready to sacrifice his
own individuality whenever such a sacrifice will save a number
of other persons, then it clearly follows that such a man, who
recognises in all beings his own inmost and true self, must also
regard the infinite suffering of all suffering beings as his own,
and take on himself the pain of the whole world. No suffering
is any longer strange to him. All the miseries of others which
he sees and is so seldom able to alleviate, all the miseries he
485
knows directly, and even those which he only knows as possible,
work upon his mind like his own. It is no longer the changing
joy and sorrow of his own person that he has in view, as is
the case with him who is still involved in egoism; but, since
he sees through the principium individuationis, all lies equally
near him. He knows the whole, comprehends its nature, and
finds that it consists in a constant passing away, vain striving,
inward conflict, and continual suffering. He sees wherever he
looks suffering humanity, the suffering brute creation, and a
world that passes away. But all this now lies as near him as his
own person lies to the egoist. Why should he now, with such
knowledge of the world, assert this very life through constant acts
of will, and thereby bind himself ever more closely to it, press
it ever more firmly to himself? Thus he who is still involved in
the principium individuationis, in egoism, only knows particular
things and their relation to his own person, and these constantly
become new motives of his volition. But, on the other hand,
that knowledge of the whole, of the nature of the thing-in-itself
which has been described, becomes a quieter of all and every
volition. The will now turns away from life; it now shudders [490]
at the pleasures in which it recognises the assertion of life. Man
now attains to the state of voluntary renunciation, resignation,
true indifference, and perfect will-lessness. If at times, in the
hard experience of our own suffering, or in the vivid recognition
of that of others, the knowledge of the vanity and bitterness
of life draws nigh to us also who are still wrapt in the veil of
Mâyâ, and we would like to destroy the sting of the desires,
close the entrance against all suffering, and purify and sanctify
ourselves by complete and final renunciation; yet the illusion
of the phenomenon soon entangles us again, and its motives
influence the will anew; we cannot tear ourselves free. The
allurement of hope, the flattery of the present, the sweetness
of pleasure, the well-being which falls to our lot, amid the
lamentations of a suffering world governed by chance and error,
486 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
draws us back to it and rivets our bonds anew. Therefore Jesus
says: “It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle,
than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.”
If we compare life to a course or path through which we must
unceasingly run—a path of red-hot coals, with a few cool places
here and there; then he who is entangled in delusion is consoled
by the cool places, on which he now stands, or which he sees
near him, and sets out to run through the course. But he who
sees through the principium individuationis, and recognises the
real nature of the thing-in-itself, and thus the whole, is no longer
susceptible of such consolation; he sees himself in all places at
once, and withdraws. His will turns round, no longer asserts its
own nature, which is reflected in the phenomenon, but denies it.
The phenomenon by which this change is marked, is the transition
from virtue to asceticism. That is to say, it no longer suffices
for such a man to love others as himself, and to do as much for
them as for himself; but there arises within him a horror of the
nature of which his own phenomenal existence is an expression,[491]
the will to live, the kernel and inner nature of that world which
is recognised as full of misery. He therefore disowns this nature
which appears in him, and is already expressed through his body,
and his action gives the lie to his phenomenal existence, and
appears in open contradiction to it. Essentially nothing else but a
manifestation of will, he ceases to will anything, guards against
attaching his will to anything, and seeks to confirm in himself
the greatest indifference to everything. His body, healthy and
strong, expresses through the genitals, the sexual impulse; but
he denies the will and gives the lie to the body; he desires
no sensual gratification under any condition. Voluntary and
complete chastity is the first step in asceticism or the denial of
the will to live. It thereby denies the assertion of the will which
extends beyond the individual life, and gives the assurance that
with the life of this body, the will, whose manifestation it is,
ceases. Nature, always true and naïve, declares that if this maxim
487
became universal, the human race would die out; and I think I
may assume, in accordance with what was said in the Second
Book about the connection of all manifestations of will, that with
its highest manifestation, the weaker reflection of it would also
pass away, as the twilight vanishes along with the full light. With
the entire abolition of knowledge, the rest of the world would
of itself vanish into nothing; for without a subject there is no
object. I should like here to refer to a passage in the Vedas,
where it is said: “As in this world hungry infants press round
their mother; so do all beings await the holy oblation.” (Asiatic
Researches, vol. viii.; Colebrooke, On the Vedas, Abstract of
the Sama-Veda; also in Colebrooke's Miscellaneous Essays, vol.
i. p. 79.) Sacrifice means resignation generally, and the rest
of nature must look for its salvation to man who is at once the
priest and the sacrifice. Indeed it deserves to be noticed as very
remarkable, that this thought has also been expressed by the [492]
admirable and unfathomably profound Angelus Silesius, in the
little poem entitled, “Man brings all to God;” it runs, “Man! all
loves thee; around thee great is the throng. All things flee to thee
that they may attain to God.” But a yet greater mystic, Meister
Eckhard, whose wonderful writings are at last accessible (1857)
through the edition of Franz Pfeiffer, says the same thing (p.
459) quite in the sense explained here: “I bear witness to the
saying of Christ. I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw
all things unto me (John xii. 32). So shall the good man draw
all things up to God, to the source whence they first came. The
Masters certify to us that all creatures are made for the sake of
man. This is proved in all created things, by the fact that the one
makes the use of the other; the ox makes use of the grass, the
fish of the water, the bird of the air, the wild beast of the forest.
Thus, all created things become of use to the good man. A good
man brings to God the one created thing in the other.” He means
to say, that man makes use of the brutes in this life because, in
and with himself, he saves them also. It also seems to me that
488 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
that difficult passage in the Bible, Rom. viii. 21-24, must be
interpreted in this sense.
In Buddhism also, there is no lack of expressions of this truth.
For example, when Buddha, still as Bodisatwa, has his horse
saddled for the last time, for his flight into the wilderness from
his father's house, he says these lines to the horse: “Long hast
thou existed in life and in death, but now thou shalt cease from
carrying and drawing. Bear me but this once more, O Kantakana,
away from here, and when I have attained to the Law (have
become Buddha) I will not forget thee” (Foe Koue Ki, trad. p.
Abel Rémusat, p. 233).
Asceticism then shows itself further in voluntary and
intentional poverty, which not only arises per accidens, because
the possessions are given away to mitigate the sufferings of
others, but is here an end in itself, is meant to serve as a constant[493]
mortification of will, so that the satisfaction of the wishes, the
sweet of life, shall not again arouse the will, against which
self-knowledge has conceived a horror. He who has attained
to this point, still always feels, as a living body, as concrete
manifestation of will, the natural disposition for every kind of
volition; but he intentionally suppresses it, for he compels himself
to refrain from doing all that he would like to do, and to do all that
he would like not to do, even if this has no further end than that
of serving as a mortification of will. Since he himself denies the
will which appears in his own person, he will not resist if another
does the same, i.e., inflicts wrongs upon him. Therefore every
suffering coming to him from without, through chance or the
wickedness of others, is welcome to him, every injury, ignominy,
and insult; he receives them gladly as the opportunity of learning
with certainty that he no longer asserts the will, but gladly sides
with every enemy of the manifestation of will which is his
own person. Therefore he bears such ignominy and suffering
with inexhaustible patience and meekness, returns good for evil
without ostentation, and allows the fire of anger to rise within
489
him just as little as that of the desires. And he mortifies not only
the will itself, but also its visible form, its objectivity, the body.
He nourishes it sparingly, lest its excessive vigour and prosperity
should animate and excite more strongly the will, of which it is
merely the expression and the mirror. So he practises fasting, and
even resorts to chastisement and self-inflicted torture, in order
that, by constant privation and suffering, he may more and more
break down and destroy the will, which he recognises and abhors
as the source of his own suffering existence and that of the world.
If at last death comes, which puts an end to this manifestation of
that will, whose existence here has long since perished through
free-denial of itself, with the exception of the weak residue of it
which appears as the life of this body; it is most welcome, and [494]
is gladly received as a longed-for deliverance. Here it is not, as
in the case of others, merely the manifestation which ends with
death; but the inner nature itself is abolished, which here existed
only in the manifestation, and that in a very weak degree;84 this
last slight bond is now broken. For him who thus ends, the world
has ended also.
And what I have here described with feeble tongue and only
in general terms, is no philosophical fable, invented by myself,
and only of to-day; no, it was the enviable life of so many saints
and beautiful souls among Christians, and still more among
Hindus and Buddhists, and also among the believers of other
religions. However different were the dogmas impressed on
their reason, the same inward, direct, intuitive knowledge, from
which alone all virtue and holiness proceed, expressed itself in
84 This thought is expressed by a beautiful simile in the ancient philosophical
Sanscrit writing, “Sankhya Karica:” “Yet the soul remains a while invested
with body; as the potter's wheel continues whirling after the pot has been
fashioned, by force of the impulse previously given to it. When separation of
the informed soul from its corporeal frame at length takes place and nature
in respect of it ceases, then is absolute and final deliverance accomplished.”
Colebrooke, “On the Philosophy of the Hindus: Miscellaneous Essays,” vol i.
p. 271. Also in the “Sankhya Karica by Horace Wilson,” § 67, p. 184.
490 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
precisely the same way in the conduct of life. For here also the
great distinction between intuitive and abstract knowledge shows
itself; a distinction which is of such importance and universal
application in our whole investigation, and which has hitherto
been too little attended to. There is a wide gulf between the
two, which can only be crossed by the aid of philosophy, as
regards the knowledge of the nature of the world. Intuitively or
in concreto, every man is really conscious of all philosophical
truths, but to bring them to abstract knowledge, to reflection, is
the work of philosophy, which neither ought nor is able to do
more than this.
Thus it may be that the inner nature of holiness, self-
renunciation, mortification of our own will, asceticism, is[495]
here for the first time expressed abstractly, and free from all
mythical elements, as denial of the will to live, appearing after
the complete knowledge of its own nature has become a quieter
of all volition. On the other hand, it has been known directly and
realised in practice by saints and ascetics, who had all the same
inward knowledge, though they used very different language
with regard to it, according to the dogmas which their reason had
accepted, and in consequence of which an Indian, a Christian,
or a Lama saint must each give a very different account of his
conduct, which is, however, of no importance as regards the
fact. A saint may be full of the absurdest superstition, or, on
the contrary, he may be a philosopher, it is all the same. His
conduct alone certifies that he is a saint, for, in a moral regard,
it proceeds from knowledge of the world and its nature, which
is not abstractly but intuitively and directly apprehended, and is
only expressed by him in any dogma for the satisfaction of his
reason. It is therefore just as little needful that a saint should
be a philosopher as that a philosopher should be a saint; just
as it is not necessary that a perfectly beautiful man should be
a great sculptor, or that a great sculptor should himself be a
beautiful man. In general, it is a strange demand upon a moralist
491
that he should teach no other virtue than that which he himself
possesses. To repeat the whole nature of the world abstractly,
universally, and distinctly in concepts, and thus to store up, as
it were, a reflected image of it in permanent concepts always at
the command of the reason; this and nothing else is philosophy.
I refer the reader to the passage quoted from Bacon in the First
Book.
But the description I have given above of the denial of the
will to live, of the conduct of a beautiful soul, of a resigned
and voluntarily expiating saint, is merely abstract and general,
and therefore cold. As the knowledge from which the denial of
the will proceeds is intuitive and not abstract, it finds its most
perfect expression, not in abstract conceptions, but in deeds [496]
and conduct. Therefore, in order to understand fully what we
philosophically express as denial of the will to live, one must
come to know examples of it in experience and actual life.
Certainly they are not to be met with in daily experience: Nam
omnia præclara tam difficilia quam rara sunt, Spinoza admirably
says. Therefore, unless by a specially happy fate we are made
eye-witnesses, we have to content ourselves with descriptions
of the lives of such men. Indian literature, as we see from the
little that we as yet know through translations, is very rich in
descriptions of the lives of saints, penitents, Samanas or ascetics,
Sannyâsis or mendicants, and whatever else they may be called.
Even the well-known “Mythologie des Indous, par Mad. de
Polier,” though by no means to be commended in every respect,
contains many excellent examples of this kind (especially in
ch. 13, vol. ii.) Among Christians also there is no lack of
examples which afford us the illustrations we desire. See the
biographies, for the most part badly written, of those persons who
are sometimes called saintly souls, sometimes pietists, quietists,
devout enthusiasts, and so forth. Collections of such biographies
have been made at various times, such as Tersteegen's “Leben
heiliger Seelen,” Reiz's “Geschichte der Wiedergeborennen,” in
492 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
our own day, a collection by Kanne, which, with much that
is bad, yet contains some good, and especially the “Leben der
Beata Sturmin.” To this category very properly belongs the life
of St. Francis of Assisi, that true personification of the ascetic,
and prototype of all mendicant friars. His life, described by
his younger contemporary, St. Bonaventura, also famous as a
scholastic, has recently been republished. “Vita S. Francisci a
S. Bonaventura concinnata” (Soest, 1847), though shortly before
a painstaking and detailed biography, making use of all sources
of information, appeared in France, “Histoire de S. François
d'Assise, par Chavin de Mallan” (1845). As an Oriental parallel
of these monastic writings we have the very valuable work of[497]
Spence Hardy, “Eastern Monachism; an Account of the Order
of Mendicants founded by Gotama Budha” (1850). It shows
us the same thing in another dress. We also see what a matter
of indifference it is whether it proceeds from a theistical or an
atheistical religion. But as a special and exceedingly full example
and practical illustration of the conceptions I have established, I
can thoroughly recommend the “Autobiography of Madame de
Guion.” To become acquainted with this great and beautiful soul,
the very thought of whom always fills me with reverence, and
to do justice to the excellence of her disposition while making
allowance for the superstition of her reason, must be just as
delightful to every man of the better sort as with vulgar thinkers,
i.e., the majority, that book will always stand in bad repute. For
it is the case with regard to everything, that each man can only
prize that which to a certain extent is analogous to him and for
which he has at least a slight inclination. This holds good of
ethical concerns as well as of intellectual. We might to a certain
extent regard the well-known French biography of Spinoza as a
case in point, if we used as a key to it that noble introduction
to his very insufficient essay, “De Emendatione Intellectus,” a
passage which I can also recommend as the most effectual means
I know of stilling the storm of the passions. Finally, even the
493
great Goethe, Greek as he is, did not think it below his dignity to
show us this most beautiful side of humanity in the magic mirror
of poetic art, for he represented the life of Fräulein Klettenberg
in an idealised form in his “Confessions of a Beautiful Soul,” and
later, in his own biography, gave us also an historical account
of it. Besides this, he twice told the story of the life of St.
Philippo Neri. The history of the world, will, and indeed must,
keep silence about the men whose conduct is the best and only
adequate illustration of this important point of our investigation,
for the material of the history of the world is quite different, [498]
and indeed opposed to this. It is not the denial of the will
to live, but its assertion and its manifestation in innumerable
individuals in which its conflict with itself at the highest grade
of its objectification appears with perfect distinctness, and brings
before our eyes, now the ascendancy of the individual through
prudence, now the might of the many through their mass, now
the might of chance personified as fate, always the vanity and
emptiness of the whole effort. We, however, do not follow here
the course of phenomena in time, but, as philosophers, we seek to
investigate the ethical significance of action, and take this as the
only criterion of what for us is significant and important. Thus
we will not be withheld by any fear of the constant numerical
superiority of vulgarity and dulness from acknowledging that the
greatest, most important, and most significant phenomenon that
the world can show is not the conqueror of the world, but the
subduer of it; is nothing but the quiet, unobserved life of a man
who has attained to the knowledge in consequence of which he
surrenders and denies that will to live which fills everything and
strives and strains in all, and which first gains freedom here in
him alone, so that his conduct becomes the exact opposite of that
of other men. In this respect, therefore, for the philosopher, these
accounts of the lives of holy, self-denying men, badly as they
are generally written, and mixed as they are with superstition
and nonsense, are, because of the significance of the material,
494 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
immeasurably more instructive and important than even Plutarch
and Livy.
It will further assist us much in obtaining a more definite
and full knowledge of what we have expressed abstractly and
generally, according to our method of exposition, as the denial of
the will to live, if we consider the moral teaching that has been
imparted with this intention, and by men who were full of this
spirit; and this will also show how old our view is, though the pure[499]
philosophical expression of it may be quite new. The teaching
of this kind which lies nearest to hand is Christianity, the ethics
of which are entirely in the spirit indicated, and lead not only
to the highest degrees of human love, but also to renunciation.
The germ of this last side of it is certainly distinctly present in
the writings of the Apostles, but it was only fully developed
and expressed later. We find the Apostles enjoining the love of
our neighbour as ourselves, benevolence, the requital of hatred
with love and well-doing, patience, meekness, the endurance
of all possible injuries without resistance, abstemiousness in
nourishment to keep down lust, resistance to sensual desire, if
possible, altogether. We already see here the first degrees of
asceticism, or denial of the will proper. This last expression
denotes that which in the Gospels is called denying ourselves
and taking up the cross (Matt. xvi. 24, 25; Mark viii. 34, 35;
Luke ix. 23, 24, xiv. 26, 27, 33). This tendency soon developed
itself more and more, and was the origin of hermits, anchorites,
and monasticism—an origin which in itself was pure and holy,
but for that very reason unsuitable for the great majority of men;
therefore what developed out of it could only be hypocrisy and
wickedness, for abusus optimi pessimus. In more developed
Christianity, we see that seed of asceticism unfold into the full
flower in the writings of the Christian saints and mystics. These
preach, besides the purest love, complete resignation, voluntary
and absolute poverty, genuine calmness, perfect indifference
to all worldly things, dying to our own will and being born
495
again in God, entire forgetting of our own person, and sinking
ourselves in the contemplation of God. A full exposition of
this will be found in Fénélon's “Explication des Maximes des
Saints sur la Vie Interieure.” But the spirit of this development
of Christianity is certainly nowhere so fully and powerfully [500]
expressed as in the writings of the German mystics, in the works
of Meister Eckhard, and in that justly famous book “Die Deutsche
Theologie,” of which Luther says in the introduction to it which
he wrote, that with the exception of the Bible and St. Augustine,
he had learnt more from it of what God, Christ, and man are than
from any other book. Yet we only got the genuine and correct
text of it in the year 1851, in the Stuttgart edition by Pfeiffer. The
precepts and doctrines which are laid down there are the most
perfect exposition, sprung from deep inward conviction of what
I have presented as the denial of the will. It should therefore
be studied more closely in that form before it is dogmatised
about with Jewish-Protestant assurance. Tauler's “Nachfolgung
des armen Leben Christi,” and also his “Medulla Animæ,” are
written in the same admirable spirit, though not quite equal in
value to that work. In my opinion the teaching of these genuine
Christian mystics, when compared with the teaching of the New
Testament, is as alcohol to wine, or what becomes visible in the
New Testament as through a veil and mist appears to us in the
works of the mystics without cloak or disguise, in full clearness
and distinctness. Finally, the New Testament might be regarded
as the first initiation, the mystics as the second,—√ºπ∫¡± ∫±π
ºμ≥±ª± º≈√ƒ∑¡π±.
We find, however, that which we have called the denial of
the will to live more fully developed, more variously expressed,
and more vividly represented in the ancient Sanscrit writings
than could be the case in the Christian Church and the Western
world. That this important ethical view of life could here
attain to a fuller development and a more distinct expression
is perhaps principally to be ascribed to the fact that it was
496 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
not confined by an element quite foreign to it, as Christianity
is by the Jewish theology, to which its sublime author had
necessarily to adopt and accommodate it, partly consciously,
partly, it may be, unconsciously. Thus Christianity is made[501]
up of two very different constituent parts, and I should like to
call the purely ethical part especially and indeed exclusively
Christian, and distinguish it from the Jewish dogmatism with
which it is combined. If, as has often been feared, and especially
at the present time, that excellent and salutary religion should
altogether decline, I should look for the reason of this simply in
the fact that it does not consist of one single element, but of two
originally different elements, which have only been combined
through the accident of history. In such a case dissolution
had to follow through the separation of these elements, arising
from their different relationship to and reaction against the
progressive spirit of the age. But even after this dissolution
the purely ethical part must always remain uninjured, because
it is indestructible. Our knowledge of Hindu literature is still
very imperfect. Yet, as we find their ethical teaching variously
and powerfully expressed in the Vedas, Puranas, poems, myths,
legends of their saints, maxims and precepts,85 we see that it
inculcates love of our neighbour with complete renunciation of
self-love; love generally, not confined to mankind, but including
all living creatures; benevolence, even to the giving away of
the hard-won wages of daily toil; unlimited patience towards
85 See, for example, “Oupnek'hat, studio Anquetil du Perron,” vol. ii., Nos.

Sir William Jones (German by Hüttner, 1797), especially the sixth and twelfth
chapters. Finally, many passages in the “Asiatic Researches.” (In the last forty
years Indian literature has grown so much in Europe, that if I were now to
complete this note to the first edition, it would occupy several pages.)
497
all who injure us; the requital of all wickedness, however base,
with goodness and love; voluntary and glad endurance of all
ignominy; abstinence from all animal food; perfect chastity and
renunciation of all sensual pleasure for him who strives after [502]
true holiness; the surrender of all possessions, the forsaking of
every dwelling-place and of all relatives; deep unbroken solitude,
spent in silent contemplation, with voluntary penance and terrible
slow self-torture for the absolute mortification of the will, torture
which extends to voluntary death by starvation, or by men giving
themselves up to crocodiles, or flinging themselves over the
sacred precipice in the Himalayas, or being buried alive, or,
finally, by flinging themselves under the wheels of the huge
car of an idol drawn along amid the singing, shouting, and
dancing of bayaderes. And even yet these precepts, whose origin
reaches back more than four thousand years, are carried out in
practice, in some cases even to the utmost extreme,86 and this
notwithstanding the fact that the Hindu nation has been broken
up into so many parts. A religion which demands the greatest
sacrifices, and which has yet remained so long in practice in
a nation that embraces so many millions of persons, cannot be
an arbitrarily invented superstition, but must have its foundation
in the nature of man. But besides this, if we read the life of
a Christian penitent or saint, and also that of a Hindu saint,
we cannot sufficiently wonder at the harmony we find between
them. In the case of such radically different dogmas, customs,
and circumstances, the inward life and effort of both is the
same. And the same harmony prevails in the maxims prescribed
for both of them. For example, Tauler speaks of the absolute
poverty which one ought to seek, and which consists in giving
away and divesting oneself completely of everything from which
one might draw comfort or worldly pleasure, clearly because
86 At the procession of Jagganath in June 1840, eleven Hindus threw
themselves under the wheels, and were instantly killed. (Letter of an East
Indian proprietor in the Times of 30th December 1840.)
498 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
all this constantly affords new nourishment to the will, which it
is intended to destroy entirely. And as an Indian counterpart[503]
of this, we find in the precepts of Fo that the Saniassi, who
ought to be without a dwelling and entirely without property,
is further finally enjoined not to lay himself down often under
the same tree, lest he should acquire a preference or inclination
for it above other trees. The Christian mystic and the teacher
of the Vedanta philosophy agree in this respect also, they both
regard all outward works and religious exercises as superfluous
for him who has attained to perfection. So much agreement in
the case of such different ages and nations is a practical proof
that what is expressed here is not, as optimistic dulness likes to
assert, an eccentricity and perversity of the mind, but an essential
side of human nature, which only appears so rarely because of
its excellence.
I have now indicated the sources from which there may
be obtained a direct knowledge, drawn from life itself, of the
phenomena in which the denial of the will to live exhibits itself.
In some respects this is the most important point of our whole
work; yet I have only explained it quite generally, for it is
better to refer to those who speak from direct experience, than to
increase the size of this book unduly by weak repetitions of what
is said by them.
I only wish to add a little to the general indication of the
nature of this state. We saw above that the wicked man, by the
vehemence of his volition, suffers constant, consuming, inward
pain, and finally, if all objects of volition are exhausted, quenches
the fiery thirst of his self-will by the sight of the suffering of
others. He, on the contrary, who has attained to the denial of
the will to live, however poor, joyless, and full of privation his
condition may appear when looked at externally, is yet filled
with inward joy and the true peace of heaven. It is not the restless
strain of life, the jubilant delight which has keen suffering as
its preceding or succeeding condition, in the experience of the
499
man who loves life; but it is a peace that cannot be shaken, a [504]
deep rest and inward serenity, a state which we cannot behold
without the greatest longing when it is brought before our eyes
or our imagination, because we at once recognise it as that which
alone is right, infinitely surpassing everything else, upon which
our better self cries within us the great sapere aude. Then we
feel that every gratification of our wishes won from the world is
merely like the alms which the beggar receives from life to-day
that he may hunger again on the morrow; resignation, on the
contrary, is like an inherited estate, it frees the owner for ever
from all care.
It will be remembered from the Third Book that the æsthetic
pleasure in the beautiful consists in great measure in the fact
that in entering the state of pure contemplation we are lifted
for the moment above all willing, i.e., all wishes and cares; we
become, as it were, freed from ourselves. We are no longer the
individual whose knowledge is subordinated to the service of its
constant willing, the correlative of the particular thing to which
objects are motives, but the eternal subject of knowing purified
from will, the correlative of the Platonic Idea. And we know
that these moments in which, delivered from the ardent strain of
will, we seem to rise out of the heavy atmosphere of earth, are
the happiest which we experience. From this we can understand
how blessed the life of a man must be whose will is silenced, not
merely for a moment, as in the enjoyment of the beautiful, but
for ever, indeed altogether extinguished, except as regards the
last glimmering spark that retains the body in life, and will be
extinguished with its death. Such a man, who, after many bitter
struggles with his own nature, has finally conquered entirely,
continues to exist only as a pure, knowing being, the undimmed
mirror of the world. Nothing can trouble him more, nothing can
move him, for he has cut all the thousand cords of will which
hold us bound to the world, and, as desire, fear, envy, anger, drag [505]
us hither and thither in constant pain. He now looks back smiling
500 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
and at rest on the delusions of this world, which once were able
to move and agonise his spirit also, but which now stand before
him as utterly indifferent to him, as the chess-men when the game
is ended, or as, in the morning, the cast-off masquerading dress
which worried and disquieted us in a night in Carnival. Life and
its forms now pass before him as a fleeting illusion, as a light
morning dream before half-waking eyes, the real world already
shining through it so that it can no longer deceive; and like
this morning dream, they finally vanish altogether without any
violent transition. From this we can understand the meaning of
Madame Guion when towards the end of her autobiography she
often expresses herself thus: “Everything is alike to me; I cannot
will anything more: often I know not whether I exist or not.” In
order to express how, after the extinction of the will, the death
of the body (which is indeed only the manifestation of the will,
and therefore loses all significance when the will is abolished)
can no longer have any bitterness, but is very welcome, I may be
allowed to quote the words of that holy penitent, although they
are not very elegantly turned: “Midi de la gloire; jour où il n'y a
plus de nuit; vie qui ne craint plus la mort, dans la mort même:
parceque la mort a vaincu la mort, et que celui qui a souffert la
première mort, ne goutera plus la seconde mort” (Vie de Mad.
de Guion, vol. ii. p. 13).
We must not, however, suppose that when, by means of the
knowledge which acts as a quieter of will, the denial of the will
to live has once appeared, it never wavers or vacillates, and that
we can rest upon it as on an assured possession. Rather, it must
ever anew be attained by a constant battle. For since the body is
the will itself only in the form of objectivity or as manifestation
in the world as idea, so long as the body lives, the whole will to[506]
live exists potentially, and constantly strives to become actual,
and to burn again with all its ardour. Therefore that peace and
blessedness in the life of holy men which we have described
is only found as the flower which proceeds from the constant
501
victory over the will, and the ground in which it grows is the
constant battle with the will to live, for no one can have lasting
peace upon earth. We therefore see the histories of the inner
life of saints full of spiritual conflicts, temptations, and absence
of grace, i.e., the kind of knowledge which makes all motives
ineffectual, and as an universal quieter silences all volition, gives
the deepest peace and opens the door of freedom. Therefore
also we see those who have once attained to the denial of the
will to live strive with all their might to keep upon this path,
by enforced renunciation of every kind, by penance and severity
of life, and by selecting whatever is disagreeable to them, all in
order to suppress the will, which is constantly springing up anew.
Hence, finally, because they already know the value of salvation,
their anxious carefulness to retain the hard-won blessing, their
scruples of conscience about every innocent pleasure, or about
every little excitement of their vanity, which here also dies last,
the most immovable, the most active, and the most foolish of
all the inclinations of man. By the term asceticism, which I
have used so often, I mean in its narrower sense this intentional
breaking of the will by the refusal of what is agreeable and the
selection of what is disagreeable, the voluntarily chosen life of
penance and self-chastisement for the continual mortification of
the will.
We see this practised by him who has attained to the denial
of the will in order to enable him to persist in it; but suffering
in general, as it is inflicted by fate, is a second way (¥μ≈ƒμ¡ø¬
¿ªø≈¬87) of attaining to that denial. Indeed, we may assume that
most men only attain to it in this way, and that it is the suffering
which is personally experienced, not that which is merely known, [507]
which most frequently produces complete resignation, often only
at the approach of death. For only in the case of a few is the mere
knowledge which, seeing through the principium individuationis,
87 On ¥μ≈ƒμ¡ø¬ ¿ªø≈¬ cf. Stob. Floril., vol. ii. p. 374.
502 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
first produces perfect goodness of disposition and universal love
of humanity, and finally enables them to regard all the suffering
of the world as their own; only in the case of a few, I say, is
this knowledge sufficient to bring about the denial of the will.
Even with him who approaches this point, it is almost invariably
the case that the tolerable condition of his own body, the flattery
of the moment, the delusion of hope, and the satisfaction of the
will, which is ever presenting itself anew, i.e., lust, is a constant
hindrance to the denial of the will, and a constant temptation to
the renewed assertion of it. Therefore in this respect all these
illusions have been personified as the devil. Thus in most cases
the will must be broken by great personal suffering before its self-
conquest appears. Then we see the man who has passed through
all the increasing degrees of affliction with the most vehement
resistance, and is finally brought to the verge of despair, suddenly
retire into himself, know himself and the world, change his whole
nature, rise above himself and all suffering, as if purified and
sanctified by it, in inviolable peace, blessedness, and sublimity,
willingly renounce everything he previously desired with all his
might, and joyfully embrace death. It is the refined silver of
the denial of the will to live that suddenly comes forth from the
purifying flame of suffering. It is salvation. Sometimes we see
even those who were very wicked purified to this degree by great
grief; they have become new beings and are completely changed.
Therefore their former misdeeds trouble their consciences no
more, yet they willingly atone for them by death, and gladly see
the end of the manifestation of that will which is now foreign
to them and abhorred by them. The great Goethe has given[508]
us a distinct and visible representation of this denial of the will,
brought about by great misfortunes and despair of all deliverance,
in his immortal masterpiece “Faust,” in the story of the sufferings
of Gretchen. I know no parallel to this in poetry. It is a perfect
example of the second path that leads to the denial of the will,
not, as the first, through the mere knowledge of the sufferings of
503
a whole world which one has voluntarily acquired, but through
excessive suffering experienced in one's own person. Many
tragedies certainly end by conducting their strong-willed heroes
to the point of entire resignation, and then generally the will
to live and its manifestation end together, but no representation
that is known to me brings what is essential to that change so
distinctly before us, free from all that is extraneous, as the part
of “Faust” I have referred to.
In actual life we see that those unfortunate persons who have
to drink to the dregs the greatest cup of suffering, since when all
hope is taken from them they have to face with full consciousness
a shameful, violent, and often painful death on the scaffold, are
very frequently changed in this way. We must not indeed assume
that there is so great a difference between their character and
that of most men as their fate would seem to indicate, but must
attribute the latter for the most part to circumstances; yet they
are guilty and to a considerable degree bad. We see, however,
many of them, when they have entirely lost hope, changed in the
way referred to. They now show actual goodness and purity of
disposition, true abhorrence of doing any act in the least degree
bad or unkind. They forgive their enemies, even if it is through
them that they innocently suffer; and not with words merely and
a sort of hypocritical fear of the judges of the lower world, but
in reality and with inward earnestness and no desire for revenge.
Indeed, their sufferings and death at last becomes dear to them,
for the denial of the will to live has appeared; they often decline
the deliverance when it is offered, and die gladly, peacefully, and [509]
happily. To them the last secret of life has revealed itself in their
excessive pain; the secret that misery and wickedness, sorrow and
hate, the sufferer and the inflicter of suffering, however different
they may appear to the knowledge which follows the principle of
sufficient reason, are in themselves one, the manifestation of that
one will to live which objectifies its conflict with itself by means
of the principium individuationis. They have learned to know
504 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
both sides in full measure, the badness and the misery; and since
at last they see the identity of the two, they reject them both at
once; they deny the will to live. In what myths and dogmas they
account to their reason for this intuitive and direct knowledge
and for their own change is, as has been said, a matter of no
importance.
Matthias Claudius must without doubt have witnessed a
change of mind of this description when he wrote the remarkable
essay in the “Wandsbecker Boten” (pt. i. p. 115) with the title
“Bekehrungsgeschichte des ***” (“History of the Conversion of
***”), which concludes thus: “Man's way of thinking may pass
from one point of the periphery to the opposite point, and again
back to the former point, if circumstances mark out for him the
path. And these changes in a man are really nothing great or
interesting, but that remarkable, catholic, transcendental change
in which the whole circle is irreparably broken up and all the
laws of psychology become vain and empty when the coat is
stripped from the shoulders, or at least turned outside in, and as
it were scales fall from a man's eyes, is such that every one who
has breath in his nostrils forsakes father and mother if he can
hear or experience something certain about it.”
The approach of death and hopelessness are in other respects
not absolutely necessary for such a purification through suffering.
Even without them the knowledge of the contradiction of the will
to live with itself can, through great misfortune and pain, force[510]
an entrance, and the vanity of all striving become recognised.
Hence it has often happened that men who have led a very
restless life in the full strain of the passions, kings, heroes, and
adventurers, suddenly change, betake themselves to resignation
and penance, become hermits or monks. To this class belong
all true accounts of conversions; for example, that of Raymond
Lully, who had long wooed a fair lady, and was at last admitted to
her chamber, anticipating the fulfilment of all his wishes, when
she, opening her bodice, showed him her bosom frightfully eaten
505
with cancer. From that moment, as if he had looked into hell,
he was changed; he forsook the court of the king of Majorca,
and went into the desert to do penance.88 This conversion is
very like that of the Abbé Rancé, which I have briefly related in
the 48th chapter of the Supplement. If we consider how in both
cases the transition from the pleasure to the horror of life was the
occasion of it, this throws some light upon the remarkable fact
that it is among the French, the most cheerful, gay, sensuous, and
frivolous nation in Europe, that by far the strictest of all monastic
orders, the Trappists, arose, was re-established by Rancé after its
fall, and has maintained itself to the present day in all its purity
and strictness, in spite of revolutions, Church reformations, and
encroachments of infidelity.
But a knowledge such as that referred to above of the nature
of this existence may leave us again along with the occasion of
it and the will to live, and with it the previous character may
reappear. Thus we see that the passionate Benvenuto Cellini was
changed in this way, once when he was in prison, and again when
very ill; but when the suffering passed over, he fell back again
into his old state. In general, the denial of the will to live by
no means proceeds from suffering with the necessity of an effect
from its cause, but the will remains free; for this is indeed the one [511]
point at which its freedom appears directly in the phenomenon;
hence the astonishment which Asmus expresses so strongly at
the “transcendental change.” In the case of every suffering, it is
always possible to conceive a will which exceeds it in intensity
and is therefore unconquered by it. Thus Plato speaks in the
“Phædon” of men who up to the moment of their execution feast,
drink, and indulge in sensuous pleasure, asserting life even to
the death. Shakespeare shows us in Cardinal Beaufort the fearful
end of a profligate, who dies full of despair, for no suffering or
death can break his will, which is vehement to the extreme of
88 Bruckeri Hist. Philos., tomi iv. pars. i. p. 10.
506 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
wickedness.89
The more intense the will is, the more glaring is the conflict of
its manifestation, and thus the greater is the suffering. A world
which was the manifestation of a far more intense will to live
than this world manifests would produce so much the greater
suffering; would thus be a hell.
All suffering, since it is a mortification and a call to resignation,
has potentially a sanctifying power. This is the explanation of the
fact that every great misfortune or deep pain inspires a certain
awe. But the sufferer only really becomes an object of reverence
when, surveying the course of his life as a chain of sorrows,
or mourning some great and incurable misfortune, he does not
really look at the special combination of circumstances which has
plunged his own life into suffering, nor stops at the single great
misfortune that has befallen him; for in so doing his knowledge
still follows the principle of sufficient reason, and clings to the
particular phenomenon; he still wills life only not under the
conditions which have happened to him; but only then, I say,
he is truly worthy of reverence when he raises his glance from
the particular to the universal, when he regards his suffering as
merely an example of the whole, and for him, since in a moral[512]
regard he partakes of genius, one case stands for a thousand, so
that the whole of life conceived as essentially suffering brings
him to resignation. Therefore it inspires reverence when in
Goethe's “Torquato Tasso” the princess speaks of how her own
life and that of her relations has always been sad and joyless, and
yet regards the matter from an entirely universal point of view.
A very noble character we always imagine with a certain trace
of quiet sadness, which is anything but a constant fretfulness
at daily annoyances (this would be an ignoble trait, and lead
us to fear a bad disposition), but is a consciousness derived
from knowledge of the vanity of all possessions, of the suffering
89 Henry VI., Part ii. act 3, sc. 3.
507
of all life, not merely of his own. But such knowledge may
primarily be awakened by the personal experience of suffering,
especially some one great sorrow, as a single unfulfilled wish
brought Petrarch to that state of resigned sadness concerning the
whole of life which appeals to us so pathetically in his works;
for the Daphne he pursued had to flee from his hands in order to
leave him, instead of herself, the immortal laurel. When through
some such great and irrevocable denial of fate the will is to some
extent broken, almost nothing else is desired, and the character
shows itself mild, just, noble, and resigned. When, finally, grief
has no definite object, but extends itself over the whole of life,
then it is to a certain extent a going into itself, a withdrawal, a
gradual disappearance of the will, whose visible manifestation,
the body, it imperceptibly but surely undermines, so that a man
feels a certain loosening of his bonds, a mild foretaste of that
death which promises to be the abolition at once of the body and
of the will. Therefore a secret pleasure accompanies this grief,
and it is this, as I believe, which the most melancholy of all
nations has called “the joy of grief.” But here also lies the danger
of sentimentality, both in life itself and in the representation of
it in poetry; when a man is always mourning and lamenting [513]
without courageously rising to resignation. In this way we lose
both earth and heaven, and retain merely a watery sentimentality.
Only if suffering assumes the form of pure knowledge, and this,
acting as a quieter of the will, brings about resignation, is it
worthy of reverence. In this regard, however, we feel a certain
respect at the sight of every great sufferer which is akin to the
feeling excited by virtue and nobility of character, and also seems
like a reproach of our own happy condition. We cannot help
regarding every sorrow, both our own and those of others, as at
least a potential advance towards virtue and holiness, and, on the
contrary, pleasures and worldly satisfactions as a retrogression
from them. This goes so far, that every man who endures a
great bodily or mental suffering, indeed every one who merely
508 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
performs some physical labour which demands the greatest
exertion, in the sweat of his brow and with evident exhaustion,
yet with patience and without murmuring, every such man, I
say, if we consider him with close attention, appears to us like a
sick man who tries a painful cure, and who willingly, and even
with satisfaction, endures the suffering it causes him, because he
knows that the more he suffers the more the cause of his disease
is affected, and that therefore the present suffering is the measure
of his cure.
According to what has been said, the denial of the will to
live, which is just what is called absolute, entire resignation, or
holiness, always proceeds from that quieter of the will which the
knowledge of its inner conflict and essential vanity, expressing
themselves in the suffering of all living things, becomes. The
difference, which we have represented as two paths, consists
in whether that knowledge is called up by suffering which
is merely and purely known, and is freely appropriated by
means of the penetration of the principium individuationis, or by
suffering which is directly felt by a man himself. True salvation,
deliverance from life and suffering, cannot even be imagined
without complete denial of the will. Till then, every one is[514]
simply this will itself, whose manifestation is an ephemeral
existence, a constantly vain and empty striving, and the world
full of suffering we have represented, to which all irrevocably
and in like manner belong. For we found above that life is always
assured to the will to live, and its one real form is the present,
from which they can never escape, since birth and death reign
in the phenomenal world. The Indian mythus expresses this by
saying “they are born again.” The great ethical difference of
character means this, that the bad man is infinitely far from the
attainment of the knowledge from which the denial of the will
proceeds, and therefore he is in truth actually exposed to all the
miseries which appear in life as possible; for even the present
fortunate condition of his personality is merely a phenomenon
509
produced by the principium individuationis, and a delusion of
Mâyâ, the happy dream of a beggar. The sufferings which in
the vehemence and ardour of his will he inflicts upon others are
the measure of the suffering, the experience of which in his own
person cannot break his will, and plainly lead it to the denial
of itself. All true and pure love, on the other hand, and even
all free justice, proceed from the penetration of the principium
individuationis, which, if it appears with its full power, results
in perfect sanctification and salvation, the phenomenon of which
is the state of resignation described above, the unbroken peace
which accompanies it, and the greatest delight in death.90
§ 69. Suicide, the actual doing away with the individual
manifestation of will, differs most widely from the denial of
the will to live, which is the single outstanding act of free-will
in the manifestation, and is therefore, as Asmus calls it, the
transcendental change. This last has been fully considered in
the course of our work. Far from being denial of the will,
suicide is a phenomenon of strong assertion of will; for the
essence of negation lies in this, that the joys of life are shunned, [515]
not its sorrows. The suicide wills life, and is only dissatisfied
with the conditions under which it has presented itself to him.
He therefore by no means surrenders the will to live, but only
life, in that he destroys the individual manifestation. He wills
life—wills the unrestricted existence and assertion of the body;
but the complication of circumstances does not allow this, and
there results for him great suffering. The very will to live
finds itself so much hampered in this particular manifestation
that it cannot put forth its energies. It therefore comes to
such a determination as is in conformity with its own nature,
which lies outside the conditions of the principle of sufficient
reason, and to which, therefore, all particular manifestations are
alike indifferent, inasmuch as it itself remains unaffected by all
90 Cf. Ch. xlviii. of the Supplement.
510 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
appearing and passing away, and is the inner life of all things;
for that firm inward assurance by reason of which we all live free
from the constant dread of death, the assurance that a phenomenal
existence can never be wanting to the will, supports our action
even in the case of suicide. Thus the will to live appears just as
much in suicide (Siva) as in the satisfaction of self-preservation
(Vishnu) and in the sensual pleasure of procreation (Brahma).
This is the inner meaning of the unity of the Trimurtis, which is
embodied in its entirety in every human being, though in time it
raises now one, now another, of its three heads. Suicide stands in
the same relation to the denial of the will as the individual thing
does to the Idea. The suicide denies only the individual, not the
species. We have already seen that as life is always assured to
the will to live, and as sorrow is inseparable from life, suicide,
the wilful destruction of the single phenomenal existence, is a
vain and foolish act; for the thing-in-itself remains unaffected
by it, even as the rainbow endures however fast the drops which
support it for the moment may change. But, more than this, it
is also the masterpiece of Mâyâ, as the most flagrant example[516]
of the contradiction of the will to live with itself. As we found
this contradiction in the case of the lowest manifestations of will,
in the permanent struggle of all the forces of nature, and of all
organic individuals for matter and time and space; and as we
saw this antagonism come ever more to the front with terrible
distinctness in the ascending grades of the objectification of the
will, so at last in the highest grade, the Idea of man, it reaches the
point at which, not only the individuals which express the same
Idea extirpate each other, but even the same individual declares
war against itself. The vehemence with which it wills life, and
revolts against what hinders it, namely, suffering, brings it to the
point of destroying itself; so that the individual will, by its own
act, puts an end to that body which is merely its particular visible
expression, rather than permit suffering to break the will. Just
because the suicide cannot give up willing, he gives up living.
511
The will asserts itself here even in putting an end to its own
manifestation, because it can no longer assert itself otherwise.
As, however, it was just the suffering which it so shuns that was
able, as mortification of the will, to bring it to the denial of itself,
and hence to freedom, so in this respect the suicide is like a sick
man, who, after a painful operation which would entirely cure
him has been begun, will not allow it to be completed, but prefers
to retain his disease. Suffering approaches and reveals itself as
the possibility of the denial of will; but the will rejects it, in that
it destroys the body, the manifestation of itself, in order that it
may remain unbroken. This is the reason why almost all ethical
teachers, whether philosophical or religious, condemn suicide,
although they themselves can only give far-fetched sophistical
reasons for their opinion. But if a human being was ever
restrained from committing suicide by purely moral motives,
the inmost meaning of this self-conquest (in whatever ideas his
reason may have clothed it) was this: “I will not shun suffering, [517]
in order that it may help to put an end to the will to live, whose
manifestation is so wretched, by so strengthening the knowledge
of the real nature of the world which is already beginning to
dawn upon me, that it may become the final quieter of my will,
and may free me for ever.”
It is well known that from time to time cases occur in which
the act of suicide extends to the children. The father first kills
the children he loves, and then himself. Now, if we consider that
conscience, religion, and all influencing ideas teach him to look
upon murder as the greatest of crimes, and that, in spite of this,
he yet commits it, in the hour of his own death, and when he is
altogether uninfluenced by any egotistical motive, such a deed
can only be explained in the following manner: in this case, the
will of the individual, the father, recognises itself immediately
in the children, though involved in the delusion of mistaking the
appearance for the true nature; and as he is at the same time
deeply impressed with the knowledge of the misery of all life,
512 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
he now thinks to put an end to the inner nature itself, along with
the appearance, and thus seeks to deliver from existence and
its misery both himself and his children, in whom he discerns
himself as living again. It would be an error precisely analogous
to this to suppose that one may reach the same end as is attained
through voluntary chastity by frustrating the aim of nature in
fecundation; or indeed if, in consideration of the unendurable
suffering of life, parents were to use means for the destruction
of their new-born children, instead of doing everything possible
to ensure life to that which is struggling into it. For if the
will to live is there, as it is the only metaphysical reality, or
the thing-in-itself, no physical force can break it, but can only
destroy its manifestation at this place and time. It itself can never
be transcended except through knowledge. Thus the only way[518]
of salvation is, that the will shall manifest itself unrestrictedly,
in order that in this individual manifestation it may come to
apprehend its own nature. Only as the result of this knowledge
can the will transcend itself, and thereby end the suffering which
is inseparable from its manifestation. It is quite impossible to
accomplish this end by physical force, as by destroying the
germ, or by killing the new-born child, or by committing suicide.
Nature guides the will to the light, just because it is only in the
light that it can work out its salvation. Therefore the aims of
Nature are to be promoted in every way as soon as the will to
live, which is its inner being, has determined itself.
There is a species of suicide which seems to be quite distinct
from the common kind, though its occurrence has perhaps not yet
been fully established. It is starvation, voluntarily chosen on the
ground of extreme asceticism. All instances of it, however, have
been accompanied and obscured by much religious fanaticism,
and even superstition. Yet it seems that the absolute denial of
will may reach the point at which the will shall be wanting to
take the necessary nourishment for the support of the natural life.

This kind of suicide is so far from being the result of the will to live, that such a completely resigned ascetic only ceases to live
because he has already altogether ceased to will. No other death
than that by starvation is in this case conceivable (unless it were
the result of some special superstition); for the intention to cut
short the torment would itself be a stage in the assertion of will.
The dogmas which satisfy the reason of such a penitent delude
him with the idea that a being of a higher nature has inculcated
the fasting to which his own inner tendency drives him. Old
examples of this may be found in the “Breslauer Sammlung
von Natur- und Medicin-Geschichten,” September 1799, p. 363;
in Bayle's “Nouvelles de la République des Lettres,” February [519]
1685, p. 189; in Zimmermann, “Ueber die Einsamkeit,” vol. i.
p. 182; in the “Histoire de l'Académie des Sciences” for 1764,
an account by Houttuyn, which is quoted in the “Sammlung für
praktische Aerzte,” vol. i. p. 69. More recent accounts may be
found in Hufeland's “Journal für praktische Heilkunde,” vol. x.
p. 181, and vol. xlviii. p. 95; also in Nasse's “Zeitschrift für
psychische Aerzte,” 1819, part iii. p. 460; and in the “Edinburgh
Medical and Surgical Journal,” 1809, vol. v. p. 319. In the year
1833 all the papers announced that the English historian, Dr.
Lingard, had died in January at Dover of voluntary starvation;
according to later accounts, it was not he himself, but a relation of
his who died. Still in these accounts the persons were generally
described as insane, and it is no longer possible to find out how
far this was the case. But I will give here a more recent case
of this kind, if it were only to ensure the preservation of one of
the rare instances of this striking and extraordinary phenomenon
of human nature, which, to all appearance at any rate, belongs
to the category to which I wish to assign it and could hardly
be explained in any other way. This case is reported in the
“Nürnberger Correspondenten” of the 29th July 1813, in these
words:—“We hear from Bern that in a thick wood near Thurnen
a hut has been discovered in which was lying the body of a man
who had been dead about a month. His clothes gave little or no
514 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
clue to his social position. Two very fine shirts lay beside him.
The most important article, however, was a Bible interleaved
with white paper, part of which had been written upon by the
deceased. In this writing he gives the date of his departure from
home (but does not mention where his home was). He then says
that he was driven by the Spirit of God into the wilderness to
pray and fast. During his journey he had fasted seven days and
then he had again taken food. After this he had begun again
to fast, and continued to do so for the same number of days[520]
as before. From this point we find each day marked with a
stroke, and of these there are five, at the expiration of which
the pilgrim presumably died. There was further found a letter
to a clergyman about a sermon which the deceased heard him
preach, but the letter was not addressed.” Between this voluntary
death arising from extreme asceticism and the common suicide
resulting from despair there may be various intermediate species
and combinations, though this is hard to find out. But human
nature has depths, obscurities, and perplexities, the analysis and
elucidation of which is a matter of the very greatest difficulty.
§ 70. It might be supposed that the entire exposition
(now terminated) of that which I call the denial of the will
is irreconcilable with the earlier explanation of necessity, which
belongs just as much to motivation as to every other form of the
principle of sufficient reason, and according to which, motives,
like all causes, are only occasional causes, upon which the
character unfolds its nature and reveals it with the necessity of a
natural law, on account of which we absolutely denied freedom
as liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ. But far from suppressing
this here, I would call it to mind. In truth, real freedom, i.e.,
independence of the principle of sufficient reason, belongs to
the will only as a thing-in-itself, not to its manifestation, whose
essential form is everywhere the principle of sufficient reason,
the element or sphere of necessity. But the one case in which
that freedom can become directly visible in the manifestation
515
is that in which it makes an end of what manifests itself, and
because the mere manifestation, as a link in the chain of causes,
the living body in time, which contains only phenomena, still
continues to exist, the will which manifests itself through this
phenomenon then stands in contradiction to it, for it denies
what the phenomenon expresses. In such a case the organs of
generation, for example, as the visible form of the sexual impulse,
are there and in health; but yet, in the inmost consciousness, [521]
no sensual gratification is desired; and although the whole
body is only the visible expression of the will to live, yet the
motives which correspond to this will no longer act; indeed, the
dissolution of the body, the end of the individual, and in this way
the greatest check to the natural will, is welcome and desired.
Now, the contradiction between our assertions of the necessity
of the determination of the will by motives, in accordance with
the character, on the one hand, and of the possibility of the entire
suppression of the will whereby the motives become powerless,
on the other hand, is only the repetition in the reflection of
philosophy of this real contradiction which arises from the direct
encroachment of the freedom of the will-in-itself, which knows
no necessity, into the sphere of the necessity of its manifestation.
But the key to the solution of these contradictions lies in the
fact that the state in which the character is withdrawn from the
power of motives does not proceed directly from the will, but
from a changed form of knowledge. So long as the knowledge is
merely that which is involved in the principium individuationis
and exclusively follows the principle of sufficient reason, the
strength of the motives is irresistible. But when the principium
individuationis is seen through, when the Ideas, and indeed
the inner nature of the thing-in-itself, as the same will in all,
are directly recognised, and from this knowledge an universal
quieter of volition arises, then the particular motives become
ineffective, because the kind of knowledge which corresponds
to them is obscured and thrown into the background by quite
516 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
another kind. Therefore the character can never partially change,
but must, with the consistency of a law of Nature, carry out in
the particular the will which it manifests as a whole. But this
whole, the character itself, may be completely suppressed or
abolished through the change of knowledge referred to above. It
is this suppression or abolition which Asmus, as quoted above,[522]
marvels at and denotes the “catholic, transcendental change;”
and in the Christian Church it has very aptly been called the
new birth, and the knowledge from which it springs, the work of
grace. Therefore it is not a question of a change, but of an entire
suppression of the character; and hence it arises that, however
different the characters which experience the suppression may
have been before it, after it they show a great similarity in their
conduct, though every one still speaks very differently according
to his conceptions and dogmas.

In this sense, then, the old philosophical doctrine of the
freedom of the will, which has constantly been contested and
constantly maintained, is not without ground, and the dogma
of the Church of the work of grace and the new birth is not
without meaning and significance. But we now unexpectedly
see both united in one, and we can also now understand in what
sense the excellent Malebranche could say, “La liberté est un
mystère,” and was right. For precisely what the Christian mystics
call the work of grace and the new birth, is for us the single
direct expression of the freedom of the will. It only appears if
the will, having attained to a knowledge of its own real nature,
receives from this a quieter, by means of which the motives are
deprived of their effect, which belongs to the province of another
kind of knowledge, the objects of which are merely phenomena.
The possibility of the freedom which thus expresses itself is the
greatest prerogative of man, which is for ever wanting to the
brute, because the condition of it is the deliberation of reason,
which enables him to survey the whole of life independent of
the impression of the present. The brute is entirely without the
517
possibility of freedom, as, indeed, it is without the possibility of a
proper or deliberate choice following upon a completed conflict
of motives, which for this purpose would have to be abstract
ideas. Therefore with the same necessity with which the stone [523]
falls to the earth, the hungry wolf buries its fangs in the flesh of
its prey, without the possibility of the knowledge that it is itself
the destroyed as well as the destroyer. Necessity is the kingdom
of nature; freedom is the kingdom of grace.
Now because, as we have seen, that self-suppression of the
will proceeds from knowledge, and all knowledge is involuntary,
that denial of will also, that entrance into freedom, cannot be
forcibly attained to by intention or design, but proceeds from the
inmost relation of knowing and volition in the man, and therefore
comes suddenly, as if spontaneously from without. This is why
the Church has called it the work of grace; and that it still regards
it as independent of the acceptance of grace corresponds to the
fact that the effect of the quieter is finally a free act of will.
And because, in consequence of such a work of grace, the whole
nature of man is changed and reversed from its foundation, so
that he no longer wills anything of all that he previously willed
so intensely, so that it is as if a new man actually took the place
of the old, the Church has called this consequence of the work of
grace the new birth. For what it calls the natural man, to which
it denies all capacity for good, is just the will to live, which must
be denied if deliverance from an existence such as ours is to be
attained. Behind our existence lies something else, which is only
accessible to us if we have shaken off this world.

Having regard, not to the individuals according to the principle
of sufficient reason, but to the Idea of man in its unity, Christian
theology symbolises nature, the assertion of the will to live in
Adam, whose sin, inherited by us, i.e., our unity with him in the
Idea, which is represented in time by the bond of procreation,
makes us all partakers of suffering and eternal death. On the
other hand, it symbolises grace, the denial of the will, salvation, in the incarnate God, who, as free from all sin, that is, from all[524]
willing of life, cannot, like us, have proceeded from the most
pronounced assertion of the will, nor can he, like us, have a body
which is through and through simply concrete will, manifestation
of the will; but born of a pure virgin, he has only a phantom
body. This last is the doctrine of the Docetæ, i.e., certain Church
Fathers, who in this respect are very consistent. It is especially
taught by Apelles, against whom and his followers Tertullian
wrote. But even Augustine comments thus on the passage, Rom.
viii. 3, “God sent his Son in the likeness of sinful flesh:”
“Non enim caro peccati erat, quæ non de carnali delectatione
nata erat: sed tamen inerat ei similitudo carnis peccati, quia
mortalis caro erat” (Liber 83, quæst. qu. 66). He also teaches
in his work entitled “Opus Imperfectum,” i. 47, that inherited
sin is both sin and punishment at once. It is already present
in new-born children, but only shows itself if they grow up.
Yet the origin of this sin is to be referred to the will of the
sinner. This sinner was Adam, but we all existed in him; Adam
became miserable, and in him we have all become miserable.
Certainly the doctrine of original sin (assertion of the will) and of
salvation (denial of the will) is the great truth which constitutes
the essence of Christianity, while most of what remains is only
the clothing of it, the husk or accessories. Therefore Jesus Christ
ought always to be conceived in the universal, as the symbol or
personification of the denial of the will to live, but never as an
individual, whether according to his mythical history given in the
Gospels, or according to the probably true history which lies at
the foundation of this. For neither the one nor the other will easily
satisfy us entirely. It is merely the vehicle of that conception
for the people, who always demand something actual. That in
recent times Christianity has forgotten its true significance, and
degenerated into dull optimism, does not concern us here.
It is further an original and evangelical doctrine of[525]
Christianity—which Augustine, with the consent of the leaders
519
of the Church, defended against the platitudes of the Pelagians,
and which it was the principal aim of Luther's endeavour to
purify from error and re-establish, as he expressly declares in
his book, “De Servo Arbitrio,”—the doctrine that the will is not
free, but originally subject to the inclination to evil. Therefore
according to this doctrine the deeds of the will are always sinful
and imperfect, and can never fully satisfy justice; and, finally,
these works can never save us, but faith alone, a faith which itself
does not spring from resolution and free will, but from the work
of grace, without our co-operation, comes to us as from without.
Not only the dogmas referred to before, but also this last
genuine evangelical dogma belongs to those which at the present
day an ignorant and dull opinion rejects as absurd or hides.
For, in spite of Augustine and Luther, it adheres to the vulgar
Pelagianism, which the rationalism of the day really is, and treats
as antiquated those deeply significant dogmas which are peculiar
and essential to Christianity in the strictest sense; while, on the
other hand, it holds fast and regards as the principal matter only
the dogma that originates in Judaism, and has been retained from
it, and is merely historically connected with Christianity.91 We,
91 How truly this is the case may be seen from the fact that all the contradictions
and inconceivabilities contained in the Christian dogmatics, consistently
systematised by Augustine, which have led to the Pelagian insipidity which is
opposed to them, vanish as soon as we abstract from the fundamental Jewish
dogma, and recognize that man is not the work of another, but of his own will.
Then all is at once clear and correct: then there is no need of freedom in the
operari, for it lies in the esse; and there also lies the sin as original sin. The
work of grace is, however, our own. To the rationalistic point of view of the
day, on the contrary, many doctrines of the Augustinian dogmatics, founded on
the New Testament, appear quite untenable, and indeed revolting; for example,
predestination. Accordingly Christianity proper is rejected, and a return is
made to crude Judaism. But the miscalculation or the original weakness of
Christian dogmatics lies—where it is never sought—precisely in that which is
withdrawn from all investigation as established and certain. Take this away
and the whole of dogmatics is rational; for this dogma destroys theology as
it does all other sciences. If any one studies the Augustinian theology in the
520 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
however, recognise in the doctrine referred to above the truth[526]
completely agreeing with the result of our own investigations.
We see that true virtue and holiness of disposition have their
origin not in deliberate choice (works), but in knowledge (faith);
just as we have in like manner developed it from our leading
thought. If it were works, which spring from motives and
deliberate intention, that led to salvation, then, however one may
turn it, virtue would always be a prudent, methodical, far-seeing
egoism. But the faith to which the Christian Church promises
salvation is this: that as through the fall of the first man we are all
partakers of sin and subject to death and perdition, through the
divine substitute, through grace and the taking upon himself of
our fearful guilt, we are all saved, without any merit of our own
(of the person); since that which can proceed from the intentional
(determined by motives) action of the person, works, can never
justify us, from its very nature, just because it is intentional,
action induced by motives, opus operatum. Thus in this faith
books “De Civitate Dei” (especially in the Fourteenth Book), he experiences
something analogous to the feeling of one who tries to make a body stand
whose centre of gravity falls outside it; however he may turn it and place it, it
always tumbles over again. So here, in spite of all the efforts and sophisms of
Augustine, the guilt and misery of the world always falls back on God, who
made everything and everything that is in everything, and also knew how all
things would go. That Augustine himself was conscious of the difficulty, and
puzzled by it, I have already shown in my prize-essay on the Freedom of the
Will (ch. iv. pp. 66-68 of the first and second editions). In the same way,
the contradiction between the goodness of God and the misery of the world,
and also between the freedom of the will and the foreknowledge of God, is
the inexhaustible theme of a controversy which lasted nearly a hundred years
between the Cartesians, Malebranche, Leibnitz, Bayle, Clarke, Arnauld, and
many others. The only dogma which was regarded as fixed by all parties was
the existence and attributes of God, and they all unceasingly move in a circle,
because they seek to bring these things into harmony, i.e., to solve a sum that
will not come right, but always shows a remainder at some new place whenever
we have concealed it elsewhere. But it does not occur to any one to seek for
the source of the difficulty in the fundamental assumption, although it palpably
obtrudes itself. Bayle alone shows that he saw this.
521
there is implied, first of all, that our condition is originally [527]
and essentially an incurable one, from which we need salvation;
then, that we ourselves essentially belong to evil, and are so
firmly bound to it that our works according to law and precept,
i.e., according to motives, can never satisfy justice nor save
us; but salvation is only obtained through faith, i.e., through a
changed mode of knowing, and this faith can only come through
grace, thus as from without. This means that the salvation is one
which is quite foreign to our person, and points to a denial and
surrender of this person necessary to salvation. Works, the result
of the law as such, can never justify, because they are always
action following upon motives. Luther demands (in his book “De
Libertate Christiana”) that after the entrance of faith the good
works shall proceed from it entirely of themselves, as symptoms,
as fruits of it; yet by no means as constituting in themselves a
claim to merit, justification, or reward, but taking place quite
voluntarily and gratuitously. So we also hold that from the ever-
clearer penetration of the principium individuationis proceeds,
first, merely free justice, then love, extending to the complete
abolition of egoism, and finally resignation or denial of the will.
I have here introduced these dogmas of Christian theology,
which in themselves are foreign to philosophy, merely for the
purpose of showing that the ethical doctrine which proceeds
from our whole investigation, and is in complete agreement and
connection with all its parts, although new and unprecedented
in its expression, is by no means so in its real nature, but fully
agrees with the Christian dogmas properly so called, and indeed,
as regards its essence, was contained and present in them. It
also agrees quite as accurately with the doctrines and ethical
teachings of the sacred books of India, which in their turn are
presented in quite different forms. At the same time the calling
to mind of the dogmas of the Christian Church serves to explain
and illustrate the apparent contradiction between the necessity [528]
of all expressions of character when motives are presented (the
522 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
kingdom of Nature) on the one hand, and the freedom of the
will in itself, to deny itself, and abolish the character with all the
necessity of the motives based upon it (the kingdom of grace) on
the other hand.
§ 71. I now end the general account of ethics, and with it
the whole development of that one thought which it has been
my object to impart; and I by no means desire to conceal here
an objection which concerns this last part of my exposition, but
rather to point out that it lies in the nature of the question, and
that it is quite impossible to remove it. It is this, that after our
investigation has brought us to the point at which we have before
our eyes perfect holiness, the denial and surrender of all volition,
and thus the deliverance from a world whose whole existence we
have found to be suffering, this appears to us as a passing away
into empty nothingness.
On this I must first remark, that the conception of nothing
is essentially relative, and always refers to a definite something
which it negatives. This quality has been attributed (by Kant)
merely to the nihil privativum, which is indicated by - as opposed
to +, which -, from an opposite point of view, might become
+, and in opposition to this nihil privativum the nihil negativum
has been set up, which would in every reference be nothing,
and as an example of this the logical contradiction which does
away with itself has been given. But more closely considered, no
absolute nothing, no proper nihil negativum is even thinkable;
but everything of this kind, when considered from a higher
standpoint or subsumed under a wider concept, is always merely
a nihil privativum. Every nothing is thought as such only in
relation to something, and presupposes this relation, and thus
also this something. Even a logical contradiction is only a
relative nothing. It is no thought of the reason, but it is not on that
account an absolute nothing; for it is a combination of words;[529]
it is an example of the unthinkable, which is necessary in logic
in order to prove the laws of thought. Therefore if for this end
523
such an example is sought, we will stick to the nonsense as the
positive which we are in search of, and pass over the sense as
the negative. Thus every nihil negativum, if subordinated to a
higher concept, will appear as a mere nihil privativum or relative
nothing, which can, moreover, always exchange signs with what
it negatives, so that that would then be thought as negation, and it
itself as assertion. This also agrees with the result of the difficult
dialectical investigation of the meaning of nothing which Plato
gives in the “Sophist” (pp. 277-287): §∑Ω ƒø≈ ƒμ¡ø≈ ∆≈√πΩ
±¿ø¥μπæ±Ωƒμ¬ ø≈√±Ω ƒμ, ∫±π ∫±ƒ±∫μ∫μ¡º±ƒπ√ºμΩ∑Ω μ¿π ¿±Ωƒ±

ƒø º∑ øΩ (Cum enim ostenderemus, alterius ipsius naturam esse
perque omnia entia divisam atque dispersam in vicem; tunc
partem ejus oppositam ei, quod cujusque ens est, esse ipsum
revera non ens asseruimus).
That which is generally received as positive, which we call
the real, and the negation of which the concept nothing in its
most general significance expresses, is just the world as idea,
which I have shown to be the objectivity and mirror of the will.
Moreover, we ourselves are just this will and this world, and to
them belongs the idea in general, as one aspect of them. The
form of the idea is space and time, therefore for this point of view
all that is real must be in some place and at some time. Denial,
abolition, conversion of the will, is also the abolition and the
vanishing of the world, its mirror. If we no longer perceive it in
this mirror, we ask in vain where it has gone, and then, because it
has no longer any where and when, complain that it has vanished
into nothing.
A reversed point of view, if it were possible for us, would [530]
reverse the signs and show the real for us as nothing, and that
nothing as the real. But as long as we ourselves are the will to live,
this last—nothing as the real—can only be known and signified
by us negatively, because the old saying of Empedocles, that like
524 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
can only be known by like, deprives us here of all knowledge,
as, conversely, upon it finally rests the possibility of all our
actual knowledge, i.e., the world as idea; for the world is the
self-knowledge of the will.
If, however, it should be absolutely insisted upon that in some
way or other a positive knowledge should be attained of that
which philosophy can only express negatively as the denial of
the will, there would be nothing for it but to refer to that state
which all those who have attained to complete denial of the
will have experienced, and which has been variously denoted
by the names ecstasy, rapture, illumination, union with God,
and so forth; a state, however, which cannot properly be called
knowledge, because it has not the form of subject and object, and
is, moreover, only attainable in one's own experience and cannot
be further communicated.
We, however, who consistently occupy the standpoint of
philosophy, must be satisfied here with negative knowledge,
content to have reached the utmost limit of the positive. We
have recognised the inmost nature of the world as will, and all its
phenomena as only the objectivity of will; and we have followed
this objectivity from the unconscious working of obscure forces
of Nature up to the completely conscious action of man. Therefore
we shall by no means evade the consequence, that with the free
denial, the surrender of the will, all those phenomena are also
abolished; that constant strain and effort without end and without
rest at all the grades of objectivity, in which and through which
the world consists; the multifarious forms succeeding each other
in gradation; the whole manifestation of the will; and, finally,
also the universal forms of this manifestation, time and space,
and also its last fundamental form, subject and object; all are[531]
abolished. No will: no idea, no world.

Before us there is certainly only nothingness. But that which
resists this passing into nothing, our nature, is indeed just the
will to live, which we ourselves are as it is our world. 

That we abhor annihilation so greatly, is simply another expression
of the fact that we so strenuously will life, and are nothing but
this will, and know nothing besides it. But if we turn our glance
from our own needy and embarrassed condition to those who
have overcome the world, in whom the will, having attained to
perfect self-knowledge, found itself again in all, and then freely
denied itself, and who then merely wait to see the last trace
of it vanish with the body which it animates; then, instead of
the restless striving and effort, instead of the constant transition
from wish to fruition, and from joy to sorrow, instead of the
never-satisfied and never-dying hope which constitutes the life
of the man who wills, we shall see that peace which is above
all reason, that perfect calm of the spirit, that deep rest, that
inviolable confidence and serenity, the mere reflection of which
in the countenance, as Raphael and Correggio have represented
it, is an entire and certain gospel; only knowledge remains, the
will has vanished. We look with deep and painful longing upon
this state, beside which the misery and wretchedness of our
own is brought out clearly by the contrast. Yet this is the only
consideration which can afford us lasting consolation, when, on
the one hand, we have recognised incurable suffering and endless
misery as essential to the manifestation of will, the world; and,
on the other hand, see the world pass away with the abolition of
will, and retain before us only empty nothingness. Thus, in this
way, by contemplation of the life and conduct of saints, whom it
is certainly rarely granted us to meet with in our own experience,
but who are brought before our eyes by their written history,
and, with the stamp of inner truth, by art, we must banish the 
dark impression of that nothingness which we discern behind
all virtue and holiness as their final goal, and which we fear as
children fear the dark; we must not even evade it like the Indians,
through myths and meaningless words, such as reabsorption in
Brahma or the Nirvana of the Buddhists. Rather do we freely
acknowledge that what remains after the entire abolition of will is for all those who are still full of will certainly nothing; but,
conversely, to those in whom the will has turned and has denied
itself, this our world, which is so real, with all its suns and
milky-ways—is nothing.92

92 This is also just the Prajna—Paramita of the Buddhists, the “beyond all
knowledge,” i.e., the point at which subject and object are no more. (Cf. J. J.
Schmidt, “Ueber das Mahajana und Pratschna-Paramita.”)
