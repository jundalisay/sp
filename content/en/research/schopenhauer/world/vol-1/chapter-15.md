Perception is the primary source of all evidence.

Only direct or indirect connection with it is absolute truth.

The shortest way to this is always the surest, as every interposition of concepts means
exposure to many deceptions; 

We apply this conviction to mathematics, as established as a science by Euclid, and has remained as a whole to our own day, we
cannot help regarding the method it adopts, as strange and indeed
perverted. We ask that every logical proof shall be traced back
to an origin in perception; but mathematics, on the contrary, is at great pains deliberately to throw away the evidence of
perception which is peculiar to it, and always at hand, that it
may substitute for it a logical demonstration. 

This must seem
to us like the action of a man who cuts off his legs in order to [091]
go on crutches, or like that of the prince in the “Triumph der
Empfindsamkeit” who flees from the beautiful reality of nature,
to delight in a stage scene that imitates it. I must here refer
to what I have said in the sixth chapter of the essay on the
principle of sufficient reason, and take for granted that it is fresh
and present in the memory of the reader; so that I may link
my observations on to it without explaining again the difference
between the mere ground of knowledge of a mathematical truth,
which can be given logically, and the ground of being, which is
the immediate connection of the parts of space and time, known
only in perception. It is only insight into the ground of being that
secures satisfaction and thorough knowledge. The mere ground
of knowledge must always remain superficial; it can afford us
indeed rational knowledge that a thing is as it is, but it cannot tell
why it is so. Euclid chose the latter way to the obvious detriment
of the science. For just at the beginning, for example, when
he ought to show once for all how in a triangle the angles and
sides reciprocally determine each other, and stand to each other
in the relation of reason and consequent, in accordance with the
form which the principle of sufficient reason has in pure space,
and which there, as in every other sphere, always affords the
necessity that a thing is as it is, because something quite different
from it, is as it is; instead of in this way giving a thorough insight
into the nature of the triangle, he sets up certain disconnected
arbitrarily chosen propositions concerning the triangle, and gives
a logical ground of knowledge of them, through a laborious
logical demonstration, based upon the principle of contradiction.
Instead of an exhaustive knowledge of these space-relations we
therefore receive merely certain results of them, imparted to us
at pleasure, and in fact we are very much in the position of a man to whom the different effects of an ingenious machine are[092]
shown, but from whom its inner connection and construction are
withheld. We are compelled by the principle of contradiction
to admit that what Euclid demonstrates is true, but we do not
comprehend why it is so. We have therefore almost the same
uncomfortable feeling that we experience after a juggling trick,
and, in fact, most of Euclid's demonstrations are remarkably
like such feats. The truth almost always enters by the back
door, for it manifests itself per accidens through some contingent
circumstance. Often a reductio ad absurdum shuts all the
doors one after another, until only one is left through which we
are therefore compelled to enter. Often, as in the proposition of
Pythagoras, lines are drawn, we don't know why, and it afterwards
appears that they were traps which close unexpectedly and take
prisoner the assent of the astonished learner, who must now admit
what remains wholly inconceivable in its inner connection, so
much so, that he may study the whole of Euclid through and
through without gaining a real insight into the laws of space-
relations, but instead of them he only learns by heart certain
results which follow from them. This specially empirical and
unscientific knowledge is like that of the doctor who knows both
the disease and the cure for it, but does not know the connection
between them. But all this is the necessary consequence if we
capriciously reject the special kind of proof and evidence of
one species of knowledge, and forcibly introduce in its stead
a kind which is quite foreign to its nature. However, in other
respects the manner in which this has been accomplished by
Euclid deserves all the praise which has been bestowed on him
through so many centuries, and which has been carried so far
that his method of treating mathematics has been set up as the
pattern of all scientific exposition. Men tried indeed to model all
the sciences after it, but later they gave up the attempt without
quite knowing why. 

Yet in our eyes this method of Euclid
in mathematics can appear only as a very brilliant piece of perversity. But when a great error in life or in science has
been intentionally and methodically carried out with universal
applause, it is always possible to discover its source in the
philosophy which prevailed at the time. The Eleatics first brought
out the difference, and indeed often the conflict, that exists
between what is perceived, ∆±πΩøºμΩøΩ,21 and what is thought,
Ωø≈ºμΩøΩ, and used it in many ways in their philosophical
epigrams, and also in sophisms. They were followed later by the
Megarics, the Dialecticians, the Sophists, the New-Academy, and
the Sceptics; these drew attention to the illusion, that is to say, to
the deception of the senses, or rather of the understanding which
transforms the data of the senses into perception, and which often
causes us to see things to which the reason unhesitatingly denies
reality; for example, a stick broken in water, and such like. It
came to be known that sense-perception was not to be trusted
unconditionally, and it was therefore hastily concluded that only
rational, logical thought could establish truth; although Plato (in
the Parmenides), the Megarics, Pyrrho, and the New-Academy,
showed by examples (in the manner which was afterwards
adopted by Sextus Empiricus) how syllogisms and concepts were
also sometimes misleading, and indeed produced paralogisms
and sophisms which arise much more easily and are far harder
to explain than the illusion of sense-perception. However, this
rationalism, which arose in opposition to empiricism, kept the
upper hand, and Euclid constructed the science of mathematics in
accordance with it. He was compelled by necessity to found the
axioms upon evidence of perception (∆±πΩøºμΩøΩ), but all the
rest he based upon reasoning (Ωø≈ºμΩøΩ). His method reigned
supreme through all the succeeding centuries, and it could not but
do so as long as pure intuition or perception, a priori, was not [094]
distinguished from empirical perception. Certain passages from
the works of Proclus, the commentator of Euclid, which Kepler

<!-- 21 The reader must not think here of Kant's misuse of these Greek terms, which
is condemned in the Appendix. -->

translated into Latin in his book, “De Harmonia Mundi,” seem
to show that he fully recognised this distinction. 

But Proclus did
not attach enough importance to the matter; he merely mentioned
it by the way, so that he remained unnoticed and accomplished
nothing. Therefore, not till two thousand years later will the
doctrine of Kant, which is destined to make such great changes
in all the knowledge, thought, and action of European nations,
produce this change in mathematics also. For it is only after
we have learned from this great man that the intuitions or
perceptions of space and time are quite different from empirical
perceptions, entirely independent of any impression of the senses,
conditioning it, not conditioned by it, i.e., are a priori, and
therefore are not exposed to the illusions of sense; only after we
have learned this, I say, can we comprehend that Euclid's logical
method of treating mathematics is a useless precaution, a crutch
for sound legs, that it is like a wanderer who during the night
mistakes a bright, firm road for water, and carefully avoiding it,
toils over the broken ground beside it, content to keep from point
to point along the edge of the supposed water. Only now can we
affirm with certainty that what presents itself to us as necessary
in the perception of a figure, does not come from the figure on
the paper, which is perhaps very defectively drawn, nor from the
abstract concept under which we think it, but immediately from
the form of all knowledge of which we are conscious a priori.
This is always the principle of sufficient reason; here as the form
of perception, i.e., space, it is the principle of the ground of being,
the evidence and validity of which is, however, just as great and
as immediate as that of the principle of the ground of knowing,
i.e., logical certainty. Thus we need not and ought not to leave
the peculiar province of mathematics in order to put our trust[095]
only in logical proof, and seek to authenticate mathematics in a
sphere which is quite foreign to it, that of concepts. If we confine
ourselves to the ground peculiar to mathematics, we gain the
great advantage that in it the rational knowledge that something
113
is, is one with the knowledge why it is so, whereas the method
of Euclid entirely separates these two, and lets us know only the
first, not the second. Aristotle says admirably in the Analyt.,
post. i. 27: “ë∫¡π≤μ√ƒμ¡± ¥Ω μ¿π√ƒ∑º∑ μ¿π√ƒ∑º∑¬ ∫±π ¿¡øƒμ¡±,
!ƒμ ƒø≈ Aƒπ ∫±π ƒø≈ ¥πøƒπ ! ±≈ƒ∑, ±ªª± º∑ «…¡π¬ ƒø≈ Aƒπ,
ƒ∑¬ ƒø≈ ¥πøƒπ” (Subtilior autem et praestantior ea est scientia,
quâ QUOD aliquid sit, et CUR sit una simulque intelligimus non
separatim QUOD, et CUR sit). In physics we are only satisfied
when the knowledge that a thing is as it is is combined with
the knowledge why it is so. To know that the mercury in the
Torricellian tube stands thirty inches high is not really rational
knowledge if we do not know that it is sustained at this height by
the counterbalancing weight of the atmosphere. Shall we then be
satisfied in mathematics with the qualitas occulta of the circle
that the segments of any two intersecting chords always contain
equal rectangles? That it is so Euclid certainly demonstrates
in the 35th Prop. of the Third Book; why it is so remains
doubtful. In the same way the proposition of Pythagoras teaches
us a qualitas occulta of the right-angled triangle; the stilted and
indeed fallacious demonstration of Euclid forsakes us at the why,
and a simple figure, which we already know, and which is present
to us, gives at a glance far more insight into the matter, and firm
inner conviction of that necessity, and of the dependence of that
quality upon the right angle:—

In the case of unequal catheti also, and indeed generally in the
case of every possible geometrical truth, it is quite possible to
obtain such a conviction based on perception, because these truths
were always discovered by such an empirically known necessity, and their demonstration was only thought out afterwards in
addition. Thus we only require an analysis of the process of
thought in the first discovery of a geometrical truth in order to
know its necessity empirically. It is the analytical method in
general that I wish for the exposition of mathematics, instead of
the synthetical method which Euclid made use of. Yet this would
have very great, though not insuperable, difficulties in the case
of complicated mathematical truths. Here and there in Germany
men are beginning to alter the exposition of mathematics, and to
proceed more in this analytical way. The greatest effort in this
direction has been made by Herr Kosack, teacher of mathematics
and physics in the Gymnasium at Nordhausen, who added a
thorough attempt to teach geometry according to my principles
to the programme of the school examination on the 6th of April
1852.
In order to improve the method of mathematics, it is especially
necessary to overcome the prejudice that demonstrated truth has
any superiority over what is known through perception, or that
logical truth founded upon the principle of contradiction has
any superiority over metaphysical truth, which is immediately
evident, and to which belongs the pure intuition or perception of
space.
That which is most certain, and yet always inexplicable, is
what is involved in the principle of sufficient reason, for this
principle, in its different aspects, expresses the universal form
of all our ideas and knowledge. All explanation consists of
reduction to it, exemplification in the particular case of the
connection of ideas expressed generally through it. It is thus the
principle of all explanation, and therefore it is neither susceptible
of an explanation itself, nor does it stand in need of it; for every[097]
explanation presupposes it, and only obtains meaning through
it. Now, none of its forms are superior to the rest; it is equally
certain and incapable of demonstration as the principle of the
ground of being, or of change, or of action, or of knowing. The
115
relation of reason and consequent is a necessity in all its forms,
and indeed it is, in general, the source of the concept of necessity,
for necessity has no other meaning. If the reason is given there
is no other necessity than that of the consequent, and there is
no reason that does not involve the necessity of the consequent.
Just as surely then as the consequent expressed in the conclusion
follows from the ground of knowledge given in the premises,
does the ground of being in space determine its consequent in
space: if I know through perception the relation of these two,
this certainty is just as great as any logical certainty. But every
geometrical proposition is just as good an expression of such a
relation as one of the twelve axioms; it is a metaphysical truth,
and as such, just as certain as the principle of contradiction itself,
which is a metalogical truth, and the common foundation of all
logical demonstration. Whoever denies the necessity, exhibited
for intuition or perception, of the space-relations expressed in
any proposition, may just as well deny the axioms, or that
the conclusion follows from the premises, or, indeed, he may
as well deny the principle of contradiction itself, for all these
relations are equally undemonstrable, immediately evident and
known a priori. For any one to wish to derive the necessity
of space-relations, known in intuition or perception, from the
principle of contradiction by means of a logical demonstration
is just the same as for the feudal superior of an estate to wish
to hold it as the vassal of another. Yet this is what Euclid has
done. His axioms only, he is compelled to leave resting upon
immediate evidence; all the geometrical truths which follow are
demonstrated logically, that is to say, from the agreement of [098]
the assumptions made in the proposition with the axioms which
are presupposed, or with some earlier proposition; or from the
contradiction between the opposite of the proposition and the
assumptions made in it, or the axioms, or earlier propositions, or
even itself. But the axioms themselves have no more immediate
evidence than any other geometrical problem, but only more
116 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
simplicity on account of their smaller content.
When a criminal is examined, a procès-verbal is made of
his statement in order that we may judge of its truth from its
consistency. But this is only a makeshift, and we are not satisfied
with it if it is possible to investigate the truth of each of his
answers for itself; especially as he might lie consistently from
the beginning. But Euclid investigated space according to this
first method. He set about it, indeed, under the correct assumption
that nature must everywhere be consistent, and that therefore it
must also be so in space, its fundamental form. Since then the
parts of space stand to each other in a relation of reason and
consequent, no single property of space can be different from
what it is without being in contradiction with all the others.
But this is a very troublesome, unsatisfactory, and roundabout
way to follow. It prefers indirect knowledge to direct, which
is just as certain, and it separates the knowledge that a thing is
from the knowledge why it is, to the great disadvantage of the
science; and lastly, it entirely withholds from the beginner insight
into the laws of space, and indeed renders him unaccustomed
to the special investigation of the ground and inner connection
of things, inclining him to be satisfied with a mere historical
knowledge that a thing is as it is. The exercise of acuteness
which this method is unceasingly extolled as affording consists
merely in this, that the pupil practises drawing conclusions, i.e.,
he practises applying the principle of contradiction, but specially
he exerts his memory to retain all those data whose agreement
is to be tested. Moreover, it is worth noticing that this method[099]
of proof was applied only to geometry and not to arithmetic. In
arithmetic the truth is really allowed to come home to us through
perception alone, which in it consists simply in counting. As the
perception of numbers is in time alone, and therefore cannot be
represented by a sensuous schema like the geometrical figure,
the suspicion that perception is merely empirical, and possibly
illusive, disappeared in arithmetic, and the introduction of the
117
logical method of proof into geometry was entirely due to this
suspicion. As time has only one dimension, counting is the only
arithmetical operation, to which all others may be reduced; and
yet counting is just intuition or perception a priori, to which
there is no hesitation in appealing here, and through which alone
everything else, every sum and every equation, is ultimately
proved. We prove, for example, not that (7 + 9 × 8 - 2)/3 = 42;
but we refer to the pure perception in time, counting thus makes
each individual problem an axiom. Instead of the demonstrations
that fill geometry, the whole content of arithmetic and algebra is
thus simply a method of abbreviating counting. We mentioned
above that our immediate perception of numbers in time extends
only to about ten. Beyond this an abstract concept of the numbers,
fixed by a word, must take the place of the perception; which
does not therefore actually occur any longer, but is only indicated
in a thoroughly definite manner. Yet even so, by the important
assistance of the system of figures which enables us to represent
all larger numbers by the same small ones, intuitive or perceptive
evidence of every sum is made possible, even where we make
such use of abstraction that not only the numbers, but indefinite
quantities and whole operations are thought only in the abstract
and indicated as so thought, as [sqrt](r^b) so that we do not
perform them, but merely symbolise them.
We might establish truth in geometry also, through pure [100]
a priori perception, with the same right and certainty as in
arithmetic. It is in fact always this necessity, known through
perception in accordance with the principle of sufficient reason
of being, which gives to geometry its principal evidence, and
upon which in the consciousness of every one, the certainty of
its propositions rests. The stilted logical demonstration is always
foreign to the matter, and is generally soon forgotten, without
weakening our conviction. It might indeed be dispensed with
altogether without diminishing the evidence of geometry, for
this is always quite independent of such demonstration, which
118 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
never proves anything we are not convinced of already, through
another kind of knowledge. So far then it is like a cowardly
soldier, who adds a wound to an enemy slain by another, and
then boasts that he slew him himself.22
After all this we hope there will be no doubt that the evidence
of mathematics, which has become the pattern and symbol of
all evidence, rests essentially not upon demonstration, but upon
immediate perception, which is thus here, as everywhere else,
the ultimate ground and source of truth. Yet the perception which
lies at the basis of mathematics has a great advantage over all
other perception, and therefore over empirical perception. It
is a priori, and therefore independent of experience, which is
always given only in successive parts; therefore everything is
equally near to it, and we can start either from the reason or
from the consequent, as we please. Now this makes it absolutely
reliable, for in it the consequent is known from the reason,[101]
and this is the only kind of knowledge that has necessity; for
example, the equality of the sides is known as established by the
equality of the angles. All empirical perception, on the other
hand, and the greater part of experience, proceeds conversely
from the consequent to the reason, and this kind of knowledge
is not infallible, for necessity only attaches to the consequent on
account of the reason being given, and no necessity attaches to
the knowledge of the reason from the consequent, for the same
22 Spinoza, who always boasts that he proceeds more geometrico, has actually
done so more than he himself was aware. For what he knew with certainty
and decision from the immediate, perceptive apprehension of the nature of the
world, he seeks to demonstrate logically without reference to this knowledge.
He only arrives at the intended and predetermined result by starting from
arbitrary concepts framed by himself (substantia causa sui, &c.), and in the
demonstrations he allows himself all the freedom of choice for which the
nature of the wide concept-spheres afford such convenient opportunity. That
his doctrine is true and excellent is therefore in his case, as in that of geometry,
quite independent of the demonstrations of it. Cf. ch. 13 of supplementary
volume.
119
consequent may follow from different reasons. The latter kind
of knowledge is simply induction, i.e., from many consequents
which point to one reason, the reason is accepted as certain;
but as the cases can never be all before us, the truth here is
not unconditionally certain. But all knowledge through sense-
perception, and the great bulk of experience, has only this
kind of truth. The affection of one of the senses induces the
understanding to infer a cause of the effect, but, as a conclusion
from the consequent to the reason is never certain, illusion, which
is deception of the senses, is possible, and indeed often occurs,
as was pointed out above. Only when several of the senses, or
it may be all the five, receive impressions which point to the
same cause, the possibility of illusion is reduced to a minimum;
but yet it still exists, for there are cases, for example, the case
of counterfeit money, in which all the senses are deceived. All
empirical knowledge, and consequently the whole of natural
science, is in the same position, except only the pure, or as
Kant calls it, metaphysical part of it. Here also the causes are
known from the effects, consequently all natural philosophy rests
upon hypotheses, which are often false, and must then gradually
give place to more correct ones. Only in the case of purposely
arranged experiments, knowledge proceeds from the cause to the
effect, that is, it follows the method that affords certainty; but
these experiments themselves are undertaken in consequence [102]
of hypotheses. Therefore, no branch of natural science, such as
physics, or astronomy, or physiology could be discovered all at
once, as was the case with mathematics and logic, but required
and requires the collected and compared experiences of many
centuries. In the first place, repeated confirmation in experience
brings the induction, upon which the hypothesis rests, so near
completeness that in practice it takes the place of certainty, and
is regarded as diminishing the value of the hypothesis, its source,
just as little as the incommensurability of straight and curved
lines diminishes the value of the application of geometry, or
120 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
that perfect exactness of the logarithm, which is not attainable,
diminishes the value of arithmetic. For as the logarithm, or the
squaring of the circle, approaches infinitely near to correctness
through infinite fractions, so, through manifold experience, the
induction, i.e., the knowledge of the cause from the effects,
approaches, not infinitely indeed, but yet so near mathematical
evidence, i.e., knowledge of the effects from the cause, that the
possibility of mistake is small enough to be neglected, but yet the
possibility exists; for example, a conclusion from an indefinite
number of cases to all cases, i.e., to the unknown ground on
which all depend, is an induction. What conclusion of this kind
seems more certain than that all men have the heart on the left
side? Yet there are extremely rare and quite isolated exceptions
of men who have the heart upon the right side. Sense-perception
and empirical science have, therefore, the same kind of evidence.
The advantage which mathematics, pure natural science, and
logic have over them, as a priori knowledge, rests merely upon
this, that the formal element in knowledge upon which all that is
a priori is based, is given as a whole and at once, and therefore
in it we can always proceed from the cause to the effect, while
in the former kind of knowledge we are generally obliged to
proceed from the effect to the cause. In other respects, the law of[103]
causality, or the principle of sufficient reason of change, which
guides empirical knowledge, is in itself just as certain as the other
forms of the principle of sufficient reason which are followed by
the a priori sciences referred to above. Logical demonstrations
from concepts or syllogisms have the advantage of proceeding
from the reason to the consequent, just as much as knowledge
through perception a priori, and therefore in themselves, i.e.,
according to their form, they are infallible. This has greatly
assisted to bring demonstration in general into such esteem. But
this infallibility is merely relative; the demonstration merely
subsumes under the first principles of the science, and it is these
which contain the whole material truth of science, and they
121
must not themselves be demonstrated, but must be founded on
perception. In the few a priori sciences we have named above,
this perception is pure, but everywhere else it is empirical, and
is only raised to universality through induction. If, then, in
the empirical sciences also, the particular is proved from the
general, yet the general, on the other hand, has received its truth
from the particular; it is only a store of collected material, not a
self-constituted foundation.
So much for the foundation of truth. Of the source and
possibility of error many explanations have been tried since
Plato's metaphorical solution of the dove-cot where the wrong
pigeons are caught, &c. (Theætetus, p. 167, et seq.) Kant's
vague, indefinite explanation of the source of error by means of
the diagram of diagonal motion, will be found in the “Critique of
Pure Reason,” p. 294 of the first edition, and p. 350 of the fifth.
As truth is the relation of a judgment to its ground of knowledge,
it is always a problem how the person judging can believe that
he has such a ground of knowledge and yet not have it; that is to
say, how error, the deception of reason, is possible. I find this
possibility quite analogous to that of illusion, or the deception
of the understanding, which has been explained above. My [104]
opinion is (and this is what gives this explanation its proper
place here) that every error is an inference from the consequent
to the reason, which indeed is valid when we know that the
consequent has that reason and can have no other; but otherwise
is not valid. The person who falls into error, either attributes to
a consequent a reason which it cannot have, in which case he
shows actual deficiency of understanding, i.e., deficiency in the
capacity for immediate knowledge of the connection between
the cause and the effect, or, as more frequently happens, he
attributes to the effect a cause which is possible, but he adds to
the major proposition of the syllogism, in which he infers the
cause from the effect, that this effect always results only from
this cause. Now he could only be assured of this by a complete induction, which, however, he assumes without having made it.
This “always” is therefore too wide a concept, and instead of it he
ought to have used “sometimes” or “generally.” 

The conclusion would then be problematical, and therefore not erroneous. That
the man who errs should proceed in this way is due either to
haste, or to insufficient knowledge of what is possible, on account
of which he does not know the necessity of the induction that
ought to be made. Error then is quite analogous to illusion.
Both are inferences from the effect to the cause; the illusion
brought about always in accordance with the law of causality,
and by the understanding alone, thus directly, in perception
itself; the error in accordance with all the forms of the principle
of sufficient reason, and by the reason, thus in thought itself; yet
most commonly in accordance with the law of causality, as will
appear from the 3 following examples which are representatives of the 3 kinds of error.

1. The illusion of the senses (deception of the understanding) induces
error (deception of the reason)

For example, if one mistakes a
painting for an alto-relief, and actually takes it for such; the error[105]
results from a conclusion from the following major premise: “If
dark grey passes regularly through all shades to white; the cause
is always the light, which strikes differently upon projections and
depressions, ergo—.” 

2. “If there is no money in my safe, the cause is always that my servant has got a key for it: ergo—.” (3.)
“If a ray of sunlight, broken through a prism, i.e., bent up or down,
appears as a coloured band instead of round and white as before,
the cause must always be that light consists of homogeneous
rays, differently coloured and refrangible to different degrees,
which, when forced asunder on account of the difference of
their refrangibility, give an elongated and variously-coloured
spectrum: ergo—bibamus!”—It must be possible to trace every
error to such a conclusion, drawn from a major premise which
is often only falsely generalised, hypothetical, and founded on
the assumption that some particular cause is that of a certain effect. 

Only certain mistakes in counting are to be excepted, and
they are not really errors, but merely mistakes. The operation
prescribed by the concepts of the numbers has not been carried
out in pure intuition or perception, in counting, but some other
operation instead of it.

As regards the content of the sciences generally, it is, in
fact, always the relation of the phenomena of the world to
each other, according to the principle of sufficient reason, under
the guidance of the why, which has validity and meaning only
through this principle. Explanation is the establishment of this
relation. Therefore explanation can never go further than to show
two ideas standing to each other in the relation peculiar to that
form of the principle of sufficient reason which reigns in the
class to which they belong. If this is done we cannot further
be asked the question, why: for the relation proved is that one
which absolutely cannot be imagined as other than it is, i.e., it is
the form of all knowledge. Therefore we do not ask why 2 + 2
= 4; or why the equality of the angles of a triangle determines [106]
the equality of the sides; or why its effect follows any given
cause; or why the truth of the conclusion is evident from the truth
of the premises. Every explanation which does not ultimately
lead to a relation of which no “why” can further be demanded,
stops at an accepted qualitas occulta; but this is the character
of every original force of nature. 

Every explanation in natural
science must ultimately end with such a qualitas occulta, and
thus with complete obscurity. It must leave the inner nature of a
stone just as much unexplained as that of a human being; it can
give as little account of the weight, the cohesion, the chemical
qualities, &c., of the former, as of the knowing and acting of
the latter. Thus, for example, weight is a qualitas occulta, for it
can be thought away, and does not proceed as a necessity from
the form of knowledge; which, on the contrary, is not the case
with the law of inertia, for it follows from the law of causality,
and is therefore sufficiently explained if it is referred to that law.

There are two things which are altogether inexplicable,—that is
to say, do not ultimately lead to the relation which the principle
of sufficient reason expresses. These are, first, the principle of
sufficient reason itself in all its four forms, because it is the
principle of all explanation, which has meaning only in relation
to it; secondly, that to which this principle does not extend, but
which is the original source of all phenomena; the thing-in-itself,
the knowledge of which is not subject to the principle of sufficient
reason. We must be content for the present not to understand this
thing-in-itself, for it can only be made intelligible by means of
the following book, in which we shall resume this consideration
of the possible achievements of the sciences. But at the point at
which natural science, and indeed every science, leaves things,
because not only its explanation of them, but even the principle
of this explanation, the principle of sufficient reason, does not
extend beyond this point; there philosophy takes them up and[107]
treats them after its own method, which is quite distinct from the
method of science. In my essay on the principle of sufficient
reason, § 51, I have shown how in the different sciences the chief
guiding clue is one or other form of that principle; and, in fact,
perhaps the most appropriate classification of the sciences might
be based upon this circumstance. Every explanation arrived at
by the help of this clue is, as we have said, merely relative; it
explains things in relation to each other, but something which
indeed is presupposed is always left unexplained. In mathematics,
for example, this is space and time; in mechanics, physics, and
chemistry it is matter, qualities, original forces and laws of
nature; in botany and zoology it is the difference of species, and
life itself; in history it is the human race with all its properties
of thought and will: in all it is that form of the principle of
sufficient reason which is respectively applicable. It is peculiar
to philosophy that it presupposes nothing as known, but treats
everything as equally external and a problem; not merely the
relations of phenomena, but also the phenomena themselves, and even the principle of sufficient reason to which the other sciences
are content to refer everything. In philosophy nothing would
be gained by such a reference, as one member of the series is
just as external to it as another; and, moreover, that kind of
connection is just as much a problem for philosophy as what
is joined together by it, and the latter again is just as much a
problem after its combination has been explained as before it.

For, as we have said, just what the sciences presuppose and lay
down as the basis and the limits of their explanation, is precisely
and peculiarly the problem of philosophy, which may therefore
be said to begin where science ends. It cannot be founded upon
demonstrations, for they lead from known principles to unknown,
but everything is equally unknown and external to philosophy.
There can be no principle in consequence of which the world
with all its phenomena first came into existence, and therefore [108]
it is not possible to construct, as Spinoza wished, a philosophy
which demonstrates ex firmis principiis. Philosophy is the most
general rational knowledge, the first principles of which cannot
therefore be derived from another principle still more general.
The principle of contradiction establishes merely the agreement
of concepts, but does not itself produce concepts. The principle of
sufficient reason explains the connections of phenomena, but not
the phenomena themselves; therefore philosophy cannot proceed
upon these principles to seek a causa efficiens or a causa finalis
of the whole world. My philosophy, at least, does not by any
means seek to know whence or wherefore the world exists, but
merely what the world is. But the why is here subordinated to
the what, for it already belongs to the world, as it arises and has
meaning and validity only through the form of its phenomena,
the principle of sufficient reason. We might indeed say that every
one knows what the world is without help, for he is himself that
subject of knowledge of which the world is the idea; and so
far this would be true. But that knowledge is empirical, is in
the concrete; the task of philosophy is to reproduce this in the abstract to raise to permanent rational knowledge the successive
changing perceptions, and in general, all that is contained under
the wide concept of feeling and merely negatively defined as not
abstract, distinct, rational knowledge. It must therefore consist
of a statement in the abstract, of the nature of the whole world,
of the whole, and of all the parts. In order then that it may not
lose itself in the endless multitude of particular judgments, it
must make use of abstraction and think everything individual in
the universal, and its differences also in the universal. It must
therefore partly separate and partly unite, in order to present to
rational knowledge the whole manifold of the world generally,
according to its nature, comprehended in a few abstract concepts.
Through these concepts, in which it fixes the nature of the world,[109]
the whole individual must be known as well as the universal,
the knowledge of both therefore must be bound together to the
minutest point. Therefore the capacity for philosophy consists
just in that in which Plato placed it, the knowledge of the one in
the many, and the many in the one. Philosophy will therefore be
a sum-total of general judgments, whose ground of knowledge
is immediately the world itself in its entirety, without excepting
anything; thus all that is to be found in human consciousness; it
will be a complete recapitulation, as it were, a reflection, of the
world in abstract concepts, which is only possible by the union
of the essentially identical in one concept and the relegation of
the different to another. This task was already prescribed to
philosophy by Bacon of Verulam when he said: ea demum vera
est philosophia, quae mundi ipsius voces fidelissime reddit, et
veluti dictante mundo conscripta est, et nihil aliud est, quam
ejusdem SIMULACRUM ET REFLECTIO, neque addit quidquam de
proprio, sed tantum iterat et resonat (De Augm. Scient., L. 2,
c. 13). But we take this in a wider sense than Bacon could then
conceive.

The agreement which all the sides and parts of the world have
with each other, just because they belong to a whole, must also be
127
found in this abstract copy of it. Therefore the judgments in this
sum-total could to a certain extent be deduced from each other,
and indeed always reciprocally so deduced. Yet to make the first
judgment possible, they must all be present, and thus implied
as prior to it in the knowledge of the world in the concrete,
especially as all direct proof is more certain than indirect proof;
their harmony with each other by virtue of which they come
together into the unity of one thought, and which arises from the
harmony and unity of the world of perception itself, which is
their common ground of knowledge, is not therefore to be made
use of to establish them, as that which is prior to them, but is [110]
only added as a confirmation of their truth. This problem itself
can only become quite clear in being solved.
