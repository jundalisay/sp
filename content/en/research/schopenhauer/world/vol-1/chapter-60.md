We have now completed the two expositions it was
necessary to insert; the exposition of the freedom of the will
in itself together with the necessity of its phenomenon, and the
exposition of its lot in the world which reflects its own nature,
and upon the knowledge of which it has to assert or deny itself.
Therefore we can now proceed to bring out more clearly the
nature of this assertion and denial itself, which was referred to
and explained in a merely general way above. This we shall do
by exhibiting the conduct in which alone it finds its expression,
and considering it in its inner significance.

The assertion of the will is the continuous willing itself,
undisturbed by any knowledge, as it fills the life of man in
general. For even the body of a man is the objectivity of the will,
as it appears at this grade and in this individual. And thus his
willing which develops itself in time is, as it were, a paraphrase
of his body, an elucidation of the significance of the whole and
its parts; it is another way of exhibiting the same thing-in-itself,
of which the body is already the phenomenon. Therefore, instead
of saying assertion of the will, we may say assertion of the body.
The fundamental theme or subject of all the multifarious acts
of will is the satisfaction of the wants which are inseparable
from the existence of the body in health, they already have their
expression in it, and may be referred to the maintenance of the
individual and the propagation of the species. But indirectly the
most different kinds of motives obtain in this way power over
the will, and bring about the most multifarious acts of will. 

Each of these is only an example, an instance, of the will which here
manifests itself generally. Of what nature this example may be,
what form the motive may have and impart to it, is not essential;
the important point here is that something is willed in general
and the degree of intensity with which it is so willed. The will
can only become visible in the motives, as the eye only manifests
its power of seeing in the light. The motive in general stands[422]
before the will in protean forms. It constantly promises complete
satisfaction, the quenching of the thirst of will. But whenever it
is attained it at once appears in another form, and thus influences
the will anew, always according to the degree of the intensity
of this will, and its relation to knowledge which are revealed as
empirical character, in these very examples and instances.

From the first appearance of consciousness, a man finds
himself a willing being, and as a rule, his knowledge remains in
constant relation to his will. He first seeks to know thoroughly
the objects of his desire, and then the means of attaining them.
Now he knows what he has to do, and, as a rule, he does not strive
after other knowledge. He moves and acts; his consciousness
keeps him always working directly and actively towards the aims
of his will; his thought is concerned with the choice of motives.
Such is life for almost all men; they wish, they know what they
wish, and they strive after it, with sufficient success to keep them
from despair, and sufficient failure to keep them from ennui and
its consequences. From this proceeds a certain serenity, or at
least indifference, which cannot be affected by wealth or poverty;
for the rich and the poor do not enjoy what they have, for this,
as we have shown, acts in a purely negative way, but what they
hope to attain to by their efforts. 

They press forward with much
earnestness, and indeed with an air of importance; thus children
also pursue their play. It is always an exception if such a life
suffers interruption from the fact that either the æsthetic demand
for contemplation or the ethical demand for renunciation proceed
from a knowledge which is independent of the service of the will, and directed to the nature of the world in general. Most men are
pursued by want all through life, without ever being allowed to
come to their senses. On the other hand, the will is often inflamed
to a degree that far transcends the assertion of the body, and [423]
then violent emotions and powerful passions show themselves,
in which the individual not only asserts his own existence, but
denies and seeks to suppress that of others when it stands in his
way.

The maintenance of the body through its own powers is so
small a degree of the assertion of will, that if it voluntarily
remains at this degree, we might assume that, with the death
of this body, the will also which appeared in it would be
extinguished. But even the satisfaction of the sexual passions
goes beyond the assertion of one's own existence, which fills
so short a time, and asserts life for an indefinite time after the
death of the individual. Nature, always true and consistent, here
even naïve, exhibits to us openly the inner significance of the
act of generation. Our own consciousness, the intensity of the
impulse, teaches us that in this act the most decided assertion of
the will to live expresses itself, pure and without further addition
(any denial of other individuals); and now, as the consequence
of this act, a new life appears in time and the causal series, i.e.,
in nature; the begotten appears before the begetter, different as
regards the phenomenon, but in himself, i.e., according to the
Idea, identical with him. Therefore it is this act through which
every species of living creature binds itself to a whole and is
perpetuated. Generation is, with reference to the begetter, only
the expression, the symptom, of his decided assertion of the will
to live: with reference to the begotten, it is not the cause of the
will which appears in him, for the will in itself knows neither
cause nor effect, but, like all causes, it is merely the occasional
cause of the phenomenal appearance of this will at this time in
this place. As thing-in-itself, the will of the begetter and that of
the begotten are not different, for only the phenomenon, not the thing-in-itself, is subordinate to the principim individuationis.
With that assertion beyond our own body and extending to the
production of a new body, suffering and death, as belonging to the phenomenon of life, have also been asserted anew, and the
possibility of salvation, introduced by the completest capability
of knowledge, has for this time been shown to be fruitless. Here
lies the profound reason of the shame connected with the process
of generation. This view is mythically expressed in the dogma
of Christian theology that we are all partakers in Adam's first
transgression (which is clearly just the satisfaction of sexual
passion), and through it are guilty of suffering and death. In
this theology goes beyond the consideration of things according
to the principle of sufficient reason, and recognises the Idea of
man, the unity of which is re-established out of its dispersion into
innumerable individuals through the bond of generation which
holds them all together. Accordingly it regards every individual
as on one side identical with Adam, the representative of the
assertion of life, and, so far, as subject to sin (original sin),
suffering, and death; on the other side, the knowledge of the Idea
of man enables it to regard every individual as identical with the
saviour, the representative of the denial of the will to live, and,
so far as a partaker of his sacrifice of himself, saved through his
merits, and delivered from the bands of sin and death, i.e., the
world (Rom. v. 12-21).

Another mythical exposition of our view of sexual pleasure as
the assertion of the will to live beyond the individual life, as an
attainment to life which is brought about for the first time by this
means, or as it were a renewed assignment of life, is the Greek
myth of Proserpine, who might return from the lower world so
long as she had not tasted its fruit, but who became subject to it
altogether through eating the pomegranate. This meaning appears
very clearly in Goethe's incomparable presentation of this myth,
especially when, as soon as she has tasted the pomegranate, the
invisible chorus of the Fates—

“Thou art ours!
Fasting shouldest thou return:
And the bite of the apple makes thee ours!”

It is worth noticing that Clement of Alexandria (Strom. iii.
c. 15) illustrates the matter with the same image and the same
expression: ü1 ºμΩ μ≈Ωø≈«π√±Ωƒμ¬ ±≈ƒø≈¬ ±¿ø ¿±√∑¬ º±¡ƒπ±¬,
¥π± ƒ∑Ω ≤±√πªμπ±Ω, ƒ…Ω ø≈¡±Ω…Ω, º±∫±¡πøπ øQƒøπ μπ√πΩ, ø1
ƒø≈ ∫ø√ºø≈ Ω∑√ƒμ≈øΩƒμ¬; (Qui se castrarunt ab omni peccato
propter regnum cœlorum, ii sunt beati, a mundo jejunantes).

The sexual impulse also proves itself the decided and strongest
assertion of life by the fact that to man in a state of nature, as
to the brutes, it is the final end, the highest goal of life. Self-maintenance is his first effort, and as soon as he has made
provision for that, he only strives after the propagation of the
species: as a merely natural being he can attempt no more. Nature
also, the inner being of which is the will to live itself, impels
with all her power both man and the brute towards propagation.

Then it has attained its end with the individual, and is quite
indifferent to its death, for, as the will to live, it cares only
for the preservation of the species, the individual is nothing to
it. Because the will to live expresses itself most strongly in
the sexual impulse, the inner being of nature, the old poets and
philosophers—Hesiod and Parmenides—said very significantly
that Eros is the first, the creator, the principle from which all
things proceed. 

(Cf. Arist. Metaph., i. 4.) Pherecydes said: ïπ¬
μ¡…ƒ± ºμƒ±≤μ≤ª∑√∏±π ƒøΩ îπ±, ºμªªøΩƒ± ¥∑ºπø≈¡≥μπΩ (Jovem,
cum mundum fabricare vellet, in cupidinem sese transformasse).
Proclus ad Plat. Tim., l. iii. A complete treatment of this subject
we have recently received from G. F. Schœmann, “De Cupidine
Cosmogonico,” 1852. The Mâya of the Hindus, whose work and
web is the whole world of illusion, is also symbolised by love.
The genital organs are, far more than any other external
member of the body, subject merely to the will, and not at all to knowledge.

The will shows itself here almost as
independent of knowledge, as in those parts which, acting merely
in consequence of stimuli, are subservient to vegetative life and
reproduction, in which the will works blindly as in unconscious
nature. For generation is only reproduction passing over to a
new individual, as it were reproduction at the second power, as
death is only excretion at the second power. 

According to all
this, the genitals are properly the focus of will, and consequently
the opposite pole of the brain, the representative of knowledge,
i.e., the other side of the world, the world as idea. The former
are the life-sustaining principle ensuring endless life to time. 

In this respect they were worshipped by the Greeks in the phallus,
and by the Hindus in the lingam, which are thus the symbol of
the assertion of the will. Knowledge, on the other hand, affords
the possibility of the suppression of willing, of salvation through
freedom, of conquest and annihilation of the world.

Book 4 explained how the will to live must regard its relation to death. We saw that death does not trouble it, because it
exists as something included in life itself and belonging to it.
Its opposite, generation, completely counterbalances it; and, in
spite of the death of the individual, ensures and guarantees life
to the will to live through all time. 

To express this the Hindus made the lingam an attribute of Siva, the god of death. We
also fully explained there how he who with full consciousness
occupies the standpoint of the decided assertion of life awaits
death without fear. We shall therefore say nothing more about
this here. Without clear consciousness most men occupy this
standpoint and continually assert life. The world exists as the
mirror of this assertion, with innumerable individuals in infinite
time and space, in infinite suffering, between generation and
death without end. Yet from no side is a complaint to be further raised about this; for the will conducts the great tragedy and
comedy at its own expense, and is also its own spectator. 

The world is just what it is because the will, whose manifestation it
is, is what it is, because it so wills. The justification of suffering
is, that in this phenomenon also the will asserts itself; and this
assertion is justified and balanced by the fact that the will bears
the suffering. Here we get a glimpse of eternal justice in the
whole: we shall recognise it later more definitely and distinctly,
and also in the particular. But first we must consider temporal or
human justice.73
