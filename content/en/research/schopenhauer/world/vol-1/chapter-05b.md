The question of the reality of the outer world disappears with my:
- principle of sufficient reason
- relation of subject and object
- the special conditions of sense perception


However, the question of the reality of the outer world is revived by dreams.

Is our whole life be a dream? 

How do we distinguish dreams and reality?

Kant answers: “The connection of ideas among themselves, according to cause and effect, constitutes the difference between real life and dreams.” 

<!-- But in dreams, as well as in real life, everything
is connected individually at any rate, in accordance with the
principle of sufficient reason in all its forms, and this connection
is broken only between life and dreams, or between one dream
and another. Kant's answer therefore could only run thus:— -->

I answer: The [flow of cognition] principle of sufficient reason has a complete connection in long dreams (life) but not with short dreams..

<!--  although each of these has in itself
the same connection: the bridge is therefore broken between the
former and the latter, and on this account we distinguish them. -->

<!-- But to institute an inquiry according to this criterion, as to
whether something was dreamt or seen, would always be difficult
and often impossible. For we are by no means in a position to trace
link by link the causal connection between any experienced event
and the present moment, but we do not on that account explain it
as dreamt. Therefore in real life we do not commonly employ that
method of distinguishing between dreams and reality.  -->

The only way to distinguish dream and reality is the awake state which breaks off the dream.

<!-- , through which at any rate the causal
connection between dreamed events and those of waking life, is
distinctly and sensibly broken off. This is strongly supported by
the remark of Hobbes in the second chapter of Leviathan, that
we easily mistake dreams for reality if we have unintentionally
fallen asleep without taking off our clothes, and much more so
when it also happens that some undertaking or design fills all
our thoughts, and occupies our dreams as well as our waking
moments. We then observe the awaking just as little as the falling
asleep, dream and reality run together and become confounded.
In such a case there is nothing for it but the application of Kant's
criterion; but if, as often happens, we fail to establish by means
of this criterion, either the existence of causal connection with
the present, or the absence of such connection, then it must for
ever remain uncertain whether an event was dreamt or really
happened. Here, in fact, the intimate relationship between life
and dreams is brought out very clearly, and we need not be
ashamed to confess it, as it has been recognised and spoken of by
many great men.  -->

The Vedas and Puranas have no better simile than a dream for the whole knowledge of the actual world, which
they call the web of Mâyâ, and they use none more frequently

Plato often says that men live only in a dream.

<!--  the philosopher
alone strives to awake himself. Pindar says (ii. ·. 135): Ãº¹±¬
ø½±£ ±½¸£…¿ø¬ (umbræ somnium homo), and Sophocles:—
H½… ³Å½ !º±¬ øÅ¥µ½ ø½ƒ±¬ ±ªªø, ¿ª·½
£¹¥…ª½ AÃø¹¿µ£ ¶…ºµ½, t ºøÅÆ·½ Ãº¹±½.—Ajax, 125.
(Nos enim, quicunque vivimus, nihil aliud esse comperio
quam simulacra et levem umbram.) Beside which most worthily
stands Shakespeare:—
“We are such stuff
As dreams are made on, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.”—Tempest, Act iv. Sc. 1. -->

Lastly, Calderon was so deeply impressed with this view of life that he sought to embody it in a kind of metaphysical drama—“Life a Dream.”

After these numerous quotations from the poets, perhaps I
also may be allowed to express myself by a metaphor. Life and
dreams are leaves of the same book. The systematic reading of
this book is real life, but when the reading hours (that is, the
day) are over, we often continue idly to turn over the leaves, and
read a page here and there without method or connection: often
one we have read before, sometimes one that is new to us, but
always in the same book. Such an isolated page is indeed out
of connection with the systematic study of the book, but it does
not seem so very different when we remember that the whole
continuous perusal begins and ends just as abruptly, and may
therefore be regarded as merely a larger single page.
Thus although individual dreams are distinguished from real
life by the fact that they do not fit into that continuity which runs
through the whole of experience, and the act of awaking brings
this into consciousness, yet that very continuity of experience
belongs to real life as its form, and the dream on its part can point to a similar continuity in itself. If, therefore, we consider
the question from a point of view external to both, there is no
distinct difference in their nature, and we are forced to concede
to the poets that life is a long dream.


Let us turn back now from this quite independent empirical
origin of the question of the reality of the outer world, to its
speculative origin. We found that 

The origin of the outer world consisted in:

1. The false application of the principle of sufficient reason to the relation of
subject and object

2. The confusion of its forms, inasmuch as the principle of sufficient reason of knowing was
extended to a province in which the principle of sufficient reason
of being is valid. 

But the question could hardly have occupied
philosophers so constantly if it were entirely devoid of all real
content, and if some true thought and meaning did not lie at
its heart as its real source. 

Accordingly, we must assume that
when the element of truth that lies at the bottom of the question
first came into reflection and sought its expression, it became
involved in these confused and meaningless forms and problems.

This at least is my opinion, and I think that the true expression
of that inmost meaning of the question, which it failed to find, is
this:—What is this world of perception besides being my idea?
Is that of which I am conscious only as idea, exactly like my own
body, of which I am doubly conscious, in one aspect as idea, in
another aspect as will? The fuller explanation of this question
and its answer in the affirmative, will form the content of the
second book, and its consequences will occupy the remaining
portion of this work.
