The will proclaims itself primarily in the voluntary movements of our own body, as the inmost nature of
this body, as that which it is besides being object of perception,
idea.

These voluntary movements are nothing else than the visible aspect of the individual acts of will, with which they are
directly coincident and identical, and only distinguished through
the form of knowledge into which they have passed, and in which
alone they can be known, the form of idea.

But these acts of will have always a ground or reason outside
themselves in motives. Yet these motives never determine more
than what I will at this time, in this place, and under these[138]
circumstances, not that I will in general, or what I will in general,
that is, the maxims which characterise my volition generally.
Therefore the inner nature of my volition cannot be explained
from these motives; but they merely determine its manifestation
at a given point of time: they are merely the occasion of my will
showing itself; but the will itself lies outside the province of the
law of motivation, which determines nothing but its appearance
at each point of time. It is only under the presupposition of
my empirical character that the motive is a sufficient ground of
explanation of my action. But if I abstract from my character,
and then ask, why, in general, I will this and not that, no answer
is possible, because it is only the manifestation of the will that is
subject to the principle of sufficient reason, and not the will itself,
always been preceded by perception in these bodies; though a glimmering of
truth lies at the bottom of this false proposition. This is also the case with
Kepler's opinion, expressed in his essay De Planeta Martis, that the planets
must have knowledge in order to keep their elliptical courses so correctly, and
to regulate the velocity of their motion so that the triangle of the plane of their
course always remains proportional to the time in which they pass through its
base.


which in this respect is to be called groundless. At this point
I presuppose Kant's doctrine of the empirical and intelligible
character, and also my own treatment of the subject in “The
Fundamental Problems of Ethics,” pp. 48, 58, and 178, et seq.,
of first edition (p. 174, et seq., of second edition). I shall also
have to speak more fully on the question in the Fourth Book.
For the present, I have only to draw attention to this, that the
fact of one manifestation being established through another, as
here the deed through the motive, does not at all conflict with
the fact that its real nature is will, which itself has no ground; for
as the principle of sufficient reason in all its aspects is only the
form of knowledge, its validity extends only to the idea, to the
phenomena, to the visibility of the will, but not to the will itself,
which becomes visible.

If now every action of my body is the manifestation of an act
of will in which my will itself in general, and as a whole, thus my
character, expresses itself under given motives, manifestation of
the will must be the inevitable condition and presupposition of
every action. For the fact of its manifestation cannot depend upon
something which does not exist directly and only through it, [139]
which consequently is for it merely accidental, and through which
its manifestation itself would be merely accidental. Now that
condition is just the whole body itself. Thus the body itself must
be manifestation of the will, and it must be related to my will as
a whole, that is, to my intelligible character, whose phenomenal
appearance in time is my empirical character, as the particular
action of the body is related to the particular act of the will. 

The
whole body, then, must be simply my will become visible, must
be my will itself, so far as this is object of perception, an idea
of the first class. It has already been advanced in confirmation
of this that every impression upon my body also affects my
will at once and immediately, and in this respect is called pain
or pleasure, or, in its lower degrees, agreeable or disagreeable
sensation; and also, conversely, that every violent movement of the will, every emotion or passion, convulses the body and
disturbs the course of its functions. Indeed we can also give an
etiological account, though a very incomplete one, of the origin
of my body, and a somewhat better account of its development
and conservation, and this is the substance of physiology. But
physiology merely explains its theme in precisely the same way as
motives explain action. Thus the physiological explanation of the
functions of the body detracts just as little from the philosophical
truth that the whole existence of this body and the sum total
of its functions are merely the objectification of that will which
appears in its outward actions in accordance with a motive, as
the establishment of the individual action through the motive and
the necessary sequence of the action from the motive conflicts
with the fact that action in general, and according to its nature,
is only the manifestation of a will which itself has no ground. If,
however, physiology tries to refer even these outward actions, the
immediate voluntary movements, to causes in the organism,—for
example, if it explains the movement of the muscles as resulting[140]
from the presence of fluids (“like the contraction of a cord when
it is wet,” says Reil in his “Archiv für Physiologie,” vol. vi. p.
153), even supposing it really could give a thorough explanation
of this kind, yet this would never invalidate the immediately
certain truth that every voluntary motion (functiones animales)
is the manifestation of an act of will. Now, just as little
can the physiological explanation of vegetative life (functiones
naturales vitales), however far it may advance, ever invalidate
the truth that the whole animal life which thus develops itself is
the manifestation of will. In general, then, as we have shown
above, no etiological explanation can ever give us more than the
necessarily determined position in time and space of a particular
manifestation, its necessary appearance there, according to a
fixed law; but the inner nature of everything that appears in this
way remains wholly inexplicable, and is presupposed by every
etiological explanation, and merely indicated by the names, force, or law of nature, or, if we are speaking of action, character
or will. 

Thus, although every particular action, under the
presupposition of the definite character, necessarily follows
from the given motive, and although growth, the process of
nourishment, and all the changes of the animal body take place
according to necessarily acting causes (stimuli), yet the whole
series of actions, and consequently every individual act, and
also its condition, the whole body itself which accomplishes
it, and therefore also the process through which and in which it
exists, are nothing but the manifestation of the will, the becoming
visible, the objectification of the will. Upon this rests the perfect
suitableness of the human and animal body to the human and
animal will in general, resembling, though far surpassing, the
correspondence between an instrument made for a purpose and
the will of the maker, and on this account appearing as design,
i.e., the teleological explanation of the body. The parts of the [141]
body must, therefore, completely correspond to the principal
desires through which the will manifests itself; they must be the
visible expression of these desires. Teeth, throat, and bowels
are objectified hunger; the organs of generation are objectified
sexual desire; the grasping hand, the hurrying feet, correspond to
the more indirect desires of the will which they express. As the
human form generally corresponds to the human will generally,
so the individual bodily structure corresponds to the individually
modified will, the character of the individual, and therefore it is
throughout and in all its parts characteristic and full of expression.
It is very remarkable that Parmenides already gave expression
to this in the following verses, quoted by Aristotle (Metaph. iii.
5):

membrorum natura hominibus, et omnibus et omni: quod enim
