The light of the moon is from the sun.

Similarly, we pass from the immediate idea of perception, which stands by itself, to reflection, to the abstract, discursive concepts of the reason, which obtain their whole content from knowledge of perception, and in relation to it. As long as we continue simply to perceive, all is clear, firm, and certain. 

There are neither questions nor doubts nor errors; we desire to go no further, can go no further; we find rest in perceiving, and satisfaction in the present. Perception suffices for itself, and therefore what springs purely from it, and remains true to it, for example, a genuine work of art, can never be false, nor can it be discredited through the lapse of time, for it does not present an opinion but the thing itself.

But with abstract knowledge, with reason, doubt and error appear in the theoretical, care and sorrow in the practical. In the idea of perception, illusion may at moments take the place of the real; but in the sphere of abstract thought, error may reign for a thousand years, impose its yoke upon whole nations, extend to the noblest impulses of humanity, and, by the help of its slaves and its dupes, may chain and fetter those whom it cannot deceive. It is the enemy against which the wisest men of all times have waged unequal war, and only what they have won from it has become the possession of mankind. 

Therefore it is well to draw attention to it at once, as
we already tread the ground to which its province belongs. It has
often been said that we ought to follow truth even although no
utility can be seen in it, because it may have indirect utility which
may appear when it is least expected; and I would add to this, that
we ought to be just as anxious to discover and to root out all error
even when no harm is anticipated from it, because its mischief[046]
may be very indirect, and may suddenly appear when we do not
expect it, for all error has poison at its heart. If it is mind, if it is
knowledge, that makes man the lord of creation, there can be no
such thing as harmless error, still less venerable and holy error.
And for the consolation of those who in any way and at any time
may have devoted strength and life to the noble and hard battle
against error, I cannot refrain from adding that, so long as truth
is absent, error will have free play, as owls and bats in the night;
but sooner would we expect to see the owls and the bats drive
back the sun in the eastern heavens, than that any truth which has
once been known and distinctly and fully expressed, can ever
again be so utterly vanquished and overcome that the old error
shall once more reign undisturbed over its wide kingdom. This
is the power of truth; its conquest is slow and laborious, but if
once the victory be gained it can never be wrested back again.
Besides the ideas we have as yet considered, which, according
to their construction, could be referred to time, space, and matter,
if we consider them with reference to the object, or to pure
sensibility and understanding (i.e., knowledge of causality), if
we consider them with reference to the subject, another faculty
of knowledge has appeared in man alone of all earthly creatures,
an entirely new consciousness, which, with very appropriate and
significant exactness, is called reflection. For it is in fact derived
from the knowledge of perception, and is a reflected appearance
of it. But it has assumed a nature fundamentally different. 

The
forms of perception do not affect it, and even the principle of
sufficient reason which reigns over all objects has an entirely different aspect with regard to it. It is just this new, more highly
endowed, consciousness, this abstract reflex of all that belongs
to perception in that conception of the reason which has nothing
to do with perception, that gives to man that thoughtfulness [047]
which distinguishes his consciousness so entirely from that of
the lower animals, and through which his whole behaviour upon
earth is so different from that of his irrational fellow-creatures.
He far surpasses them in power and also in suffering. They live
in the present alone, he lives also in the future and the past.
They satisfy the needs of the moment, he provides by the most
ingenious preparations for the future, yea for days that he shall
never see. They are entirely dependent on the impression of the
moment, on the effect of the perceptible motive; he is determined
by abstract conceptions independent of the present. 

Therefore
he follows predetermined plans, he acts from maxims, without
reference to his surroundings or the accidental impression of
the moment. Thus, for example, he can make with composure
deliberate preparations for his own death, he can dissemble past
finding out, and can carry his secret with him to the grave; lastly,
he has an actual choice between several motives; for only in
the abstract can such motives, present together in consciousness,
afford the knowledge with regard to themselves, that the one
excludes the other, and can thus measure themselves against
each other with reference to their power over the will. 

The
motive that overcomes, in that it decides the question at issue,
is the deliberate determinant of the will, and is a sure indication
of its character. The brute, on the other hand, is determined by
the present impression; only the fear of present compulsion can
constrain its desires, until at last this fear has become custom, and
as such continues to determine it; this is called training. The brute
feels and perceives; man, in addition to this, thinks and knows:
both will. The brute expresses its feelings and dispositions by
gestures and sounds; man communicates his thought to others,
or, if he wishes, he conceals it, by means of speech. 

Speech is the first production, and also the necessary organ of his
reason. Therefore in Greek and Italian, speech and reason are[048]
expressed by the same word; A ªø≥ø¬, il discorso. Vernunft is
derived from vernehmen, which is not a synonym for the verb to
hear, but signifies the consciousness of the meaning of thoughts
communicated in words. 

It is by the help of language alone
that reason accomplishes its most important achievements,—the
united action of several individuals, the planned co-operation
of many thousands, civilisation, the state; also science, the
storing up of experience, the uniting of common properties in
one concept, the communication of truth, the spread of error,
thoughts and poems, dogmas and superstitions. The brute first
knows death when it dies, but man draws consciously nearer
to it every hour that he lives; and this makes life at times a
questionable good even to him who has not recognised this
character of constant annihilation in the whole of life. Principally
on this account man has philosophies and religions, though it is
uncertain whether the qualities we admire most in his conduct,
voluntary rectitude and nobility of feeling, were ever the fruit of
either of them. As results which certainly belong only to them,
and as productions of reason in this sphere, we may refer to the
marvellous and monstrous opinions of philosophers of various
schools, and the extraordinary and sometimes cruel customs of
the priests of different religions.

It is the universal opinion of all times and of all nations that these manifold and far-reaching achievements spring from a common principle, from that peculiar intellectual power which belongs distinctively to man and which has been called reason, A ªø≥ø¬, ƒø ªø≥π√ƒπ∫øΩ, ƒø ªø≥πºøΩ, ratio. Besides this, no one finds any difficulty in recognising the manifestations of this faculty, and in saying what is rational and what is irrational, where reason appears as distinguished from the other faculties and qualities of man, or lastly, in pointing out what, on account of the want of reason, we must never expect even from the most sensible brute. The philosophers of all ages may be said to [049] be on the whole at one about this general knowledge of reason, and they have also given prominence to several very important manifestations of it; such as, the control of the emotions and passions, the capacity for drawing conclusions and formulating general principles, even such as are true prior to all experience, and so forth. Still all their explanations of the peculiar nature of reason are wavering, not clearly defined, discursive, without unity and concentration; now laying stress on one manifestation, now on another, and therefore often at variance with each other. Besides this, many start from the opposition between reason and revelation, a distinction which is unknown to philosophy, and which only increases confusion. It is very remarkable that up till now no philosopher has referred these manifold expressions of reason to one simple function which would be recognised in them all, from which they would all be explained, and which would therefore constitute the real inner nature of reason.

The excellent Locke in the “Essay on the Human Understanding” (Book II., ch. xi., §§ 10 and 11), very rightly refers to general concepts as the characteristic which distinguishes man from the brutes, and Leibnitz quotes this with full approval in the “Nouveaux Essais sur l'Entendement Humaine” (Book II., ch. xi., §§ 10 and 11.) But when Locke (in Book IV., ch. xvii., §§ 2 and 3) comes to the special explanation of reason he entirely loses sight of this simple, primary characteristic, and he also falls into a wavering, undetermined, incomplete account of mangled and derivative manifestations of it. Leibnitz also, in the corresponding part of his work, behaves in a similar manner, only with more confusion and indistinctness. In the Appendix, I have fully considered how Kant confused and falsified the conception of the nature of reason. But whoever will take the trouble to go through in this reference the mass of philosophical writing which has appeared since Kant, will find out, that just as the faults of [050] princes must be expiated by whole nations, the errors of great minds extend their influence over whole generations, and even over centuries; they grow and propagate themselves, and finally degenerate into monstrosities. All this arises from the fact that, as Berkeley says, “Few men think; yet all will have opinions.”


The understanding has only one function—immediate knowledge of the relation of cause and effect. Yet the perception of the real world, and all common sense, sagacity, and inventiveness, however multifarious their applications may be, are quite clearly seen to be nothing more than manifestations of that one function. So also the reason has one function; and from it all the manifestations of reason we have mentioned, which distinguish the life of man from that of the brutes, may easily be explained. The application or the non-application of this function is all that is meant by what men have everywhere and always called rational and irrational.12
