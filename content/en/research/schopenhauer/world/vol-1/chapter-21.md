Whoever has now gained from all these expositions a knowledge in abstracto, and therefore clear and certain, of
what every one knows directly in concreto, i.e., as feeling, a
knowledge that his will is the real inner nature of his phenomenal
being, which manifests itself to him as idea, both in his actions
and in their permanent substratum, his body, and that his will
is that which is most immediate in his consciousness, though it
has not as such completely passed into the form of idea in which
object and subject stand over against each other, but makes itself known to him in a direct manner, in which he does not
quite clearly distinguish subject and object, yet is not known
as a whole to the individual himself, but only in its particular
acts,—whoever, I say, has with me gained this conviction will
find that of itself it affords him the key to the knowledge of the
inmost being of the whole of nature; for he now transfers it to
all those phenomena which are not given to him, like his own
phenomenal existence, both in direct and indirect knowledge,
but only in the latter, thus merely one-sidedly as idea alone. 

He will recognise this will of which we are speaking not only in those phenomenal existences which exactly resemble his own,
in men and animals as their inmost nature, but the course of
reflection will lead him to recognise the force which germinates
and vegetates in the plant, and indeed the force through which the
crystal is formed, that by which the magnet turns to the north pole,
the force whose shock he experiences from the contact of two
different kinds of metals, the force which appears in the elective
affinities of matter as repulsion and attraction, decomposition

der Natur,” the chapters on Physiology and Comparative Anatomy, where the
subject I have only touched upon here is fully discussed. -->

and combination, and, lastly, even gravitation, which acts so
powerfully throughout matter, draws the stone to the earth and
the earth to the sun,—all these, I say, he will recognise as
different only in their phenomenal existence, but in their inner
nature as identical, as that which is directly known to him so
intimately and so much better than anything else, and which in
its most distinct manifestation is called will. It is this application
of reflection alone that prevents us from remaining any longer at
the phenomenon, and leads us to the thing in itself. Phenomenal
existence is idea and nothing more. 

All idea, all object, is phenomenal existence.

But the will alone is a thing in itself. As such, it is throughout not idea, but toto
genere different from it; it is that of which all idea, all object,
is the phenomenal appearance, the visibility, the objectification.

It is the inmost nature, the kernel, of every particular thing, and
also of the whole. It appears in every blind force of nature and
also in the preconsidered action of man; and the great difference
between these two is merely in the degree of the manifestation,
not in the nature of what manifests itself.
