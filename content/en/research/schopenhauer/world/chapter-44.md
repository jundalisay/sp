What the two arts we have spoken of accomplish for
these lowest grades of the objectivity of will, is performed for
the higher grades of vegetable nature by artistic horticulture. The
landscape beauty of a scene consists, for the most part, in the
multiplicity of natural objects which are present in it, and then in
the fact that they are clearly separated, appear distinctly, and yet
exhibit a fitting connection and alternation. These two conditions
are assisted and promoted by landscape-gardening, but it has
by no means such a mastery over its material as architecture,
and therefore its effect is limited. The beauty with which it is
concerned belongs almost exclusively to nature; it has done little
for it; and, on the other hand, it can do little against unfavourable
nature, and when nature works, not for it, but against it, its
achievements are small.

The vegetable world offers itself everywhere for æsthetic
enjoyment without the medium of art; but so far as it is an
object of art, it belongs principally to landscape-painting; to the province of which all the rest of unconscious nature also
belongs. In paintings of still life, and of mere architecture, ruins,
interiors of churches, &c., the subjective side of æsthetic pleasure
is predominant, i.e., our satisfaction does not lie principally in
the direct comprehension of the represented Ideas, but rather in
the subjective correlative of this comprehension, pure, will-less
knowing. For, because the painter lets us see these things[283]
through his eyes, we at once receive a sympathetic and reflected
sense of the deep spiritual peace and absolute silence of the
will, which were necessary in order to enter with knowledge so
entirely into these lifeless objects, and comprehend them with
such love, i.e., in this case with such a degree of objectivity.
The effect of landscape-painting proper is indeed, as a whole,
of this kind; but because the Ideas expressed are more distinct
and significant, as higher grades of the objectivity of will, the
objective side of æsthetic pleasure already comes more to the
front and assumes as much importance as the subjective side.
Pure knowing as such is no longer the paramount consideration,
for we are equally affected by the known Platonic Idea, the world
as idea at an important grade of the objectification of will.
But a far higher grade is revealed by animal painting and
sculpture. Of the latter we have some important antique remains;
for example, horses at Venice, on Monte Cavallo, and on the
Elgin Marbles, also at Florence in bronze and marble; the ancient
boar, howling wolves, the lions in the arsenal at Venice, also
in the Vatican a whole room almost filled with ancient animals,
&c. In these representations the objective side of æsthetic
pleasure obtains a marked predominance over the subjective.
The peace of the subject which knows these Ideas, which has
silenced its own will, is indeed present, as it is in all æsthetic
contemplation; but its effect is not felt, for we are occupied
with the restlessness and impetuosity of the will represented. 

It
is that very will, which constitutes our own nature, that here
appears to us in forms, in which its manifestation is not, as in us, controlled and tempered by intellect, but exhibits itself
in stronger traits, and with a distinctness that borders on the
grotesque and monstrous. For this very reason there is no
concealment; it is free, naïve, open as the day, and this is the
cause of our interest in animals. The characteristics of species
appeared already in the representation of plants, but showed [284]
itself only in the forms; here it becomes much more distinct, and
expresses itself not only in the form, but in the action, position,
and mien, yet always merely as the character of the species,
not of the individual. This knowledge of the Ideas of higher
grades, which in painting we receive through extraneous means,
we may gain directly by the pure contemplative perception of
plants, and observation of beasts, and indeed of the latter in their
free, natural, and unrestrained state. The objective contemplation
of their manifold and marvellous forms, and of their actions
and behaviour, is an instructive lesson from the great book of
nature, it is a deciphering of the true signatura rerum.53 We see
in them the manifold grades and modes of the manifestation of
will, which in all beings of one and the same grade, wills always
in the same way, which objectifies itself as life, as existence
in such endless variety, and such different forms, which are all
adaptations to the different external circumstances, and may be
compared to many variations on the same theme. But if we had
to communicate to the observer, for reflection, and in a word, the
explanation of their inner nature, it would be best to make use of
that Sanscrit formula which occurs so often in the sacred books
of the Hindoos, and is called Mahavakya, i.e., the great word:
“Tat twam asi,” which means, “this living thing art thou.”
53 Jakob Böhm in his book, “de Signatura Rerum,” ch. i., § 13-15, says, “There
is nothing in nature that does not manifest its internal form externally; for the
internal continually labours to manifest itself.... Everything has its language
by which to reveal itself.... And this is the language of nature when everything
speaks out of its own property, and continually manifests and declares itself, ...
for each thing reveals its mother, which thus gives the essence and the will to
the form.”
