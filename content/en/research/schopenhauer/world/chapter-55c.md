The assertion of an empirical freedom of the will, a liberum
arbitrium indifferentiæ, agrees precisely with the doctrine that
places the inner nature of man in a soul, which is originally a
knowing, and indeed really an abstract thinking nature, and only
in consequence of this a willing nature—a doctrine which thus
regards the will as of a secondary or derivative nature, instead
of knowledge which is really so. The will indeed came to be
regarded as an act of thought, and to be identified with the
judgment, especially by Descartes and Spinoza. According to
this doctrine every man must become what he is only through his
knowledge; he must enter the world as a moral cipher come to
know the things in it, and thereupon determine to be this or that,
to act thus or thus, and may also through new knowledge achieve
a new course of action, that is to say, become another person.
Further, he must first know a thing to be good, and in consequence
of this will it, instead of first willing it, and in consequence of
this calling it good. According to my fundamental point of view,
all this is a reversal of the true relation. Will is first and original;
knowledge is merely added to it as an instrument belonging to
the phenomenon of will. 

Therefore every man is what he is
through his will, and his character is original, for willing is the
basis of his nature. Through the knowledge which is added to it
he comes to know in the course of experience what he is, i.e., he
learns his character. Thus he knows himself in consequence of 
and in accordance with the nature of his will, instead of willing in
consequence of and in accordance with his knowing. According
to the latter view, he would only require to consider how he
would like best to be, and he would be it; that is its doctrine
of the freedom of the will. Thus it consists really in this, that
a man is his own work guided by the light of knowledge. I, on
the contrary, say that he is his own work before all knowledge,
and knowledge is merely added to it to enlighten it. Therefore
he cannot resolve to be this or that, nor can he become other
than he is; but he is once for all, and he knows in the course of
experience what he is. According to one doctrine he wills what
he knows, and according to the other he knows what he wills.
The Greeks called the character ∑∏ø¬, and its expression, i.e.,
morals, ∑∏∑. 

But this word comes from μ∏ø¬, custom; they
chose it in order to express metaphorically the constancy of
character through the constancy of custom. §ø ≥±¡ ∑∏ø¬ ±¿ø
ƒø≈ μ∏ø≈¬ μ«μπ ƒ∑Ω μ¿…Ω≈ºπ±Ω. ∑∏π∫μ ≥±¡ ∫±ªμπƒ±π ¥π± ƒø
μ∏π∂μ√∏±π (a voce ∑∏ø¬, i.e., consuetudo ∑∏ø¬ est appellatum:
ethica ergo dicta est ±¿ø ƒø≈ μ∏π∂μ√∏±π, sivi ab assuescendo)
says Aristotle (Eth. Magna, i. 6, p. 1186, and Eth. Eud., p.
1220, and Eth. Nic., p. 1103, ed. Ber.) Stobæus quotes: ø1 ¥μ
∫±ƒ± ñ∑Ω…Ω± ƒ¡ø¿π∫…¬; ∑∏ø¬ μ√ƒπ ¿∑≥∑ ≤πø≈ ±∆Ω !¬ ±1 ∫±ƒ±
ºμ¡ø¬ ¿¡±æμπ¬ ¡μø≈√π (Stoici autem, Zenonis castra sequentes,
metaphorice ethos definiunt vitæ fontem, e quo singulæ manant
actiones), ii. ch. 7. 

In Christian theology we find the dogma
of predestination in consequence of election and non-election
(Rom. ix. 11-24), clearly originating from the knowledge that
man does not change himself, but his life and conduct, i.e.,
his empirical character, is only the unfolding of his intelligible
character, the development of decided and unchangeable natural
dispositions recognisable even in the child; therefore, as it were,
even at his birth his conduct is firmly determined, and remains essentially the same to the end. This we entirely agree with; but
certainly the consequences which followed from the union of this perfectly correct insight with the dogmas that already existed in
Jewish theology, and which now gave rise to the great difficulty,
the Gordian knot upon which most of the controversies of the
Church turned, I do not undertake to defend, for even the Apostle
Paul scarcely succeeded in doing so by means of his simile of the
potter's vessels which he invented for the purpose, for the result
he finally arrived at was nothing else than this:

“Let mankind
Fear the gods!
They hold the power
In everlasting hands:
And they can use it
As seems good to them.”

Such considerations, however, are really foreign to our subject.
Some explanation as to the relation between the character and
the knowledge in which all its motives lie, will now be more to
the point.

The motives which determine the manifestation of the
character or conduct influence it through the medium of
knowledge. But knowledge is changeable, and often vacillates
between truth and error, yet, as a rule, is rectified more and
more in the course of life, though certainly in very different
degrees. Therefore the conduct of a man may be observably
altered without justifying us in concluding that his character
has been changed. What the man really and in general wills,
the striving of his inmost nature, and the end he pursues in
accordance with it, this we can never change by influence upon
him from without by instruction, otherwise we could transform
him. Seneca says admirably, velle non discitur; whereby he
preferred truth to his Stoic philosophers, who taught ¥π¥±∫ƒ∑Ω
μπΩ±π ƒ∑Ω ±¡μƒ∑Ω (doceri posse virtutem). From without the
will can only be affected by motives. 

But these can never
change the will itself; for they have power over it only under the presupposition that it is precisely such as it is. All that they
can do is thus to alter the direction of its effort, i.e., bring it
about that it shall seek in another way than it has hitherto done
that which it invariably seeks. Therefore instruction, improved
knowledge, in other words, influence from without, may indeed
teach the will that it erred in the means it employed, and can
therefore bring it about that the end after which it strives once for
all according to its inner nature shall be pursued on an entirely
different path and in an entirely different object from what has
hitherto been the case. But it can never bring about that the will
shall will something actually different from what it has hitherto
willed; this remains unchangeable, for the will is simply this
willing itself, which would have to be abolished. The former,
however, the possible modification of knowledge, and through
knowledge of conduct, extends so far that the will seeks to attain
its unalterable end, for example, Mohammed's paradise, at one
time in the real world, at another time in a world of imagination,
adapting the means to each, and thus in the first case applying
prudence, might, and fraud, and in the second case, abstinence,
justice, alms, and pilgrimages to Mecca. But its effort itself has
not therefore changed, still less the will itself. Thus, although its
action certainly shows itself very different at different times, its
willing has yet remained precisely the same. Velle non discitur.
For motives to act, it is necessary not only that they should
be present, but that they should be known; for, according to a
very good expression of the schoolmen, which we referred to
once before, causa finalis movet non secundum suum esse reale;
sed secundum esse cognitum. For example, in order that the
relation may appear that exists in a given man between egoism
and sympathy, it is not sufficient that he should possess wealth
and see others in want, but he must also know what he can do[381]
with his wealth, both for himself and for others: not only must
the suffering of others be presented to him, but he must know
both what suffering and also what pleasure is. Perhaps, on a first
381
occasion, he did not know all this so well as on a second; and if,
on a similar occasion, he acts differently, this arises simply from
the fact that the circumstances were really different, as regards
the part of them that depends on his knowing them, although
they seem to be the same. As ignorance of actually existing
circumstances robs them of their influence, so, on the other hand,
entirely imaginary circumstances may act as if they were real,
not only in the case of a particular deception, but also in general
and continuously. For example, if a man is firmly persuaded that
every good action will be repaid him a hundredfold in a future
life, such a conviction affects him in precisely the same way as a
good bill of exchange at a very long date, and he can give from
mere egoism, as from another point of view he would take from
egoism. He has not changed himself: velle non discitur. It is on
account of this great influence of knowledge upon action, while
the will remains unchangeable, that the character develops and its
different features appear only little by little. Therefore it shows
itself different at every period of life, and an impetuous, wild
youth may be succeeded by a staid, sober, manly age. Especially
what is bad in the character will always come out more strongly
with time, yet sometimes it occurs that passions which a man
gave way to in his youth are afterwards voluntarily restrained,
simply because the motives opposed to them have only then
come into knowledge. Hence, also, we are all innocent to begin
with, and this merely means that neither we nor others know the
evil of our own nature; it only appears with the motives, and
only in time do the motives appear in knowledge. Finally we [382]
come to know ourselves as quite different from what a priori
we supposed ourselves to be, and then we are often terrified at
ourselves.

Repentance never proceeds from a change of the will (which
is impossible), but from a change of knowledge. The essential
and peculiar in what I have always willed I must still continue to
will; for I myself am this will which lies outside time and change.

I can therefore never repent of what I have willed, though I can
repent of what I have done; because, led by false conceptions,
I did something that was not in conformity with my will. The
discovery of this through fuller knowledge is repentance. This
extends not merely to worldly wisdom, to the choice of the
means, and the judgment of the appropriateness of the end to my
own will, but also to what is properly ethical. For example, I
may have acted more egotistically than is in accordance with my
character, led astray by exaggerated ideas of the need in which I
myself stood, or of the craft, falseness, and wickedness of others,
or because I hurried too much, i.e., acted without deliberation,
determined not by motives distinctly known in abstracto, but by
merely perceived motives, by the present and the emotion which
it excited, and which was so strong that I had not properly the use
of my reason; but the return of reflection is thus here also merely
corrected knowledge, and from this repentance may proceed,
which always proclaims itself by making amends for the past, as
far as is possible. Yet it must be observed that, in order to deceive
themselves, men prearrange what seem to be hasty errors, but
are really secretly considered actions. For we deceive and flatter
no one through such fine devices as ourselves. 

The converse of
the case we have given may also occur. I may be misled by too
good an opinion of others, or want of knowledge of the relative
value of the good things of life, or some abstract dogma in which
I have since lost faith, and thus I may act less egotistically than is
in keeping with my character, and lay up for myself repentance[383]
of another kind. Thus repentance is always corrected knowledge
of the relation of an act to its special intention. When the will
reveals its Ideas in space alone, i.e., through mere form, the
matter in which other Ideas—in this case natural forces—already
reign, resists the will, and seldom allows the form that is striving
after visibility to appear in perfect purity and distinctness, i.e.,
in perfect beauty. And there is an analogous hindrance to the
will as it reveals itself in time alone, i.e., through actions, in
383
the knowledge which seldom gives it the data quite correctly, so
that the action which takes place does not accurately correspond
to the will, and leads to repentance. Repentance thus always
proceeds from corrected knowledge, not from the change of the
will, which is impossible. Anguish of conscience for past deeds is
anything but repentance. It is pain at the knowledge of oneself in
one's inmost nature, i.e., as will. It rests precisely on the certainty
that we have still the same will. If the will were changed, and
therefore the anguish of conscience mere repentance, it would
cease to exist. The past could then no longer give us pain, for it
exhibited the expressions of a will which is no longer that of him
who has repented. We shall explain the significance of anguish
of conscience in detail farther on.
The influence which knowledge, as the medium of motives,
exerts, not indeed upon the will itself, but upon its appearance in
actions, is also the source of the principal distinction between the
action of men and that of brutes, for their methods of knowledge
are different. The brute has only knowledge of perception, the
man, through reason, has also abstract ideas, conceptions. Now,
although man and brute are with equal necessity determined
by their motives, yet man, as distinguished from the brute,
has a complete choice, which has often been regarded as a
freedom of the will in particular actions, although it is nothing
but the possibility of a thoroughly-fought-out battle between [384]
several motives, the strongest of which then determines it with
necessity. For this the motives must have assumed the form of
abstract thoughts, because it is really only by means of these
that deliberation, i.e., a weighing of opposite reasons for action,
is possible. In the case of the brute there can only be a choice
between perceptible motives presented to it, so that the choice is
limited to the narrow sphere of its present sensuous perception.
Therefore the necessity of the determination of the will by the
motive, which is like that of the effect by the cause, can be
exhibited perceptibly and directly only in the case of the brutes, because here the spectator has the motives just as directly before
his eyes as their effect; while in the case of man the motives are
almost always abstract ideas, which are not communicated to the
spectator, and even for the actor himself the necessity of their
effect is hidden behind their conflict. 

For only in abstracto can
several ideas, as judgments and chains of conclusions, lie beside
each other in consciousness, and then, free from all determination
of time, work against each other till the stronger overcomes the
rest and determines the will. This is the complete choice or power
of deliberation which man has as distinguished from the brutes,
and on account of which freedom of the will has been attributed to
him, in the belief that his willing is a mere result of the operations
of his intellect, without a definite tendency which serves as its
basis; while, in truth, the motives only work on the foundation
and under the presupposition of his definite tendency, which in
his case is individual, i.e., a character. A fuller exposition of this
power of deliberation, and the difference between human and
brute choice which is introduced by it, will be found in the “Two
Fundamental Problems of Ethics” (1st edition, p. 35, et seq.; 2d
edition, p. 34, et seq.), to which I therefore refer. For the rest,
this power of deliberation which man possesses is one of those
things that makes his existence so much more miserable than[385]
that of the brute. For in general our greatest sufferings do not
lie in the present as ideas of perception or as immediate feelings;
but in the reason, as abstract conceptions, painful thoughts, from
which the brute, which lives only in the present, and therefore in
enviable carelessness, is entirely free.

It seems to have been the dependence, which we have shown,
of the human power of deliberation upon the faculty of abstract
thinking, and thus also of judging and drawing conclusions also,
that led both Descartes and Spinoza to identify the decisions of
the will with the faculty of asserting and denying (the faculty of
judgment). From this Descartes deduced the doctrine that the
will, which, according to him, is indifferently free, is the source of sin, and also of all theoretical error. And Spinoza, on the other
hand, concluded that the will is necessarily determined by the
motives, as the judgment is by the reasons.70 The latter doctrine
is in a sense true, but it appears as a true conclusion from false
premises.

The distinction we have established between the ways in
which the brutes and man are respectively moved by motives
exerts a very wide influence upon the nature of both, and has
most to do with the complete and obvious differences of their
existence. While an idea of perception is in every case the
motive which determines the brute, the man strives to exclude
this kind of motivation altogether, and to determine himself
entirely by abstract ideas. Thus he uses his prerogative of
reason to the greatest possible advantage. Independent of the
present, he neither chooses nor avoids the passing pleasure or
pain, but reflects on the consequences of both. In most cases,
setting aside quite insignificant actions, we are determined by
abstract, thought motives, not present impressions. 

Therefore
all particular privation for the moment is for us comparatively
light, but all renunciation is terribly hard; for the former only concerns the fleeting present, but the latter concerns the future,
and includes in itself innumerable privations, of which it is the
equivalent. The causes of our pain, as of our pleasure, lie for the
most part, not in the real present, but merely in abstract thoughts.

It is these which are often unbearable to us—inflict torments in
comparison with which all the sufferings of the animal world
are very small; for even our own physical pain is not felt at
all when they are present. Indeed, in the case of keen mental
suffering, we even inflict physical suffering on ourselves merely
to distract our attention from the former to the latter. This is why,
in great mental anguish, men tear their hair, beat their breasts,
lacerate their faces, or roll on the floor, for all these are in reality only violent means of diverting the mind from an unbearable
thought. Just because mental pain, being much greater, makes
us insensible to physical pain, suicide is very easy to the person
who is in despair, or who is consumed by morbid depression,
even though formerly, in comfortable circumstances, he recoiled
at the thought of it. In the same way care and passion (thus
the play of thought) wear out the body oftener and more than
physical hardships. And in accordance with this Epictetus rightly
says: §±¡±√√μπ ƒø≈¬ ±Ω∏¡…¿ø≈¬ ø≈ ƒ± ¿¡±≥º±ƒ±, ±ªª± ƒ± ¿μ¡π
ƒ…Ω ¿¡±≥º±ƒ…Ω ¥ø≥º±ƒ± (Perturbant homines non res ipsæ, sed
de rebus decreta) (V.); and Seneca: Plura sunt quæ nos terrent,
quam quæ premunt, et sæpius opinione quam re laboramus (Ep.
5). Eulenspiegel also admirably bantered human nature, for
going uphill he laughed, and going downhill he wept. Indeed,
children who have hurt themselves often cry, not at the pain, but
at the thought of the pain which is awakened when some one
condoles with them. Such great differences in conduct and in life
arise from the diversity between the methods of knowledge of
the brutes and man. Further, the appearance of the distinct and
decided individual character, the principal distinction between[387]
man and the brute, which has scarcely more than the character of
the species, is conditioned by the choice between several motives,
which is only possible through abstract conceptions. For only
after a choice has been made are the resolutions, which vary in
different individuals, an indication of the individual character
which is different in each; while the action of the brute depends
only upon the presence or absence of the impression, supposing
this impression to be in general a motive for its species. And,
finally, in the case of man, only the resolve, and not the mere
wish, is a valid indication of his character both for himself and
for others; but the resolve becomes for himself, as for others,
a certain fact only through the deed. The wish is merely the
necessary consequence of the present impression, whether of the
outward stimulus, or the inward passing mood; and is therefore as immediately necessary and devoid of consideration as the
action of the brutes. 

Therefore, like the action of the brutes,
it merely expresses the character of the species, not that of the
individual, i.e., it indicates merely what man in general, not
what the individual who experiences the wish, is capable of
doing. The deed alone,—because as human action it always
requires a certain deliberation, and because as a rule a man has
command of his reason, is considerate, i.e., decides in accordance
with considered and abstract motives,—is the expression of the
intelligible maxims of his conduct, the result of his inmost
willing, and is related as a letter to the word that stands for his
empirical character, itself merely the temporal expression of his
intelligible character. In a healthy mind, therefore, only deeds
oppress the conscience, not wishes and thoughts; for it is only our
deeds that hold up to us the mirror of our will. The deed referred
to above, that is entirely unconsidered and is really committed in
blind passion, is to a certain extent an intermediate thing between
the mere wish and the resolve.

Therefore, by true repentance, which, however, shows itself
as action also, it can be obliterated, as a falsely drawn line, from
that picture of our will which our course of life is. I may insert the
remark here, as a very good comparison, that the relation between
wish and deed has a purely accidental but accurate analogy with
that between the accumulation and discharge of electricity.
As the result of the whole of this discussion of the freedom
of the will and what relates to it, we find that although the will
may, in itself and apart from the phenomenon, be called free and
even omnipotent, yet in its particular phenomena enlightened by
knowledge, as in men and brutes, it is determined by motives to
which the special character regularly and necessarily responds,
and always in the same way. We see that because of the
possession on his part of abstract or rational knowledge, man, as
distinguished from the brutes, has a choice, which only makes
him the scene of the conflict of his motives, without withdrawing him from their control. This choice is therefore certainly the
condition of the possibility of the complete expression of the
individual character, but is by no means to be regarded as
freedom of the particular volition, i.e., independence of the
law of causality, the necessity of which extends to man as to
every other phenomenon. Thus the difference between human
volition and that of the brutes, which is introduced by reason
or knowledge through concepts, extends to the point we have
indicated, and no farther. 

But, what is quite a different thing,
there may arise a phenomenon of the human will which is quite
impossible in the brute creation, if man altogether lays aside the
knowledge of particular things as such which is subordinate to
the principle of sufficient reason, and by means of his knowledge
of the Ideas sees through the principium individuationis. Then
an actual appearance of the real freedom of the will as a thing-
in-itself is possible, by which the phenomenon comes into a sort
of contradiction with itself, as is indicated by the word self-[389]
renunciation; and, finally, the “in-itself” of its nature suppresses
itself. But this, the one, real, and direct expression of the freedom
of the will in itself in the phenomenon, cannot be distinctly
explained here, but will form the subject of the concluding part
of our work.

Now that we have shown clearly in these pages the unalterable
nature of the empirical character, which is just the unfolding
of the intelligible character that lies outside time, together with
the necessity with which actions follow upon its contact with
motives, we hasten to anticipate an argument which may very
easily be drawn from this in the interest of bad dispositions. Our
character is to be regarded as the temporal unfolding of an extra-
temporal, and therefore indivisible and unalterable, act of will,
or an intelligible character. This necessarily determines all that is
essential in our conduct in life, i.e., its ethical content, which must
express itself in accordance with it in its phenomenal appearance,
the empirical character; while only what is unessential in this,
389
the outward form of our course of life, depends upon the forms
in which the motives present themselves. It might, therefore,
be inferred that it is a waste of trouble to endeavour to improve
one's character, and that it is wiser to submit to the inevitable,
and gratify every inclination at once, even if it is bad. But this
is precisely the same thing as the theory of an inevitable fate
which is called ±¡≥ø¬ ªø≥ø¬, and in more recent times Turkish
faith. Its true refutation, as it is supposed to have been given by
Chrysippus, is explained by Cicero in his book De Fato, ch. 12,
13.
Though everything may be regarded as irrevocably
predetermined by fate, yet it is so only through the medium
of the chain of causes; therefore in no case can it be determined
that an effect shall appear without its cause. Thus it is not simply
the event that is predetermined, but the event as the consequence [390]
of preceding causes; so that fate does not decide the consequence
alone, but also the means as the consequence of which it is
destined to appear. Accordingly, if some means is not present, it
is certain that the consequence also will not be present: each is
always present in accordance with the determination of fate, but
this is never known to us till afterwards.
As events always take place according to fate, i.e., according
to the infinite concatenation of causes, so our actions always
take place according to our intelligible character. But just as we
do not know the former beforehand, so no a priori insight is
given us into the latter, but we only come to know ourselves as
we come to know other persons a posteriori through experience.
If the intelligible character involved that we could only form a
good resolution after a long conflict with a bad disposition, this
conflict would have to come first and be waited for. Reflection
on the unalterable nature of the character, on the unity of the
source from which all our actions flow, must not mislead us into
claiming the decision of the character in favour of one side or
the other; it is in the resolve that follows that we shall see what manner of men we are, and mirror ourselves in our actions. This
is the explanation of the satisfaction or the anguish of soul with
which we look back on the course of our past life. 

Both are
experienced, not because these past deeds have still an existence;
they are past, they have been, and now are no more; but their
great importance for us lies in their significance, lies in the fact
that these deeds are the expression of the character, the mirror
of the will, in which we look and recognise our inmost self,
the kernel of our will. Because we experience this not before,
but only after, it behoves us to strive and fight in time, in order
that the picture we produce by our deeds may be such that the
contemplation of it may calm us as much as possible, instead of
harassing us. The significance of this consolation or anguish of[391]
soul will, as we have said, be inquired into farther on; but to this
place there belongs the inquiry which follows, and which stands
by itself.

Besides the intelligible and the empirical character, we must
mention a third which is different from them both, the acquired
character, which one only receives in life through contact with
the world, and which is referred to when one is praised as a man
of character or censured as being without character. Certainly
one might suppose that, since the empirical character, as the
phenomenon of the intelligible, is unalterable, and, like every
natural phenomenon, is consistent with itself, man would always
have to appear like himself and consistent, and would therefore
have no need to acquire a character artificially by experience
and reflection. But the case is otherwise, and although a man
is always the same, yet he does not always understand himself,
but often mistakes himself, till he has in some degree acquired
real self-knowledge. The empirical character, as a mere natural
tendency, is in itself irrational; nay, more, its expressions are
disturbed by reason, all the more so the more intellect and power
of thought the man has; for these always keep before him what
becomes man in general as the character of the species, and
391
what is possible for him both in will and in deed. This makes
it the more difficult for him to see how much his individuality
enables him to will and to accomplish. He finds in himself the
germs of all the various human pursuits and powers, but the
difference of degree in which they exist in his individuality is not
clear to him in the absence of experience; and if he now applies
himself to the pursuits which alone correspond to his character,
he yet feels, especially at particular moments and in particular
moods, the inclination to directly opposite pursuits which cannot
be combined with them, but must be entirely suppressed if he
desires to follow the former undisturbed. 

For as our physical
path upon earth is always merely a line, not an extended surface,
so in life, if we desire to grasp and possess one thing, we must
renounce and leave innumerable others on the right hand and on
the left. If we cannot make up our minds to this, but, like children
at the fair, snatch at everything that attracts us in passing, we are
making the perverse endeavour to change the line of our path into
an extended surface; we run in a zigzag, skip about like a will o'
the wisp, and attain to nothing. Or, to use another comparison,
as, according to Hobbes' philosophy of law, every one has an
original right to everything but an exclusive right to nothing, yet
can obtain an exclusive right to particular things by renouncing
his right to all the rest, while others, on their part, do likewise
with regard to what he has chosen; so is it in life, in which
some definite pursuit, whether it be pleasure, honour, wealth,
science, art, or virtue, can only be followed with seriousness and
success when all claims that are foreign to it are given up, when
everything else is renounced. Accordingly, the mere will and the
mere ability are not sufficient, but a man must also know what he
wills, and know what he can do; only then will he show character,
and only then can he accomplish something right. Until he attains
to that, notwithstanding the natural consistency of the empirical
character, he is without character. And although, on the whole,
he must remain true to himself, and fulfil his course, led by his dæmon, yet his path will not be a straight line, but wavering and
uneven. He will hesitate, deviate, turn back, lay up for himself
repentance and pain. And all this is because, in great and small,
he sees before him all that is possible and attainable for man in
general, but does not know what part of all this is alone suitable
for him, can be accomplished by him, and is alone enjoyable by
him. He will, therefore, envy many men on account of a position
and circumstances which are yet only suitable to their characters
and not to his, and in which he would feel unhappy, if indeed
he found them endurable at all. For as a fish is only at home in[393]
water, a bird in the air, a mole in the earth, so every man is only at
home in the atmosphere suitable to him. For example, not all men
can breathe the air of court life. From deficiency of proper insight
into all this, many a man will make all kinds of abortive attempts,
will do violence to his character in particulars, and yet, on the
whole, will have to yield to it again; and what he thus painfully
attains will give him no pleasure; what he thus learns will remain
dead; even in an ethical regard, a deed that is too noble for his
character, that has not sprung from pure, direct impulse, but from
a concept, a dogma, will lose all merit, even in his own eyes,
through subsequent egoistical repentance. Velle non discitur. 

We
only become conscious of the inflexibility of another person's
character through experience, and till then we childishly believe
that it is possible, by means of rational ideas, by prayers and
entreaties, by example and noble-mindedness, ever to persuade
any one to leave his own way, to change his course of conduct, to
depart from his mode of thinking, or even to extend his capacities:
so is it also with ourselves. We must first learn from experience
what we desire and what we can do. Till then we know it not, we
are without character, and must often be driven back to our own
way by hard blows from without. But if we have finally learnt
it, then we have attained to what in the world is called character,
the acquired character. This is accordingly nothing but the most
perfect knowledge possible of our own individuality. It is the abstract, and consequently distinct, knowledge of the unalterable
qualities of our own empirical character, and of the measure and
direction of our mental and physical powers, and thus of the whole
strength and weakness of our own individuality. This places us
in a position to carry out deliberately and methodically the rôle
which belongs to our own person, and to fill up the gaps which
caprices or weaknesses produce in it, under the guidance of fixed [394]
conceptions. This rôle is in itself unchangeably determined once
for all, but hitherto we have allowed it to follow its natural course
without any rule. We have now brought to distinct conscious
maxims which are always present to us the form of conduct
which is necessarily determined by our own individual nature,
and now we conduct it in accordance with them as deliberately
as if we had learned it; without ever falling into error through the
passing influence of the mood or the impression of the present,
without being checked by the bitterness or sweetness of some
particular thing we meet with on our path, without delay, without
hesitation, without inconsistency. We shall now no longer, as
novices, wait, attempt, and grope about in order to see what we
really desire and are able to do, but we know this once for all,
and in every choice we have only to apply general principles
to particular cases, and arrive at once at a decision. We know
our will in general, and do not allow ourselves to be led by
the passing mood or by solicitations from without to resolve in
particular cases what is contrary to it as a whole. We know in
the same way the nature and the measure of our strength and
our weakness, and thereby are spared much suffering. For we
experience no real pleasure except in the use and feeling of our
own powers, and the greatest pain is the conscious deficiency of
our powers where we need them. If, now, we have discovered
where our strength and our weakness lie, we will endeavour to
cultivate, employ, and in every way make use of those talents
which are naturally prominent in us. We will always turn to
those occupations in which they are valuable and to the purpose, and entirely avoid, even with self-renunciation, those pursuits
for which we have naturally little aptitude; we will beware of
attempting that in which we have no chance of succeeding.

Only he who has attained to this will constantly and with full[395]
consciousness be completely himself, and will never fail himself
at the critical moment, because he will always have known what
he could expect from himself. He will often enjoy the satisfaction
of feeling his strength, and seldom experience the pain of being
reminded of his weakness. The latter is mortification, which
causes perhaps the greatest of mental sufferings; therefore it
is far more endurable to have our misfortune brought clearly
before us than our incapacity. And, further, if we are thus fully
acquainted with our strength and our weakness, we will not
attempt to make a show of powers which we do not possess; we
will not play with base coin, for all such dissimulation misses
the mark in the end. For since the whole man is only the
phenomenon of his will, nothing can be more perverse than to
try, by means of reflection, to become something else than one
is, for this is a direct contradiction of the will with itself. The
imitation of the qualities and idiosyncrasies of others is much
more shameful than to dress in other people's clothes; for it is the
judgment of our own worthlessness pronounced by ourselves.
Knowledge of our own mind and its capacities of every kind, and
their unalterable limits, is in this respect the surest way to the
attainment of the greatest possible contentment with ourselves.


For it holds good of inward as of outward circumstances that there
is for us no consolation so effective as the complete certainty of
unalterable necessity. 

No evil that befalls us pains us so much
as the thought of the circumstances by which it might have been
warded off. Therefore nothing comforts us so effectually as
the consideration of what has happened from the standpoint of
necessity, from which all accidents appear as tools in the hand of
an overruling fate, and we therefore recognise the evil that has
come to us as inevitably produced by the conflict of inner and outer circumstances; in other words, fatalism. We really only
complain and storm so long as we hope either to affect others or to excite ourselves to unheard-of efforts. But children and
grown-up people know very well to yield contentedly as soon as
they clearly see that it absolutely cannot be otherwise:—ò≈ºxΩ
Ωv √ƒu∏μ√√π ∆wªøΩ ¥±ºq√√±Ωƒμ¬ Ωq≥∫∑ (Animo in pectoribus
nostro domito necessitate). 

We are like the entrapped elephants,
that rage and struggle for many days, till they see that it is
useless, and then suddenly offer their necks quietly to the yoke,
tamed for ever. We are like King David, who, as long as his
son still lived, unceasingly importuned Jehovah with prayers,
and behaved himself as if in despair; but as soon as his son was
dead, thought no longer about it. Hence it arises that innumerable
permanent ills, such as lameness, poverty, low estate, ugliness,
a disagreeable dwelling-place, are borne with indifference by
innumerable persons, and are no longer felt, like healed wounds,
just because these persons know that inward or outward necessity
renders it impossible that any change can take place in these
things; while those who are more fortunate cannot understand
how such misfortunes can be borne. 

Now as with outward
necessity, so also with inward; nothing reconciles so thoroughly
as a distinct knowledge of it. If we have once for all distinctly
recognised not only our good qualities and our strength, but
also our defects and weakness, established our aim accordingly,
and rest satisfied concerning what cannot be attained, we thus
escape in the surest way, as far as our individuality permits, the
bitterest of all sorrows, discontentment with ourselves, which is
the inevitable result of ignorance of our own individuality, of
false conceit and the audacity that proceeds from it. To the bitter
chapter of the self-knowledge here recommended the lines of

Ovid admit of excellent application—
“Optimus ille animi vindex lædentia pectus,
Vincula qui rupit, dedoluitque semel.”

So much with regard to the acquired character, which, indeed,
is not of so much importance for ethics proper as for life in the
world. But its investigation was related as that of a third species
to the investigation of the intelligible and the empirical character,
in regard to which we were obliged to enter upon a somewhat
detailed inquiry in order to bring out clearly how in all its
phenomena the will is subject to necessity, while yet in itself it
may be called free and even omnipotent.
