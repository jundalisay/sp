Beauty accompanied with grace is the principal object of sculpture, it loves nakedness, and allows clothing only
so far as it does not conceal the form. It makes use of drapery, not
as a covering, but as a means of exhibiting the form, a method
of exposition that gives much exercise to the understanding, for
it can only arrive at a perception of the cause, the form of the
body, through the only directly given effect, the drapery. Thus
to a certain extent drapery is in sculpture what fore-shortening is
in painting. Both are suggestions, yet not symbolical, but such
that, if they are successful, they force the understanding directly
to perceive what is suggested, just as if it were actually given.
I may be allowed, in passing, to insert here a comparison

that is very pertinent to the arts we are discussing. It is this:
as the beautiful bodily form is seen to the greatest advantage
when clothed in the lightest way, or indeed without any clothing
at all, and therefore a very handsome man, if he had also taste
and the courage to follow it, would go about almost naked,
clothed only after the manner of the ancients; so every one who
possesses a beautiful and rich mind will always express himself
in the most natural, direct, and simple way, concerned, if it
be possible, to communicate his thoughts to others, and thus
relieve the loneliness that he must feel in such a world as this.
And conversely, poverty of mind, confusion, and perversity of
thought, will clothe itself in the most far-fetched expressions and
the obscurest forms of speech, in order to wrap up in difficult and
pompous phraseology small, trifling, insipid, or commonplace
thoughts; like a man who has lost the majesty of beauty, and
trying to make up for the deficiency by means of clothing, seeks
to hide the insignificance or ugliness of his person under barbaric
finery, tinsel, feathers, ruffles, cuffs, and mantles. Many an
author, if compelled to translate his pompous and obscure book [297]
into its little clear content, would be as utterly spoilt as this man
if he had to go naked.



§ 48. Historical painting has for its principal object, besides
beauty and grace, character. By character we mean generally, the
representation of will at the highest grade of its objectification,
when the individual, as giving prominence to a particular side
of the Idea of humanity, has special significance, and shows this
not merely by his form, but makes it visible in his bearing and
occupation, by action of every kind, and the modifications of
knowing and willing that occasion and accompany it. The Idea of
man must be exhibited in these circumstances, and therefore the
unfolding of its many-sidedness must be brought before our eyes
by means of representative individuals, and these individuals
can only be made visible in their significance through various
scenes, events, and actions. This is the endless problem of the historical painter, and he solves it by placing before us scenes of
life of every kind, of greater or less significance. No individual
and no action can be without significance; in all and through
all the Idea of man unfolds itself more and more. Therefore no
event of human life is excluded from the sphere of painting. It
is thus a great injustice to the excellent painters of the Dutch
school, to prize merely their technical skill, and to look down
upon them in other respects, because, for the most part, they
represent objects of common life, whereas it is assumed that only
the events of the history of the world, or the incidents of biblical
story, have significance. We ought first to bethink ourselves
that the inward significance of an action is quite different from
its outward significance, and that these are often separated from
each other. The outward significance is the importance of an
action in relation to its result for and in the actual world; thus
according to the principle of sufficient reason. 

The inward
significance is the depth of the insight into the Idea of man which
it reveals, in that it brings to light sides of that Idea which[298]
rarely appear, by making individuals who assert themselves
distinctly and decidedly, disclose their peculiar characteristics by
means of appropriately arranged circumstances. Only the inward
significance concerns art; the outward belongs to history. They
are both completely independent of each other; they may appear
together, but may each appear alone. An action which is of the
highest significance for history may in inward significance be
a very ordinary and common one; and conversely, a scene of
ordinary daily life may be of great inward significance, if human
individuals, and the inmost recesses of human action and will,
appear in it in a clear and distinct light. Further, the outward
and the inward significance of a scene may be equal and yet
very different. Thus, for example, it is all the same, as far as
inward significance is concerned, whether ministers discuss the
fate of countries and nations over a map, or boors wrangle in a
beer-house over cards and dice, just as it is all the same whether we play chess with golden or wooden pieces. But apart from this,
the scenes and events that make up the life of so many millions of
men, their actions, their sorrows, their joys, are on that account
important enough to be the object of art, and by their rich variety
they must afford material enough for unfolding the many-sided
Idea of man. Indeed the very transitoriness of the moment
which art has fixed in such a picture (now called genre-painting)
excites a slight and peculiar sensation; for to fix the fleeting,
ever-changing world in the enduring picture of a single event,
which yet represents the whole, is an achievement of the art of
painting by which it seems to bring time itself to a standstill,
for it raises the individual to the Idea of its species. Finally,
the historical and outwardly significant subjects of painting have
often the disadvantage that just what is significant in them cannot
be presented to perception, but must be arrived at by thought.
In this respect the nominal significance of the picture must [299]
be distinguished from its real significance. The former is the
outward significance, which, however, can only be reached as
a conception; the latter is that side of the Idea of man which is
made visible to the onlooker in the picture. For example, Moses
found by the Egyptian princess is the nominal significance of a
painting; it represents a moment of the greatest importance in
history; the real significance, on the other hand, that which is
really given to the onlooker, is a foundling child rescued from
its floating cradle by a great lady, an incident which may have
happened more than once. The costume alone can here indicate
the particular historical case to the learned; but the costume is
only of importance to the nominal significance, and is a matter
of indifference to the real significance; for the latter knows only
the human being as such, not the arbitrary forms. Subjects
taken from history have no advantage over those which are taken
from mere possibility, and which are therefore to be called, not
individual, but merely general. For what is peculiarly significant
in the former is not the individual, not the particular event as
304 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
such, but the universal in it, the side of the Idea of humanity
which expresses itself through it. But, on the other hand, definite
historical subjects are not on this account to be rejected, only the
really artistic view of such subjects, both in the painter and in the
beholder, is never directed to the individual particulars in them,
which properly constitute the historical, but to the universal
which expresses itself in them, to the Idea. And only those
historical subjects are to be chosen the chief point of which can
actually be represented, and not merely arrived at by thought,
otherwise the nominal significance is too remote from the real;
what is merely thought in connection with the picture becomes
of most importance, and interferes with what is perceived. If
even on the stage it is not right that the chief incident of the plot
should take place behind the scenes (as in French tragedies), it[300]
is clearly a far greater fault in a picture. Historical subjects are
distinctly disadvantageous only when they confine the painter
to a field which has not been chosen for artistic but for other
reasons, and especially when this field is poor in picturesque and
significant objects—if, for example, it is the history of a small,
isolated, capricious, hierarchical (i.e., ruled by error), obscure
people, like the Jews, despised by the great contemporary nations
of the East and the West. Since the wandering of the tribes lies
between us and all ancient nations, as the change of the bed of
the ocean lies between the earth's surface as it is to-day and as
it was when those organisations existed which we only know
from fossil remains, it is to be regarded generally as a great
misfortune that the people whose culture was to be the principal
basis of our own were not the Indians or the Greeks, or even
the Romans, but these very Jews. But it was especially a great
misfortune for the Italian painters of genius in the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries that, in the narrow sphere to which they were
arbitrarily driven for the choice of subjects, they were obliged
to have recourse to miserable beings of every kind. 

For the
New Testament, as regards its historical part, is almost more unsuitable for painting than the Old, and the subsequent history
of martyrs and doctors of the church is a very unfortunate subject.
Yet of the pictures, whose subject is the history or mythology
of Judaism and Christianity, we must carefully distinguish those
in which the peculiar, i.e., the ethical spirit of Christianity is
revealed for perception, by the representation of men who are
full of this spirit. These representations are in fact the highest and
most admirable achievements of the art of painting; and only the
greatest masters of this art succeeded in this, particularly Raphael
and Correggio, and especially in their earlier pictures. Pictures
of this kind are not properly to be classed as historical: for, as a
rule, they represent no event, no action; but are merely groups
of saints, with the Saviour himself, often still a child, with His [301]
mother, angels, &c. In their countenances, and especially in the
eyes, we see the expression, the reflection, of the completest
knowledge, that which is not directed to particular things, but
has fully grasped the Ideas, and thus the whole nature of the
world and life. And this knowledge in them, reacting upon the
will, does not, like other knowledge, convey motives to it, but
on the contrary has become a quieter of all will, from which
proceeded the complete resignation, which is the innermost spirit
of Christianity, as of the Indian philosophy; the surrender of
all volition, conversion, the suppression of will, and with it of
the whole inner being of this world, that is to say, salvation.
Thus these masters of art, worthy of eternal praise, expressed
perceptibly in their works the highest wisdom. And this is
the summit of all art. It has followed the will in its adequate
objectivity, the Ideas, through all its grades, in which it is affected
and its nature unfolded in so many ways, first by causes, then
by stimuli, and finally by motives. And now art ends with the
representation of the free self-suppression of will, by means of
the great peace which it gains from the perfect knowledge of its
own nature.56
