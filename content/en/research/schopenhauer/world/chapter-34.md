<!-- The transition which we have referred to as possible, but yet to be regarded as only exceptional, from  -->

The common knowledge of particular things changes to the knowledge of the Idea suddenly. 

for knowledge breaks free from the service
of the will, by the subject ceasing to be merely individual, and
thus becoming the pure will-less subject of knowledge, which
no longer traces relations in accordance with the principle of
sufficient reason, but rests in fixed contemplation of the object
presented to it, out of its connection with all others, and rises into
it.

If, raised by the power of the mind, a man relinquishes the
common way of looking at things, gives up tracing, under the
guidance of the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, their
relations to each other, the final goal of which is always a
relation to his own will; if he thus ceases to consider the where,
the when, the why, and the whither of things, and looks simply
and solely at the what; if, further, he does not allow abstract
thought, the concepts of the reason, to take possession of his
consciousness, but, instead of all this, gives the whole power of his mind to perception, sinks himself entirely in this, and lets his
whole consciousness be filled with the quiet contemplation of
the natural object actually present, whether a landscape, a tree,
a mountain, a building, or whatever it may be; inasmuch as he
loses himself in this object (to use a pregnant German idiom),
i.e., forgets even his individuality, his will, and only continues
to exist as the pure subject, the clear mirror of the object, so
that it is as if the object alone were there, without any one to
perceive it, and he can no longer separate the perceiver from
the perception, but both have become one, because the whole
consciousness is filled and occupied with one single sensuous
picture; if thus the object has to such an extent passed out of
all relation to something outside it, and the subject out of all
relation to the will, then that which is so known is no longer the
particular thing as such; but it is the Idea, the eternal form, the
immediate objectivity of the will at this grade; and, therefore,
he who is sunk in this perception is no longer individual, for
in such perception the individual has lost himself; but he is
pure, will-less, painless, timeless subject of knowledge. 

This, which in itself is so remarkable (which I well know confirms
the saying that originated with Thomas Paine, Du sublime au
ridicule il n'y a qu'un pas), will by degrees become clearer and
less surprising from what follows. It was this that was running
in Spinoza's mind when he wrote: Meus æterna est, quatenus res
sub æternitatis specie concipit (Eth. V. pr. 31, Schol.)47 In such [232]
contemplation the particular thing becomes at once the Idea of
its species, and the perceiving individual becomes pure subject
of knowledge. The individual, as such, knows only particular
things; the pure subject of knowledge knows only Ideas. For

<!-- 47 I also recommend the perusal of what Spinoza says in his Ethics (Book
II., Prop. 40, Schol. 2, and Book V., Props. 25-38), concerning the cognitio
tertii generis, sive intuitiva, in illustration of the kind of knowledge we are
considering, and very specially Prop. 29, Schol.; prop. 36, Schol., and Prop.
38, Demonst. et Schol. -->

the individual is the subject of knowledge in its relation to a
definite particular manifestation of will, and in subjection to this.
This particular manifestation of will is, as such, subordinated to
the principle of sufficient reason in all its forms; therefore, all
knowledge which relates itself to it also follows the principle
of sufficient reason, and no other kind of knowledge is fitted
to be of use to the will but this, which always consists merely
of relations to the object. 

The knowing individual as such, and
the particular things known by him, are always in some place,
at some time, and are links in the chain of causes and effects.
The pure subject of knowledge and his correlative, the Idea, have
passed out of all these forms of the principle of sufficient reason:
time, place, the individual that knows, and the individual that is
known, have for them no meaning. When an individual knower
has raised himself in the manner described to be pure subject of
knowledge, and at the same time has raised the observed object
to the Platonic Idea, the world as idea appears complete and
pure, and the full objectification of the will takes place, for the
Platonic Idea alone is its adequate objectivity. 

The Idea includes
object and subject in like manner in itself, for they are its one
form; but in it they are absolutely of equal importance; for as
the object is here, as elsewhere, simply the idea of the subject,
the subject, which passes entirely into the perceived object has
thus become this object itself, for the whole consciousness is
nothing but its perfectly distinct picture. Now this consciousness[233]
constitutes the whole world as idea, for one imagines the whole
of the Platonic Ideas, or grades of the objectivity of will, in their
series passing through it. The particular things of all time and
space are nothing but Ideas multiplied through the principle of
sufficient reason (the form of the knowledge of the individual as
such), and thus obscured as regards their pure objectivity. When
the Platonic Idea appears, in it subject and object are no longer to
be distinguished, for the Platonic Idea, the adequate objectivity
of will, the true world as idea, arises only when the subject and object reciprocally fill and penetrate each other completely;
and in the same way the knowing and the known individuals,
as things in themselves, are not to be distinguished. For if we
look entirely away from the true world as idea, there remains
nothing but the world as will. The will is the “in-itself” of the
Platonic Idea, which fully objectifies it; it is also the “in-itself”
of the particular thing and of the individual that knows it, which
objectify it incompletely. 

As will, outside the idea and all its
forms, it is one and the same in the object contemplated and in the
individual, who soars aloft in this contemplation, and becomes
conscious of himself as pure subject. These two are, therefore, in
themselves not different, for in themselves they are will, which
here knows itself; and multiplicity and difference exist only as
the way in which this knowledge comes to the will, i.e., only
in the phenomenon, on account of its form, the principle of
sufficient reason.

Now the known thing, without me as the subject of knowledge,
is just as little an object, and not mere will, blind effort, as without
the object, without the idea, I am a knowing subject and not mere
blind will. This will is in itself, i.e., outside the idea, one and
the same with mine: only in the world as idea, whose form is
always at least that of subject and object, we are separated as
the known and the knowing individual. As soon as knowledge, [234]
the world as idea, is abolished, there remains nothing but mere
will, blind effort. That it should receive objectivity, become
idea, supposes at once both subject and object; but that this
should be pure, complete, and adequate objectivity of the will,
supposes the object as Platonic Idea, free from the forms of the
principle of sufficient reason, and the subject as the pure subject
of knowledge, free from individuality and subjection to the will.
Whoever now, has, after the manner referred to, become
so absorbed and lost in the perception of nature that he only
continues to exist as the pure knowing subject, becomes in this
way directly conscious that, as such, he is the condition, that is, the supporter, of the world and all objective existence; for this
now shows itself as dependent upon his existence. Thus he draws
nature into himself, so that he sees it to be merely an accident of
his own being. In this sense Byron says—
“Are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part
Of me and of my soul, as I of them?”

But how shall he who feels this, regard himself as absolutely
transitory, in contrast to imperishable nature? Such a man will
rather be filled with the consciousness, which the Upanishad of
the Veda expresses: Hæ omnes creaturæ in totum ego sum, et
præter me aliud ens non est (Oupnek'hat, i. 122).
