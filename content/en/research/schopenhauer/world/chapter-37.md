Genius consists in the capacity for knowing, independently of the principle of sufficient reason, not individual things, which have their
existence only in their relations, but the Ideas of such things, 
and of being oneself the correlative of the Idea, and thus no
longer an individual, but the pure subject of knowledge. 

Yet this faculty must exist in all men in a smaller and different degree. For if not, they would be just as incapable of enjoying works
of art as of producing them; they would have no susceptibility
for the beautiful or the sublime; indeed, these words could have
no meaning for them. We must therefore assume that there exists in all men this power of knowing the Ideas in things, and
consequently of transcending their personality for the moment,
unless indeed there are some men who are capable of no æsthetic
pleasure at all. The man of genius excels ordinary men only
by possessing this kind of knowledge in a far higher degree and
more continuously. Thus, while under its influence he retains
the presence of mind which is necessary to enable him to repeat
in a voluntary and intentional work what he has learned in this
manner; and this repetition is the work of art. Through this
he communicates to others the Idea he has grasped. This Idea
remains unchanged and the same, so that æsthetic pleasure is one
and the same whether it is called forth by a work of art or directly
by the contemplation of nature and life. The work of art is only
a means of facilitating the knowledge in which this pleasure
consists. That the Idea comes to us more easily from the work of
art than directly from nature and the real world, arises from the
fact that the artist, who knew only the Idea, no longer the actual,
has reproduced in his work the pure Idea, has abstracted it from
the actual, omitting all disturbing accidents. The artist lets us
see the world through his eyes. That he has these eyes, that he
knows the inner nature of things apart from all their relations, is
the gift of genius, is inborn; but that he is able to lend us this
gift, to let us see with his eyes, is acquired, and is the technical
side of art. Therefore, after the account which I have given in the
preceding pages of the inner nature of æsthetical knowledge in
its most general outlines, the following more exact philosophical
treatment of the beautiful and the sublime will explain them both,
in nature and in art, without separating them further. First of all [253]
we shall consider what takes place in a man when he is affected
by the beautiful and the sublime; whether he derives this emotion
directly from nature, from life, or partakes of it only through
the medium of art, does not make any essential, but merely an
external, difference.
