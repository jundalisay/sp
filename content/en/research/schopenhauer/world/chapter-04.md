The form of the principle of sufficient reason appears in pure time.

Time is the basis for all counting and arithmetical calculation.

<!-- , has completely mastered the nature of time.  -->

<!-- Time is nothing more than that form of the principle of sufficient reason, and has no further significance. -->

The principle of sufficient reason in time is called succession.

Succession is the whole nature of time.

The form of the principle of sufficient reason appears in the presentation of pure space.

This exhausts the whole nature of space, which is just a possibility of the reciprocal determination of its parts by each other, as 'position'.

Geometry studies this. 

<!-- The detailed treatment of this, and the formulation in abstract conceptions of the results which flow from it, so that they may be more conveniently used, is the subject of the science of geometry. -->


The principle of sufficient reason fills the forms of space and time as objects of perception through the law of causation.

<!-- that is to say matter, has completely mastered the nature of matter as such, for  -->

Matter is just causation.

 <!-- as any one will see at once if he reflects.  -->

Matter's true being is its action.

 <!-- nor can we possibly conceive it as having any other meaning.  -->

Only as active does matter fill space and time.

Matter's action on immediate matter-object determines that resulting perception [in space and time].

 <!-- in which alone it exists.  -->

The consequence of the action of any material object on another is known only as the receiving object acts on the acting object in a different way.

<!--  from that in which it acted before; 

it consists only of this. -->


Cause and effect thus constitute the whole nature of matter.

Its true being is its action. 

<!-- (A fuller treatment of this will be found in the essay on the Principle of Sufficient Reason, § 21, p. 77.)  -->

The nature of all material things is 'Wirklichkeit'.

It is more expressive than Realität. 

Again, that which is acted upon is always matter, and thus the whole being and essence of matter consists in the orderly change, which one part of it brings about in another part. 

The existence of matter is therefore entirely relative.
- It is based on a relation which is valid only within its limits, as in the case of time and space.

But time and space, each for itself, can be mentally presented apart from matter.

But matter cannot be so presented without time and space.

The form which is inseparable from it presupposes space, and the action in which its very
existence consists, always imports some change, in other words
a determination in time. 

But space and time are not only, each for itself, presupposed by matter, but a union of the two constitutes
its essence, for this, as we have seen, consists in action, i.e.,
in causation. 

All the innumerable conceivable phenomena and conditions of things, might be coexistent in boundless space,[011]
without limiting each other, or might be successive in endless time
without interfering with each other: thus a necessary relation of
these phenomena to each other, and a law which should regulate
them according to such a relation, is by no means needful, would
not, indeed, be applicable: it therefore follows that in the case of all co-existence in space and change in time, so long as each
of these forms preserves for itself its condition and its course
without any connection with the other, there can be no causation,
and since causation constitutes the essential nature of matter,
there can be no matter. 

But the law of causation receives its
meaning and necessity only from this, that the essence of change
does not consist simply in the mere variation of things, but
rather in the fact that at the same part of space there is now one
thing and then another, and at one and the same point of time
there is here one thing and there another: only this reciprocal
limitation of space and time by each other gives meaning, and
at the same time necessity, to a law, according to which change
must take place.
