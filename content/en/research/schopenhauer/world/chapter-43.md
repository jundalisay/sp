The knowledge of the beautiful always supposes at once and
inseparably the pure knowing subject and the known Idea as
object. Yet the source of æsthetic satisfaction will sometimes lie
more in the comprehension of the known Idea, sometimes more
in the blessedness and spiritual peace of the pure knowing subject
freed from all willing, and therefore from all individuality, and[275]
the pain that proceeds from it. And, indeed, this predominance
of one or the other constituent part of æsthetic feeling will
depend upon whether the intuitively grasped Idea is a higher
or a lower grade of the objectivity of will. Thus in æsthetic
contemplation (in the real, or through the medium of art) of
the beauty of nature in the inorganic and vegetable worlds, or
in works of architecture, the pleasure of pure will-less knowing
will predominate, because the Ideas which are here apprehended
are only low grades of the objectivity of will, and are therefore
not manifestations of deep significance and rich content. 

On
the other hand, if animals and man are the objects of æsthetic contemplation or representation, the pleasure will consist rather
in the comprehension of these Ideas, which are the most distinct
revelation of will; for they exhibit the greatest multiplicity of
forms, the greatest richness and deep significance of phenomena,
and reveal to us most completely the nature of will, whether
in its violence, its terribleness, its satisfaction or its aberration
(the latter in tragic situations), or finally in its change and self-
surrender, which is the peculiar theme of christian painting; as
the Idea of the will enlightened by full knowledge is the object of
historical painting in general, and of the drama. We shall now go
through the fine arts one by one, and this will give completeness
and distinctness to the theory of the beautiful which we have
advanced.



§ 43. Matter as such cannot be the expression of an Idea.
For, as we found in the first book, it is throughout nothing but
causality: its being consists in its casual action. But causality
is a form of the principle of sufficient reason; knowledge of the
Idea, on the other hand, absolutely excludes the content of that
principle. We also found, in the second book, that matter is the
common substratum of all particular phenomena of the Ideas,
and consequently is the connecting link between the Idea and [276]
the phenomenon, or the particular thing. Accordingly for both of
these reasons it is impossible that matter can for itself express any
Idea. This is confirmed a posteriori by the fact that it is impossible
to have a perceptible idea of matter as such, but only an abstract
conception; in the former, i.e., in perceptible ideas are exhibited
only the forms and qualities of which matter is the supporter,
and in all of which Ideas reveal themselves. This corresponds
also with the fact, that causality (the whole essence of matter)
cannot for itself be presented perceptibly, but is merely a definite
casual connection. On the other hand, every phenomenon of an
Idea, because as such it has entered the form of the principle of
sufficient reason, or the principium individuationis, must exhibit
itself in matter, as one of its qualities. So far then matter is,
282 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
as we have said, the connecting link between the Idea and the
principium individuationis, which is the form of knowledge of
the individual, or the principle of sufficient reason. Plato is
therefore perfectly right in his enumeration, for after the Idea
and the phenomenon, which include all other things in the world,
he gives matter only, as a third thing which is different from
both (Timaus, p. 345). The individual, as a phenomenon of
the Idea, is always matter. Every quality of matter is also the
phenomenon of an Idea, and as such it may always be an object of
æsthetic contemplation, i.e., the Idea expressed in it may always
be recognised. This holds good of even the most universal
qualities of matter, without which it never appears, and which
are the weakest objectivity of will. Such are gravity, cohesion,
rigidity, fluidity, sensitiveness to light, and so forth.
If now we consider architecture simply as a fine art and apart
from its application to useful ends, in which it serves the will
and not pure knowledge, and therefore ceases to be art in our
sense; we can assign to it no other aim than that of bringing to
greater distinctness some of those ideas, which are the lowest[277]
grades of the objectivity of will; such as gravity, cohesion,
rigidity, hardness, those universal qualities of stone, those first,
simplest, most inarticulate manifestations of will; the bass notes
of nature; and after these light, which in many respects is their
opposite. Even at these low grades of the objectivity of will we
see its nature revealing itself in discord; for properly speaking the
conflict between gravity and rigidity is the sole æsthetic material
of architecture; its problem is to make this conflict appear with
perfect distinctness in a multitude of different ways. It solves
it by depriving these indestructible forces of the shortest way
to their satisfaction, and conducting them to it by a circuitous
route, so that the conflict is lengthened and the inexhaustible
efforts of both forces become visible in many different ways.
The whole mass of the building, if left to its original tendency,
would exhibit a mere heap or clump, bound as closely as possible to the earth, to which gravity, the form in which the will appears
here, continually presses, while rigidity, also objectivity of will,
resists. But this very tendency, this effort, is hindered by
architecture from obtaining direct satisfaction, and only allowed
to reach it indirectly and by roundabout ways. The roof, for
example, can only press the earth through columns, the arch
must support itself, and can only satisfy its tendency towards the
earth through the medium of the pillars, and so forth. 

But just by
these enforced digressions, just by these restrictions, the forces
which reside in the crude mass of stone unfold themselves in
the most distinct and multifarious ways; and the purely æsthetic
aim of architecture can go no further than this. Therefore the
beauty, at any rate, of a building lies in the obvious adaptation
of every part, not to the outward arbitrary end of man (so far
the work belongs to practical architecture), but directly to the
stability of the whole, to which the position, dimensions, and
form of every part must have so necessary a relation that, where [278]
it is possible, if any one part were taken away, the whole would
fall to pieces. For just because each part bears just as much as it
conveniently can, and each is supported just where it requires to
be and just to the necessary extent, this opposition unfolds itself,
this conflict between rigidity and gravity, which constitutes the
life, the manifestation of will, in the stone, becomes completely
visible, and these lowest grades of the objectivity of will reveal
themselves distinctly. In the same way the form of each part
must not be determined arbitrarily, but by its end, and its relation
to the whole. 

The column is the simplest form of support,
determined simply by its end: the twisted column is tasteless; the
four-cornered pillar is in fact not so simple as the round column,
though it happens that it is easier to make it. The forms also
of frieze, rafter, roof, and dome are entirely determined by their
immediate end, and explain themselves from it. The decoration
of capitals, &c., belongs to sculpture, not to architecture, which
admits it merely as extraneous ornament, and could dispense with
284 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
it. According to what has been said, it is absolutely necessary, in
order to understand the æsthetic satisfaction afforded by a work
of architecture, to have immediate knowledge through perception
of its matter as regards its weight, rigidity, and cohesion, and our
pleasure in such a work would suddenly be very much diminished
by the discovery that the material used was pumice-stone; for
then it would appear to us as a kind of sham building. We
would be affected in almost the same way if we were told that
it was made of wood, when we had supposed it to be of stone,
just because this alters and destroys the relation between rigidity
and gravity, and consequently the significance and necessity of
all the parts, for these natural forces reveal themselves in a far
weaker degree in a wooden building. Therefore no real work
of architecture as a fine art can be made of wood, although it
assumes all forms so easily; this can only be explained by our[279]
theory. If we were distinctly told that a building, the sight of
which gave us pleasure, was made of different kinds of material
of very unequal weight and consistency, but not distinguishable
to the eye, the whole building would become as utterly incapable
of affording us pleasure as a poem in an unknown language. All
this proves that architecture does not affect us mathematically,
but also dynamically, and that what speaks to us through it,
is not mere form and symmetry, but rather those fundamental
forces of nature, those first Ideas, those lowest grades of the
objectivity of will. The regularity of the building and its parts is
partly produced by the direct adaptation of each member to the
stability of the whole, partly it serves to facilitate the survey and
comprehension of the whole, and finally, regular figures to some
extent enhance the beauty because they reveal the constitution of
space as such. But all this is of subordinate value and necessity,
and by no means the chief concern; indeed, symmetry is not
invariably demanded, as ruins are still beautiful.
Works of architecture have further quite a special relation to
light; they gain a double beauty in the full sunshine, with the blue sky as a background, and again they have quite a different effect
by moonlight. Therefore, when a beautiful work of architecture
is to be erected, special attention is always paid to the effects
of the light and to the climate. 

The reason of all this is, indeed,
principally that all the parts and their relations are only made
clearly visible by a bright, strong light; but besides this I am of
opinion that it is the function of architecture to reveal the nature
of light just as it reveals that of things so opposite to it as gravity
and rigidity. For the light is intercepted, confined, and reflected
by the great opaque, sharply outlined, and variously formed
masses of stone, and thus it unfolds its nature and qualities in the
purest and clearest way, to the great pleasure of the beholders,
for light is the most joy-giving of things, as the condition and [280]
the objective correlative of the most perfect kind of knowledge
of perception.
Now, because the Ideas which architecture brings to clear
perception, are the lowest grades of the objectivity of will,
and consequently their objective significance, which architecture
reveals to us, is comparatively small; the æsthetic pleasure of
looking at a beautiful building in a good light will lie, not so much
in the comprehension of the Idea, as in the subjective correlative
which accompanies this comprehension; it will consist pre-
eminently in the fact that the beholder, set free from the kind
of knowledge that belongs to the individual, and which serves
the will and follows the principle of sufficient reason, is raised
to that of the pure subject of knowing free from will. It will
consist then principally in pure contemplation itself, free from
all the suffering of will and of individuality. In this respect the
opposite of architecture, and the other extreme of the series of
the fine arts, is the drama, which brings to knowledge the most
significant Ideas. Therefore in the æsthetic pleasure afforded by
the drama the objective side is throughout predominant.
Architecture has this distinction from plastic art and poetry: it
does not give us a copy but the thing itself. It does not repeat,
286 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
as they do, the known Idea, so that the artist lends his eyes to
the beholder, but in it the artist merely presents the object to
the beholder, and facilitates for him the comprehension of the
Idea by bringing the actual, individual object to a distinct and
complete expression of its nature.
Unlike the works of the other arts, those of architecture are very
seldom executed for purely æsthetic ends. These are generally
subordinated to other useful ends which are foreign to art itself.
Thus the great merit of the architect consists in achieving and
attaining the pure æsthetic ends, in spite of their subordination to
other ends which are foreign to them. This he does by cleverly[281]
adapting them in a variety of ways to the arbitrary ends in view,
and by rightly judging which form of æsthetical architectonic
beauty is compatible and may be associated with a temple, which
with a palace, which with a prison, and so forth. The more a
harsh climate increases these demands of necessity and utility,
determines them definitely, and prescribes them more inevitably,
the less free play has beauty in architecture. In the mild climate of
India, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, where the demands of necessity
were fewer and less definite, architecture could follow its æsthetic
ends with the greatest freedom. But under a northern sky this
was sorely hindered. Here, when caissons, pointed roofs and
towers were what was demanded, architecture could only unfold
its own beauty within very narrow limits, and therefore it was
obliged to make amends by resorting all the more to the borrowed
ornaments of sculpture, as is seen in Gothic architecture.

We thus see that architecture is greatly restricted by the
demands of necessity and utility; but on the other hand it has in
them a very powerful support, for, on account of the magnitude
and costliness of its works, and the narrow sphere of its æsthetic
effect, it could not continue to exist merely as a fine art, if
it had not also, as a useful and necessary profession, a firm
and honourable place among the occupations of men. 

It is
the want of this that prevents another art from taking its place beside architecture as a sister art, although in an æsthetical point
of view it is quite properly to be classed along with it as its
counterpart; I mean artistic arrangements of water. For what
architecture accomplishes for the Idea of gravity when it appears
in connection with that of rigidity, hydraulics accomplishes
for the same Idea, when it is connected with fluidity, i.e.,
formlessness, the greatest mobility and transparency. Leaping
waterfalls foaming and tumbling over rocks, cataracts dispersed [282]
into floating spray, springs gushing up as high columns of water,
and clear reflecting lakes, reveal the Ideas of fluid and heavy
matter, in precisely the same way as the works of architecture
unfold the Ideas of rigid matter. Artistic hydraulics, however,
obtains no support from practical hydraulics, for, as a rule, their
ends cannot be combined; yet, in exceptional cases, this happens;
for example, in the Cascata di Trevi at Rome.
