Reason is a special faculty of knowledge belonging to man alone and the results and phenomena peculiar to human nature brought about by it, it still remains for me to speak of reason, so far as it is the guide of human action, and in this respect may be called practical.
 
But what there is to say upon this point has found its place elsewhere in the appendix to this work, where I controvert the existence of the so-called practical reason of Kant, which he (certainly very conveniently) explained as the immediate source of virtue, and as the seat of an absolute (i.e., fallen from heaven) imperative. The detailed and thorough refutation of this Kantian principle of morality I have given later in the “Fundamental Problems of Ethics.” There remains, therefore, but little for me to say here about the actual influence of reason, in the true sense of the word, upon action.

At the commencement of our treatment of reason we remarked, in general terms, how much the action and behaviour of men differs from that of brutes, and that this difference is to be regarded as entirely due to the presence of abstract concepts in consciousness. The influence of these upon our whole existence is so penetrating and significant that, on account of them, we are related to the lower animals very much as those animals that see are related to those that have no eyes (certain larvae, worms, and zoophytes). Animals without eyes know only by touch what is immediately present to them in space, what comes into contact with them; those which see, on the contrary, know a wide circle of near and distant objects. In the same way the absence of reason confines the lower animals to the ideas of perception, i.e., the real objects which are immediately present to them in time; we, on the contrary, on account of knowledge in the abstract, comprehend[111] not only the narrow actual present, but also the whole past and future, and the wide sphere of the possible; we view life freely on all its sides, and go far beyond the present and the actual.

Thus
what the eye is in space and for sensuous knowledge, reason is,
to a certain extent, in time and for inner knowledge. But as the
visibility of objects has its worth and meaning only in the fact that
it informs us of their tangibility, so the whole worth of abstract
knowledge always consists in its relation to what is perceived.
Therefore men naturally attach far more worth to immediate and
perceived knowledge than to abstract concepts, to that which is
merely thought; they place empirical knowledge before logical.

But this is not the opinion of men who live more in words than
in deeds, who have seen more on paper and in books than in
actual life, and who in their greatest degeneracy become pedants
and lovers of the mere letter. Thus only is it conceivable that
Leibnitz and Wolf and all their successors could go so far astray
as to explain knowledge of perception, after the example of Duns
Scotus, as merely confused abstract knowledge! To the honour
of Spinoza, I must mention that his truer sense led him, on the
contrary, to explain all general concepts as having arisen from
the confusion of that which was known in perception (Eth. II.,
prop. 40, Schol. 1). 

It is also a result of perverted opinion that in
mathematics the evidence proper to it was rejected, and logical
evidence alone accepted; that everything in general which was not abstract knowledge was comprehended under the wide name
of feeling, and consequently was little valued; and lastly that the
Kantian ethics regarded the good will which immediately asserts
itself upon knowledge of the circumstances, and guides to right
and good action as mere feeling and emotion, and consequently
as worthless and without merit, and would only recognise actions [112]
which proceed from abstract maxims as having moral worth.
The many-sided view of life as a whole which man, as
distinguished from the lower animals, possesses through reason,
may be compared to a geometrical, colourless, abstract, reduced
plan of his actual life. He, therefore, stands to the lower animals
as the navigator who, by means of chart, compass, and quadrant,
knows accurately his course and his position at any time upon the
sea, stands to the uneducated sailors who see only the waves and
the heavens. Thus it is worth noticing, and indeed wonderful,
how, besides his life in the concrete, man always lives another
life in the abstract. In the former he is given as a prey to all
the storms of actual life, and to the influence of the present; he
must struggle, suffer, and die like the brute. 

But his life in the
abstract, as it lies before his rational consciousness, is the still
reflection of the former, and of the world in which he lives; it is
just that reduced chart or plan to which we have referred. Here in
the sphere of quiet deliberation, what completely possessed him
and moved him intensely before, appears to him cold, colourless,
and for the moment external to him; he is merely the spectator,
the observer. In respect of this withdrawal into reflection he may
be compared to an actor who has played his part in one scene,
and who takes his place among the audience till it is time for
him to go upon the stage again, and quietly looks on at whatever
may happen, even though it be the preparation for his own death
(in the piece), but afterwards he again goes on the stage and
acts and suffers as he must. From this double life proceeds that
quietness peculiar to human beings, so very different from the
thoughtlessness of the brutes, and with which, in accordance with previous reflection, or a formed determination, or a recognised
necessity, a man suffers or accomplishes in cold blood, what
is of the utmost and often terrible importance to him; suicide,
execution, the duel, enterprises of every kind fraught with danger[113]
to life, and, in general, things against which his whole animal
nature rebels. Under such circumstances we see to what an extent
reason has mastered the animal nature, and we say to the strong:
√π¥∑¡μπøΩ Ω≈ ƒøπ !ƒø¡! (ferreum certe tibi cor), Il. 24, 521.
Here we can say truly that reason manifests itself practically, and
thus wherever action is guided by reason, where the motives are
abstract concepts, wherever we are not determined by particular
ideas of perception, nor by the impression of the moment which
guides the brutes, there practical reason shows itself. But I have
fully explained in the Appendix, and illustrated by examples,
that this is entirely different from and unrelated to the ethical
worth of actions; that rational action and virtuous action are
two entirely different things; that reason may just as well find
itself in connection with great evil as with great good, and by
its assistance may give great power to the one as well as to the
other; that it is equally ready and valuable for the methodical
and consistent carrying out of the noble and of the bad intention,
of the wise as of the foolish maxim; which all results from the
constitution of its nature, which is feminine, receptive, retentive,
and not spontaneous; all this I have shown in detail in the
Appendix, and illustrated by examples. What is said there would
have been placed here, but on account of my polemic against
Kant's pretended practical reason I have been obliged to relegate
it to the Appendix, to which I therefore refer.

The ideal explained in the Stoical philosophy is the most
complete development of practical reason in the true and genuine
sense of the word; it is the highest summit to which man can
attain by the mere use of his reason, and in it his difference from
the brutes shows itself most distinctly. For the ethics of Stoicism
are originally and essentially, not a doctrine of virtue, but merely a guide to a rational life, the end and aim of which is happiness
through peace of mind. Virtuous conduct appears in it as it [114]
were merely by accident, as the means, not as the end. Therefore
the ethical theory of Stoicism is in its whole nature and point of
view fundamentally different from the ethical systems which lay
stress directly upon virtue, such as the doctrines of the Vedas, of
Plato, of Christianity, and of Kant. The aim of Stoical ethics is
happiness: ƒμªø¬ ƒø μ≈¥±π ºøΩμπΩ (virtutes omnes finem habere
beatitudinem) it is called in the account of the Stoa by Stobæus
(Ecl., L. ii. c. 7, p. 114, and also p. 138). Yet the ethics of
Stoicism teach that happiness can only be attained with certainty
through inward peace and quietness of spirit (±ƒ±¡±æπ±), and
that this again can only be reached through virtue; this is the
whole meaning of the saying that virtue is the highest good. But
if indeed by degrees the end is lost sight of in the means, and
virtue is inculcated in a way which discloses an interest entirely
different from that of one's own happiness, for it contradicts this
too distinctly; this is just one of those inconsistencies by means of
which, in every system, the immediately known, or, as it is called,
felt truth leads us back to the right way in defiance of syllogistic
reasoning; as, for example, we see clearly in the ethical teaching
of Spinoza, which deduces a pure doctrine of virtue from the
egoistical suum utile quærere by means of palpable sophisms.
According to this, as I conceive the spirit of the Stoical ethics,
their source lies in the question whether the great prerogative of
man, reason, which, by means of planned action and its results,
relieves life and its burdens so much, might not also be capable
of freeing him at once, directly, i.e., through mere knowledge,
completely, or nearly so, of the sorrows and miseries of every
kind of which his life is full. They held that it was not in keeping
with the prerogative of reason that the nature given with it, which
by means of it comprehends and contemplates an infinity of
things and circumstances, should yet, through the present, and
the accidents that can be contained in the few years of a life that
132 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
is short, fleeting, and uncertain, be exposed to such intense pain,[115]
to such great anxiety and suffering, as arise from the tempestuous
strain of the desires and the antipathies; and they believed that
the due application of reason must raise men above them, and
can make them invulnerable. Therefore Antisthenes says: îμπ
∫ƒ±√∏±π Ωø≈Ω, ∑ ≤¡ø«øΩ (aut mentem parandam, aut laqueum.
Plut. de stoic. repugn., c. 14), i.e., life is so full of troubles
and vexations, that one must either rise above it by means of
corrected thoughts, or leave it. It was seen that want and suffering
did not directly and of necessity spring from not having, but from
desiring to have and not having; that therefore this desire to
have is the necessary condition under which alone it becomes a
privation not to have and begets pain. ü≈ ¿μΩπ± ª≈¿∑Ω μ¡≥±∂μƒ±π,
±ªª± μ¿π∏≈ºπ± (non paupertas dolorem efficit, sed cupiditas),
Epict., fragm. 25. Men learned also from experience that it is
only the hope of what is claimed that begets and nourishes the
wish; therefore neither the many unavoidable evils which are
common to all, nor unattainable blessings, disquiet or trouble us,
but only the trifling more or less of those things which we can
avoid or attain; indeed, not only what is absolutely unavoidable
or unattainable, but also what is merely relatively so, leaves us
quite undisturbed; therefore the ills that have once become joined
to our individuality, or the good things that must of necessity
always be denied us, are treated with indifference, in accordance
with the peculiarity of human nature that every wish soon dies
and can no more beget pain if it is not nourished by hope. 

It
followed from all this that happiness always depends upon the
proportion between our claims and what we receive. It is all
one whether the quantities thus related be great or small, and
the proportion can be established just as well by diminishing the
amount of the first as by increasing the amount of the second; and
in the same way it also follows that all suffering proceeds from
the want of proportion between what we demand and expect and what we get. Now this want of proportion obviously lies only in knowledge, and it could be entirely abolished through fuller
insight.24 Therefore Chrysippus says: ¥μπ ∂√Ω ∫±ƒΩ μº¿μπ¡π±Ω ƒ…Ω
∆≈√μπ √≈º≤±πΩøΩƒ…Ω (Stob. Ecl., L. ii. c. 7, p. 134), that is, one
ought to live with a due knowledge of the transitory nature of the
things of the world. 

For as often as a man loses self-command,
or is struck down by a misfortune, or grows angry, or becomes
faint-hearted, he shows that he finds things different from what
he expected, consequently that he was caught in error, and did
not know the world and life, did not know that the will of the
individual is crossed at every step by the chance of inanimate
nature and the antagonism of aims and the wickedness of other
individuals: he has therefore either not made use of his reason
in order to arrive at a general knowledge of this characteristic of
life, or he lacks judgment, in that he does not recognise in the
particular what he knows in general, and is therefore surprised
by it and loses his self-command.25 Thus also every keen
pleasure is an error and an illusion, for no attained wish can give
lasting satisfaction; and, moreover, every possession and every
happiness is but lent by chance for an uncertain time, and may
therefore be demanded back the next hour. 

All pain rests on the
passing away of such an illusion; thus both arise from defective
knowledge; the wise man therefore holds himself equally aloof
from joy and sorrow, and no event disturbs his ±ƒ±¡±æπ±.
In accordance with this spirit and aim of the Stoa, Epictetus
began and ended with the doctrine as the kernel of his philosophy, [117]
that we should consider well and distinguish what depends upon
us and what does not, and therefore entirely avoid counting

upon the latter, whereby we shall certainly remain free from all
pain, sorrow, and anxiety. But that which alone is dependent
upon us is the will; and here a transition gradually takes place
to a doctrine of virtue, for it is observed that as the outer
world, which is independent of us, determines good and bad
fortune, so inner contentment with ourselves, or the absence of
it, proceeds from the will. But it was then asked whether we
ought to apply the words bonum and malum to the two former
or to the two latter? This was indeed arbitrary and a matter of
choice, and did not make any real difference, but yet the Stoics
disputed everlastingly with the Peripatetics and Epicureans about
it, and amused themselves with the inadmissible comparison of
two entirely incommensurable quantities, and the antithetical,
paradoxical judgments which proceeded from them, and which
they flung at each other. The Paradoxa of Cicero afford us an
interesting collection of these from the Stoical side.

Zeno, the founder, followed a different path.

The starting-point with him was that for the attainment of the highest good, i.e., blessedness and spiritual
peace, one must live in harmony with oneself

Now this was only possible for a man if he determined
himself entirely rationally, according to concepts, not according
to changing impressions and moods; since, however, only the
maxims of our conduct, not the consequences nor the outward
circumstances, are in our power, in order to be always consistent
we must set before us as our aim only the maxims and not the[118]
consequences and circumstances, and thus again a doctrine of
virtue is introduced.

But the ethical principle of Zeno—to live in harmony with

oneself—appeared even to his immediate successors to be too
formal and empty. They therefore gave it material content by the
addition—“to live in harmony with nature” (Aºøªø≥ø≈ºμΩ…¬ ƒ√
∆≈√μπ ∂√Ω), which, as Stobæus mentions in another place, was
first added by Kleanthes, and extended the matter very much
on account of the wide sphere of the concept and the vagueness
of the expression. For Kleanthes meant the whole of nature
in general, while Chrysippus meant human nature in particular
(Diog. Laert., 7, 89). It followed that what alone was adapted
to the latter was virtue, just as the satisfaction of animal desires
was adapted to animal natures; and thus ethics had again to be
forcibly united to a doctrine of virtue, and in some way or other
established through physics. For the Stoics always aimed at unity
of principle, as for them God and the world were not dissevered.
The ethical system of Stoicism, regarded as a whole, is in fact
a very valuable and estimable attempt to use the great prerogative
of man, reason, for an important and salutary end; to raise him
above the suffering and pain to which all life is exposed, by
means of a maxim—

“Qua ratione queas traducere leniter œvum:
Ne te semper inops agitet vexetque cupido,
Ne pavor et rerum mediocriter utilium spes,”
and thus to make him partake, in the highest degree, of the
dignity which belongs to him as a rational being, as distinguished
from the brutes; a dignity of which, in this sense at any rate,
we can speak, though not in any other. It is a consequence
of my view of the ethical system of Stoicism that it must be
explained at the part of my work at which I consider what reason [119]
is and what it can do. But although it may to a certain extent
be possible to attain that end through the application of reason,
and through a purely rational system of ethics, and although
experience shows that the happiest men are those purely rational characters commonly called practical philosophers,—and rightly
so, because just as the true, that is, the theoretical philosopher
carries life into the concept, they carry the concept into life,—yet
it is far from the case that perfection can be attained in this
way, and that the reason, rightly used, can really free us from
the burden and sorrow of life, and lead us to happiness. 

Rather,
there lies an absolute contradiction in wishing to live without
suffering, and this contradiction is also implied in the commonly
used expression, “blessed life.” This will become perfectly clear
to whoever comprehends the whole of the following exposition.
In this purely rational system of ethics the contradiction reveals
itself thus, the Stoic is obliged in his doctrine of the way to the
blessed life (for that is what his ethical system always remains)
to insert a recommendation of suicide (as among the magnificent
ornaments and apparel of Eastern despots there is always a
costly vial of poison) for the case in which the sufferings of the
body, which cannot be philosophised away by any principles or
syllogistic reasonings, are paramount and incurable; thus its one
aim, blessedness, is rendered vain, and nothing remains as a mode
of escape from suffering except death; in such a case then death
must be voluntarily accepted, just as we would take any other
medicine. Here then a marked antagonism is brought out between
the ethical system of Stoicism and all those systems referred to
above which make virtue in itself directly, and accompanied by
the most grievous sorrows, their aim, and will not allow a man to
end his life in order to escape from suffering. Not one of them,
however, was able to give the true reason for the rejection of
suicide, but they laboriously collected illusory explanations from
all sides: the true reason will appear in the Fourth Book in the[120]
course of the development of our system. But the antagonism
referred to reveals and establishes the essential difference in
fundamental principle between Stoicism, which is just a special
form of endæmonism, and those doctrines we have mentioned,
although both are often at one in their results, and are apparently related. And the inner contradiction referred to above, with which
the ethical system of Stoicism is affected even in its fundamental
thought, shows itself further in the circumstance that its ideal,
the Stoic philosopher, as the system itself represents him, could
never obtain life or inner poetic truth, but remains a wooden,
stiff lay-figure of which nothing can be made. He cannot himself
make use of his wisdom, and his perfect peace, contentment, and
blessedness directly contradict the nature of man, and preclude
us from forming any concrete idea of him. 

When compared
with him, how entirely different appear the overcomers of the
world, and voluntary hermits that Indian philosophy presents
to us, and has actually produced; or indeed, the holy man of
Christianity, that excellent form full of deep life, of the greatest
poetic truth, and the highest significance, which stands before
us in perfect virtue, holiness, and sublimity, yet in a state of
supreme suffering.26
