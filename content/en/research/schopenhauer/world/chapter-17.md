Second Book. The World As Will.
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The
Will.

<!-- Nos habitat, non tartara, sed nec sidera coeli:
Spiritus, in nobis qui viget, illa facit. -->

Book 1 considered the idea in its general form.

It is true that as
far as the abstract idea, the concept, is concerned, we obtained
a knowledge of it in respect of its content also, because it has
content and meaning only in relation to the idea of perception,
without which it would be worthless and empty. 

Accordingly,
directing our attention exclusively to the idea of perception, we
shall now endeavour to arrive at a knowledge of its content, its
more exact definition, and the forms which it presents to us. And
it will specially interest us to find an explanation of its peculiar
significance, that significance which is otherwise merely felt, but
on account of which it is that these pictures do not pass by us
entirely strange and meaningless, as they must otherwise do, but
speak to us directly, are understood, and obtain an interest which
concerns our whole nature.

We direct our attention to mathematics, natural science, and
philosophy, for each of these holds out the hope that it will afford
us a part of the explanation we desire. Now, taking philosophy first, we find that it is like a monster with many heads, each of
which speaks a different language. They are not, indeed, all at
variance on the point we are here considering, the significance
of the idea of perception. For, with the exception of the Sceptics
and the Idealists, the others, for the most part, speak very much in
the same way of an object which constitutes the basis of the idea,
and which is indeed different in its whole being and nature from
the idea, but yet is in all points as like it as one egg is to another.

But this does not help us, for we are quite unable to distinguish
such an object from the idea; we find that they are one and the
same; for every object always and for ever presupposes a subject,
and therefore remains idea, so that we recognised objectivity
as belonging to the most universal form of the idea, which is
the division into subject and object. Further, the principle of
sufficient reason, which is referred to in support of this doctrine,
is for us merely the form of the idea, the orderly combination
of one idea with another, but not the combination of the whole
finite or infinite series of ideas with something which is not idea
at all, and which cannot therefore be presented in perception.
Of the Sceptics and Idealists we spoke above, in examining the
controversy about the reality of the outer world.

If we turn to mathematics to look for the fuller knowledge
we desire of the idea of perception, which we have, as yet,
only understood generally, merely in its form, we find that
mathematics only treats of these ideas so far as they fill time and
space, that is, so far as they are quantities. It will tell us with the
greatest accuracy the how-many and the how-much; but as this
is always merely relative, that is to say, merely a comparison of
one idea with others, and a comparison only in the one respect
of quantity, this also is not the information we are principally in
search of.

Lastly, if we turn to the wide province of natural science, which
is divided into many fields, we may, in the first place, make a
general division of it into two parts. It is either the description of forms, which I call Morphology, or the explanation of changes,
which I call Etiology. The first treats of the permanent forms,
the second of the changing matter, according to the laws of
its transition from one form to another. 

The first is the whole
extent of what is generally called natural history. It teaches us,
especially in the sciences of botany and zoology, the various[125]
permanent, organised, and therefore definitely determined forms
in the constant change of individuals; and these forms constitute
a great part of the content of the idea of perception. In natural
history they are classified, separated, united, arranged according
to natural and artificial systems, and brought under concepts
which make a general view and knowledge of the whole of
them possible. Further, an infinitely fine analogy both in the
whole and in the parts of these forms, and running through
them all (unité de plan), is established, and thus they may be
compared to innumerable variations on a theme which is not
given. 

The passage of matter into these forms, that is to say,
the origin of individuals, is not a special part of natural science,
for every individual springs from its like by generation, which is
everywhere equally mysterious, and has as yet evaded definite
knowledge. The little that is known on the subject finds its place
in physiology, which belongs to that part of natural science I have
called etiology. Mineralogy also, especially where it becomes
geology, inclines towards etiology, though it principally belongs
to morphology. Etiology proper comprehends all those branches
of natural science in which the chief concern is the knowledge
of cause and effect. The sciences teach how, according to an
invariable rule, one condition of matter is necessarily followed by
a certain other condition; how one change necessarily conditions
and brings about a certain other change; this sort of teaching is
called explanation. The principal sciences in this department are mechanics, physics, chemistry, and physiology.
If, however, we surrender ourselves to its teaching, we soon
become convinced that etiology cannot afford us the information we chiefly desire, any more than morphology. The latter presents
to us innumerable and infinitely varied forms, which are yet
related by an unmistakable family likeness. These are for us
ideas, and when only treated in this way, they remain always
strange to us, and stand before us like hieroglyphics which [126]
we do not understand. Etiology, on the other hand, teaches us
that, according to the law of cause and effect, this particular
condition of matter brings about that other particular condition,
and thus it has explained it and performed its part. However, it
really does nothing more than indicate the orderly arrangement
according to which the states of matter appear in space and time,
and teach in all cases what phenomenon must necessarily appear
at a particular time in a particular place. It thus determines the
position of phenomena in time and space, according to a law
whose special content is derived from experience, but whose
universal form and necessity is yet known to us independently of
experience. But it affords us absolutely no information about the
inner nature of any one of these phenomena: this is called a force
of nature, and it lies outside the province of causal explanation,
which calls the constant uniformity with which manifestations of
such a force appear whenever their known conditions are present,
a law of nature. 

But this law of nature, these conditions, and this
appearance in a particular place at a particular time, are all that it
knows or ever can know. The force itself which manifests itself,
the inner nature of the phenomena which appear in accordance
with these laws, remains always a secret to it, something entirely
strange and unknown in the case of the simplest as well as of
the most complex phenomena. For although as yet etiology
has most completely achieved its aim in mechanics, and least
completely in physiology, still the force on account of which a
stone falls to the ground or one body repels another is, in its inner
nature, not less strange and mysterious than that which produces
the movements and the growth of an animal. 

The science
of mechanics presupposes matter, weight, impenetrability, the possibility of communicating motion by impact, inertia and so
forth as ultimate facts, calls them forces of nature, and their
necessary and orderly appearance under certain conditions a[127]
law of nature. Only after this does its explanation begin, and
it consists in indicating truly and with mathematical exactness,
how, where and when each force manifests itself, and in referring
every phenomenon which presents itself to the operation of one
of these forces. 

Physics, chemistry, and physiology proceed in
the same way in their province, only they presuppose more and
accomplish less. Consequently the most complete etiological
explanation of the whole of nature can never be more than an
enumeration of forces which cannot be explained, and a reliable
statement of the rule according to which phenomena appear in
time and space, succeed, and make way for each other. 

But the
inner nature of the forces which thus appear remains unexplained
by such an explanation, which must confine itself to phenomena
and their arrangement, because the law which it follows does not
extend further. In this respect it may be compared to a section of
a piece of marble which shows many veins beside each other, but
does not allow us to trace the course of the veins from the interior
of the marble to its surface. 

Or, if I may use an absurd but more
striking comparison, the philosophical investigator must always
have the same feeling towards the complete etiology of the whole
of nature, as a man who, without knowing how, has been brought
into a company quite unknown to him, each member of which
in turn presents another to him as his friend and cousin, and
therefore as quite well known, and yet the man himself, while at
each introduction he expresses himself gratified, has always the
question on his lips: “But how the deuce do I stand to the whole
company?”

Thus we see that, with regard to those phenomena which we
know only as our ideas, etiology can never give us the desired
information that shall carry us beyond this point. 

For, after all its
explanations, they still remain quite strange to us, as mere ideas whose significance we do not understand. The causal connection [128]
merely gives us the rule and the relative order of their appearance
in space and time, but affords us no further knowledge of that
which so appears. Moreover, the law of causality itself has
only validity for ideas, for objects of a definite class, and it has
meaning only in so far as it presupposes them. 

Thus, like these
objects themselves, it always exists only in relation to a subject,
that is, conditionally; and so it is known just as well if we start
from the subject, i.e., a priori, as if we start from the object, i.e.,
a posteriori. Kant indeed has taught us this.

But what now impels us to inquiry is just that we are not
satisfied with knowing that we have ideas, that they are such and
such, and that they are connected according to certain laws, the
general expression of which is the principle of sufficient reason.

We wish to know the significance of these ideas; we ask whether
this world is merely idea; in which case it would pass by us like
an empty dream or a baseless vision, not worth our notice; or
whether it is also something else, something more than idea, and
if so, what. Thus much is certain, that this something we seek
for must be completely and in its whole nature different from
the idea; that the forms and laws of the idea must therefore be
completely foreign to it; further, that we cannot arrive at it from
the idea under the guidance of the laws which merely combine
objects, ideas, among themselves, and which are the forms of the
principle of sufficient reason.

Thus we can never arrive at the real nature of things from outside. 

<!-- However much we investigate, we can
never reach anything but images and names. We are like a man
who goes round a castle seeking in vain for an entrance, and
sometimes sketching the façades. And  -->

Yet this is the method that has been followed by all philosophers before me.
