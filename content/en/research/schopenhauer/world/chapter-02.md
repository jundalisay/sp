A subject is that which knows all things and is known by none.

Thus it is the supporter of the world, that condition of all phenomena, of all objects which is always pre-supposed
throughout experience; for all that exists, exists only for the
subject. Every one finds himself to be subject, yet only in so
far as he knows, not in so far as he is an object of knowledge.

But his body is object, and therefore from this point of view
we call it idea. For the body is an object among objects, and is
conditioned by the laws of objects, although it is an immediate
object. Like all objects of perception, it lies within the universal
forms of knowledge, time and space, which are the conditions of
multiplicity. The subject, on the contrary, which is always the
knower, never the known, does not come under these forms, but is presupposed by them; it has therefore neither multiplicity nor
its opposite unity. We never know it, but it is always the knower
wherever there is knowledge.

So then the world as idea, the only aspect in which we consider[006]
it at present, has two fundamental, necessary, and inseparable
halves. The one half is the object, the forms of which are space
and time, and through these multiplicity. The other half is the
subject, which is not in space and time, for it is present, entire and
undivided, in every percipient being. So that any one percipient
being, with the object, constitutes the whole world as idea just
as fully as the existing millions could do; but if this one were
to disappear, then the whole world as idea would cease to be.

These halves are therefore inseparable even for thought, for each
of the two has meaning and existence only through and for the
other, each appears with the other and vanishes with it. They
limit each other immediately; where the object begins the subject
ends. The universality of this limitation is shown by the fact
that the essential and hence universal forms of all objects, space,
time, and causality, may, without knowledge of the object, be
discovered and fully known from a consideration of the subject,
i.e., in Kantian language, they lie a priori in our consciousness.

That he discovered this is one of Kant's principal merits, and
it is a great one. I however go beyond this, and maintain that
the principle of sufficient reason is the general expression for all
these forms of the object of which we are a priori conscious;
and that therefore all that we know purely a priori, is merely
the content of that principle and what follows from it; in it all
our certain a priori knowledge is expressed. In my essay on the
principle of sufficient reason I have shown in detail how every
possible object comes under it; that is, stands in a necessary
relation to other objects, on the one side as determined, on the
other side as determining: this is of such wide application, that
the whole existence of all objects, so far as they are objects,
ideas and nothing more, may be entirely traced to this their necessary relation to each other, rests only in it, is in fact merely
relative; but of this more presently. I have further shown, that [007]
the necessary relation which the principle of sufficient reason
expresses generally, appears in other forms corresponding to
the classes into which objects are divided, according to their
possibility; and again that by these forms the proper division of
the classes is tested. I take it for granted that what I said in this
earlier essay is known and present to the reader, for if it had not
been already said it would necessarily find its place here.
