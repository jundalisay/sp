First, however, the following very essential remark. I
hope that in the preceding book I have succeeded in producing
the conviction that what is called in the Kantian philosophy the
thing-in-itself, and appears there as so significant, and yet so
obscure and paradoxical a doctrine, and especially on account
of the manner in which Kant introduced it as an inference from
the caused to the cause, was considered a stumbling-stone, and,
in fact, the weak side of his philosophy,—that this, I say, if it is
reached by the entirely different way by which we have arrived
at it, is nothing but the will when the sphere of that conception
is extended and defined in the way I have shown. 

I hope,
further, that after what has been said there will be no hesitation in
recognising the definite grades of the objectification of the will,
which is the inner reality of the world, to be what Plato called the
eternal Ideas or unchangeable forms (μπ¥∆); a doctrine which is regarded as the principal, but at the same time the most obscure
and paradoxical dogma of his system, and has been the subject
of reflection and controversy of ridicule and of reverence to so
many and such differently endowed minds in the course of many
centuries.

If now the will is for us the thing-in-itself, and the Idea is
the immediate objectivity of that will at a definite grade, we
find that Kant's thing-in-itself, and Plato's Idea, which to him
is the only øΩƒ…¬ øΩ, these two great obscure paradoxes of the
two greatest philosophers of the West are not indeed identical,
but yet very closely related, and only distinguished by a single
circumstance. 

The purport of these two great paradoxes, with
all inner harmony and relationship, is yet so very different on
account of the remarkable diversity of the individuality of their
authors, that they are the best commentary on each other, for they
are like two entirely different roads that conduct us to the same
goal. This is easily made clear. What Kant says is in substance
this:—“Time, space, and causality are not determinations of the
thing-in-itself, but belong only to its phenomenal existence, for
they are nothing but the forms of our knowledge. Since, however,
all multiplicity, and all coming into being and passing away, are
only possible through time, space, and causality, it follows that
they also belong only to the phenomenon, not to the thing-in-
itself. But as our knowledge is conditioned by these forms, the
whole of experience is only knowledge of the phenomenon, not
of the thing-in-itself; therefore its laws cannot be made valid for
the thing-in-itself. This extends even to our own ego, and we
know it only as phenomenon, and not according to what it may be
in itself.” This is the meaning and content of the doctrine of Kant
in the important respect we are considering. What Plato says is
this:—“The things of this world which our senses perceive have
no true being; they always become, they never are: they have
only a relative being; they all exist merely in and through their
relations to each other; their whole being may, therefore, quite as well be called a non-being. They are consequently not objects of
a true knowledge (μ¿π√ƒ∑º∑), for such a knowledge can only be
of what exists for itself, and always in the same way; they, on the
contrary, are only the objects of an opinion based on sensation
(¥øæ± ºμƒΩ ±π√∏∑√μ…¬ ±ªø≥ø≈). So long as we are confined to the
perception of these, we are like men who sit in a dark cave, bound
so fast that they cannot turn their heads, and who see nothing but
the shadows of real things which pass between them and a fire
burning behind them, the light of which casts the shadows on the
wall opposite them; and even of themselves and of each other
they see only the shadows on the wall. 

Their wisdom would
thus consist in predicting the order of the shadows learned from
experience. The real archetypes, on the other hand, to which
these shadows correspond, the eternal Ideas, the original forms
of all things, can alone be said to have true being (øΩƒ…¬ øΩ),
because they always are, but never become nor pass away. To
them belongs no multiplicity; for each of them is according to
its nature only one, for it is the archetype itself, of which all
particular transitory things of the same kind which are named
after it are copies or shadows. They have also no coming into
being nor passing away, for they are truly being, never becoming
nor vanishing, like their fleeting shadows. (It is necessarily
presupposed, however, in these two negative definitions, that
time, space, and causality have no significance or validity for
these Ideas, and that they do not exist in them.) Of these only can
there be true knowledge, for the object of such knowledge can
only be that which always and in every respect (thus in-itself) is;
not that which is and again is not, according as we look at it.”
This is Plato's doctrine. It is clear, and requires no further proof
that the inner meaning of both doctrines is entirely the same;
that both explain the visible world as a manifestation, which in
itself is nothing, and which only has meaning and a borrowed
reality through that which expresses itself in it (in the one case
the thing-in-itself, in the other the Idea). 

To this last, which has true being, all the forms of that phenomenal existence, even the [223]
most universal and essential, are, according to both doctrines,
entirely foreign. In order to disown these forms Kant has directly
expressed them even in abstract terms, and distinctly refused
time, space, and causality as mere forms of the phenomenon to
the thing-in-itself. Plato, on the other hand, did not attain to the
fullest expression, and has only distinctly refused these forms
to his Ideas in that he denies of the Ideas what is only possible
through these forms, multiplicity of similar things, coming into
being and passing away. 

Though it is perhaps superfluous, I
should like to illustrate this remarkable and important agreement
by an example. There stands before us, let us suppose, an animal
in the full activity of life. Plato would say, “This animal has
no true existence, but merely an apparent existence, a constant
becoming, a relative existence which may just as well be called
non-being as being. Only the Idea which expresses itself in
that animal is truly ‘being,’ or the animal in-itself (±≈ƒø ƒø
∏∑¡πøΩ), which is dependent upon nothing, but is in and for
itself (∫±∏Ω ±≈ƒø, ±μπ a¬ ±≈ƒ…¬); it has not become, it will not
end, but always is in the same way (±μπ øΩ, ∫±π º∑¥μ¿øƒμ ø≈ƒμ
≥≈≥ΩøºμΩøΩ ø≈ƒμ ±¿øªª≈ºμΩøΩ). If now we recognise its Idea
in this animal, it is all one and of no importance whether we
have this animal now before us or its progenitor of a thousand
years ago, whether it is here or in a distant land, whether it
presents itself in this or that manner, position, or action; whether,
lastly, it is this or any other individual of the same species; all
this is nothing, and only concerns the phenomenon; the Idea
of the animal alone has true being, and is the object of real
knowledge.” 

So Plato; Kant would say something of this kind,
“This animal is a phenomenon in time, space, and causality,
which are collectively the conditions a priori of the possibility of
experience, lying in our faculty of knowledge, not determinations
of the thing-in-itself. Therefore this animal as we perceive it
at this definite point of time, in this particular place, as an individual in the connection of experience (i.e., in the chain of
causes and effects), which has come into being, and will just as
necessarily pass away, is not a thing-in-itself, but a phenomenon
which only exists in relation to our knowledge. To know it as
what it may be in itself, that is to say, independent of all the
determinations which lie in time, space, and causality, would
demand another kind of knowledge than that which is possible
for us through the senses and the understanding.”

In order to bring Kant's mode of expression nearer the Platonic,
we might say: Time, space, and causality are that arrangement
of our intellect by virtue of which the one being of each kind
which alone really is, manifests itself to us as a multiplicity of
similar beings, constantly appearing and disappearing in endless
succession. The apprehension of things by means of and in
accordance with this arrangement is immanent knowledge; that,
on the other hand, which is conscious of the true state of the case,
is transcendental knowledge. The latter is obtained in abstracto
through the criticism of pure reason, but in exceptional cases it
may also appear intuitively. This last is an addition of my own,
which I am endeavouring in this Third Book to explain.

If the doctrine of Kant had ever been properly understood
and grasped, and since Kant's time that of Plato, if men had
truly and earnestly reflected on the inner meaning and content
of the teaching of these two great masters, instead of involving
themselves in the technicalities of the one and writing parodies
of the style of the other, they could not have failed to discern long
ago to what an extent these two great philosophers agree, and
that the true meaning, the aim of both systems, is the same. Not
only would they have refrained from constantly comparing Plato
to Leibnitz, on whom his spirit certainly did not rest, or indeed to
a well-known gentleman who is still alive,44 as if they wanted to mock the manes of the great thinker of the past; but they would have advanced much farther in general, or rather they would not have fallen so disgracefully far behind as they have in the last
forty years. They would not have let themselves be led by the
nose, to-day by one vain boaster and to-morrow by another, nor
would they have opened the nineteenth century, which promised
so much in Germany, with the philosophical farces that were
performed over the grave of Kant (as the ancients sometimes
did at the funeral obsequies of their dead), and which deservedly
called forth the derision of other nations, for such things least
become the earnest and strait-laced German. 

But so small is
the chosen public of true philosophers, that even students who
understand are but scantily brought them by the centuries—ïπ√π

Men followed the words,—such words as “a priori ideas,”
“forms of perception and thought existing in consciousness
independently of experience,” “fundamental conceptions of the
pure understanding,” &c., &c.,—and asked whether Plato's Ideas,
which were also original conceptions, and besides this were
supposed to be reminiscences of a perception before life of the
truly real things, were in some way the same as Kant's forms of
perception and thought, which lie a priori in our consciousness.

On account of some slight resemblance in the expression of these
two entirely different doctrines, the Kantian doctrine of the forms
which limit the knowledge of the individual to the phenomenon,
and the Platonic doctrine of Ideas, the knowledge of which these [226]
very forms expressly deny, these so far diametrically opposed
doctrines were carefully compared, and men deliberated and
disputed as to whether they were identical, found at last that they
were not the same, and concluded that Plato's doctrine of Ideas and Kant's “Critique of Reason” had nothing in common. But
enough of this.
