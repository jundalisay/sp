<!-- First Book. The World As Idea.

First Aspect. The Idea Subordinated To The Principle Of Sufficient Reason: The Object
Of Experience And Science. -->

—Jean Jacques Rousseau. -->


“The world is my idea.”

This is a truth which is true for every conscious being that lives and knows.

Though man alone can bring it into reflective and abstract consciousness. 

Converting undefined perceptions into defined ideas is philosophical wisdom.

This conversion to idea makes it clear to him that:
- what he knows is not a sun and an earth, but only:
  - an eye that sees a sun
  - a hand that feels an earth
- his world is only idea
- his world is only in relation to his consciousness 

The only a priori truth is that idea is the expression of the most general form real and mental experience.

This form of experience is more general than time, space, or causality which presuppose idea. 

Time, space, and causality are just:
- modes of the principle of sufficient reason
- valid only for a particular class of ideas

Whereas all ideas are in object and subject.

 <!-- is the common form of all these classes, is that form under which alone any idea of whatever kind it may be, abstract or intuitive, pure or empirical, is possible and thinkable. -->

Therefore is most certain truth is that everything, as the world, is the object of the subject, as idea.

<!-- , more independent of all others, and less in need of proof than this, that all that exists for knowledge, and therefore this whole world, is only object in relation to subject, perception of a perceiver, in a word, idea.  -->

This is true of:
- past, present, and future
- near, far

It is true of time and space themselves, in which alone these distinctions arise. 

Anything in the world is conditioned through the subject, and exists only for the subject.

The world is idea.

This truth is not new. 

It was implicitly involved in the sceptical reflections begun by Descartes. 

Berkeley was the first who distinctly enunciate it.

 <!-- and by this he has rendered a permanent service to philosophy, even though the rest of his teaching should not endure.  -->

Kant's primary mistake was the neglect of this principle.

 as is shown in the appendix. How early again this truth was recognised by the wise men of India, appearing indeed as the fundamental tenet of the

 <!-- is pointed out by Sir William Jones in the last of his essays: “On the philosophy of the Asiatics” (Asiatic Researches, vol. iv. p. 164), where he says, “The fundamental tenet of the Vedanta school consisted not in denying the existence of matter, that is, of solidity, impenetrability, and extended figure (to deny which would be lunacy), but in correcting the popular notion of it, and in contending that it has no essence independent of mental perception; that existence and perceptibility are convertible terms.” These words adequately express the compatibility of empirical reality and transcendental ideality. -->

Book 1 considers the world only as idea. 

<!-- The inward reluctance with which
any one accepts the world as merely his idea, warns him that
this view of it, however true it may be, is nevertheless  -->

People avoid this truth because it is one-sided as some arbitrary abstraction. 

<!-- And yet
it is a conception from which he can never free himself.  -->

<!-- The defectiveness of this view will be corrected in the next book by
means of a truth which is not so immediately certain as that from
which we start here; a truth at which we can arrive only by deeper
research and more severe abstraction, by the separation of what
is different and the union of what is identical.  -->

<!-- This truth, which must be very serious and impressive if not awful to every one, is
that a man can also say and must say,  -->

I address this objection with “the world is my will.”

<!-- In this book, however, we must consider separately that aspect of the world from which we start, its aspect as knowable, and therefore, in the meantime, we must, without reserve, regard all presented objects, even our own bodies (as we shall presently show more fully), merely as ideas, and call them merely ideas. By so doing we always abstract from will (as we hope to make clear to every one further on), which by itself constitutes the other aspect of the world. For as the world is in one aspect entirely idea, so in another it is entirely will. A reality which is neither of these two, but an object in itself (into which the thing in itself has unfortunately dwindled in the hands of Kant), is the phantom of a dream, and its acceptance is an ignis fatuus in philosophy. -->
