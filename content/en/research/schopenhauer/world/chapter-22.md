If we are to think as an object this thing-in-itself (I retain the Kantian expression as a standing formula), which, as such, is never object, because all object is its mere manifestation, and therefore cannot be it itself, we must borrow for it the name and concept of an object, of something in some way objectively given, consequently of one of its own manifestations. 

But in order to serve as a clue for the understanding, this can be no other than the most complete of all its manifestations, i.e., the most distinct, the most developed, and directly enlightened by knowledge. Now this is the human will. It is, however, well to observe that here, at any rate, we only make use of a denominatio a potiori, through which, therefore, the concept of will receives a greater extension than it has hitherto had.

Knowledge of the identical in different phenomena, and of difference in similar phenomena, is, as Plato so often remarks, a sine qua non of philosophy. But hitherto it was not recognised that every kind of active and operating force in nature is essentially identical with will, and therefore the multifarious kinds of phenomena were not seen to be merely different species of the same genus, but were treated as heterogeneous.

Consequently there could be no word to denote the concept of this genus. I therefore name the genus after its most important species, the direct knowledge of which lies nearer to us and guides us to the indirect knowledge of all other species. But whoever is incapable of carrying out the required extension of the concept will remain involved in a permanent misunderstanding. For by the word will he understands only that species of it which has hitherto been exclusively denoted by it, the will which is guided by knowledge,[144] and whose manifestation follows only upon motives, and indeed merely abstract motives, and thus takes place under the guidance of the reason.

This is only the most prominent
example of the manifestation of will. We must now distinctly
separate in thought the inmost essence of this manifestation
which is known to us directly, and then transfer it to all the
weaker, less distinct manifestations of the same nature, and thus
we shall accomplish the desired extension of the concept of will.
From another point of view I should be equally misunderstood by
any one who should think that it is all the same in the end whether
we denote this inner nature of all phenomena by the word will
or by any other. This would be the case if the thing-in-itself
were something whose existence we merely inferred, and thus
knew indirectly and only in the abstract. Then, indeed, we might
call it what we pleased; the name would stand merely as the
symbol of an unknown quantity. But the word will, which, like
a magic spell, discloses to us the inmost being of everything in
nature, is by no means an unknown quantity, something arrived
at only by inference, but is fully and immediately comprehended,
and is so familiar to us that we know and understand what will
is far better than anything else whatever. 

The concept of will has hitherto commonly been subordinated to that of force, but I
reverse the matter entirely, and desire that every force in nature
should be thought as will. It must not be supposed that this is
mere verbal quibbling or of no consequence; rather, it is of the
greatest significance and importance. For at the foundation of
the concept of force, as of all other concepts, there ultimately
lies the knowledge in sense-perception of the objective world,
that is to say, the phenomenon, the idea; and the concept is
constructed out of this. 

It is an abstraction from the province
in which cause and effect reign, i.e., from ideas of perception,
and means just the causal nature of causes at the point at which [145]
this causal nature is no further etiologically explicable, but is
the necessary presupposition of all etiological explanation. The
concept will, on the other hand, is of all possible concepts the
only one which has its source not in the phenomenal, not in the
mere idea of perception, but comes from within, and proceeds
from the most immediate consciousness of each of us, in which
each of us knows his own individuality, according to its nature,
immediately, apart from all form, even that of subject and object,
and which at the same time is this individuality, for here the
subject and the object of knowledge are one. If, therefore, we
refer the concept of force to that of will, we have in fact referred
the less known to what is infinitely better known; indeed, to
the one thing that is really immediately and fully known to
us, and have very greatly extended our knowledge. If, on the
contrary, we subsume the concept of will under that of force, as
has hitherto always been done, we renounce the only immediate
knowledge which we have of the inner nature of the world, for
we allow it to disappear in a concept which is abstracted from the
phenomenal, and with which we can therefore never go beyond
the phenomenal.
