<!-- From our exposition of eternal justice, which is
not mythical but philosophical, we will now proceed to the
kindred investigation of the ethical significance of conduct and
of conscience, which is the merely felt knowledge of that
significance.  -->


What is the nature of that eternal justice?

Human nature has 2 peculiarities that make us obscurely feel:
- eternal justice
- the unity and identity of the will

<!--  in all its phenomena upon which it rests, is
known to every one, at least as an . -->

When a bad deed has been done, it affords satisfaction not only
to the sufferer, who for the most part feels the desire of revenge, but also to the perfectly indifferent spectator, to see that he who
caused another pain suffers himself a like measure of pain.

This quite independently of the end which we have shown the state
has in view in punishment, and which is the foundation of penal
law. It seems to me that what expresses itself here is nothing but
the consciousness of that eternal justice, which is, nevertheless,
at once misunderstood and falsified by the unenlightened mind,
for, involved in the principium individuationis, it produces an
amphiboly of the concepts and demands from the phenomenon
what only belongs to the thing in itself. 

It does not see how
far in themselves the offender and the offended are one, and
that it is the same being which, not recognising itself in its
own manifestation, bears both the pain and the guilt, but it
desires rather to see the pain also in the particular individual to
whom the guilt belongs. Therefore, most persons would demand
that a man who had a very high degree of wickedness which
might yet occur in many others, only not matched with other
qualities such as are found in him, a man who also far surpassed
others by extraordinary intellectual powers, and who inflicted[462]
unspeakable sufferings upon millions of others—for example,
as a conqueror,—most persons, I say, would demand that such
a man should at some time and in some place expiate all these
sufferings by a like amount of pain; for they do not recognise
how in themselves the inflicter of suffering and the sufferers are
one, and that it is the same will through which the latter exist
and live which also appears in the former, and just through him
attains to a distinct revelation of its nature, and which likewise
suffers both in the oppressed and the oppressor; and indeed in
the latter in a greater measure, as the consciousness has attained
a higher degree of clearness and distinctness and the will has
greater vehemence. But that the deeper knowledge, which is no
longer involved in the principium individuationis, from which all
virtue and nobleness proceed, no longer retains the disposition
which demands requital, is shown by the Christian ethics, which absolutely forbids all requital of evil with evil, and allows eternal
justice to proceed in the sphere of the thing-in-itself, which is
different from that of the phenomenon. (“Vengeance is mine; I
will repay, saith the Lord,”—Rom. xii. 19.)

A much more striking, but also a much rarer, characteristic
of human nature, which expresses that desire to draw eternal
justice into the province of experience, i.e., of individuality, and
at the same time indicates a felt consciousness that, as I have
expressed it above, the will to live conducts at its own cost the
great tragedy and comedy, and that the same one will lives in
all manifestations,—such a characteristic, I say, is the following.
We sometimes see a man so deeply moved by a great injury
which he has experienced, or, it may be, only witnessed, that he
deliberately and irretrievably stakes his own life in order to take
vengeance on the perpetrator of that wrong. We see him seek
for some mighty oppressor through long years, murder him at
last, and then himself die on the scaffold, as he had foreseen, [463]
and often, it may be, did not seek to avoid, for his life had value
for him only as a means of vengeance. We find examples of
this especially among the Spaniards.78 If, now, we consider the
spirit of that desire for retribution carefully, we find that it is
very different from common revenge, which seeks to mitigate
the suffering, endured by the sight of the suffering inflicted;
indeed, we find that what it aims at deserves to be called, not
so much revenge as punishment. For in it there really lies the
intention of an effect upon the future through the example, and
that without any selfish aim, either for the avenging person, for
it costs him his life, or for a society which secures its own safety
by laws. For that punishment is carried out by individuals, not
by the state, nor is it in fulfilment of a law, but, on the contrary,

<!-- 78 That Spanish bishop who, in the last war, poisoned both himself and the
French generals at his own table, is an instance of this; and also various
incidents in that war. Examples are also to be found in Montaigne, Bk. ii. ch. -->

always concerns a deed which the state either would not or
could not punish, and the punishment of which it condemns. It
seems to me that the indignation which carries such a man so
far beyond the limits of all self-love springs from the deepest
consciousness that he himself is the whole will to live, which
appears in all beings through all time, and that therefore the most
distant future belongs to him just as the present, and cannot be
indifferent to him. Asserting this will, he yet desires that in the
drama which represents its nature no such fearful wrong shall
ever appear again, and wishes to frighten ever future wrong-doer
by the example of a vengeance against which there is no means
of defence, since the avenger is not deterred by the fear of
death. The will to live, though still asserting itself, does not
here depend any longer upon the particular phenomenon, the
individual, but comprehends the Idea of man, and wishes to keep
its manifestation pure from such a fearful and shocking wrong.
It is a rare, very significant, and even sublime trait of character[464]
through which the individual sacrifices himself by striving to
make himself the arm of eternal justice, of the true nature of
which he is yet ignorant.
