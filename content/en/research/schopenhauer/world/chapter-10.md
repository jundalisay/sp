How is certainty to be attained?

How judgments are to be established?

What constitutes rational knowledge and science, which we rank with language and deliberate action as
the third great benefit conferred by reason?

Reason is feminine. It can only give after it has received. 

Of itself it has nothing but the empty forms of its
operation. 

There is no absolutely pure rational knowledge except
the four principles to which I have attributed metalogical truth;
the principles of identity, contradiction, excluded middle, and
sufficient reason of knowledge. 

For even the rest of logic is not
absolutely pure rational knowledge. 

It presupposes the relations
and the combinations of the spheres of concepts. But concepts
in general only exist after experience of ideas of perception,
and as their whole nature consists in their relation to these, it is
clear that they presuppose them. 

No special content, however,
is presupposed, but merely the existence of a content generally,
and so logic as a whole may fairly pass for pure rational science.
In all other sciences reason has received its content from ideas of
perception; in mathematics from the relations of space and time,
presented in intuition or perception prior to all experience; in pure
natural science, that is, in what we know of the course of nature
prior to any experience, the content of the science proceeds from
the pure understanding, i.e., from the a priori knowledge of the law of causality and its connection with those pure intuitions or
perceptions of space and time. In all other sciences everything that
is not derived from the sources we have just referred to belongs
to experience. 

Speaking generally, to know rationally (wissen)
means to have in the power of the mind, and capable of being
reproduced at will, such judgments as have their sufficient ground
of knowledge in something outside themselves, i.e., are true. Thus
only abstract cognition is rational knowledge (wissen), which is
therefore the result of reason, so that we cannot accurately
say of the lower animals that they rationally know (wissen) [066]
anything, although they have apprehension of what is presented
in perception, and memory of this, and consequently imagination,
which is further proved by the circumstance that they dream.
We attribute consciousness to them, and therefore although the
word (bewusstsein) is derived from the verb to know rationally
(wissen), the conception of consciousness corresponds generally
with that of idea of whatever kind it may be. Thus we attribute life
to plants, but not consciousness. Rational knowledge (wissen)
is therefore abstract consciousness, the permanent possession in
concepts of the reason, of what has become known in another
way.
