The chief distinction among our ideas is that between:
- ideas of perception and
- abstract ideas

The latter form just one
class of ideas, namely concepts, and these are the possession of
man alone of all creatures upon earth. 

The capacity for these, which distinguishes him from all the lower animals, has always been called reason.5 We shall consider these abstract ideas by themselves later, but, in the first place, we shall speak exclusively of the ideas of perception. These comprehend the whole visible world, or the sum total of experience, with the conditions of its possibility.

It is a highly important discovery of Kant's, that these very conditions, these forms of the visible world, i.e., the absolutely universal element in its perception, the common property of all its phenomena, space and time, even when taken by themselves and apart from their content, can, not only be thought in the abstract, but also be directly perceived; and that this perception or intuition is not some kind of phantasm arising from constant recurrence in experience, but is so entirely independent of experience that we must rather regard the latter as dependent on it, inasmuch as the qualities of space and time, as they are known in a priori perception or intuition, are valid for all possible experience, as rules to which it must invariably conform.

Accordingly, in

<!-- 5 Kant is the only writer who has confused this idea of reason, and in this
connection I refer the reader to the Appendix, and also to my “Grundprobleme
der Ethik”: Grundl. dd. Moral. § 6, pp. 148-154, first and second editions.  -->

my essay on the principle of sufficient reason, I have treated[008]
space and time, because they are perceived as pure and empty of
content, as a special and independent class of ideas. This quality
of the universal forms of intuition, which was discovered by
Kant, that they may be perceived in themselves and apart from
experience, and that they may be known as exhibiting those laws
on which is founded the infallible science of mathematics, is
certainly very important. Not less worthy of remark, however, is
this other quality of time and space, that the principle of sufficient
reason, which conditions experience as the law of causation and
of motive, and thought as the law of the basis of judgment,
appears here in quite a special form, to which I have given the
name of the ground of being. In time, this is the succession
of its moments, and in space the position of its parts, which
reciprocally determine each other ad infinitum.

Any one who has fully understood from the introductory essay
the complete identity of the content of the principle of sufficient
reason in all its different forms, must also be convinced of the
importance of the knowledge of the simplest of these forms, as
affording him insight into his own inmost nature. This simplest
form of the principle we have found to be time. 

In it each
instant is, only in so far as it has effaced the preceding one, its
generator, to be itself in turn as quickly effaced. The past and the
future (considered apart from the consequences of their content)
are empty as a dream, and the present is only the indivisible
and unenduring boundary between them. 

In all the other
forms of the principle of sufficient reason, we shall find the same
emptiness, and shall see that not time only but also space, and the
whole content of both of them, i.e., all that proceeds from causes
and motives, has a merely relative existence, is only through and
for another like to itself, i.e., not more enduring. The substance
of this doctrine is old: it appears in Heraclitus when he laments
the eternal flux of things; in Plato when he degrades the object[009]
to that which is ever becoming, but never being; in Spinoza as the doctrine of the mere accidents of the one substance which
is and endures. Kant opposes what is thus known as the mere
phenomenon to the thing in itself. 

Lastly, the ancient wisdom
of the Indian philosophers declares, “It is Mâyâ, the veil of
deception, which blinds the eyes of mortals, and makes them
behold a world of which they cannot say either that it is or that
it is not: for it is like a dream; it is like the sunshine on the sand
which the traveller takes from afar for water, or the stray piece
of rope he mistakes for a snake.” (These similes are repeated in
innumerable passages of the Vedas and the Puranas.) But what
all these mean, and that of which they all speak, is nothing more
than what we have just considered—the world as idea subject to
the principle of sufficient reason.
