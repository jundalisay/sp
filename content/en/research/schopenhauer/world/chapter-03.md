The chief distinction among our ideas is that between:

1. abstract ideas

These abstract ideas form concepts. 

Concepts are a class of ideas which only man has.

The capacity for concepts is 'reason'.5 


2. ideas of perception

These comprehend the whole visible world, or all of experience, with the conditions of its possibility.

Kant made the important discovery of them that these ideas of perception:
- are absolutely universal
- have space and time as their common property
- can be thought in the abstract yet also be directly perceived

 time, even when taken by themselves and apart from their content, can, not only ; and that 

 This perception or intuition is independent of experience.

 Experience is dependent on perception. 

<!--  not some kind of phantasm arising from constant recurrence in experience, but is so entirely 

  that we must rather regard the latter as dependent on it, inasmuch as 
, as they are known in a priori perception or intuition, are -->

Thia makes the qualities of [abstract] space and time valid for all possible experience, as rules to which it must invariably conform.


<!-- 5 Kant is the only writer who has confused this idea of reason, and in this
connection I refer the reader to the Appendix, and also to my “Grundprobleme
der Ethik”: Grundl. dd. Moral. § 6, pp. 148-154, first and second editions.  -->

<!-- my essay on the principle of sufficient reason -->

I wrote that space and time are perceived as pure and empty of content, as a special and independent class of ideas. 

This quality of the universal forms of intuition was discovered by Kant.

They may be:
- perceived in themselves separate from experience
- known as exhibiting those laws that is the basis of mathematics

This is very important.

Not less worthy of remark, however, is
this other quality of time and space, that the 

My principle of sufficient reason says that:
- experience follows the:
  - law of causation, and 
  - law of motive
- thought is the basis of judgment


<!-- appears here in quite a special form, to which I have given the
name of --> 

I call experience as the 'ground of being'. 

- In time, this ground of being is the succession of its moments
- In space, this ground of being is the position of its parts
  - These parts reciprocally determine each other infinitely.

<!-- Any one who has fully understood from the introductory essay
the complete identity of the content of the principle of sufficient
reason in all its different forms, must also be convinced of the
importance of the knowledge of the simplest of these forms, as
affording him insight into his own inmost nature.  -->

This simplest form of my principle of sufficient reason is time. 

In time, each instant is a generator of the next one just as it is quickly effaced.

<!-- , only in so far as it has effaced the preceding one, its
generator, to be itself in turn as  The past and the
future (considered apart from the consequences of their content)
are empty as a dream, and the present is only the indivisible
and unenduring boundary between them.  -->

The other forms of the principle of sufficient reason have the same emptiness.

Both , and 

The whole content of time and space:
- is made up of effects from causes and motives.
- has a merely relative existence
- are not more enduring

<!-- is only through and
for another like to itself, i.e.,  -->

The substance of this doctrine is old: it appears in 

Heraclitus had this idea when he laments the eternal flux of things

Plato had this idea when he degrades the object to that which is ever becoming, but never being.

Spinoza had this idea as the doctrine of the mere accidents of the one substance which is and endures.

Kant opposes what is thus known as the mere phenomenon to the thing in itself. 

The Indian philosophers declares “It is Mâyâ which blinds mortals and makes them behold a world that either exists or not. It is like a dream."

<!-- ; it is like the sunshine on the sand
which the traveller takes from afar for water, or the stray piece
of rope he mistakes for a snake.”  -->

<!-- (These similes are repeated in innumerable passages of the Vedas and the Puranas.) But what
all these mean, and that of which they all speak, is nothing more
than what we have just considered— -->


They all refer to the the world being an idea subject to the principle of sufficient reason.
