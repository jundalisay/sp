The great problem of historical painting and sculpture
is to express directly and for perception the Idea in which
the will reaches the highest grade of its objectification. The
objective side of the pleasure afforded by the beautiful is here
always predominant, and the subjective side has retired into[285]
the background. It is further to be observed that at the next
grade below this, animal painting, the characteristic is entirely
one with the beautiful; the most characteristic lion, wolf, horse,
sheep, or ox, was always the most beautiful also. The reason of
this is that animals have only the character of their species, no
individual character. In the representation of men the character of
the species is separated from that of the individual; the former is
now called beauty (entirely in the objective sense), but the latter
retains the name, character, or expression, and the new difficulty
arises of representing both, at once and completely, in the same
individual.

Human beauty is an objective expression, which means the
fullest objectification of will at the highest grade at which it
is knowable, the Idea of man in general, completely expressed
in the sensible form. But however much the objective side
of the beautiful appears here, the subjective side still always
accompanies it. And just because no object transports us so
quickly into pure æsthetic contemplation, as the most beautiful
human countenance and form, at the sight of which we are
instantly filled with unspeakable satisfaction, and raised above
ourselves and all that troubles us; this is only possible because
this most distinct and purest knowledge of will raises us most
easily and quickly to the state of pure knowing, in which our
personality, our will with its constant pain, disappears, so long
as the pure æsthetic pleasure lasts. Therefore it is that Goethe
says: “No evil can touch him who looks on human beauty; he
feels himself at one with himself and with the world.” 

That a
beautiful human form is produced by nature must be explained
in this way. At this its highest grade the will objectifies itself in an individual; and therefore through circumstances and its
own power it completely overcomes all the hindrances and
opposition which the phenomena of the lower grades present to
it. Such are the forces of nature, from which the will must [286]
always first extort and win back the matter that belongs to all
its manifestations. Further, the phenomenon of will at its higher
grades always has multiplicity in its form. Even the tree is
only a systematic aggregate of innumerably repeated sprouting
fibres. This combination assumes greater complexity in higher
forms, and the human body is an exceedingly complex system of
different parts, each of which has a peculiar life of its own, vita
propria, subordinate to the whole. Now that all these parts are
in the proper fashion subordinate to the whole, and co-ordinate
to each other, that they all work together harmoniously for the
expression of the whole, nothing superfluous, nothing restricted;
all these are the rare conditions, whose result is beauty, the
completely expressed character of the species. So is it in nature.
But how in art? One would suppose that art achieved the beautiful
by imitating nature. But how is the artist to recognise the perfect
work which is to be imitated, and distinguish it from the failures,
if he does not anticipate the beautiful before experience? And
besides this, has nature ever produced a human being perfectly
beautiful in all his parts? It has accordingly been thought that
the artist must seek out the beautiful parts, distributed among a
number of different human beings, and out of them construct a
beautiful whole; a perverse and foolish opinion. For it will be
asked, how is he to know that just these forms and not others
are beautiful? We also see what kind of success attended the
efforts of the old German painters to achieve the beautiful by
imitating nature. Observe their naked figures. No knowledge
of the beautiful is possible purely a posteriori, and from mere
experience; it is always, at least in part, a priori, although quite
different in kind, from the forms of the principle of sufficient
reason, of which we are conscious a priori. These concern
292 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
the universal form of phenomena as such, as it constitutes the
possibility of knowledge in general, the universal how of all[287]
phenomena, and from this knowledge proceed mathematics and
pure natural science. But this other kind of knowledge a priori,
which makes it possible to express the beautiful, concerns, not the
form but the content of phenomena, not the how but the what of
the phenomenon. That we all recognise human beauty when we
see it, but that in the true artist this takes place with such clearness
that he shows it as he has never seen it, and surpasses nature
in his representation; this is only possible because we ourselves
are the will whose adequate objectification at its highest grade
is here to be judged and discovered. Thus alone have we in fact
an anticipation of that which nature (which is just the will that
constitutes our own being) strives to express. And in the true
genius this anticipation is accompanied by so great a degree of
intelligence that he recognises the Idea in the particular thing,
and thus, as it were, understands the half-uttered speech of
nature, and articulates clearly what she only stammered forth.
He expresses in the hard marble that beauty of form which in a
thousand attempts she failed to produce, he presents it to nature,
saying, as it were, to her, “That is what you wanted to say!”
And whoever is able to judge replies, “Yes, that is it.” Only in
this way was it possible for the genius of the Greeks to find the
type of human beauty and establish it as a canon for the school
of sculpture; and only by virtue of such an anticipation is it
possible for all of us to recognise beauty, when it has actually
been achieved by nature in the particular case. This anticipation
is the Ideal. It is the Idea so far as it is known a priori, at least
half, and it becomes practical for art, because it corresponds to
and completes what is given a posteriori through nature. The
possibility of such an anticipation of the beautiful a priori in the
artist, and of its recognition a posteriori by the critic, lies in the
fact that the artist and the critic are themselves the “in-itself” of
nature, the will which objectifies itself. For, as Empedocles said,[288]
293
like can only be known by like: only nature can understand itself:
only nature can fathom itself: but only spirit also can understand
spirit.54
The opinion, which is absurd, although expressed by the
Socrates of Xenophon (Stobæi Floril, vol. ii. p. 384) that
the Greeks discovered the established ideal of human beauty
empirically, by collecting particular beautiful parts, uncovering
and noting here a knee, there an arm, has an exact parallel in
the art of poetry. The view is entertained, that Shakespeare, for
example, observed, and then gave forth from his own experience
of life, the innumerable variety of the characters in his dramas, so
true, so sustained, so profoundly worked out. The impossibility
and absurdity of such an assumption need not be dwelt upon. It
is obvious that the man of genius produces the works of poetic
art by means of an anticipation of what is characteristic, just
as he produces the works of plastic and pictorial art by means
of a prophetic anticipation of the beautiful; yet both require
experience as a pattern or model, for thus alone can that which is
dimly known a priori be called into clear consciousness, and an
intelligent representation of it becomes possible.
Human beauty was explained above as the fullest
objectification of will at the highest grade at which it is
knowable. It expresses itself through the form; and this lies
in space alone, and has no necessary connection with time, as,
for example, motion has. Thus far then we may say: the adequate
objectification of will through a merely spatial phenomenon is
beauty, in the objective sense. A plant is nothing but such a merely
spatial phenomenon of will; for no motion, and consequently no [289]
54 The last sentence is the German of the il n'y a que l'esprit qui sente l'esprit,
of Helvetius. In the first edition there was no occasion to point this out, but
since then the age has become so degraded and ignorant through the stupefying
influence of the Hegelian sophistry, that some might quite likely say that an
antithesis was intended here between “spirit and nature.” I am therefore obliged
to guard myself in express terms against the suspicion of such vulgar sophisms.
294 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
relation to time (regarded apart from its development), belongs
to the expression of its nature; its mere form expresses its whole
being and displays it openly. But brutes and men require, further,
for the full revelation of the will which is manifested in them,
a series of actions, and thus the manifestation in them takes on
a direct relation to time. All this has already been explained in
the preceding book; it is related to what we are considering at
present in the following way. As the merely spatial manifestation
of will can objectify it fully or defectively at each definite
grade,—and it is this which constitutes beauty or ugliness,—so
the temporal objectification of will, i.e., the action, and indeed
the direct action, the movement, may correspond to the will,
which objectifies itself in it, purely and fully without foreign
admixture, without superfluity, without defect, only expressing
exactly the act of will determined in each case;—or the converse
of all this may occur. In the first case the movement is made
with grace, in the second case without it. Thus as beauty is
the adequate representation of will generally, through its merely
spatial manifestation; grace is the adequate representation of will
through its temporal manifestation, that is to say, the perfectly
accurate and fitting expression of each act of will, through the
movement and position which objectify it. Since movement and
position presuppose the body, Winckelmann's expression is very
true and suitable, when he says, “Grace is the proper relation
of the acting person to the action” (Works, vol. i. p. 258). It
is thus evident that beauty may be attributed to a plant, but no
grace, unless in a figurative sense; but to brutes and men, both
beauty and grace. Grace consists, according to what has been
said, in every movement being performed, and every position
assumed, in the easiest, most appropriate and convenient way,
and therefore being the pure, adequate expression of its intention,
or of the act of will, without any superfluity, which exhibits itself[290]
as aimless, meaningless bustle, or as wooden stiffness. Grace
presupposes as its condition a true proportion of all the limbs,
295
and a symmetrical, harmonious figure; for complete ease and
evident appropriateness of all positions and movements are only
possible by means of these. Grace is therefore never without
a certain degree of beauty of person. The two, complete and
united, are the most distinct manifestation of will at the highest
grade of its objectification.
It was mentioned above that in order rightly to portray man, it
is necessary to separate the character of the species from that of
the individual, so that to a certain extent every man expresses an
Idea peculiar to himself, as was said in the last book. Therefore
the arts whose aim is the representation of the Idea of man, have
as their problem, not only beauty, the character of the species,
but also the character of the individual, which is called, par
excellence, character. But this is only the case in so far as this
character is to be regarded, not as something accidental and quite
peculiar to the man as a single individual, but as a side of the Idea
of humanity which is specially apparent in this individual, and
the representation of which is therefore of assistance in revealing
this Idea. Thus the character, although as such it is individual,
must yet be Ideal, that is, its significance in relation to the Idea
of humanity generally (the objectifying of which it assists in its
own way) must be comprehended and expressed with special
prominence. Apart from this the representation is a portrait, a
copy of the individual as such, with all his accidental qualities.
And even the portrait ought to be, as Winckelmann says, the
ideal of the individual.
That character which is to be ideally comprehended, as the
prominence of a special side of the Idea of humanity, expresses
itself visibly, partly through permanent physiognomy and bodily
form, partly through passing emotion and passion, the reciprocal [291]
modification of knowing and willing by each other, which is
all exhibited in the mien and movements. Since the individual
always belongs to humanity, and, on the other hand, humanity
always reveals itself in the individual with what is indeed peculiar
296 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
ideal significance, beauty must not be destroyed by character nor
character by beauty. For if the character of the species is
annulled by that of the individual, the result is caricature; and
if the character of the individual is annulled by that of the
species, the result is an absence of meaning. Therefore the
representation which aims at beauty, as sculpture principally
does, will yet always modify this (the character of the species),
in some respect, by the individual character, and will always
express the Idea of man in a definite individual manner, giving
prominence to a special side of it. For the human individual as
such has to a certain extent the dignity of a special Idea, and
it is essential to the Idea of man that it should express itself
in individuals of special significance. Therefore we find in the
works of the ancients, that the beauty distinctly comprehended by
them, is not expressed in one form, but in many forms of different
character. It is always apprehended, as it were, from a different
side, and expressed in one way in Apollo, in another way in
Bacchus, in another in Hercules, in another in Antinous; indeed
the characteristic may limit the beautiful, and finally extend even
to hideousness, in the drunken Silenus, in the Faun, &c. If the
characteristic goes so far as actually to annul the character of
the species, if it extends to the unnatural, it becomes caricature.
But we can far less afford to allow grace to be interfered with
by what is characteristic than even beauty, for graceful position
and movement are demanded for the expression of the character
also; but yet it must be achieved in the way which is most fitting,
appropriate, and easy for the person. This will be observed, not
only by the sculptor and the painter, but also by every good[292]
actor; otherwise caricature will appear here also as grimace or
distortion.

In sculpture, beauty and grace are the principal concern.
The special character of the mind, appearing in emotion,
passion, alternations of knowing and willing, which can only
be represented by the expression of the countenance and the gestures, is the peculiar sphere of painting. For although
eyes and colour, which lie outside the province of sculpture,
contribute much to beauty, they are yet far more essential to
character. Further, beauty unfolds itself more completely when it
is contemplated from various points of view; but the expression,
the character, can only be completely comprehended from one
point of view.

Because beauty is obviously the chief aim of sculpture, Lessing
tried to explain the fact that the Laocoon does not cry out, by
saying that crying out is incompatible with beauty. The Laocoon
formed for Lessing the theme, or at least the text of a work of his
own, and both before and after him a great deal has been written
on the subject. I may therefore be allowed to express my views
about it in passing, although so special a discussion does not
properly belong to the scheme of this work, which is throughout
concerned with what is general.
