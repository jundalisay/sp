Opposites throw light upon each other, and therefore
the remark may be in place here, that the proper opposite of
the sublime is something which would not at the first glance be
recognised, as such: the charming or attractive. 

By this, however,
I understand, that which excites the will by presenting to it directly
its fulfilment, its satisfaction. We saw that the feeling of the
sublime arises from the fact, that something entirely unfavourable
to the will, becomes the object of pure contemplation, so that such
contemplation can only be maintained by persistently turning
away from the will, and transcending its interests; this constitutes
the sublimity of the character. The charming or attractive, on the
contrary, draws the beholder away from the pure contemplation
which is demanded by all apprehension of the beautiful, because
it necessarily excites this will, by objects which directly appeal
to it, and thus he no longer remains pure subject of knowing,
but becomes the needy and dependent subject of will. 

That
every beautiful thing which is bright or cheering should be called
charming, is the result of a too general concept, which arises
from a want of accurate discrimination, and which I must entirely
set aside, and indeed condemn. But in the sense of the word
which has been given and explained, I find only two species of the charming or attractive in the province of art, and both of them
are unworthy of it. The one species, a very low one, is found
in Dutch paintings of still life, when they err by representing
articles of food, which by their deceptive likeness necessarily
excite the appetite for the things they represent, and this is just
an excitement of the will, which puts an end to all æsthetic
contemplation of the object. Painted fruit is yet admissible,
because we may regard it as the further development of the
flower, and as a beautiful product of nature in form and colour,
without being obliged to think of it as eatable; but unfortunately
we often find, represented with deceptive naturalness, prepared
and served dishes, oysters, herrings, crabs, bread and butter,
beer, wine, and so forth, which is altogether to be condemned.
In historical painting and in sculpture the charming consists in
naked figures, whose position, drapery, and general treatment
are calculated to excite the passions of the beholder, and thus
pure æsthetical contemplation is at once annihilated, and the
aim of art is defeated. 

This mistake corresponds exactly to that
which we have just censured in the Dutch paintings. The ancients
are almost always free from this fault in their representations
of beauty and complete nakedness of form, because the artist
himself created them in a purely objective spirit, filled with ideal
beauty, not in the spirit of subjective, and base sensuality. The
charming is thus everywhere to be avoided in art.

There is also a negative species of the charming or exciting
which is even more reprehensible than the positive form which
has been discussed; this is the disgusting or the loathsome. It
arouses the will of the beholder, just as what is properly speaking
charming, and therefore disturbs pure æsthetic contemplation.
But it is an active aversion and opposition which is excited by
it; it arouses the will by presenting to it objects which it abhors.
Therefore it has always been recognised that it is altogether [270]
inadmissible in art, where even what is ugly, when it is not
disgusting, is allowable in its proper place, as we shall see later.
