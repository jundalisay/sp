The lowest grades of the objectification of will are
to be found in those most universal forces of nature which
partly appear in all matter without exception, as gravity and
impenetrability, and partly have shared the given matter among
them, so that certain of them reign in one species of matter
and others in another species, constituting its specific difference,
as rigidity, fluidity, elasticity, electricity, magnetism, chemical
properties and qualities of every kind. They are in themselves
immediate manifestations of will, just as much as human action;
and as such they are groundless, like human character. Only
their particular manifestations are subordinated to the principle
of sufficient reason, like the particular actions of men. They
themselves, on the other hand, can never be called either effect or
cause, but are the prior and presupposed conditions of all causes
and effects through which their real nature unfolds and reveals
itself. 

It is therefore senseless to demand a cause of gravity or electricity, for they are original forces. Their expressions,
indeed, take place in accordance with the law of cause and effect,
so that every one of their particular manifestations has a cause,
which is itself again just a similar particular manifestation which
determines that this force must express itself here, must appear
in space and time; but the force itself is by no means the effect
of a cause, nor the cause of an effect. It is therefore a mistake [170]
to say “gravity is the cause of a stone falling;” for the cause in
this case is rather the nearness of the earth, because it attracts the
stone. Take the earth away and the stone will not fall, although
gravity remains. The force itself lies quite outside the chain of
causes and effects, which presupposes time, because it only has
meaning in relation to it; but the force lies outside time. 

The
individual change always has for its cause another change just as
individual as itself, and not the force of which it is the expression.
For that which always gives its efficiency to a cause, however
many times it may appear, is a force of nature. As such, it is
groundless, i.e., it lies outside the chain of causes and outside
the province of the principle of sufficient reason in general, and
is philosophically known as the immediate objectivity of will,
which is the “in-itself” of the whole of nature; but in etiology,
which in this reference is physics, it is set down as an original
force, i.e., a qualitas occulta.

In the higher grades of the objectivity of will we see
individuality occupy a prominent position, especially in the case
of man, where it appears as the great difference of individual
characters, i.e., as complete personality, outwardly expressed in
strongly marked individual physiognomy, which influences the
whole bodily form. None of the brutes have this individuality in
anything like so high a degree, though the higher species of them
have a trace of it; but the character of the species completely
predominates over it, and therefore they have little individual
physiognomy. 

The farther down we go, the more completely
is every trace of the individual character lost in the common character of the species, and the physiognomy of the species
alone remains. We know the physiological character of the
species, and from that we know exactly what is to be expected
from the individual; while, on the contrary, in the human species
every individual has to be studied and fathomed for himself,[171]
which, if we wish to forecast his action with some degree of
certainty, is, on account of the possibility of concealment that
first appears with reason, a matter of the greatest difficulty. It
is probably connected with this difference of the human species
from all others, that the folds and convolutions of the brain,
which are entirely wanting in birds, and very weakly marked
in rodents, are even in the case of the higher animals far more
symmetrical on both sides, and more constantly the same in each
individual, than in the case of human beings.34 It is further to be
regarded as a phenomenon of this peculiar individual character
which distinguishes men from all the lower animals, that in
the case of the brutes the sexual instinct seeks its satisfaction
without observable choice of objects, while in the case of man
this choice is, in a purely instinctive manner and independent of
all reflection, carried so far that it rises into a powerful passion.
While then every man is to be regarded as a specially determined
and characterised phenomenon of will, and indeed to a certain
extent as a special Idea, in the case of the brutes this individual
character as a whole is wanting, because only the species has a
special significance. And the farther we go from man, the fainter
becomes the trace of this individual character, so that plants have
no individual qualities left, except such as may be fully explained
from the favourable or unfavourable external influences of soil,
climate, and other accidents. Finally, in the inorganic kingdom
of nature all individuality disappears. The crystal alone is to be
regarded as to a certain extent individual. It is a unity of the

tendency in definite directions, fixed by crystallisation, which
makes the trace of this tendency permanent. It is at the same time
a cumulative repetition of its primitive form, bound into unity by
an idea, just as the tree is an aggregate of the single germinating [172]
fibre which shows itself in every rib of the leaves, in every leaf,
in every branch; which repeats itself, and to some extent makes
each of these appear as a separate growth, nourishing itself from
the greater as a parasite, so that the tree, resembling the crystal, is
a systematic aggregate of small plants, although only the whole
is the complete expression of an individual Idea, i.e., of this
particular grade of the objectification of will. But the individuals
of the same species of crystal can have no other difference than
such as is produced by external accidents; indeed we can make at
pleasure large or small crystals of every species. The individual,
however, as such, that is, with traces of an individual character,
does not exist further in unorganised nature. All its phenomena
are expressions of general forces of nature, i.e., of those grades of
the objectification of will which do not objectify themselves (as
is the case in organised nature), by means of the difference of the
individualities which collectively express the whole of the Idea,
but show themselves only in the species, and as a whole, without
any variation in each particular example of it. Time, space,
multiplicity, and existence conditioned by causes, do not belong
to the will or to the Idea (the grade of the objectification of will),
but only to their particular phenomena. Therefore such a force
of nature as, for example, gravity or electricity, must show itself
as such in precisely the same way in all its million phenomena,
and only external circumstances can modify these. This unity
of its being in all its phenomena, this unchangeable constancy
of the appearance of these, whenever, under the guidance of
causality, the necessary conditions are present, is called a law
of nature. If such a law is once learned from experience, then
the phenomenon of that force of nature, the character of which
is expressed and laid down in it, may be accurately forecast
186 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
and counted upon. But it is just this conformity to law of the
phenomena of the lower grades of the objectification of will[173]
which gives them such a different aspect from the phenomena of
the same will in the higher, i.e., the more distinct, grades of its
objectification, in animals, and in men and their actions, where
the stronger or weaker influence of the individual character and
the susceptibility to motives which often remain hidden from the
spectator, because they lie in knowledge, has had the result that
the identity of the inner nature of the two kinds of phenomena
has hitherto been entirely overlooked.
If we start from the knowledge of the particular, and not from
that of the Idea, there is something astonishing, and sometimes
even terrible, in the absolute uniformity of the laws of nature. It
might astonish us that nature never once forgets her laws; that
if, for example, it has once been according to a law of nature
that where certain materials are brought together under given
conditions, a chemical combination will take place, or gas will
be evolved, or they will go on fire; if these conditions are fulfilled,
whether by our interposition or entirely by chance (and in this
case the accuracy is the more astonishing because unexpected),
to-day just as well as a thousand years ago, the determined
phenomenon will take place at once and without delay. We are
most vividly impressed with the marvellousness of this fact in the
case of rare phenomena, which only occur under very complex
circumstances, but which we are previously informed will take
place if these conditions are fulfilled. For example, when we
are told that if certain metals, when arranged alternately in fluid
with which an acid has been mixed, are brought into contact,
silver leaf brought between the extremities of this combination
will suddenly be consumed in a green flame; or that under certain
conditions the hard diamond turns into carbonic acid. It is the
ghostly omnipresence of natural forces that astonishes us in such
cases, and we remark here what in the case of phenomena[174]
which happen daily no longer strikes us, how the connection
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 187
between cause and effect is really as mysterious as that which is
imagined between a magic formula and a spirit that must appear
when invoked by it. On the other hand, if we have attained to
the philosophical knowledge that a force of nature is a definite
grade of the objectification of will, that is to say, a definite
grade of that which we recognise as our own inmost nature, and
that this will, in itself, and distinguished from its phenomena
and their forms, lies outside time and space, and that, therefore,
the multiplicity, which is conditioned by time and space, does
not belong to it, nor directly to the grade of its objectification,
i.e., the Idea, but only to the phenomena of the Idea; and if
we remember that the law of causality has significance only in
relation to time and space, inasmuch as it determines the position
of the multitude of phenomena of the different Ideas in which
the will reveals itself, governing the order in which they must
appear; if, I say, in this knowledge the inner meaning of the
great doctrine of Kant has been fully grasped, the doctrine that
time, space, and causality do not belong to the thing-in-itself,
but merely to the phenomenon, that they are only the forms of
our knowledge, not qualities of things in themselves; then we
shall understand that this astonishment at the conformity to law
and accurate operation of a force of nature, this astonishment
at the complete sameness of all its million phenomena and the
infallibility of their occurrence, is really like that of a child or a
savage who looks for the first time through a glass with many
facets at a flower, and marvels at the complete similarity of the
innumerable flowers which he sees, and counts the leaves of each
of them separately.

Thus every universal, original force of nature is nothing but a
low grade of the objectification of will, and we call every such [175]
grade an eternal Idea in Plato's sense. But a law of nature is the
relation of the Idea to the form of its manifestation. This form is
time, space, and causality, which are necessarily and inseparably
connected and related to each other. Through time and space
188 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
the Idea multiplies itself in innumerable phenomena, but the
order according to which it enters these forms of multiplicity
is definitely determined by the law of causality; this law is as
it were the norm of the limit of these phenomena of different
Ideas, in accordance with which time, space, and matter are
assigned to them. This norm is therefore necessarily related to
the identity of the aggregate of existing matter, which is the
common substratum of all those different phenomena. If all
these were not directed to that common matter in the possession
of which they must be divided, there would be no need for
such a law to decide their claims. They might all at once
and together fill a boundless space throughout an endless time.
Therefore, because all these phenomena of the eternal Ideas are
directed to one and the same matter, must there be a rule for
their appearance and disappearance; for if there were not, they
would not make way for each other. Thus the law of causality is
essentially bound up with that of the permanence of substance;
they reciprocally derive significance from each other. Time and
space, again, are related to them in the same way. For time is
merely the possibility of conflicting states of the same matter,
and space is merely the possibility of the permanence of the same
matter under all sorts of conflicting states. Accordingly, in the
preceding book we explained matter as the union of space and
time, and this union shows itself as change of the accidents in the
permanence of the substance, of which causality or becoming is
the universal possibility. And accordingly, we said that matter is
through and through causality. We explained the understanding
as the subjective correlative of causality, and said matter (and
thus the whole world as idea) exists only for the understanding;[176]
the understanding is its condition, its supporter as its necessary
correlative. I repeat all this in passing, merely to call to mind
what was demonstrated in the First Book, for it is necessary for
the complete understanding of these two books that their inner
agreement should be observed, since what is inseparably united
First Aspect. The Objectification Of The Will. 189
in the actual world as its two sides, will and idea, has, in order
that we might understand each of them more clearly in isolation,
been dissevered in these two books.

It may not perhaps be superfluous to elucidate further by an
example how the law of causality has meaning only in relation
to time and space, and the matter which consists in the union of
the two. For it determines the limits in accordance with which
the phenomena of the forces of nature divide themselves in the
possession of matter, while the original forces of nature, as the
immediate objectification of will, which, as a thing in itself, is
not subordinated to the principle of sufficient reason, lie outside
these forms, within which alone all etiological explanation has
validity and meaning, and just on that account can never lead us
to the inner reality of nature. For this purpose let us think of some
kind of machine constructed according to the laws of mechanics.
Iron weights begin the motion by their gravity; copper wheels
resist by their rigidity, affect and raise each other and the lever
by their impenetrability, and so on. Here gravity, rigidity, and
impenetrability are original unexplained forces; mechanics only
gives us the condition under which, and the manner in which,
they manifest themselves, appear, and govern a definite matter,
time, and place. If, now, a strong magnet is made to attract
the iron of the weight, and overcome its gravity, the movement
of the machine stops, and the matter becomes forthwith the
scene of quite a different force of nature—magnetism, of which
etiology again gives no further explanation than the condition
under which it appears. Or let us suppose that the copper [177]
discs of such a machine are laid upon zinc plates, and an acid
solution introduced between them. At once the same matter
of the machine has become subject to another original force,
galvanism, which now governs it according to its own laws,
and reveals itself in it through its phenomena; and etiology can
again tell us nothing about this force except the conditions under
which, and the laws in accordance with which, it manifests itself.
190 The World As Will And Idea (Vol. 1 of 3)
Let us now raise the temperature and add pure acid; the whole
machine burns; that is to say, once more an entirely different
force of nature, chemical energy, asserts at this time and in this
place irresistible claims to this particular matter, and reveals
itself in it as Idea, as a definite grade of the objectification of
will. The calcined metal thus produced now unites with an acid,
and a salt is obtained which forms itself into crystals. These
are the phenomena of another Idea, which in itself is again
quite inexplicable, while the appearance of its phenomena is
dependent upon certain conditions which etiology can give us.
The crystals dissolve, mix with other materials, and vegetation
springs up from them—a new phenomenon of will: and so the
same permanent matter may be followed ad infinitum, to observe
how now this and now that natural force obtains a right to it and
temporarily takes possession of it, in order to appear and reveal
its own nature. The condition of this right, the point of time and
space at which it becomes valid, is given by causality, but the
explanation founded upon this law only extends thus far. The
force itself is a manifestation of will, and as such is not subject
to the forms of the principle of sufficient reason, that is, it is
groundless. It lies outside all time, is omnipresent, and seems
as it were to wait constantly till the circumstances occur under
which it can appear and take possession of a definite matter,
supplanting the forces which have reigned in it till then. All
time exists only for the phenomena of such a force, and is[178]
without significance for the force itself. Through thousands of
years chemical forces slumber in matter till the contact with the
reagents sets them free; then they appear; but time exists only
for the phenomena, not for the forces themselves. For thousands
of years galvanism slumbered in copper and zinc, and they lay
quietly beside silver, which must be consumed in flame as soon
as all three are brought together under the required conditions.

Even in the organic kingdom we see a dry seed preserve the
slumbering force through three thousand years, and when at last the favourable circumstances occur, grow up as a plant.35
If by this exposition the difference between a force of nature
and all its phenomena has been made quite distinct; if we have
seen clearly that the former is the will itself at this particular grade
of its objectification, but that multiplicity comes to phenomena
only through time and space, and that the law of causality is
nothing but the determination of the position of these phenomena
in time and space; then we shall recognise the complete truth
and the deep meaning of Malebranche's doctrine of occasional
causes (causes occasionelles). It is well worth while comparing [179]
this doctrine of his, as he explains it in the “Recherches de la
Vérite,” both in the 3rd Chapter of the second part of the 6th
Book, and in the éclaircissements appended to this chapter, with
this exposition of mine, and observing the complete agreement
of the two doctrines in the case of such different systems of
thought. Indeed I cannot help admiring how Malebranche,
though thoroughly involved in the positive dogmas which his
age inevitably forced upon him, yet, in such bonds and under
such a burden, hit the truth so happily, so correctly, and even
knew how to combine it with these dogmas, at all events verbally.

For the power of truth is incredibly great and of unspeakable
endurance. We find constant traces of it in all, even the most
eccentric and absurd dogmas, of different times and different
lands,—often indeed in strange company, curiously mixed up
with other things, but still recognisable. It is like a plant that
germinates under a heap of great stones, but still struggles up
to the light, working itself through with many deviations and
windings, disfigured, worn out, stunted in its growth,—but yet,
to the light.

35 On the 16th of September 1840, at a lecture upon Egyptian Archæology
delivered by Mr. Pettigrew at the Literary and Scientific Institute of London,
he showed some corns of wheat which Sir G. Wilkinson had found in a grave
at Thebes, in which they must have lain for three thousand years. They were
found in an hermetically sealed vase. Mr. Pettigrew had sowed twelve grains,
and obtained a plant which grew five feet high, and the seeds of which were
now quite ripe.—Times, 21st September 1840. In the same way in 1830 Mr.
Haulton produced in the Medical Botanical Society of London a bulbous root
which was found in the hand of an Egyptian mummy, in which it was probably
put in observance of some religious rite, and which must have been at least
two thousand years old. He had planted it in a flower-pot, in which it grew up
and flourished. This is quoted from the Medical Journal of 1830 in the Journal
of the Royal Institute of Great Britain, October 1830, p. 196.—“In the garden
of Mr. Grimstone of the Herbarium, Highgate, London, is a pea in full fruit,
which has sprung from a pea that Mr. Pettigrew and the officials of the British
Museum took out of a vase which had been found in an Egyptian sarcophagus,
where it must have lain 2844 years.”—Times, 16th August 1844. Indeed, the
living toads found in limestone lead to the conclusion that even animal life is
capable of such a suspension for thousands of years, if this is begun in the
dormant period and maintained by special circumstances.



In any case Malebranche is right: every natural cause is only
an occasional cause. It only gives opportunity or occasion for the
manifestation of the one indivisible will which is the “in-itself”
of all things, and whose graduated objectification is the whole
visible world. Only the appearance, the becoming visible, in
this place, at this time, is brought about by the cause and is so
far dependent on it, but not the whole of the phenomenon, nor
its inner nature. This is the will itself, to which the principle
of sufficient reason has not application, and which is therefore
groundless. Nothing in the world has a sufficient cause of
its existence generally, but only a cause of existence just here
and just now. That a stone exhibits now gravity, now rigidity,
now electricity, now chemical qualities, depends upon causes,[180]
upon impressions upon it from without, and is to be explained
from these. But these qualities themselves, and thus the whole
inner nature of the stone which consists in them, and therefore
manifests itself in all the ways referred to; thus, in general, that
the stone is such as it is, that it exists generally—all this, I say, has
no ground, but is the visible appearance of the groundless will.
Every cause is thus an occasional cause. 

We have found it to be
so in nature, which is without knowledge, and it is also precisely
the same when motives and not causes or stimuli determine the point at which the phenomena are to appear, that is to say, in
the actions of animals and human beings. For in both cases it
is one and the same will which appears; very different in the
grades of its manifestation, multiplied in the phenomena of these
grades, and, in respect of these, subordinated to the principle of
sufficient reason, but in itself free from all this. Motives do not
determine the character of man, but only the phenomena of his
character, that is, his actions; the outward fashion of his life, not
its inner meaning and content. These proceed from the character
which is the immediate manifestation of the will, and is therefore
groundless. That one man is bad and another good, does not
depend upon motives or outward influences, such as teaching and
preaching, and is in this sense quite inexplicable. But whether a
bad man shows his badness in petty acts of injustice, cowardly
tricks, and low knavery which he practises in the narrow sphere
of his circumstances, or whether as a conqueror he oppresses
nations, throws a world into lamentation, and sheds the blood
of millions; this is the outward form of his manifestation, that
which is unessential to it, and depends upon the circumstances in
which fate has placed him, upon his surroundings, upon external
influences, upon motives; but his decision upon these motives can
never be explained from them; it proceeds from the will, of which
this man is a manifestation. Of this we shall speak in the Fourth [181]
Book. The manner in which the character discloses its qualities is
quite analogous to the way in which those of every material body
in unconscious nature are disclosed. Water remains water with
its intrinsic qualities, whether as a still lake it reflects its banks,
or leaps in foam from the cliffs, or, artificially confined, spouts
in a long jet into the air. All that depends upon external causes;
the one form is as natural to it as the other, but it will always
show the same form in the same circumstances; it is equally
ready for any, but in every case true to its character, and at all
times revealing this alone. So will every human character under
all circumstances reveal itself, but the phenomena which proceed from it will always be in accordance with the circumstances.
