The direct opposite of rational knowledge is feeling.

Feeling denotes a negative content, something which is present in consciousness.

It is not a concept, is not abstract rational knowledge. 

Except this, whatever it may be, it comes under the
concept of feeling. 

Thus the immeasurably wide sphere of the
concept of feeling includes the most different kinds of objects,
and no one can ever understand how they come together until he
has recognised that they all agree in this negative respect, that
they are not abstract concepts. For the most diverse and even
antagonistic elements lie quietly side by side in this concept;
for example, religious feeling, feeling of sensual pleasure, moral feeling, bodily feeling, as touch, pain, sense of colour, of sounds
and their harmonies and discords, feeling of hate, of disgust, of
self-satisfaction, of honour, of disgrace, of right, of wrong, sense
of truth, æsthetic feeling, feeling of power, weakness, health,
friendship, love, &c.

There is absolutely nothing in common
among them except the negative quality that they are not abstract
rational knowledge. But this diversity becomes more striking
when the apprehension of space relations presented a priori in
perception, and also the knowledge of the pure understanding is[067]
brought under this concept, and when we say of all knowledge
and all truth, of which we are first conscious only intuitively,
and have not yet formulated in abstract concepts, we feel it. 

Euclid says that we should make beginners
in geometry draw the figures before proceeding to demonstrate,
for in this way they would already feel geometrical truth before
the demonstration brought them complete knowledge. In the
same way Schleiermacher speaks in his “Critique of Ethics” of
logical and mathematical feeling (p. 339), and also of the feeling
of the sameness or difference of two formulas (p. 342). 

Again
Tennemann in his “History of Philosophy” (vol. I., p. 361) says,
“One felt that the fallacies were not right, but could not point out
the mistakes.” Now, so long as we do not regard this concept
“feeling” from the right point of view, and do not recognise that
one negative characteristic which alone is essential to it, it must
constantly give occasion for misunderstanding and controversy,
on account of the excessive wideness of its sphere, and its
entirely negative and very limited content which is determined
in a purely one-sided manner. Since then we have in German
the nearly synonymous word empfindung (sensation), it would
be convenient to make use of it for bodily feeling, as a subspecies. 

This concept “feeling,” which is quite out of proportion to all others, doubtless originated in the following manner. All
concepts, and concepts alone, are denoted by words; they exist
only for the reason, and proceed from it. With concepts, therefore,
we are already at a one-sided point of view; but from such a
point of view what is near appears distinct and is set down
as positive, what is farther off becomes mixed up and is soon
regarded as merely negative. Thus each nation calls all others [068]
foreign: to the Greek all others are barbarians; to the Englishman
all that is not England or English is continent or continental; to
the believer all others are heretics, or heathens; to the noble all
others are roturiers; to the student all others are Philistines, and
so forth. Now, reason itself, strange as it may seem, is guilty
of the same one-sidedness, indeed one might say of the same
crude ignorance arising from vanity, for it classes under the one
concept, “feeling,” every modification of consciousness which
does not immediately belong to its own mode of apprehension,
that is to say, which is not an abstract concept. It has had to pay
the penalty of this hitherto in misunderstanding and confusion
in its own province, because its own procedure had not become
clear to it through thorough self-knowledge, for a special faculty
of feeling has been set up, and new theories of it are constructed.
