The law of causality determines not merely a succession of things in time.

The law of causality determines this succession with reference to a definite space, and not merely existence of things in a particular place, but in this place at a different point of time. 

Change is the variation which happens according to the law of causality.

It implies always a determined part of space and a determined part of time together and in union. 

Thus, causality unites space with time. 

But we found that the whole essence of matter consisted in action, i.e., in causation, consequently space and time must also be united in matter, that is to say, matter must take to itself at once the distinguishing qualities both of space and time, however much these may be opposed to each other, and must unite in itself what is impossible for each of these independently, that is, the fleeting course of time, with the rigid unchangeable perduration of space: infinite divisibility it receives from both.

This is why co-existence, which could neither be in time alone, for time has no contiguity, nor in space alone, for space has no before, after, or now, is first established through matter. 

But the co-existence of many things constitutes, in fact, the essence of reality, for through it permanence first becomes possible; for permanence is only knowable in the change of something which is present along with what is permanent, while on the other hand it is only because something permanent is present along with what changes, that the latter gains the special character of change, i.e., the mutation of quality and form in the permanence of substance, that is to say, in matter.

If the world were in space alone, it would be rigid and immovable, without succession, without change, without action; but we know that with action, the idea of matter first appears. Again, if the world were in time alone, all would be fleeting, without persistence, without contiguity, hence without co-existence, and consequently without permanence; so that in this case also there would be no matter. Only through the union of space and time do we reach matter, and matter is the possibility of co-existence, and, through that, of permanence; through permanence again matter is the possibility of the persistence of substance in the change of its states.8 As matter consists in the union of space and time, it bears throughout the stamp of both.

It manifests its origin in space, partly through the form which is inseparable from it, but especially through its persistence (substance), the a priori certainty of which is therefore wholly deducible from that of space9 (for variation belongs to time alone, but in it alone and for itself nothing is persistent). Matter shows that it springs from time by quality (accidents), without which it never exists,[013] and which is plainly always causality, action upon other matter, and therefore change (a time concept).

<!-- 7 It is shown in the Appendix that matter and substance are one.
8 This shows the ground of the Kantian explanation of matter, that it is “that
which is movable in space,” for motion consists simply in the union of space
and time.
9 Not, as Kant holds, from the knowledge of time, as will be explained in the
Appendix. -->


The law of this action, however, always depends upon space and time together, and only thus obtains meaning. The regulative function of causality is confined entirely to the determination of what must occupy this time and this space. The fact that we know a priori the unalterable characteristics of matter, depends upon this derivation of its essential nature from the forms of our knowledge of which we are conscious a priori.

These unalterable characteristics are space-occupation, i.e., impenetrability, i.e., causal action, consequently, extension, infinite divisibility, persistence, i.e., indestructibility, and lastly mobility: weight, on the other hand, notwithstanding its universality, must be attributed to a posteriori knowledge, although Kant, in his “Metaphysical Introduction to Natural Philosophy,” p. 71 (p. 372 of Rosenkranz's edition), treats it as knowable a priori.

But as the object in general is only for the subject, as its idea, so every special class of ideas is only for an equally special quality in the subject, which is called a faculty of perception. This subjective correlative of time and space in themselves as empty forms, has been named by Kant pure sensibility; and we may retain this expression, as Kant was the first to treat of the subject, though it is not exact, for sensibility presupposes matter. The subjective correlative of matter or of causation, for these two are the same, is understanding, which is nothing more than this. To know causality is its one function, its only power; and it is a great one, embracing much, of manifold application, yet of unmistakable identity in all its manifestations. Conversely all causation, that is to say, all matter, or the whole of reality, is only for the understanding, through the understanding, and in the understanding. The first, simplest, and ever-present example of understanding is the perception of the actual world. This is [014] throughout knowledge of the cause from the effect, and therefore all perception is intellectual. The understanding could never arrive at this perception, however, if some effect did not become known immediately, and thus serve as a starting-point. But this is the affection of the animal body. So far, then, the animal body is the immediate object of the subject; the perception of all other objects becomes possible through it.

The changes which every animal body experiences, are immediately known, that is,
felt; and as these effects are at once referred to their causes,
the perception of the latter as objects arises. This relation is
no conclusion in abstract conceptions; it does not arise from
reflection, nor is it arbitrary, but immediate, necessary, and
certain. It is the method of knowing of the pure understanding,
without which there could be no perception; there would only
remain a dull plant-like consciousness of the changes of the
immediate object, which would succeed each other in an utterly
unmeaning way, except in so far as they might have a meaning
for the will either as pain or pleasure. But as with the rising
of the sun the visible world appears, so at one stroke, the
understanding, by means of its one simple function, changes the
dull, meaningless sensation into perception. What the eye, the
ear, or the hand feels, is not perception; it is merely its data.
By the understanding passing from the effect to the cause, the
world first appears as perception extended in space, varying in
respect of form, persistent through all time in respect of matter;
for the understanding unites space and time in the idea of matter,
that is, causal action. As the world as idea exists only through
the understanding, so also it exists only for the understanding.
In the first chapter of my essay on “Light and Colour,” I have
already explained how the understanding constructs perceptions
out of the data supplied by the senses; how by comparison of the
impressions which the various senses receive from the object, a
child arrives at perceptions; how this alone affords the solution[015]
of so many phenomena of the senses; the single vision of two
eyes, the double vision in the case of a squint, or when we try to
look at once at objects which lie at unequal distances behind each
other; and all illusion which is produced by a sudden alteration
in the organs of sense. But I have treated this important subject
much more fully and thoroughly in the second edition of the
essay on “The Principle of Sufficient Reason,” § 21. 

All that is
said there would find its proper place here, and would therefore have to be said again; but as I have almost as much disinclination
to quote myself as to quote others, and as I am unable to explain
the subject better than it is explained there, I refer the reader to
it, instead of quoting it, and take for granted that it is known.

The process by which children, and persons born blind who
have been operated upon, learn to see, the single vision of the
double sensation of two eyes, the double vision and double touch
which occur when the organs of sense have been displaced from
their usual position, the upright appearance of objects while the
picture on the retina is upside down, the attributing of colour to
the outward objects, whereas it is merely an inner function, a
division through polarisation, of the activity of the eye, and lastly
the stereoscope,—all these are sure and incontrovertible evidence
that perception is not merely of the senses, but intellectual—that
is, pure knowledge through the understanding of the cause from
the effect, and that, consequently, it presupposes the law of
causality, in a knowledge of which all perception—that is to
say all experience, by virtue of its primary and only possibility,
depends. The contrary doctrine that the law of causality results
from experience, which was the scepticism of Hume, is first
refuted by this. For the independence of the knowledge of
causality of all experience,—that is, its a priori character—can [016]
only be deduced from the dependence of all experience upon it;
and this deduction can only be accomplished by proving, in the
manner here indicated, and explained in the passages referred to
above, that the knowledge of causality is included in perception
in general, to which all experience belongs, and therefore in
respect of experience is completely a priori, does not presuppose
it, but is presupposed by it as a condition. This, however, cannot
be deduced in the manner attempted by Kant, which I have
criticised in the essay on “The Principle of Sufficient Reason,”
