The freedom of the will as thing-in-itself, if, as has been said, we abstract from the entirely exceptional case mentioned above, by no means extends directly to its phenomenon, not even in the case in which this reaches the highest made of its visibility, and thus does not extend to the rational animal endowed with individual character, i.e., the person. 

The person is never free although he is the phenomenon of a free will; for he is already the determined phenomenon of the free volition of this will, and, because he enters the form of every object, the principle of sufficient reason, he develops indeed the unity of that will in a multiplicity of actions, but on account of the timeless unity of that volition in itself, this multiplicity exhibits in itself the regular conformity to law of a force of Nature.

Since, however, it is that
free volition that becomes visible in the person and the whole of
his conduct, relating itself to him as the concept to the definition,
every individual action of the person is to be ascribed to the
free will, and directly proclaims itself as such in consciousness.
Therefore, as was said in the Second Book, every one regards
himself a priori (i.e., here in this original feeling) as free in his
individual actions, in the sense that in every given case every
action is possible for him, and he only recognises a posteriori
from experience and reflection upon experience that his actions take place with absolute necessity from the coincidence of his
character with his motives. Hence it arises that every uncultured
man, following his feeling, ardently defends complete freedom
in particular actions, while the great thinkers of all ages, and
indeed the more profound systems of religion, have denied it. 

But whoever has come to see clearly that the whole nature of man is will, and he himself only a phenomenon of this will, and that such a phenomenon has, even from the subject itself, the principle of sufficient reason as its necessary form, which here appears as the [373] law of motivation,—such a man will regard it as just as absurd to doubt the inevitable nature of an action when the motive is presented to a given character, as to doubt that the three angles of any triangle are together equal to two right angles. Priestley has very sufficiently proved the necessity of the individual action in his “Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity;” but Kant, whose merit in this respect is specially great, first proved the coexistence of this necessity with the freedom of the will in itself, i.e., apart from the phenomenon,69 by establishing the distinction between the intelligible and the empirical character.

I entirely adhere to
this distinction, for the former is the will as thing-in-itself so far
as it appears in a definite individual in a definite grade, and the
latter is this phenomenon itself as it exhibits itself in time in the
mode of action, and in space in the physical structure. In order to
make the relation of the two comprehensible, the best expression
is that which I have already used in the introductory essay, that
the intelligible character of every man is to be regarded as an act
of will outside time, and therefore indivisible and unchangeable,
and the manifestation of this act of will developed and broken up
in time and space and all the forms of the principle of sufficient
reason is the empirical character as it exhibits itself for experience
in the whole conduct and life of this man. As the whole tree is

only the constantly repeated manifestation of one and the same
tendency, which exhibits itself in its simplest form in the fibre,
and recurs and is easily recognised in the construction of the leaf,
shoot, branch, and trunk, so all a man's deeds are merely the
constantly repeated expression, somewhat varied in form, of his
intelligible character, and the induction based on the sum of all
these expressions gives us his empirical character. For the rest,[374]
I shall not at this point repeat in my own words Kant's masterly
exposition, but presuppose it as known.
In the year 1840 I dealt with the important chapter on the
freedom of the will, thoroughly and in detail, in my crowned
prize-essay upon the subject, and exposed the reason of the
delusion which led men to imagine that they found an empirically
given absolute freedom of the will, that is to say, a liberum
arbitrium indifferentiæ, as a fact in self-consciousness; for the
question propounded for the essay was with great insight directed
to this point. Therefore, as I refer the reader to that work, and also
to the tenth paragraph of the prize-essay on the basis of morals,
which was published along with it under the title “The Two
Fundamental Problems of Ethics,” I now omit the incomplete
exposition of the necessity of the act of will, which was given
at this place in the first edition. Instead of it I shall explain
the delusion mentioned above in a brief discussion which is
presupposed in the nineteenth chapter of the supplement to the
present work, and therefore could not be given in the prize-essay
referred to.

Apart from the fact that the will as the true thing-in-itself
is actually original and independent, and that the feeling of its
originality and absoluteness must accompany its acts in self-
consciousness, though here they are already determined, there
arises the illusion of an empirical freedom of the will (instead
of the transcendental freedom which alone is to be attributed to
it), and thus a freedom of its particular actions, from that attitude
of the intellect towards the will which is explained, separated, and subordinated in the nineteenth chapter of the supplement,
especially under No. 3. The intellect knows the conclusions
of the will only a posteriori and empirically; therefore when
a choice is presented, it has no data as to how the will is to
decide. For the intelligible character, by virtue of which, when
motives are given, only one decision is possible and is therefore 
necessary, does not come within the knowledge of the intellect,
but merely the empirical character is known to it through the
succession of its particular acts. Therefore it seems to the intellect
that in a given case two opposite decisions are possible for the
will. But this is just the same thing as if we were to say of a
perpendicular beam that has lost its balance, and is hesitating
which way to fall, “It can fall either to the right hand or the left.”

This can has merely a subjective significance, and really means
“as far as the data known to us are concerned.” Objectively,
the direction of the fall is necessarily determined as soon as the
equilibrium is lost. Accordingly, the decision of one's own will is
undetermined only to the beholder, one's own intellect, and thus
merely relatively and subjectively for the subject of knowing.
In itself and objectively, on the other hand, in every choice
presented to it, its decision is at once determined and necessary.
But this determination only comes into consciousness through
the decision that follows upon it. Indeed, we receive an empirical
proof of this when any difficult and important choice lies before
us, but only under a condition which is not yet present, but merely
hoped for, so that in the meanwhile we can do nothing, but must
remain passive. Now we consider how we shall decide when the
circumstances occur that will give us a free activity and choice.
Generally the foresight of rational deliberation recommends one
decision, while direct inclination leans rather to the other. So
long as we are compelled to remain passive, the side of reason
seems to wish to keep the upper hand; but we see beforehand how
strongly the other side will influence us when the opportunity
for action arises. Till then we are eagerly concerned to place the motives on both sides in the clearest light, by calm meditation on
the pro et contra, so that every motive may exert its full influence
upon the will when the time arrives, and it may not be misled by
a mistake on the part of the intellect to decide otherwise than it would have done if all the motives had their due influence upon
it. But this distinct unfolding of the motives on both sides is all
that the intellect can do to assist the choice. 

It awaits the real
decision just as passively and with the same intense curiosity as
if it were that of a foreign will. Therefore from its point of view
both decisions must seem to it equally possible; and this is just
the illusion of the empirical freedom of the will. Certainly the
decision enters the sphere of the intellect altogether empirically,
as the final conclusion of the matter; but yet it proceeded from
the inner nature, the intelligible character, of the individual will
in its conflict with given motives, and therefore with complete
necessity. The intellect can do nothing more than bring out
clearly and fully the nature of the motives; it cannot determine
the will itself; for the will is quite inaccessible to it, and, as we
have seen, cannot be investigated.

If, under the same circumstances, a man could act now one
way and now another, it would be necessary that his will itself
should have changed in the meantime, and thus that it should lie
in time, for change is only possible in time; but then either the
will would be a mere phenomenon, or time would be a condition
of the thing-in-itself. Accordingly the dispute as to the freedom of
the particular action, the liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ, really
turns on the question whether the will lies in time or not. If, as
both Kant's doctrine and the whole of my system necessitates,
the will is the thing-in-itself outside time and outside every form
of the principle of sufficient reason, not only must the individual
act in the same way in the same circumstances, and not only
must every bad action be the sure warrant of innumerable others,
which the individual must perform and cannot leave, but, as
Kant said, if only the empirical character and the motives were completely given, it would be possible to calculate the future
conduct of a man just as we can calculate an eclipse of the sun or moon. As Nature is consistent, so is the character; every action
must take place in accordance with it, just as every phenomenon
takes place according to a law of Nature: the causes in the latter
case and the motives in the former are merely the occasional
causes, as was shown in the Second Book. The will, whose
phenomenon is the whole being and life of man, cannot deny
itself in the particular case, and what the man wills on the whole,
that will he also will in the particular case.
