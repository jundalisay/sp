The final cause here is that nature, always so anxiously concerned for the maintenance of the species, seeks to replace by a
new individual the approaching loss of one in the prime of life;
the efficient cause, on the other hand, is the unusually excited
state of the nervous system which occurs in the last period of
consumption. From the same final cause is to be explained the
analogous phenomenon that (according to Oken, Die Zeugung,
p. 65) flies poisoned with arsenic still couple, and die in the act
of copulation. The final cause of the pubes in both sexes, and
of the Mons Veneris in the female, is that even in the case of
very thin subjects the Ossa pubis shall not be felt, which might
excite antipathy; the efficient cause, on the other hand, is to be
sought in the fact that wherever the mucous membrane passes
over to the outer skin, hair grows in the vicinity; and, secondly,
also that the head and the genitals are to a certain extent opposite
poles of each other, and therefore have various relations and [088]
analogies between them, among which is that of being covered
with hair. The same efficient cause holds good also of the beard
of the man; the final cause of it, I suppose, lies in the fact that the
pathogonomic signs, thus the rapid alterations of the countenance
betraying every movement of the mind, are principally visible in
the mouth and its vicinity; therefore, in order to conceal these
from the prying eye of the adversary, as something dangerous in
bargaining, or in sudden emergencies, nature gave man the beard
(which shows that homo homini lupus). The woman, on the other
hand, could dispense with this; for with her dissimulation and
command of countenance are inborn. As I have said, there must
be far more apt examples to be found to show how the completely
blind working of nature unites in the result with the apparently
intentional, or, as Kant calls it, the mechanism of nature with its
technic; which points to the fact that both have their common
origin beyond their difference in the will as the thing in itself.

Much would be achieved for the elucidation of this point of
view, if, for example, we could find the efficient cause which
carries the driftwood to the treeless polar lands, or that which has concentrated the dry land of our planet principally in the northern half of it; while it is to be regarded as the final cause of this
that the winter of that half, because it occurs in the perihelion
which accelerates the course of the earth, is eight days shorter,
and hereby is also milder. Yet in considering unorganised nature
the final cause is always ambiguous, and, especially when the
efficient cause is found, leaves us in doubt whether it is not a
merely subjective view, an aspect conditioned by our point of
view. In this respect, however, it may be compared to many
works of art; for example, to coarse mosaics, theatre decorations,
and to the god Apennine at Pratolino, near Florence, composed
of large masses of rock, all of which only produce their effect
at a distance, and vanish when we come near, because instead
of them the efficient cause of their appearance now becomes[089]
visible: but the forms are yet actually existent, and are no mere
imagination. Analogous to this, then, are the final causes in
unorganised nature, if the efficient causes appear. Indeed, those
who take a wide view of things would perhaps allow it to pass if
I added that something similar is the case with omens.
For the rest, if any one desires to misuse the external design,
which, as has been said, always remains ambiguous for physi-
co-theological demonstrations, which is done even at the present
day, though it is to be hoped only by Englishmen, there are
in this class enough examples in contrarium, thus ateleological
instances, to derange his conception. One of the strongest is
presented by the unsuitableness of sea-water for drinking, in
consequence of which man is never more exposed to the danger
of dying of thirst than in the midst of the greatest mass of water
on his planet. “Why, then, does the sea need to be salt?” let us
ask our Englishman.

That in unorganised nature the final causes entirely withdraw
into the background, so that an explanation from them alone is
here no longer valid, but the efficient causes are rather indispensably required, depends upon the fact that the will which objectifies itself here also no longer appears in individuals which
constitute a whole for themselves, but in forces of nature and
their action, whereby end and means are too far separated for
their relation to be clear and for us to recognise a manifestation
of will in it. This already occurs in organised nature, in a certain
degree, when the design is an external one, i.e., the end lies
in one individual and the means in another. Yet even here it
remains unquestionable so long as the two belong to the same
species, indeed it then becomes the more striking. Here we have
first to count the reciprocally adapted organisation of the genitals
of the two sexes, and then also many circumstances that assist
the propagation of the species, for example, in the case of the
Lampyris noctiluca (the glowworm) the circumstance that only [090]
the male, which does not shine, has wings to enable it to seek
out the female; the wingless female, on the other hand, since
it only comes out in the evening, possesses the phosphorescent
light, so that the male may be able to find it. Yet in the case
of the Lampyris Italica both sexes shine, which is an instance
of the natural luxury of the South. But a striking, because quite
special, example of the kind of design we are speaking of is
afforded by the discovery made by Geoffroy St. Hilaire, in his
last years, of the more exact nature of the sucking apparatus of
the cetacea. Since all sucking requires the action of respiration,
it can only take place in the respirable medium itself, and not
under water, where, however, the sucking young of the whale
hangs on to the teats of the mother; now to meet this the whole
mammary apparatus of the cetacea is so modified that it has
become an injecting organ, and placed in the mouth of the young
injects the milk into it without it requiring to suck. When, on
the contrary, the individual that affords essential help to another
belongs to an entirely different species, and even to another
kingdom of nature, we will doubt this external design just as in
unorganised nature; unless it is evident that the maintenance of
the species depends upon it. But this is the case with many plants whose fructification only takes place by means of insects, which either bear the pollen to the stigma or bend the stamina to the
pistil. The common barberry, many kinds of iris, and Aristolo-
chia Clematitis cannot fructify themselves at all without the help
of insects (Chr. Cour. Sprengel, Entdecktes Geheimniss, &c.,
1793; Wildenow, Grundriss der Kräuterkunde, 353). Very many
diœcia, monœcia, and polygamia are in the same position. The
reciprocal support which the plant and the insect worlds receive
from each other will be found admirably described in Burdach's
large Physiology, vol. i. § 263. He very beautifully adds: “This
is no mechanical assistance, no make-shift, as if nature had made
the plants yesterday, and had committed an error which she[091]
tries to correct to-day through the insect; it is rather a deep-lying
sympathy between the plant and the animal worlds. It ought to
reveal the identity of the two. Both, children of one mother,
ought to subsist with each other and through each other.” And
further on: “But the organised world stands in such a sympathy
with the unorganised world also,” &c. A proof of this consensus
naturæ is also afforded by the observation communicated in the
second volume of the “Introduction into Entomology” by Kirby
and Spence, that the insect eggs that pass the winter attached to
the twigs of the trees, which serve as nourishment for their larvæ,
are hatched exactly at the time at which the twig buds; thus, for
example, the aphis of the birch a month earlier than that of the
ash. Similarly, that the insects of perennial plants pass the winter
upon these as eggs; but those of mere annuals, since they cannot
do this, in the state of pupæ.
Three great men have entirely rejected teleology, or the expla-
nation from final causes, and many small men have echoed them.
These three are, Lucretius, Bacon of Verulam, and Spinoza. But
in the case of all three we know clearly enough the source of
this aversion, namely, that they regarded it as inseparable from
speculative theology, of which, however, they entertained so
great a distrust (which Bacon indeed prudently sought to conceal) that they wanted to give it a wide berth. We find Leibnitz also entirely involved in this prejudice, for, with characteristic
naïveté, he expresses it as something self-evident in his Lettre
à M. Nicaise (Spinozæ op. ed Paulus, vol. ii. p. 672): “Les
causes finales, ou ce qui est la même chose, la consideration de
la sagesse divine dans l'ordre des choses.” (The devil also même
chose!) At the same point of view we find, indeed, Englishmen
even at the present day. The Bridgewater-Treatise-men—Lord
Brougham, &c.—nay, even Richard Owen also, in his “Ostéolo-
gie Comparée,” thinks precisely as Leibnitz, which I have already
found fault with in the first volume. To all these teleology is at [092]
once also theology, and at every instance of design recognised
in nature, instead of thinking and learning to understand nature,
they break at once into the childish cry, “Design! design!” then
strike up the refrain of their old wives' philosophy, and stop their
ears against all rational arguments, such as, however, the great
Hume has already advanced against them.5
The ignorance of the Kantian philosophy now, after seventy
years, which is really a disgrace to Englishmen of learning, is
principally responsible for this whole outcast position of the
English; and this ignorance, again, depends, at least in great
measure, upon the nefarious influence of the detestable English
clergy, with whom stultification of every kind is a thing after
their own hearts, so that only they may be able still to hold the
English nation, otherwise so intelligent, involved in the most de-
grading bigotry; therefore, inspired by the basest obscurantism,
5 Let me here remark in passing that, judging from the German literature
since Kant, one would necessarily believe that Hume's whole wisdom had
consisted in his obviously false scepticism with regard to the law of causality,
for this alone is everywhere referred to. In order to know Hume one must read
his “Natural History of Religion” and his “Dialogues on Natural Religion.”
There one sees him in his greatness, and these, together with Essay 21 “Of
National Characters,” are the writings on account of which—I know of nothing
that says more for his fame—even to the present day, he is everywhere hated
by the English clergy.

they oppose with all their might the education of the people,
the investigation of nature, nay, the advancement of all human
knowledge in general; and both by means of their connections
and by means of their scandalous, unwarrantable wealth, which
increases the misery of the people, they extend their influence
even to university teachers and authors, who accordingly (for ex-
ample, Th. Brown, “On Cause and Effect”) resort to suppressions
and perversions of every kind simply in order to avoid opposing
even in a distant manner that “cold superstition” (as Pückler very
happily designates their religion, or the current arguments in its
favour).[093]

But, on the other hand, the three great men of whom we are
speaking, since they lived long before the dawn of the Kantian
philosophy, are to be pardoned for their distrust of teleology on
account of its origin; yet even Voltaire regarded the physico-the-
ological proof as irrefutable. In order, however, to go into this
somewhat more fully: first of all, the polemic of Lucretius (iv.
824-858) against teleology is so crude and clumsy that it refutes
itself and convinces us of the opposite. But as regards Bacon (De
augm. scient., iii. 4), he makes, in the first place, no distinction
with reference to the use of final causes between organised and
unorganised nature (which is yet just the principal matter), for,
in his examples of final causes, he mixes the two up together.
Then he banishes final causes from physics to metaphysics; but
the latter is for him, as it is still for many at the present day,
identical with speculative theology. From this, then, he regards
final causes as inseparable, and goes so far in this respect that he
blames Aristotle because he has made great use of final causes,
yet without connecting them with speculative theology (which I
shall have occasion immediately especially to praise). Finally,
Spinoza (Eth. i. prop. 36, appendix) makes it abundantly clear
that he identifies teleology so entirely with physico-theology,
against which he expresses himself with bitterness, that he ex-
plains Natura nihil frustra agere: hoc est, quod in usum hominum

non sit: similarly, Omnia naturalia tanquam ad suum utile me-
dia considerant, et credunt aliquem alium esse, qui illa media
paraverit; and also: Hinc statuerunt, Deos omnia in usum homi-
num fecisse et dirigere. Upon this, then, he bases his assertion:
Naturam finem nullum sibi præfixum habere et omnes causas
finales nihil, nisi humana esse figmenta. His aim merely was
to block the path of theism; and he had quite rightly recognised
the physico-theological proof as its strongest weapon. But it was
reserved for Kant really to refute this proof, and for me to give
the correct exposition of its material, whereby I have satisfied [094]
the maxim: Est enim verum index sui et falsi. But Spinoza did
not know how else to help himself but by the desperate stroke of
denying teleology itself, thus design in the works of nature—an
assertion the monstrosity of which is at once evident to every
one who has gained any accurate knowledge of organised nature.
This limited point of view of Spinoza, together with his complete
ignorance of nature, sufficiently prove his entire incompetence
in this matter, and the folly of those who, upon his authority,
believe they must judge contemptuously of final causes.

Aristotle, who just here shows his brilliant side, contrasts
very advantageously with these modern philosophers. He goes
unprejudiced to nature, knows of no physico-theology—such a
thing has never entered his mind,—and he has never looked at
the world for the purpose of seeing whether it was a bungled
piece of work. He is in his heart pure from all this, for he also sets
up hypotheses as to the origin of animals and men (De generat.
anim., iii. 11) without lighting upon the physico-theological train
of thought. He always says: “! ∆≈√π¬ ¿øπμπ (natura facit), never
! ∆≈√π¬ ¿μ¿øπ∑ƒ±π” (natura facta est). But after he has truly and
diligently studied nature, he finds that it everywhere proceeds
teleologically, and he says: “º±ƒ∑Ω A¡…ºμΩ ø≈¥μΩ ¿øπø≈√±Ω
ƒ∑Ω ∆≈√πΩ” (naturam nihil frustra facere cernimus), De respir.,
c. 10; and in the books, De partibus animalium, which are a
comparative anatomy: “ü≈¥μ ¿μ¡πμ¡≥øΩ ø≈¥μΩ, ø≈ƒμ º±ƒ∑Ω ! ∆≈√π¬ ¿øπμπ.—) ∆≈√π¬ Ωμ∫± ƒø≈ ¿øπμπ ¿±Ωƒ±.—†±Ωƒ±«ø≈ ¥μ

greater length, p. 633 and 645 of the Berlin quarto edition, and
also De incessu animalium, c. 2: “) ∆≈√π¬ ø≈¥μΩ ¿øπμπ º±ƒ∑Ω,

iis, quæ cuique animalium generis essentiæ contingunt, id quod
optimum est.) But he expressly recommends teleology at the end
of the books De generatione animalium, and blames Democritus
for having denied it, which is just what Bacon, in his prejudice,
praises in him. Especially, however, in the “Physica,” ii. 8, p.
198, Aristotle speaks ex professo of final causes, and establishes
them as the true principle of the investigation of nature. In fact,
every good and regular mind must, in considering organised
nature, hit upon teleology, but unless it is determined by the pre-
conceived opinions, by no means either upon physico-theology
or upon the anthropo-teleology condemned by Spinoza. 

With
regard to Aristotle generally, I wish further to draw attention
to the fact here, that his teaching, so far as it concerns unor-
ganised nature, is very defective and unserviceable, as in the
fundamental conceptions of mechanics and physics he accepts
the most gross errors, which is the less pardonable, since before
him the Pythagoreans and Empedocles had been upon the right
path and had taught much better. Empedocles indeed, as we
learn from Aristotle's second book, De cœlo (c. 1, p. 284), had already grasped the conception of a tangential force arising
from rotation, and counteracting gravity, which Aristotle again
rejects. Quite the reverse, however, is Aristotle's relation to the
investigation of organised nature. This is his field; here the
wealth of his knowledge, the keenness of his observation, nay,
sometimes the depth of his insight, astonish us. Thus, to give
just one example, he already knew the antagonism in which in
the ruminants the horns and the teeth of the upper jaw stand to
each other, on account of which, therefore, the latter are wanting
where the former are found, and conversely (De partib. anim.,
iii. 2). Hence then, also his correct estimation of final causes.
