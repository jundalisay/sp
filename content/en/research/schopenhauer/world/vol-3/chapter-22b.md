Thus knowledge and multiplicity, or individuation, stand and fall together, for they reciprocally condition each other. Hence it must be inferred that, beyond the phenomenon in the true being of all things, to which time and space, and consequently also multiplicity, must be foreign, there can also be no knowledge. Buddhism defines this as Pratschna Paramita, i.e., that which is beyond all knowledge (J. J. Schmidt, “On the Maha-Jana and Pratschna Paramita”). A “knowledge of things in themselves,” in the strictest sense of the word, would accordingly be already impossible from the fact that where the thing in itself begins knowledge ceases, and all knowledge is essentially concerned only with phenomena.

For it springs from a limitation, by which it is made necessary, in order to extend the limits.

For the objective consideration the brain is the efflorescence of the organism; therefore only where the latter has attained its highest perfection and complexity does the brain appear in its greatest
development. 

But in the preceding chapter we have recognised
the organism as the objectification of the will; therefore the brain
also, as a part of it, must belong to this objectification. Further,
from the fact that the organism is only the visibility of the will,
thus in itself is the will, I have deduced that every affection of
the organism at once and directly affects the will, i.e., is felt as
agreeable or painful. Yet, with the heightening of sensibility,
in the higher development of the nervous system, the possibility
arises that in the nobler, i.e., the objective, organs of sense
(sight and hearing) the exquisitely delicate affections proper to
them are perceived without in themselves and directly affect-
ing the will, that is, without being either painful or agreeable,
and that therefore they appear in consciousness as indifferent,
merely perceived, sensations. But in the brain this heightening
of sensibility reaches such a high degree that upon received[010]
impressions of sense a reaction even takes place, which does not
proceed directly from the will, but is primarily a spontaneity of
the function of understanding, which makes the transition from
the directly perceived sensation of the senses to its cause; and
since the brain then at once produces the form of space, there thus
arises the perception of an external object. We may therefore
regard the point at which the understanding makes the transition
from the mere sensation upon the retina, which is still a mere
affection of the body and therefore of the will, to the cause of
that sensation, which it projects by means of its form of space,
as something external and different from its own body, as the
boundary between the world as will and the world as idea, or as the birthplace of the latter. In man, however, the spontaneity of the activity of the brain, which in the last instance is certainly
conferred by the will, goes further than mere perception and
immediate comprehension of causal relations. It extends to the
construction of abstract conceptions out of these perceptions, and
to operating with these conceptions, i.e., to thinking, as that in
which his reason consists. Thoughts are therefore furthest re-
moved from the affections of the body, which, since the body is
the objectification of the will, may, through increased intensity,
pass at once into pain, even in the organs of sense. Accordingly
idea and thought may also be regarded as the efflorescence of
the will, because they spring from the highest perfection and
development of the organism; but the organism, in itself and
apart from the idea, is the will. Of course, in my explanation, the
existence of the body presupposes the world of idea; inasmuch
as it also, as body or real object, is only in this world; and, on the
other hand, the idea itself just as much presupposes the body, for
it arises only through the function of an organ of the body. That
which lies at the foundation of the whole phenomenon, that in it
which alone has being in itself and is original, is exclusively the
will; for it is the will which through this very process assumes [011]
the form of the idea, i.e., enters the secondary existence of an
objective world, or the sphere of the knowable. Philosophers
before Kant, with few exceptions, approached the explanation of
the origin of our knowledge from the wrong side. They set out
from a so-called soul, an existence whose inner nature and pecu-
liar function consisted in thinking, and indeed quite specially in
abstract thinking, with mere conceptions, which belonged to it
the more completely the further they lay from all perception. (I
beg to refer here to the note at the end of § 6 of my prize essay on
the foundation of morals.) 

This soul has in some inconceivable
manner entered the body, and there it is only disturbed in its
pure thinking, first by impressions of the senses and perceptions,
still more by the desires which these excite, and finally by the emotions, nay, passions, to which these desires develop; while
the characteristic and original element of this soul is mere ab-
stract thinking, and given up to this it has only universals, inborn
conceptions, and æternæ veritates for its objects, and leaves
everything perceptible lying far below it. Hence, also, arises the
contempt with which even now “sensibility” and the "sensuous"
are referred to by professors of philosophy, nay, are even made
the chief source of immorality, while it is just the senses which
are the genuine and innocent source of all our knowledge, from
which all thinking must first borrow its material, for in combi-
nation with the a priori functions of the intellect they produce
the perception. One might really suppose that in speaking of
sensibility these gentlemen always think only of the pretended
sixth sense of the French. Thus, as we have said, in the process of
knowledge, its ultimate product was made that which is first and
original in it, and accordingly the matter was taken hold of by
the wrong end. According to my exposition, the intellect springs
from the organism, and thereby from the will, and hence could
not be without the latter. Thus, without the will it would also[012]
find no material to occupy it; for everything that is knowable is
just the objectification of the will.
But not only the perception of the external world, or the
consciousness of other things, is conditioned by the brain and
its functions, but also self-consciousness. The will in itself is
without consciousness, and remains so in the greater part of its
phenomena. The secondary world of idea must be added, in order
that it may become conscious of itself, just as light only becomes
visible through the bodies which reflect it, and without them loses
itself in darkness without producing any effect. Because the will,
with the aim of comprehending its relations to the external world,
produces a brain in the animal individual, the consciousness of
its own self arises in it, by means of the subject of knowledge,
which comprehends things as existing and the ego as willing.

The sensibility, which reaches its highest degree in the brain, but is yet dispersed through its different parts, must first of all
collect all the rays of its activity, concentrate them, as it were,
in a focus, which, however, does not lie without, as in the case
of the concave mirror, but within, as in the convex mirror. With
this point now it first describes the line of time, upon which,
therefore, all that it presents to itself as idea must exhibit itself,
and which is the first and most essential form of all knowledge,
or the form of inner sense. This focus of the whole activity of
the brain is what Kant called the synthetic unity of apperception
(cf. vol. ii. p. 475). Only by means of this does the will become
conscious of itself, because this focus of the activity of the brain,
or that which knows, apprehends itself as identical with its own
basis, from which it springs, that which wills; and thus the ego
arises. Yet this focus of the brain activity remains primarily a
mere subject of knowledge, and as such capable of being the cold
and impartial spectator, the mere guide and counsellor of the
will, and also of comprehending the external world in a purely
objective manner, without reference to the will and its weal or [013]
woe. But whenever it turns within, it recognises the will as the
basis of its own phenomenon, and therefore combines with it in
the consciousness of an ego. That focus of the activity of the
brain (or the subject of knowledge) is indeed, as an indivisible
point, simple, but yet is not on this account a substance (soul),
but a mere condition or state. That of which it is itself a condition
or state can only be known by it indirectly, as it were through
reflection. But the ceasing of this state must not be regarded
as the annihilation of that of which it is a state. This knowing
and conscious ego is related to the will, which is the basis of its
phenomenal appearance, as the picture in the focus of a concave
mirror is related to the mirror itself, and has, like that picture,
only a conditioned, nay, really a merely apparent, reality. Far
from being the absolutely first (as, for example, Fichte teaches),
it is at bottom tertiary, for it presupposes the organism, and the
organism presupposes the will. I admit that all that is said here is really only an image and a figure, and in part also hypothetical;
but we stand at a point to which thought can scarcely reach, not
to speak of proof. 

I therefore request the reader to compare with
this what I have adduced at length on this subject in chapter 20.
Now, although the true being of everything that exists consists
in its will, and knowledge together with consciousness are only
added at the higher grades of the phenomenon as something
secondary, yet we find that the difference which the presence
and the different degree of consciousness places between one
being and another is exceedingly great and of important results.
The subjective existence of the plant we must think of as a weak
analogue, a mere shadow of comfort and discomfort; and even in
this exceedingly weak degree the plant knows only of itself, not
of anything outside of it. On the other hand, even the lowest ani-
mal standing next to it is forced by increased and more definitely
specified wants to extend the sphere of its existence beyond the[014]
limits of its own body. This takes place through knowledge. It
has a dim apprehension of its immediate surroundings, out of
which the motives for its action with a view to its own mainte-
nance arise. Thus accordingly the medium of motives appears,
and this is—the world existing objectively in time and space, the
world as idea, however weak, obscure, and dimly dawning this
first and lowest example of it may be. But it imprints itself ever
more and more distinctly, ever wider and deeper, in proportion
as in the ascending scale of animal organisations the brain is
ever more perfectly produced. This progress in the development
of the brain, thus of the intellect, and of the clearness of the
idea, at each of these ever higher grades is, however, brought
about by the constantly increasing and more complicated wants
of this phenomenon of the will. This must always first afford
the occasion for it, for without necessity nature (i.e., the will
which objectifies itself in it) produces nothing, least of all the
hardest of its productions—a more perfect brain: in consequence
of its lex parsimoniæ: natura nihil agit frustra et nihil facit supervacaneum. It has provided every animal with the organs
which are necessary for its sustenance and the weapons necessary
for its conflict, as I have shown at length in my work, “Ueber
den Willen in der Natur,” under the heading, “Vergleichende
Anatomie.” According to this measure, therefore, it imparts to
each the most important of those organs concerned with what is
without, the brain, with its function the intellect. The more com-
plicated, through higher development, its organisation became,
the more multifarious and specially determined did its wants also
become, and consequently the more difficult and the more depen-
dent upon opportunity was the provision of what would satisfy
them. 

Thus there was needed here a wider range of sight, a more
accurate comprehension, a more correct distinction of things
in the external world, in all their circumstances and relations.
Accordingly we see the faculty of forming ideas, and its organs, [015]
brain, nerves, and special senses, appear ever more perfect the
higher we advance in the scale of animals; and in proportion as
the cerebral system develops, the external world appears ever
more distinct, many-sided, and complete in consciousness. The
comprehension of it now demands ever more attention, and ul-
timately in such a degree that sometimes its relation to the will
must momentarily be lost sight of in order that it may take place
more purely and correctly. Quite definitely this first appears
in the case of man. With him alone does a pure separation of
knowing and willing take place. This is an important point, which
I merely touch on here in order to indicate its position, and be
able to take it up again later. But, like all the rest, nature takes this
last step also in extending and perfecting the brain, and thereby
in increasing the powers of knowledge, only in consequence of
the increased needs, thus in the service of the will. What this
aims at and attains in man is indeed essentially the same, and
not more than what is also its goal in the brutes—nourishment
and propagation. But the requisites for the attainment of this
goal became so much increased in number, and of so much higher quality and greater definiteness through the organisation
of man, that a very much more considerable heightening of the
intellect than the previous steps demanded was necessary, or at
least was the easiest means of reaching the end. But since now
the intellect, in accordance with its nature, is a tool of the most
various utility, and is equally applicable to the most different
kinds of ends, nature, true to her spirit of parsimony, could now
meet through it alone all the demands of the wants which had
now become so manifold. Therefore she sent forth man without
clothing, without natural means of protection or weapons of
attack, nay, with relatively little muscular power, combined with
great frailty and little endurance of adverse influences and wants,
in reliance upon that one great tool, in addition to which she
had only to retain the hands from the next grade below him, the
ape. But through the predominating intellect which here appears[016]
not only is the comprehension of motives, their multiplicity,
and in general the horizon of the aims infinitely increased, but
also the distinctness with which the will is conscious of itself is
enhanced in the highest degree in consequence of the clearness
of the whole consciousness which has been brought about, which
is supported by the capacity for abstract knowledge, and now
attains to complete reflectiveness. But thereby, and also through
the vehemence of the will, which is necessarily presupposed
as the supporter of such a heightened intellect, an intensifying
of all the emotions appears, and indeed the possibility of the
passions, which, properly speaking, are unknown to the brute.
For the vehemence of the will keeps pace with the advance of
intelligence, because this advance really always springs from
the increased needs and pressing demands of the will: besides
this, however, the two reciprocally support each other. Thus the
vehemence of the character corresponds to the greater energy of
the beating of the heart and the circulation of the blood, which
physically heighten the activity of the brain. On the other hand,
the clearness of the intelligence intensifies the emotions, which
Chapter XXII. Objective View of the Intellect. 17
are called forth by the outward circumstances, by means of the
more vivid apprehension of the latter. Hence, for example,
young calves quietly allow themselves to be packed in a cart and
carried off; but young lions, if they are only separated from their
mother, remain permanently restless, and roar unceasingly from
morning to night; children in such a position would cry and vex
themselves almost to death. The vivaciousness and impetuosity
of the ape is in exact proportion to its greatly developed intellect.
It depends just on this reciprocal relationship that man is, in
general, capable of far greater sorrows than the brute, but also
of greater joy in satisfied and pleasing emotions. In the same
way his higher intelligence makes him more sensible to ennui
than the brute; but it also becomes, if he is individually very complete, an inexhaustible source of entertainment. Thus, as a
whole, the manifestation of the will in man is related to that in
the brute of the higher species, as a note that has been struck
to its fifth pitched two or three octaves lower. But between the
different kinds of brutes also the differences of intellect, and
thereby of consciousness, are great and endlessly graduated. The
mere analogy of consciousness which we must yet attribute to
plants will be related to the still far deader subjective nature of an
unorganised body, very much as the consciousness of the lowest
species of animals is related to the quasi consciousness of plants.
We may present to our imagination the innumerable gradations
in the degree of consciousness under the figure of the different
velocity of points which are unequally distant from the centre of
a revolving sphere. But the most correct, and indeed, as our third
book teaches, the natural figure of that gradation is afforded us
by the scale in its whole compass from the lowest audible note
to the highest. It is, however, the grade of consciousness which
determines the grade of existence of a being. For every imme-
diate existence is subjective: the objective existence is in the
consciousness of another, thus only for this other, consequently
quite indirect. Through the grade of consciousness beings are as different as through the will they are alike, for the will is what is
common to them all.

But what we have now considered between the plant and the
animal, and then between the different species of animals, occurs
also between man and man. Here also that which is secondary,
the intellect, by means of the clearness of consciousness and
distinctness of knowledge which depends upon it, constitutes
a fundamental and immeasurably great difference in the whole
manner of the existence, and thereby in the grade of it. The higher
the consciousness has risen, the more distinct and connected are
the thoughts, the clearer the perceptions the more intense the
sensations. Through it everything gains more depth: emotion,[018]
sadness, joy, and sorrow. Commonplace blockheads are not even
capable of real joy: they live on in dull insensibility. While
to one man his consciousness only presents his own existence,
together with the motives which must be apprehended for the
purpose of sustaining and enlivening it, in a bare comprehension
of the external world, it is to another a camera obscura in which
the macrocosm exhibits itself:
“He feels that he holds a little world
Brooding in his brain,
That it begins to work and to live,
That he fain would give it forth.”

The difference of the whole manner of existence which the
extremes of the gradation of intellectual capacity establish be-
tween man and man is so great that that between a king and a day
labourer seems small in comparison. And here also, as in the case
of the species of animals, a connection between the vehemence
of the will and the height of the intellect can be shown. Genius
is conditioned by a passionate temperament, and a phlegmatic
genius is inconceivable: it seems as if an exceptionally vehement,
thus a violently longing, will must be present if nature is to give an abnormally heightened intellect, as corresponding to it; while
the merely physical account of this points to the greater energy
with which the arteries of the head move the brain and increase
its turgescence. Certainly, however, the quantity, quality, and
form of the brain itself is the other and incomparably more rare
condition of genius. On the other hand, phlegmatic persons are
as a rule of very moderate mental power; and thus the northern,
cold-blooded, and phlegmatic nations are in general noticeably
inferior in mind to the southern vivacious and passionate peoples;
although, as Bacon2 has most pertinently remarked, if once a
man of a northern nation is highly gifted by nature, he can then
reach a grade which no southern ever attains to. It is accordingly
as perverse as it is common to take the great minds of different [019]
nations as the standard for comparing their mental powers: for
that is just attempting to prove the rule by the exceptions. It is
rather the great majority of each nation that one has to consider:
for one swallow does not make a summer. We have further to
remark here that that very passionateness which is a condition of
genius, bound up with its vivid apprehension of things, produces
in practical life, where the will comes into play, and especially
in the case of sudden occurrences, so great an excitement of the
emotions that it disturbs and confuses the intellect; while the
phlegmatic man in such a case still retains the full use of his
mental faculties, though they are much more limited, and then
accomplishes much more with them than the greatest genius can
achieve. Accordingly a passionate temperament is favourable to
the original quality of the intellect, but a phlegmatic temperament
to its use. Therefore genius proper is only for theoretical achieve-
ments, for which it can choose and await its time, which will just
be the time at which the will is entirely at rest, and no waves
disturb the clear mirror of the comprehension of the world. 

On
the other hand, genius is ill adapted and unserviceable for practical life, and is therefore for the most part unfortunate. Goethe's “Tasso” is written from this point of view. As now genius
proper depends upon the absolute strength of the intellect, which
must be purchased by a correspondingly excessive vehemence
of disposition, so, on the other hand, the great pre-eminence in
practical life that makes generals and statesmen depends upon
the relative strength of the intellect, thus upon the highest de-
gree of it that can be attained without too great excitability of
the emotions, and too great vehemence of character, and that
therefore can hold its own even in the storm. Great firmness
of will and constancy of mind, together with a capable and fine
understanding, are here sufficient; and whatever goes beyond
this acts detrimentally, for too great a development of the in-[020]
telligence directly impedes firmness of character and resolution
of will. Hence this kind of eminence is not so abnormal, and is
a hundred times less rare than the former kind; and accordingly
we see great generals and great ministers appear in every age,
whenever the merely external conditions are favourable to their
efficiency. Great poets and philosophers, on the other hand, leave
centuries waiting for them; and yet humanity may be contented
even with this rare appearance of them, for their works remain,
and do not exist only for the present, like the achievements of
those other men. It is also quite in keeping with the law of
the parsimony of nature referred to above that it bestows great
eminence of mind in general upon very few, and genius only
as the rarest of all exceptions, while it equips the great mass of
the human race with no more mental power than is required for
the maintenance of the individual and the species. For the great,
and through their very satisfaction, constantly increasing needs
of the human race make it necessary that the great majority of
men should pass their lives in occupations of a coarsely physical
and entirely mechanical description. And what would be the
use to them of an active mind, a glowing imagination, a subtle
understanding, and a profoundly penetrating intellect? These
Chapter XXII. Objective View of the Intellect. 21
would only make them useless and unhappy. Therefore nature
has thus gone about the most costly of all her productions in
the least extravagant manner. In order not to judge unfairly one
ought also to settle definitely one's expectations of the mental
achievements of men generally from this point of view, and
to regard, for example, even learned men, since as a rule they
have become so only by the force of outward circumstances,
primarily as men whom nature really intended to be tillers of the
soil; indeed even professors of philosophy ought to be estimated
according to this standard, and then their achievements will be
found to come up to all fair expectations. It is worth noticing that
in the south, where the necessities of life press less severely upon [021]
the human race, and more leisure is allowed, the mental faculties
even of the multitude also become more active and finer. It is
physiologically noteworthy that the preponderance of the mass
of the brain over that of the spinal cord and the nerves, which,
according to Sömmerring's acute discovery, affords the true and
closest measure of the degree of intelligence both of species
of brutes and of individual men, at the same time increases the
direct power of moving, the agility of the limbs; because, through
the great inequality of the relation, the dependence of all motor
nerves upon the brain becomes more decided; and besides this
the cerebellum, which is the primary controller of movements,
shares the qualitative perfection of the cerebrum; thus through
both all voluntary movements gain greater facility, rapidity, and
manageableness, and by the concentration of the starting-point of
all activity that arises which Lichtenberg praises in Garrick: “that
he appeared to be present in all the muscles of his body.” Hence
clumsiness in the movement of the body indicates clumsiness in
the movement of the thoughts, and will be regarded as a sign of
stupidity both in individuals and nations, as much as sleepiness
of the countenance and vacancy of the glance. Another symptom
of the physiological state of the case referred to is the fact that
many persons are obliged at once to stand still whenever their conversation with any one who is walking with them begins to
gain some connection; because their brain, as soon as it has to
link together a few thoughts, has no longer as much power over
as is required to keep the limbs in motion by means of the motory
nerves, so closely is everything measured with them.
It results from this whole objective consideration of the intel-
lect and its origin, that it is designed for the comprehension of
those ends upon the attainment of which depends the individual
life and its propagation, but by no means for deciphering the
inner nature of things and of the world, which exists indepen-
dently of the knower. What to the plant is the susceptibility[022]
to light, in consequence of which it guides its growth in the
direction of it, that is, in kind, the knowledge of the brute, nay,
even of man, although in degree it is increased in proportion
as the needs of each of these beings demand. With them all
apprehension remains a mere consciousness of their relations to
other things, and is by no means intended to present again in the
consciousness of the knower the peculiar, absolutely real nature
of these things. Rather, as springing from the will, the intellect
is also only designed for its service, thus for the apprehension of
motives; it is adapted for this, and is therefore of a thoroughly
practical tendency. This also holds good if we conceive the
significance of life as ethical; for in this regard too we find man
knowing only for the benefit of his conduct. Such a faculty of
knowledge, existing exclusively for practical ends, will from its
nature always comprehend only the relations of things to each
other, but not the inner nature of them, as it is in itself. But to
regard the complex of these relations as the absolute nature of
the world as it is in itself, and the manner in which it necessarily
exhibits itself in accordance with the laws predisposed in the
brain as the eternal laws of the existence of all things, and then to
construct ontology, cosmology, and theology in accordance with
this view—this was really the old fundamental error, of which
Kant's teaching has made an end. Here, then, our objective, and therefore for the most part physiological consideration of the intellect meets his transcendental consideration of it; nay,
appears in a certain sense even as an a priori insight into it;
for, from a point of view which we have taken up outside of
it, our objective view enables us to know in its origin, and
therefore as necessary, what that transcendental consideration,
starting from facts of consciousness, presents only as a matter
of fact. For it follows from our objective consideration of the
intellect, that the world as idea, as it exists stretched out in space
and time, and moves on regularly according to the strict law [023]
of causality, is primarily only a physiological phenomenon, a
function of the brain, which brings it about, certainly upon the
occasion of certain external stimuli, but yet in conformity with
its own laws. Accordingly it is beforehand a matter of course,
that what goes on in this function itself, and therefore through it
and for it, must by no means be regarded as the nature of things
in themselves, which exist independently of it and are entirely
different from it, but primarily exhibits only the mode or manner
of this function itself, which can always receive only a very
subordinate modification through that which exists completely
independently of it, and sets it in motion as a stimulus. As, then,
Locke claimed for the organs of sense all that comes into our
apprehension by means of the sensation, in order to deny that it
belongs to things in themselves, so Kant, with the same intention,
and pursuing the same path further, has proved all that makes
perception proper possible, thus space, time, and causality, to
be functions of the brain; although he has refrained from using
this physiological expression, to which, however, our present
method of investigation, coming from the opposite side, the side
of the real, necessarily leads us. Kant arrived upon his analytical
path at the result that what we know are mere phenomena. What
this mysterious expression really means becomes clear from our
objective and genetic investigation of the intellect. 

The phenomena are the motives for the aims of individual will as they exhibit themselves in the intellect which the will has produced for
this purpose (which itself appears as a phenomenon objectively,
as the brain), and which, when comprehended, as far as one
can follow their concatenation, afford us in their connection the
world which extends itself objectively in time and space, and
which I call the world as idea. Moreover, from our point of
view, the objectionable element vanishes which in the Kantian
doctrine arises from the fact that, because the intellect knows[024]
merely phenomena instead of things as they are in themselves,
nay, in consequence of this is led astray into paralogisms and
unfounded hypostases by means of “sophistications, not of men
but of the reason itself, from which even the wisest does not free
himself, and if, perhaps indeed after much trouble, he avoids
error, can yet never get quit of the illusion which unceasing-
ly torments and mocks him”—because of all this, I say, the
appearance arises that our intellect is intentionally designed to
lead us into errors. For the objective view of the intellect given
here, which contains a genesis of it, makes it conceivable that,
being exclusively intended for practical ends, it is merely the
medium of motives, and therefore fulfils its end by an accurate
presentation of these, and that if we undertake to discover the
nature of things in themselves, from the manifold phenomena
which here exhibit themselves objectively to us, and their laws,
we do this at our own peril and on our own responsibility. We
have recognised that the original inner force of nature, without
knowledge and working in the dark, which, if it has worked
its way up to self-consciousness, reveals itself to this as will,
attains to this grade only by the production of an animal brain
and of knowledge, as its function, whereupon the phenomenon
of the world of perception arises in this brain. But to explain
this mere brain phenomenon, with the conformity to law which
is invariably connected with its functions, as the objective inner
nature of the world and the things in it, which is independent of
the brain, existing before and after it, is clearly a spring which nothing warrants us in making. From this mundus phœnomenon,
however, from this perception which arises under such a variety
of conditions, all our conceptions are drawn. They have all their
content from it, or even only in relation to it. Therefore, as Kant
says, they are only for immanent, not for transcendental, use; that
is to say, these conceptions of ours, this first material of thought,
and consequently still more the judgments which result from [025]
their combination, are unfitted for the task of thinking the nature
of things in themselves, and the true connection of the world and
existence; indeed, to undertake this is analogous to expressing
the stereometrical content of a body in square inches. For our in-
tellect, originally only intended to present to an individual will its
paltry aims, comprehends accordingly mere relations of things,
and does not penetrate to their inner being, to their real nature.
It is therefore a merely superficial force, clings to the surface
of things, and apprehends mere species transitivas, not the true
being of things. From this it arises that we cannot understand and
comprehend any single thing, even the simplest and smallest,
through and through, but something remains entirely inexplicable
to us in each of them. Just because the intellect is a product of
nature, and is therefore only intended for its ends, the Christian
mystics have very aptly called it “the light of nature,” and driven
it back within its limits; for nature is the object to which alone
it is the subject. The thought from which the Critique of Pure
Reason has sprung really lies already at the foundation of this
expression. That we cannot comprehend the world on the direct
path, i.e., through the uncritical, direct application of the intellect
and its data, but when we reflect upon it become ever more
deeply involved in insoluble mysteries, points to the fact that the
intellect, thus knowledge itself, is secondary, a mere product,
brought about by the development of the inner being of the world,
which consequently till then preceded it, and it at last appeared
as a breaking through to the light out of the obscure depths of the
unconscious striving the nature of which exhibits itself as will to the self-consciousness which now at once arises. 

That which preceded knowledge as its condition, whereby it first became
possible, thus its own basis, cannot be directly comprehended by
it; as the eye cannot see itself. It is rather the relations of one
existence to another, exhibiting themselves upon the surface of[026]
things, which alone are its affair, and are so only by means of the
apparatus of the intellect, its forms, space, time, and causality.
Just because the world has made itself without the assistance of
knowledge, its whole being does not enter into knowledge, but
knowledge presupposes the existence of the world; on which
account the origin of the world does not lie within its sphere. It
is accordingly limited to the relations between the things which
lie before it, and is thus sufficient for the individual will, for the
service of which alone it appeared. For the intellect is, as has
been shown, conditioned by nature, lies in it, belongs to it, and
cannot therefore place itself over against it as something quite
foreign to it, in order thus to take up into itself its whole nature,
absolutely, objectively, and thoroughly. It can, if fortune favours
it, understand all that is in nature, but not nature itself, at least
not directly.
However discouraging to metaphysics this essential limitation
of the intellect may be, which arises from its nature and origin, it
has yet another side which is very consoling. It deprives the direct
utterances of nature of their unconditional validity, in the asser-
tion of which naturalism proper consists. If, therefore, nature
presents to us every living thing as appearing out of nothing, and,
after an ephemeral existence, returning again for ever to nothing,
and if it seems to take pleasure in the unceasing production of
new beings, in order that it may be able unceasingly to destroy,
and, on the other hand, is unable to bring anything permanent
to light; if accordingly we are forced to recognise matter as that
which alone is permanent, which never came into being and
never passes away, but brings forth all things from its womb,
whence its name appears to be derived from mater rerum, and along with it, as the father of things, form, which, just as fleeting
as matter is permanent, changes really every moment, and can
only maintain itself so long as it clings as a parasite to matter
(now to one part of it, now to another), but when once it entirely [027]
loses hold, disappears, as is shown by the palæotheria and the
ichthyosaurians, we must indeed recognise this as the direct and
genuine utterance of nature, but on account of the origin of the
intellect explained above, and the nature of it which results from
this origin, we cannot ascribe to this utterance an unconditional
truth, but rather only an entirely conditional truth, which Kant
has appropriately indicated as such by calling it the phenomenon
in opposition to the thing in itself.

If, in spite of this essential limitation of the intellect, it is pos-
sible, by a circuitous route, to arrive at a certain understanding of
the world and the nature of things, by means of reflection widely
pursued, and the skilful combination of objective knowledge
directed towards without, with the data of self-consciousness,
this will yet be only a very limited, entirely indirect, and relative
understanding, a parabolical translation into the forms of knowl-
edge, thus a quadam prodire tenus, which must always leave
many problems still unsolved. On the other hand, the fundamental
error of the old dogmatism in all its forms, which was destroyed
by Kant, was this, that it started absolutely from knowledge, i.e.,
the world as idea, in order to deduce and construct from its laws
being in general, whereby it accepted that world of idea, together
with its laws, as absolutely existing and absolutely real; while
its whole existence is throughout relative, and a mere result or
phenomenon of the true being which lies at its foundation,—or,
in other words, that it constructed an ontology when it had only
materials for a dianoiology. Kant discovered the subjectively
conditioned and therefore entirely immanent nature of knowledge, i.e., its unsuitableness for transcendental use, from the
constitution of knowledge itself; and therefore he very appropriately called his doctrine the Critique of Reason. 

He accomplished this partly by showing the important and thoroughly a priori part
of all knowledge, which, as throughout subjective, spoils all[028]
objectivity, and partly by professedly proving that if they were
followed out to the end the principles of knowledge, taken as
purely objective, led to contradictions. He had, however, hastily
assumed that, apart from objective knowledge, i.e., apart from the
world as idea, there is nothing given us except conscience, out of
which he constructed the little that still remained of metaphysics,
his moral theology, to which, however, he attributed absolutely
only a practical validity, and no theoretical validity at all. He
had overlooked that although certainly objective knowledge, or
the world as idea, affords nothing but phenomena, together with
their phenomenal connection and regressus, yet our own nature
necessarily also belongs to the world of things in themselves, for
it must have its root in it. But here, even if the root itself cannot
be brought to light, it must be possible to gather some data for
the explanation of the connection of the world of phenomena
with the inner nature of things. Thus here lies the path upon
which I have gone beyond Kant and the limits which he drew, yet
always restricting myself to the ground of reflection, and con-
sequently of honesty, and therefore without the vain pretension
of intellectual intuition or absolute thought which characterises
the period of pseudo-philosophy between Kant and me. In his
proof of the insufficiency of rational knowledge to fathom the
nature of the world Kant started from knowledge as a fact, which
our consciousness affords us, thus in this sense he proceeded a
posteriori. But in this chapter, and also in my work, “Ueber den
Willen in der Natur,” I have sought to show what knowledge
is in its nature and origin, something secondary, designed for
individual ends; whence it follows that it must be insufficient to
fathom the nature of the world. Thus so far I have reached the
same goal a priori. But one never knows anything wholly and
completely until one has gone right round it for that purpose,
and has got back to it from the opposite side from which one[029]
Chapter XXII. Objective View of the Intellect. 29
started. Therefore also, in the case of the important fundamental
knowledge here considered, one must not merely go from the
intellect to the knowledge of the world, as Kant has done, but
also from the world, taken as given, to the intellect, as I have
undertaken here. Then this physiological consideration, in the
wider sense, becomes the supplement of that ideological, as the
French say, or, more accurately, transcendental consideration.

In the above, in order not to break the thread of the exposition,
I have postponed the explanation of one point which I touched
upon. It was this, that in proportion as, in the ascending series of
animals, the intellect appears ever more developed and complete,
knowledge always separates itself more distinctly from will, and
thereby becomes purer. What is essential upon this point will
be found in my work, “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” under
the heading, “Pflanzenphysiologie” (p. 68-72 of the second, and
74-77 of the third edition), to which I refer, in order to avoid
repetition, and merely add here a few remarks. Since the plant
possesses neither irritability nor sensibility, but the will objecti-
fies itself in it only as plastic or reproductive power, it has neither
muscle nor nerve. In the lowest grades of the animal kingdom,
in zoophites, especially in polyps, we cannot as yet distinctly
recognise the separation of these two constituent parts, but still
we assume their existence, though in a state of fusion; because we
perceive movements which follow, not, as in the case of plants,
upon mere stimuli, but upon motives, i.e., in consequence of a
certain apprehension. Now in proportion as, in the ascending se-
ries of animals, the nervous and muscular systems separate ever
more distinctly from each other, till in the vertebrate animals, and
most completely in man, the former divides into an organic and
a cerebral nervous system, and of these the latter again develops
into the excessively complicated apparatus of the cerebrum and
cerebellum, spinal marrow, cerebral and spinal nerves, sensory
and motor nerve fascicles, of which only the cerebrum, together [030]
with the sensory nerves depending upon it, and the posterior spinal nerve fascicles are intended for the apprehension of the
motive from the external world, while all the other parts are in-
tended for the transmission of the motive to the muscles in which
the will manifests itself directly; in the same proportion does the
motive separate ever more distinctly in consciousness from the
act of will which it calls forth, thus the idea from the will; and
thereby the objectivity of consciousness constantly increases, for
the ideas exhibit themselves ever more distinctly and purely in
it. These two separations are, however, really only one and
the same, which we have here considered from two sides, the
objective and the subjective, or first in the consciousness of other
things and then in self-consciousness. Upon the degree of this
separation ultimately depends the difference and the gradation of
intellectual capacity, both between different kinds of animals and
between individual human beings; thus it gives the standard for
the intellectual completeness of these beings. For the clearness
of the consciousness of the external world, the objectivity of the
perception, depends upon it. In the passage referred to above I
have shown that the brute only perceives things so far as they
are motives for its will, and that even the most intelligent of the
brutes scarcely overstep these limits, because their intellect is
too closely joined to the will from which it has sprung. On the
other hand, even the stupidest man comprehends things in some
degree objectively; for he recognises not merely what they are
with reference to him, but also something of what they are with
reference to themselves and to other things. Yet in the case of
very few does this reach such a degree that they are in a position
to examine and judge of anything purely objectively; but “that
must I do, that must I say, that must I believe,” is the goal to
which on every occasion their thought hastens in a direct line,
and at which their understanding at once finds welcome rest. For
thinking is as unendurable to the weak head as the lifting of a burden to the weak arm; therefore both hasten to set it down. 

The
objectivity of knowledge, and primarily of perceptive knowledge, has innumerable grades, which depend upon the energy
of the intellect and its separation from the will, and the highest
of which is genius, in which the comprehension of the external
world becomes so pure and objective that to it even more reveals
itself directly in the individual thing than the individual thing
itself, namely, the nature of its whole species, i.e., its Platonic
Idea; which is brought about by the fact that in this case the will
entirely vanishes from consciousness. Here is the point at which
the present investigation, starting from physiological grounds,
connects itself with the subject of our third book, the metaphysics
of the beautiful, where æsthetic comprehension proper, which,
in a high degree, is peculiar to genius alone, is fully considered
as the condition of pure, i.e., perfectly will-less, and on that
account completely objective knowledge. According to what has
been said, the rise of intelligence, from the obscurest animal
consciousness up to that of man, is a progressive loosening of the
intellect from the will, which appears complete, although only as
an exception, in the genius. Therefore genius may be defined as
the highest grade of the objectivity of knowledge. The condition
of this, which so seldom occurs, is a decidedly larger measure
of intelligence than is required for the service of the will, which
constitutes its basis; it is accordingly this free surplus which first
really properly comes to know the world, i.e., comprehends it
perfectly objectively, and now paints pictures, composes poems,
and thinks in accordance with this comprehension.
