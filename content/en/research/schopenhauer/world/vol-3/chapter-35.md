19 This chapter is connected with § 43 of the first volume.

In accordance with the deduction given in the text of the pure
æsthetics of architecture from the lowest grades of the objecti-
fication of the will or of nature, the Ideas of which it seeks to
bring to distinct perception, its one constant theme is support and
burden, and its fundamental law is that no burden shall be with-
out sufficient support, and no support without a suitable burden;
consequently that the relation of these two shall be exactly the
fitting one. The purest example of the carrying out of this theme
is the column and entablature. 

Therefore the order or columnar
arrangement has become, as it were, the thorough bass of the
whole of architecture. In column and entablature the support and
the burden are completely separated; whereby the reciprocal ac-
tion of the two and their relation to each other becomes apparent.
For certainly even every plain wall contains support and burden;
but here the two are still fused together. All is here support
and all is burden; hence there is no æsthetic effect. This first
appears through the separation, and takes place in proportion to
its degree. For between the row of columns and the plain wall
there are many intermediate degrees. Even in the mere breaking
up of the wall of a house by windows and doors one seeks at least
to indicate that separation by flat projecting pilasters (antæ) with
capitals, which are inserted under the mouldings, nay, in case
of need, are represented by mere painting, in order to indicate
in some way the entablature and an order. Real pillars, and [183]
also consoles and supports of various kinds, realise more that
pure separation of support and burden which is striven after
throughout by architecture. In this respect, next to the column
with the entablature, but as a special construction not imitating
it, stands the vault with the pillar. 

The latter certainly is far from attaining to the æsthetic effect of the former, because here the support and the burden are not purely separated, but are fused,
passing over into each other. In the vault itself every stone is
at once burden and support, and even the pillars, especially in
groined vaulting, are, at least apparently, held in position by
the pressure of opposite arches; and also just on account of
this lateral pressure not only vaults but even mere arches ought
not to rest upon columns, but require the massive four-cornered
pillars. In the row of columns alone is the separation complete,
for here the entablature appears as pure burden, the column as
pure support. Accordingly the relation of the colonnade to the
plain wall may be compared to that which would exist between a
scale ascending in regular intervals and a tone ascending little by
little from the same depth to the same height without gradation,
which would produce a mere howl. For in the one as in the other
the material is the same, and the important difference proceeds
entirely from the pure separation.

The support is not adapted to the burden when it is
only sufficient to bear it, but when it can do this so conveniently
and amply that at the first glance we are quite at ease about it.
Yet this superfluity of support must not exceed a certain degree;
for otherwise we will perceive support without burden, which
is opposed to the æsthetic end. As a rule for determining that
degree the ancients devised the line of equilibrium, which is got
by carrying out the diminution of the thickness of the column as
it ascends till it runs out into an acute angle, whereby the column
becomes a cone; now every cross section will leave the lower[184]
part so strong that it is sufficient to support the upper part cut off.
Commonly, however, one builds with twentyfold strength, i.e.,
one lays upon every support only 1/20th of the maximum it could
bear. A glaring example of burden without support is presented
to the eye by the balconies at the corners of many houses built in
the elegant style of the present day. We do not see what supports
them; they seem to hang suspended, and disturb the mind.


That in Italy even the simplest and most unornamented build-
ings make an æsthetic impression, while in Germany this is not
the case, depends principally upon the fact that in Italy the roofs
are very flat. A high roof is neither support nor burden, for its two
halves mutually support each other, but the whole has no weight
corresponding to its extension. Therefore it presents to the eye
an extended mass which is entirely foreign to the æsthetic end,
serves merely a useful end, consequently disturbs the former, of
which the theme is always only support and burden.
The form of the column has its sole ground in the fact that
it affords the simplest and most suitable support. In the twisted
column inappropriateness appears as if with intentional perver-
sity, and therefore shamelessness: hence good taste condemns it
at the first glance. The four-cornered pillar, since the diagonal
exceeds the sides, has unequal dimensions of thickness which
have no end as their motive, but are occasioned by the accident of
greater feasibleness; and just on this account it pleases us so very
much less than the column. Even the hexagonal or octagonal
pillar is more pleasing, because it approaches more nearly to
the round column; for the form of the latter alone is exclusively
determined by the end. It is, however, also so determined in all its
other proportions, primarily in the relation of its thickness to its
height, within the limits permitted by the difference of the three
columnar orders. Therefore its diminution from the first third [185]
of its height upwards, and also a slight increase of its thickness
just at this place (entasis vitr.), depends upon the fact that the
pressure of the burden is greatest there. It has hitherto been be-
lieved that this increase in thickness was peculiar to the Ionic and
Corinthian columns alone, but recent measurements have shown
it also in the Doric columns, even at Pæstum. Thus everything
in the column, its thoroughly determined form, the proportion
of its height to its thickness, of both to the intervals between
the columns, and that of the whole series to the entablature and
the burden resting upon it, is the exactly calculated result of the relation of the necessary support to the given burden. As the latter is uniformly distributed, so must also the support be; therefore
groups of columns are tasteless. On the other hand, in the best
Doric temples the corner column comes somewhat nearer to the
next ones, because the meeting of the entablatures at the corner
increases the burden; and in this the principle of architecture
expresses itself distinctly, that the structural relations, i.e., the
relations between support and burden, are the essential ones, to
which the relations of symmetry, as subordinate, must at once
give way. According to the weight of the whole burden generally
will the Doric or the two lighter orders of columns be chosen, for
the first, not only by the greater thickness, but also by the closer
position of the columns, which is essential to it, is calculated for
heavier burdens, to which end also the almost crude simplicity
of its capital is suited. The capitals in general serve the end of
showing visibly that the columns bear the entablature, and are
not stuck in like pins; at the same time they increase by means
of their abacus the bearing surface. Since, then, all the laws
of columnar arrangement, and consequently also the form and
proportion of the column, in all its parts and dimensions down
to the smallest details, follow from the thoroughly understood
and consistently carried out conception of the amply adequate
support of a given burden, thus so far are determined a prio-[186]
ri, it comes out clearly how perverse is the thought, so often
repeated, that the stems of trees, or even (which unfortunately
even “Vitruvius,” iv. 1, expresses) the human form has been the
prototype of the column. For if the form of the column were for
architecture a purely accidental one, taken from without, it could
never appeal to us so harmoniously and satisfactorily whenever
we behold it in its proper symmetry; nor, on the other hand, could
every even slight disproportion of it be felt at once by the fine
and cultivated sense as disagreeable and disturbing, like a false
note in music. This is rather only possible because, according to
the given end and means, all the rest is essentially determined a
Chapter XXXV. On The Æsthetics Of Architecture. 183
priori, as in music, according to the given melody and key, the
whole harmony is essentially so determined. And, like music,
architecture in general is also not an imitative art, although both
are often falsely taken to be so.

Æsthetic satisfaction, as was fully explained in the text, always
depends upon the apprehension of a (Platonic) Idea. For archi-
tecture, considered merely as a fine art, the Ideas of the lowest
grades of nature, such as gravity, rigidity, and cohesion, are the
peculiar theme; but not, as has hitherto been assumed, merely
regular form, proportion, and symmetry, which, as something
purely geometrical, properties of space, are not Ideas, and there-
fore cannot be the theme of a fine art. Thus in architecture also
they are of secondary origin, and have a subordinate significance,
which I shall bring out immediately. If it were the task of archi-
tecture as a fine art simply to exhibit these, then the model would
have the same effect as the finished work. But this is distinctly
not the case; on the contrary, the works of architecture, in order
to act æsthetically, absolutely must have a considerable size; nay,
they can never be too large, but may easily be too small. Indeed
ceteris paribus the æsthetic effect is in exact proportion to the
size of the building, because only great masses make the action [187]
of gravitation apparent and impressive in a high degree. But this
confirms my view that the tendency and antagonism of those
fundamental forces of nature constitute the special æsthetical
material of architecture, which, according to its nature, requires
large masses in order to become visible, and indeed capable of
being felt. The forms in architecture, as was shown above in the
case of the column, are primarily determined by the immediate
structural end of each part. But so far as this leaves anything
undetermined, the law of the most perfect clearness to percep-
tion, thus also of the easiest comprehensibility, comes in; for
architecture has its existence primarily in our spatial perception,
and accordingly appeals to our a priori faculty for this. But these
qualities always result from the greatest regularity of the forms
184 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
and rationality of their relations. Therefore beautiful architecture
selects only regular figures composed of straight lines or regular
curves, and also the bodies which result from these, such as
cubes, parallelopipeda, cylinders, spheres, pyramids, and cones;
but as openings sometimes circles or ellipses, yet, as a rule,
quadrates, and still oftener rectangles, the latter of thoroughly
rational and very easily comprehended relation of their sides (not,
for instance as 6:7, but as 1:2, 2:3), finally also blind windows
or niches of regular and comprehensible proportions. For the
same reason it will readily give to the buildings themselves and
their large parts a rational and easily comprehended relation of
height and breadth; for example, it will let the height of a facade
be half the breadth, and place the pillars so that every three or
four of them, with the intervals between them, will measure a
line which is equal to the height, thus will form a quadrate.
The same principle of perceptibility and easy comprehension
demands also that a building should be easily surveyed. This
introduces symmetry, which is further necessary to mark out
the work as a whole, and to distinguish its essential from its[188]
accidental limitation; for sometimes, for example, it is only under
the guidance of symmetry that one knows whether one has before
one three buildings standing beside each other or only one. Thus
only by means of symmetry does a work of architecture at once
announce itself as individual unity, and as the development of a
central thought.

Now although, as was cursorily shown above, architecture has
by no means to imitate the forms of nature, such as the stems of
trees or even the human figure, yet it ought to work in the spirit
of nature, for it makes the law its own, natura nihil agit frustra,
nihilque supervacaneum, et quod commodissimum in omnibus
suis operationibus sequitur, and accordingly avoids everything
which is even only apparently aimless, and always attains the end
in view in each case, whether this is purely architectonic, i.e.,
structural, or an end connected with usefulness, by the shortest
Chapter XXXV. On The Æsthetics Of Architecture. 185
and most natural path, and thus openly exhibits the end through
the work itself. Thus it attains a certain grace, analogous to that
which in living creatures consists in the ease and suitableness of
every movement and position to its end. Accordingly we see in
the good antique style of architecture every part, whether pillar,
column, arch, entablature, or door, window, stair, or balcony,
attain its end in the directest and simplest manner, at the same
time displaying it openly and naively; just as organised nature
also does in its works. The tasteless style of architecture, on
the contrary, seeks in everything useless roundabout ways, and
delights in caprices, thereby hits upon aimlessly broken and ir-
regular entablatures, grouped columns, fragmentary cornices on
door arches and gables, meaningless volutes, scrolls, and such
like. It plays with the means of the art without understanding
its aims, as children play with the tools of grown-up people.
This was given above as the character of the bungler. Of this
kind is every interruption of a straight line, every alteration [189]
in the sweep of a curve, without apparent end. On the other
hand, it is also just that naive simplicity in the disclosure and
attainment of the end, corresponding to the spirit in which nature
works and fashions, that imparts such beauty and grace of form
to antique pottery that it ever anew excites our wonder, because
it contrasts so advantageously in original taste with our modern
pottery, which bears the stamp of vulgarity, whether it is made
of porcelain or common potter's clay. At the sight of the pottery
and implements of the ancients we feel that if nature had wished
to produce such things it would have done so in these forms.
Since, then, we see that the beauty of architecture arises from the
unconcealed exhibition of the ends, and the attainment of them
by the shortest and most natural path, my theory here appears in
direct contradiction with that of Kant, which places the nature of
all beauty in an apparent design without an end.

The sole theme of architecture here set forth—support and
burden—is so very simple, that just on this account this art, so far as it is a fine art (but not so far as it serves useful ends), is perfect and complete in essential matters, since the best Greek
period, at least, is not susceptible of any important enrichment.
On the other hand, the modern architect cannot noticeably depart
from the rules and patterns of the ancients without already being
on the path of deterioration. Therefore there remains nothing for
him to do but to apply the art transmitted to him by the ancients,
and carry out the rules so far as is possible under the limitations
which are inevitably laid down for him by wants, climate, age,
and country. For in this art, as in sculpture, the effort after the
ideal unites with the imitation of the ancients.
I scarcely need to remind the reader that in all these consid-
erations I have had in view antique architecture alone, and not
the so-called Gothic style, which is of Saracen origin, and was
introduced by the Goths in Spain to the rest of Europe. Perhaps[190]
a certain beauty of its own kind is not altogether to be denied to
this style, but yet if it attempts to oppose itself to the former as
its equal, then this is a barbarous presumption which must not be
allowed for a moment. How beneficently, after contemplating
such Gothic magnificence, does the sight of a building correctly
carried out in the antique style act upon our mind! We feel at
once that this alone is right and true. If one could bring an ancient
Greek before our most celebrated Gothic cathedrals, what would
he say to them?—í±¡≤±¡øπ! Our pleasure in Gothic works certainly depends for the most part upon the association of ideas and
historical reminiscences, thus upon a feeling which is foreign to
art. All that I have said of the true æsthetic end, of the spirit
and the theme of architecture, loses in the case of these works its
validity. For the freely lying entablature has vanished, and with
it the columns: support and burden, arranged and distributed in
order to give visible form to the conflict between rigidity and
gravity, are here no longer the theme. Moreover, that thorough,
pure rationality by virtue of which everything admits of strict account, nay, already presents it of its own accord to the thoughtful beholder, and which belongs to the character of antique archi-
tecture, can here no longer be found; we soon become conscious
that here, instead of it, a will guided by other conceptions has
moved; therefore much remains unexplained to us. For only the
antique style of architecture is conceived in a purely objective
spirit; the Gothic style is more in the subjective spirit. Yet as
we have recognised the peculiar æsthetic fundamental thought
of antique architecture in the unfolding of the conflict between
rigidity and gravity, if we wish to discover in Gothic architec-
ture also an analogous fundamental thought, it will be this, that
here the entire overcoming and conquest of gravity by rigidity
is supposed to be exhibited. For in accordance with this the
horizontal line which is that of burden has entirely vanished, and [191]
the action of gravity only appears indirectly, disguised in arches
and vaults, while the vertical line which is that of support, alone
prevails, and makes palpable to the senses the victorious action
of rigidity, in excessively high buttresses, towers, turrets, and
pinnacles without number which rise unencumbered on high.
While in antique architecture the tendency and pressure from
above downwards is just as well represented and exhibited as
that from below upwards, here the latter decidedly predominates;
whence that analogy often observed with the crystal, whose
crystallisation also takes place with the overcoming of gravity.
If now we attribute this spirit and fundamental thought to Gothic
architecture, and would like thereby to set it up as the equally
justified antithesis of antique architecture, we must remember
that the conflict between rigidity and gravity, which the antique
architecture so openly and naïvely expresses, is an actual and
true conflict founded in nature; the entire overcoming of gravity
by rigidity, on the contrary, remains a mere appearance, a fiction
accredited by illusion. 

Every one will easily be able to see
clearly how from the fundamental thought given here, and the
peculiarities of Gothic architecture noticed above, there arises
that mysterious and hyperphysical character which is attributed to it. It principally arises, as was already mentioned, from the fact that here the arbitrary has taken the place of the purely
rational, which makes itself known as the thorough adaptation of
the means to the end. The many things that are really aimless, but
yet are so carefully perfected, raise the assumption of unknown,
unfathomed, and secret ends, i.e., give the appearance of mys-
tery. On the other hand, the brilliant side of Gothic churches is
the interior; because here the effect of the groined vaulting borne
by slender, crystalline, aspiring pillars, raised high aloft, and, all
burden having disappeared, promising eternal security, impress-
es the mind; while most of the faults which have been mentioned
lie upon the outside. In antique buildings the external side is[192]
the most advantageous, because there we see better the support
and the burden; in the interior, on the other hand, the flat roof
always retains something depressing and prosaic. For the most
part, also, in the temples of the ancients, while the outworks were
many and great, the interior proper was small. An appearance of
sublimity is gained from the hemispherical vault of a cupola, as
in the Pantheon, of which, therefore, the Italians also, building in
this style, have made a most extensive use. What determines this
is, that the ancients, as southern peoples, lived more in the open
air than the northern nations who have produced the Gothic style
of architecture. Whoever, then, absolutely insists upon Gothic
architecture being accepted as an essential and authorised style
may, if he is also fond of analogies, regard it as the negative pole
of architecture, or, again, as its minor key. In the interest of good
taste I must wish that great wealth will be devoted to that which
is objectively, i.e., actually, good and right, to what in itself is
beautiful, but not to that whose value depends merely upon the
association of ideas. Now when I see how this unbelieving age
so diligently finishes the Gothic churches left incomplete by the
believing Middle Ages, it looks to me as if it were desired to
embalm a dead Christianity.
