Matter has already been spoken of in the fourth chapter of the
supplements to the first book, when we were considering the part
of our knowledge of which we are conscious a priori. But it
could only be considered there from a one-sided point of view,
because we were then concerned merely with its relation to the
forms of our intellect, and not to the thing in itself, and therefore
we investigated it only from the subjective side, i.e., so far as
it is an idea, and not from the objective side, i.e., with regard
to what it may be in itself. In the first respect, our conclusion
was that it is objective activity in general, yet conceived without
fuller determination; therefore it takes the place of causality in
the table of our a priori knowledge which is given there. For
what is material is that which acts (the actual) in general, and
regarded apart from the specific nature of its action. Hence also
matter, merely as such, is not an object of perception, but only
of thought, and thus is really an abstraction. It only comes into
perception in connection with form and quality, as a body, i.e.,
as a fully determined kind of activity. It is only by abstracting
from this fuller determination that we think of matter as such,
i.e., separated from form and quality; consequently under matter
we think of acting absolutely and in general, thus of activity in
the abstract. The more fully determined acting we then conceive
as the accident of matter; but only by means of this does matter
become perceptible, i.e., present itself as a body and an object of experience. 

Pure matter, on the other hand, which, as 

I showed in the Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy, 

alone
constitutes the true and admissible content of the conception of
substance, is causality itself, thought objectively, consequently
as in space, and therefore filling it. Accordingly the whole being
of matter consists in acting. Only thus does it occupy space and
last in time. It is through and through pure causality. 

Therefore wherever there is action there is matter, and the material is the active in general. But causality itself is the form of our
understanding; for it is known to us a priori, as well as time
and space. Thus matter also, so far and up to this point, belongs
to the formal part of our knowledge, and is consequently that
form of the understanding, causality itself, bound up with space
and time, hence objectified, i.e., conceived as that which fills
space. (The fuller explanation of this doctrine will be found
in the second edition of the essay on the principle of sufficient
reason, p. 77; third edition, p. 82.) So far, however, matter is
properly not the object but the condition of experience; like the
pure understanding itself, whose function it so far is. Therefore
of pure matter there is also only a conception, no perception.
It enters into all external experience as a necessary constituent
part of it; yet it cannot be given in any experience, but is only
thought, and thought indeed as that which is absolutely inert,
inactive, formless, and without qualities, and which is yet the
supporter of all forms, qualities, and effects. 

Accordingly, of all
fleeting phenomena, thus of all manifestations of natural forces
and all living beings, matter is the permanent substratum which
is necessarily produced by the forms of our intellect in which
the world as idea exhibits itself. As such, and as having sprung
from the forms of the intellect, it is entirely indifferent to those
phenomena themselves, i.e., it is just as ready to be the supporter
of this force of nature as of that, whenever, under the guidance
of causality, the necessary conditions appear; while it itself, just because its existence is really only formal, i.e., is founded in the intellect must be thought as that which under all that change is ab-
solutely permanent, thus with regard to time is without beginning
and without end. This is why we cannot give up the thought that
anything may be made out of anything, for example, gold out of
lead; for this would only require that we should find out and bring
about the intermediate states which matter, in itself indifferent,
would have to pass through upon that path. 

For a priori we can
never see why the same matter which is now the supporter of the quality lead could not some time become the supporter of the
quality gold. Matter, as that which is only thought a priori, is
distinguished from the a priori intuitions or perceptions proper
by the fact that we can also think it entirely away; space and time,
on the contrary, never. But this only shows that we can present
to ourselves space and time in imagination without matter. For
the matter which has once been placed in them, and accordingly
thought as existing, we can never again absolutely think away,
i.e., imagine it as vanished and annihilated, but are always forced
to think of it merely as transferred to another space. So far, then,
matter is as inseparably connected with our faculty of knowledge
as space and time themselves. Yet even the difference that it must
first be voluntarily thought as existing indicates that it does not
belong so entirely and in every regard to the formal part of our
knowledge as space and time, but also contains an element which
is only given a posteriori. It is, in fact, the point of connection of
the empirical part of our knowledge with the pure and a priori
part, consequently the peculiar foundation-stone of the world of
experience.

Only where all a priori assertions cease, therefore in the entirely empirical part of our knowledge of bodies, in their form, quality, and definite manner of acting, does that will reveal itself
which we have already recognised and established as the true
inner nature of things. But these forms and qualities always[051]
appear only as the properties and manifestations of that very
matter the existence and nature of which depends upon the subjective forms of our intellect, i.e., they only become visible in it, and therefore by means of it. 

For that which always exhibits
itself to us is only matter acting in some specially determined
manner. Out of the inner properties of such matter, properties
which cannot be further explained, proceeds every definite kind
of effect of given bodies; and yet the matter itself is never perceived, but only these effects, and the definite properties which
lie at their foundation, after separating which, matter, as that which then remains over, is necessarily added in thought by us;
for, according to the exposition given above, it is objectified
causality itself. Accordingly matter is that whereby the will,
which constitutes the inner nature of things, becomes capable
of being apprehended, perceptible, visible. In this sense, then,
matter is simply the visibility of the will, or the bond between
the world as will and the world as idea. It belongs to the latter
inasmuch as it is the product of the functions of the intellect, to
the former inasmuch as that which manifests itself in all material
existences, i.e., phenomena is the will. 

Therefore every object
is, as thing in itself, will, and as phenomenon, matter. If we
could strip any given matter of all the properties that come to it a
priori, i.e., of all the forms of our perception and apprehension,
we would have left the thing in itself, that which, by means of
those forms, appears as the purely empirical in matter, but which
would then itself no longer appear as something extended and
active; i.e., we would no longer have matter before us, but the
will. This very thing in itself, or the will, in that it becomes a
phenomenon, i.e., enters the forms of our intellect, appears as
matter, i.e., as the invisible but necessarily assumed supporter of
the properties which are only visible through it. In this sense,
then, matter is the visibility of the will. Consequently Plotinus
and Giordano Bruno were right, not only in their sense but also in [052]
ours, when they made the paradoxical assertion already referred
to in chapter 4: Matter itself is not extended, consequently it is
incorporeal. For space, which is our form of perception, imparts
extension to matter, and corporeal existence consists in acting,
which depends upon causality, and consequently upon the form
of our understanding. On the other hand, every definite property,
thus everything empirical in matter, even gravity, depends upon
that which only becomes visible by means of matter, the thing
in itself, the will. Gravity is yet the lowest of all grades of
the objectification of the will; therefore it appears in all matter
without exception, thus is inseparable from matter in general.
52 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
Yet, just because it is a manifestation of the will, it belongs to
knowledge a posteriori, not to knowledge a priori. Therefore we
can always picture to ourselves matter without weight, but not
without extension, repulsive force, and stability, for then it would
be without impenetrability, and consequently would not occupy
space, i.e., it would be without the power of acting; but the
nature of matter as such just consists in acting, i.e., in causality
in general; and causality depends upon the a priori form of our
understanding, and therefore cannot be thought away.
Matter is accordingly the will itself, but no longer in itself, but
so far as it is perceived, i.e., assumes the form of the objective
idea. Thus what objectively is matter is subjectively will. Exactly
corresponding to this, as was proved above, our body is just the
visibility, objectivity of our will, and so also every body is the
objectivity of the will at some one of its grades. Whenever the
will exhibits itself to objective knowledge it enters into the forms
of perception of the intellect, time, space, and causality. But on
account of this it exists at once as a material object. We can
present to our minds form without matter, but not the reverse;
because matter deprived of form would be the will itself, and the
will only becomes objective by entering the forms of perception[053]
of our intellect, and therefore only by means of the assumption of
form. Space is the form of perception of matter because the latter
is the substance (Stoff) of mere form, but matter can appear only
in form.

Since the will becomes objective, i.e., passes over into the
idea, matter is the universal substratum of this objectification,
or rather it is this objectification itself taken abstractly, i.e., re-
garded apart from all form. Matter is accordingly the visibility
of the will in general, while the character of its definite mani-
festations has its expression in form and quality. Hence what
in the manifestation, i.e., for the idea, is matter is in itself will.
Therefore, under the conditions of experience and perception,
everything holds good of it that holds good of the will in itself, and it repeats all the relations and properties of the will in
temporal images. Accordingly it is the substance of the world
of perception, as the will is the inner nature of all things. The
forms are innumerable, the matter is one; just as the will is one
in all its objectifications. As the will never objectifies itself as
general, i.e., as absolute will, but always as particular, i.e., under
special determinations and a given character, so matter never
appears as such, but always in connection with some particular
form and quality. In the manifestation or objectification of the
will matter represents its totality, it itself, which in all is one, as
matter is one in all bodies. As the will is the inmost kernel of
all phenomenal beings, so matter is the substance which remains
after all the accidents have been taken away. As the will is that
which is absolutely indestructible in all existence, so matter is
that which is imperishable in time and permanent through all
changes. That matter for itself, thus separated from form, cannot
be perceived or presented in imagination depends upon the fact
that in itself, and as the pure substantiality of bodies, it is really
the will itself. But the will cannot be apprehended objectively, [054]
or perceived in itself, but only under all the conditions of the
idea, and therefore only as phenomenon. Under these conditions,
however, it exhibits itself at once as body, i.e., as matter clothed
in form and quality. But form is conditioned by space, and
quality or power of acting by causality; thus both depend upon
the functions of the intellect. Matter without them would just
be the thing in itself, i.e., the will itself. Therefore, as has
been said, Plotinus and Giordano Bruno could only be brought
by a completely objective path to the assertion that matter in
and for itself is without extension, consequently without spatial
properties, consequently incorporeal.

Because, then, matter is the visibility of the will, and every
force in itself is will, no force can appear without a material sub-
stratum, and conversely no body can be without forces dwelling
in it which constitute its quality. Therefore a body is the union
54 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
of matter and form which is called substance (Stoff). Force and
substance are inseparable because at bottom they are one; for, as
Kant has shown, matter itself is given us only as the union of
two forces, the force of expansion and that of attraction. Thus
there is no opposition between force and substance, rather they
are precisely one.

Led by the course of our consideration to this standpoint, and
having attained to this metaphysical view of matter, we will
confess without reluctance that the temporal origin of forms,
shapes, or species cannot reasonably be sought elsewhere than in
matter. Some time or other they must have come forth from it,
just because it is the mere visibility of the will which constitutes
the inner nature of all phenomena. In that the will manifests
itself, i.e., presents itself objectively to the intellect, matter, as
its visibility, assumes form by means of the functions of the
intellect. Hence the Schoolmen said: “Materia appetit formam.”
That such was the origin of all forms of life cannot be doubted:
we cannot even conceive it otherwise. Whether, however, now,
since the paths to the perpetuation of the forms stand open, and[055]
are secured and sustained by nature with boundless care and jeal-
ousy, generatio œquivoca still takes place, can only be decided
by experience; especially since the saying, Natura nihil facit fru-
stra, might, with reference to the paths of regular propagation, be
used as a valid argument against it. Yet in spite of the most recent
objections to it, I hold that at very low grades generatio œquivoca
is very probable, and primarily indeed in the case of entozoa
and epizoa, particularly such as appear in consequence of special
cachexia of the animal organism. For the conditions of their
life only appear exceptionally; consequently their species cannot
propagate itself in the regular manner, and therefore has always
to arise anew whenever opportunity offers. Therefore as soon
as the conditions of life of epizoa have appeared in consequence
of certain chronic diseases, or cachexia, and in accordance with
them, pediculus capitis or pubis or corporis appears entirely of itself, and without any egg; and this notwithstanding the complex
structure of these insects, for the putrefaction of a living animal
body affords material for higher productions than that of hay in
water, which only produces infusoria. Or is it thought more likely
that the eggs of the epizoa are constantly floating about in the air
in expectation? (Fearful to think of!) Let us rather remember the
disease of phthiriasis, which occurs even now. 

An analogous case
takes place when through special circumstances the conditions
of life appear of a species which up till then was foreign to that
place. Thus August St. Hilaire saw in Brazil, after the burning
of a primitive forest, as soon as ever the ashes had cooled, a
number of plants grow up out of them, the species of which
was not to be found far and wide; and quite recently Admiral
Petit-Thouars informed the Académie des sciences that upon the
growing coral islands in Polynesia a soil gradually deposits itself
which is now dry, now lies in water, and which vegetation soon
takes possession of, bringing forth trees which are absolutely [056]
peculiar to these islands (Comptes rendus, 17th Jan. 1859, p.
147). Whenever putrefaction takes place mould, fungi, and in
liquids infusoria appear. The assumption now in favour that
spores and eggs of the innumerable species of all those kinds of
animal life are everywhere floating in the air, and wait through
long years for a favourable opportunity, is more paradoxical than
that of generatio œquivoca. Putrefaction is the decomposition of
an organised body, first into its more immediate chemical con-
stituents. Since now these are more or less the same in all living
beings, the omnipresent will to live can possess itself of them,
in order, in accordance with the circumstances, to produce new
existences from them; and these forming themselves according
to design, i.e., objectifying the volition of the will at the time,
solidify out of the chemical elements as the chicken out of the
fluidity of the egg. When, however, this does not take place, the
putrefying matter is resolved into its ultimate constituent parts,
which are the chemical elements, and now passes over again into the great course of nature. The war which has been waged for
the last ten or fifteen years against generatio œquivoca, with its
premature shouts of victory, was the prelude to the denial of the
vital force, and related to it. Let no one, however, be deceived by
dogmatic assertions and brazen assurances that the questions are
decided, settled, and generally recognised. On the contrary, the
whole mechanical and atomistic view of nature is approaching its
bankruptcy, and its defenders have to learn that something more
is concealed behind nature than action and reaction. The reality
of generatio œquivoca and the folly of the extraordinary assump-
tion that in the atmosphere, everywhere and always, billions of
seeds of all possible kinds of fungi, and eggs of all possible kinds
of infusoria, are floating about, till now one and then another
by chance finds its suitable medium, has quite recently (1859)
been thoroughly and victoriously shown by Pouchet before the[057]
French Academy, to the great vexation of the other members.
Our wonder at the origin of forms in matter is at bottom like
that of the savage who looks for the first time in a mirror and
marvels at his own image which he sees there. For our own
inner nature is the will, whose mere visibility is matter. 

Yet matter never appears otherwise than with the visible, i.e., under
the outer shell of form and quality, and therefore is never directly
apprehended, but always merely added in thought as that which
is identical in all things, under all differences of quality and
form. On this account it is more a metaphysical than a physical
principle of explanation of things, and to make all existences
arise from it is really to explain them from something which
is very mysterious; which all know it to be except those who
confound attacking with comprehending. In truth, the ultimate
and exhaustive explanation of things is by no means to be sought
in matter, although certainly the temporal origin both of unor-
ganised forms and of organised beings is to be sought in it. Yet
it seems that the origination of organised forms, the production
of the species themselves, is almost as difficult for nature to accomplish as it is for us to comprehend. This is indicated by the entirely extravagant provision which nature always makes
for maintaining the species which once exist. Yet on the present
surface of this planet the will to live has gone through the scale
of its objectification three times, quite independently of each
other, in a different modulation, and also with great difference
of perfection and fulness. The old world, America, and Australia
have, it is well known, each their peculiar independent fauna,
entirely different from that of the other two. Upon each of these
great continents the species are throughout different, but yet,
because all three belong to the same planet, they have a thorough
analogy with each other running parallel through them; therefore
the genera are for the most part the same. In Australia this [058]
analogy can only be very imperfectly followed because its fauna
is very poor in mammalia, and contains neither beasts of prey
nor apes. On the other hand, between the old world and America
it is obvious, and in the following manner. In mammals America
always produces the inferior analogue, but in birds and reptiles
the better. Thus it has the advantage in the condor, the macaw,
the humming-bird, and the largest batrachia and ophidia; but, for
example, instead of the elephant it has only the tapir, instead of
the lion the puma, instead of the tiger the jaguar, instead of the
camel the lama, and instead of apes proper only monkeys. Even
from this last defect it may be concluded that in America nature
was not able to rise to man; for even from the nearest grade below
man, the chimpanzee and the orang-outang or pongo, the step
to man was still an excessively great one. Correspondingly we
find that the three races of men which, both upon physiological
and linguistic grounds, are undoubtedly equally original, the
Caucasian, the Mongolian, and the Ethiopian, are only at home
in the old world; while America, on the other hand, is peopled
by a mixed or climatically modified Mongolian race, which must
have come over from Asia. On the surface of the earth which
immediately preceded the present surface apes were reached here and there, but not men.

This view of matter as the direct visibility of the will which manifests itself
in all things, nay, indeed, for the merely physical investigation
which follows the guidance of time and causality, lets it pass as
the origin of things, we are easily led to the question whether
even in philosophy we could not just as well start from the objective as from the subjective side, and accordingly set up as the fundamental truth the proposition: “There is in general nothing
but matter and its indwelling forces.” 

But, with regard to these
“indwelling forces” here so easily used, we must remember that
their assumption leads every explanation back to a completely[059]
incomprehensible miracle, and then leaves it beside it, or rather
leaves it to begin from it. For every definite, inexplicable force
of nature which lies at the foundation of the most different
kinds of effects of an unorganised body, not less than the vital
force which manifests itself in every organised body, is such
an incomprehensible miracle, as I have fully explained in chap.
17, and have also shown that physics can never be set upon the
throne of metaphysics, just because it leaves quite untouched the
assumption referred to and also many others; whereby from the
beginning it renounces all claim to give an ultimate explanation
of things. I must further remind the reader here of the proof of the
insufficiency of materialism, which is given towards the end of
the first chapter, because, as was said there, it is the philosophy
of the subject which forgets itself in its calculation. But all these
truths rest upon the fact that everything objective, everything ex-
ternal, since it is always only something apprehended, something
known, remains also always indirect and secondary, therefore ab-
solutely never can become the ultimate ground of explanation of
things or the starting-point of philosophy. Philosophy necessarily
requires what is absolutely immediate for its starting-point. But
clearly only that which is given in self-consciousness fulfils this
condition, that which is within, the subjective. 

Hence it is so eminent a merit of Descartes that he first made philosophy start
from self-consciousness. Since then, upon this path, the genuine
philosophers, especially Locke, Berkeley, and Kant, have gone
even further, each in his own manner, and in consequence of their
investigations I was led to recognise and make use, not of one,
but of two completely different data of immediate knowledge
in self-consciousness, the idea and the will, by the combined
application of which one can go further in philosophy, in the
same proportion as in the case of an algebraical problem one can
accomplish more if two known quantities are given than if only
one is given. [060]

In accordance with what has been said, the ineradicable false- ness of materialism primarily consists in the fact that it starts from a petitio principii, which when more closely considered turns out indeed to be a ¿¡…ƒøΩ ∆μ≈¥ø¬. It starts from the as- sumption that matter is something absolutely and unconditionally given, something existing independently of the knowledge of the subject, thus really a thing in itself. It attributes to matter (and consequently also to its presuppositions time and space) an ab- solute existence, i.e., an existence independent of the perceiving subject; this is its fundamental error. Then, if it will go honestly to work, it must leave the qualities inherent in the given materi- als, i.e., in the substances, together with the natural forces which manifest themselves in these, and finally also the vital force, unexplained, as unfathomable qualitates occultæ, and start from them; as physics and physiology actually do, because they make no claim to be the ultimate explanation of things. But just to avoid this, materialism—at least as it has hitherto appeared—has not proceeded honestly. It denies all those original forces, for it pretends and seems to reduce them all, and ultimately also the vital force, to the mere mechanical activity of matter, thus to manifestations of impenetrability, form, cohesion, impulsive power, inertia, gravity, &c., qualities which certainly have least that is inexplicable in themselves, just because they partly depend upon what is known a priori, consequently on the forms of our own intellect, which are the principle of all comprehensibility.

But the intellect as the condition of all objects, and consequently
of the whole phenomenal world, is entirely ignored by materialism. Its plan is now to refer everything qualitative to something
merely quantitative, for it attributes the former to mere form in
opposition to matter proper. To matter it leaves, of the properly
empirical qualities, only gravity, because it already appears as
something quantitative, the only measure of the quantity of the
matter. This path necessarily leads it to the fiction of atoms,[061]
which now become the material out of which it thinks to con-
struct the mysterious manifestations of all original forces. But
here it has really no longer to do with empirically given matter,
but with a matter which is not to be found in rerum natura, but
is rather a mere abstraction of that real matter, a matter which
would absolutely have no other than those mechanical qualities
which, with the exception of gravity, can be pretty well construed
a priori, just because they depend upon the forms of space, time,
and causality, and consequently upon our intellect; to this poor
material, then, it finds itself reduced for the construction of its
castle in the air.

In this way it inevitably becomes atomism; as happened to it
already in its childhood in the hands of Leucippus and Democri-
tus, and happens to it again now that it has come to a second
childhood through age; with the French because they have never
known the Kantian philosophy, and with the Germans because
they have forgotten it. And indeed it carries it further in this its
second childhood than in its first. Not merely solid bodies are
supposed to consist of atoms, but liquids, water, air, gas, nay,
even light, which is supposed to be the undulations of a com-
pletely hypothetical and altogether unproved ether, consisting of
atoms, the difference of the rapidity of these undulations causing
colours. This is an hypothesis which, like the earlier Newtonian
seven-colour theory, starts from an analogy with music, entirely arbitrarily assumed, and then violently carried out. One must really  be credulous to an unheard-of degree to let oneself be
persuaded that the innumerable different ether vibrations pro-
ceeding from the infinite multiplicity of coloured surfaces in this
varied world could constantly, and each in its own time, run
through and everywhere cross each other without ever disturbing
each other, but should rather produce through such tumult and
confusion the profoundly peaceful aspect of illumined nature and
art. 

Credat Judæus Apella! Certainly the nature of light is to [062] us a secret; but it is better to confess this than to bar the way of future knowledge by bad theories. That light is something quite different from a mere mechanical movement, undulation, or vibration and tremor, indeed that it is material, is shown by its chemical effects, a beautiful series of which was recently laid before the Académie des sciences by Chevreul, who let sunlight act upon different coloured materials. The most beautiful thing in these experiments is, that a white roll of paper which has been exposed to the sunlight exhibits the same effects, nay, does so even after six months, if during this time it has been secured in a firmly closed metal tube. Has, then, the tremulation paused for six months, and does it now fall into time again? (Comptes rendus of 20th December 1858.) This whole hypothesis of vi- brating ether atoms is not only a chimera, but equals in awkward crudeness the worst of Democritus, and yet is shameless enough, at the present day, to profess to be an established fact, and has thus brought it about that it is orthodoxly repeated by a thousand stupid scribblers of all kinds, who are devoid of all knowledge of such things, and is believed in as a gospel. But the doctrine of atoms in general goes still further: it is soon a case of Spartam, quam nactus es, orna! Different perpetual motions are then ascribed to all the atoms, revolving, vibrating, &c., according to the office of each; in the same way every atom has its atmosphere of ether, or something else, and whatever other similar fancies there may be. The fancies of Schelling's philosophy of nature and its disciples were for the most part ingenious, lofty, or at least witty; but these, on the contrary, are clumsy, insipid, paltry, and awkward, the production of minds which, in the first place, are unable to think any other reality than a fabulous, qualityless matter, which is also an absolute object, i.e., an object without a subject; and secondly can think of no other activity than motion and impact: these two alone are comprehensible to them, and that everything runs back to these is their a priori assump-[063] tion; for these are their thing in itself. To attain this end the vital force is reduced to chemical forces (which are insidiously and unjustifiably called molecular forces), and all processes of unorganised nature to mechanism, i.e., to action and reaction. And thus at last the whole world and everything in it becomes merely a piece of mechanical ingenuity, like the toys worked by levers, wheels, and sand, which represent a mine or the work on a farm. The source of the evil is, that through the amount of hand-work which experimenting requires the head-work of thinking has been allowed to get out of practice. The crucible and the voltaic pile are supposed to assume its functions; hence also the profound abhorrence of all philosophy. But the matter might be put in this way.

One might say that
materialism, as it has hitherto appeared, has only failed because
it did not adequately know the matter out of which it thought to
construct the world, and therefore was dealing, not with matter
itself, but with a propertyless substitute for it. If, on the contrary,
instead of this, it had taken the actual and empirically given
matter (i.e., material substance, or rather substances), endowed
as it is with all physical, chemical, electrical properties, and also
with the power of spontaneously producing life out of itself,
thus the true mater rerum, from the obscurity of whose womb
all phenomena and forms come forth, to fall back into it some
time again; from this, i.e., from matter fully comprehended and
exhaustively known, a world might have been constructed of
which materialism would not need to be ashamed. 

Quite true:  only the trick would then consist in this, that the Quæsita had been placed in the Data, for professedly what was taken as given, and made the starting-point of the deduction, was mere matter, but really it included all the mysterious forces of nature which cling to it, or more correctly, by means of it become visible to us, much the same as if under the name of the dish we [064] understand what lies upon it. For in fact, for our knowledge, matter is really merely the vehicle of the qualities and natural forces, which appear as its accidents, and just because I have traced these back to the will I call matter the mere visibility of the will. Stripped of all these qualities, matter remains behind as that which is without qualities, the caput mortuum of nature, out of which nothing can honestly be made. If, on the contrary, in the manner referred to, one leaves it all these properties, one is guilty of a concealed petitio principii, for one has assumed the Quæsita beforehand as Data. But what is accomplished with this will no longer be a proper materialism, but merely naturalism, i.e., an absolute system of physics, which, as was shown in chap. 17 already referred to, can never assume and fill the place of metaphysics, just because it only begins after so many assumptions, thus never undertakes to explain things from the foundation. Mere naturalism is therefore essentially based simply upon qualitates occultæ, which one can never get beyond except, as I have done, by calling in the aid of the subjective source of knowledge, which then certainly leads to the long and toilsome round-about path of metaphysics, for it presupposes the complete analysis of self-consciousness and of the intellect and will given in it. However, the starting from what is objective, at the foundation of which lies external perception, so distinct and comprehensible, is a path so natural and which presents itself of its own accord to man, that naturalism, and consequently, because this cannot satisfy as it is not exhaustive, materialism, are systems to which the speculative reason must necessarily have come, nay, must have come first of all.

Therefore at the very beginning of the history of philosophy we meet naturalism, in the systems of the Ionic philosophers, and then materialism in the teaching of Leucippus and Democritus, and also later we see them ever appear anew from time to time.
