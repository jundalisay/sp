Man has his existence and being either with his will, i.e., his consent, or without this; in the latter case an existence so em- bittered by manifold and insupportable sufferings would be a flagrant injustice. The ancients, especially the Stoics, also the Peripatetics and Academics, strove in vain to prove that virtue sufficed to make life happy. Experience cried out loudly against it. What really lay at the foundation of the efforts of these philosophers, although they were not distinctly conscious of it, was the assumed justice of the thing; whoever was without guilt ought to be free from suffering, thus happy.

But the serious and profound solution of the problem lies in the Christian doctrine that works do not justify. Accordingly a man, even if he has practised all justice and benevolence, consequently the ±≥±∏øΩ, honestum, is yet not, as Cicero imagines, culpa omni carens (Tusc., v. i.); but el delito mayor del hombre es haber nacido (the greatest guilt of man is that he was born), as Calderon, illuminated by Christianity, has expressed it with far profounder knowledge than these wise men.

Therefore that man comes into
the world already tainted with guilt can appear absurd only to
him who regards him as just then having arisen out of nothing
and as the work of another. In consequence of this guilt, then,
which must therefore have proceeded from his will, man remains [421]
rightly exposed to physical and mental suffering, even if he has
practised all those virtues, thus is not happy. This follows from
the eternal justice of which I have spoken in § 63 of the first
volume. That, however, as St. Paul (Rom. iii. 21), Augustine,
and Luther teach, works cannot justify, inasmuch as we all are
and remain essentially sinners, ultimately rests upon the fact that,
44 This chapter is connected with § 68 of the first volume. Chapter 14 of the
second volume of the Parerga should also be compared with it.
410 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
because operari sequitur esse, if we acted as we ought, we would
necessarily be as we ought. But then we would require no salva-
tion from our present condition, which not only Christianity but
also Brahmanism and Buddhism (under the name which is ex-
pressed in English by final emancipation) present as the highest
goal, i.e., we would not need to become something quite different
from, nay, the very opposite of what we are. Since, however,
we are what we ought not to be, we also necessarily do what we
ought not to do. Therefore we need a complete transformation
of our mind and nature; i.e., the new birth, as the result of which
salvation appears. Although the guilt lies in action, operari, yet
the root of the guilt lies in our essentia et existentia, for out of
these the operari necessarily proceeds, as I have shown in the
prize essay on the freedom of the will. Accordingly our one true
sin is really original sin. Now the Christian myth makes original
sin first arise after man came into existence, and for this purpose
ascribes to him, per impossibile, a free will. It does this, however,
simply as myth. The inmost kernel and spirit of Christianity is
identical with that of Brahmanism and Buddhism; they all teach
a great guilt of the human race through its existence itself, only
that Christianity does not proceed directly and frankly like these
more ancient religions: thus does not make the guilt simply the
result of existence itself, but makes it arise through the act of the
first human pair. This was only possible under the fiction of a
liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ, and only necessary on account
of the Jewish fundamental dogma, in which that doctrine had[422]
here to be implanted. Because, according to the truth, the coming
into existence of man himself is the act of his free will, and
accordingly one with the fall, and therefore the original sin, of
which all other sins are the result, appeared already with the
essentia and existentia of man; but the fundamental dogma of
Judaism did not admit of such an explanation. Thus Augustine
taught, in his books De libero arbitrio, that only as Adam before
the fall was man guiltless and possessed of a free will, but for
411
ever after is involved in the necessity of sin. The law, A Ωøºø¬,
in the Biblical sense, always demands that we shall change our
doing, while our being remains unchanged. But because this is
impossible, Paul says that no man is justified by the law; only
the new birth in Jesus Christ, in consequence of the work of
grace, on account of which a new man arises and the old man
is abolished (i.e., a fundamental change of mind or conversion),
can transfer us from the state of sinfulness into that of freedom
and salvation. This is the Christian myth with reference to ethics.
But certainly the Jewish theism, upon which it was grafted, must
have received wonderful additions to adapt itself to that myth.
In it the fable of the fall presented the only place for the graft
of the old Indian stem. It is to be attributed just to that forcibly
surmounted difficulty that the Christian mysteries have received
such an extraordinary appearance, conflicting with the ordinary
understanding, which makes proselytising more difficult, and on
account of which, from incapacity to comprehend their profound
meaning, Pelagianism, or at the present day Rationalism, ris-
es against them, and seeks to explain them away, but thereby
reduces Christianity to Judaism.
But to speak without myth: so long as our will is the same,
our world can be no other than it is. It is true all wish to
be delivered from the state of suffering and death; they would
like, as it is expressed, to attain to eternal blessedness, to enter
the kingdom of heaven, only not upon their own feet; they [423]
would like to be carried there by the course of nature. That,
however, is impossible. Therefore nature will never let us fall
and become nothing; but yet it can lead us nowhere but always
again into nature. Yet how questionable a thing it is to exist as
a part of nature every one experiences in his own life and death.
Accordingly existence is certainly to be regarded as an erring,
to return from which is salvation: it also bears this character
throughout. It is therefore conceived in this manner by the an-
cient Samana religions, and also, although indirectly, by real and
412 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
original Christianity. Even Judaism itself contains at least in the
fall (this its redeeming feature) the germ of such a view. Only
Greek paganism and Islamism are entirely optimistic: therefore
in the former the opposite tendency had to find expression at
least in tragedy; but in Islamism, which is the worst, as it is the
most modern, of all religions, it appeared as Sufism, that very
beautiful phenomenon, which is completely of Indian spirit and
origin, and has now continued for upwards of a thousand years.
Nothing can, in fact, be given as the end of our existence but
the knowledge that we had better not be. This, however, is the
most important of all truths, which must therefore be expressed,
however great the contrast in which it stands with the European
manner of thought of the present day. On the other hand, in
the whole of non-Mohammedan Asia it is the most universally
recognised fundamental truth, to-day as much as three thousand
years ago.
If now we consider the will to live as a whole and objectively,
we have, in accordance with what has been said, to think of it
as involved in an illusion, to escape from which, thus to deny
its whole existing endeavour, is what all religions denote by
self-renunciation, abnegatio sui ipsius; for the true self is the will
to live. The moral virtues, thus justice and benevolence, since
if they are pure they spring, as I have shown, from the fact that
the will to live, seeing through the principium individuationis,[424]
recognises itself in all its manifestations, are accordingly primar-
ily a sign, a symptom, that the self-manifesting will is no longer
firmly held in that illusion, but the disillusion already begins to
take place; so that one might metaphorically say it already flaps
its wings to fly away from it. Conversely, injustice, wickedness,
cruelty are signs of the opposite, thus of the deep entanglement
in that illusion. Secondly, however, these virtues are a means
of advancing self-renunciation, and accordingly the denial of the
will to live. For true integrity, inviolable justice, this first and
most important of cardinal virtues, is so hard a task that whoever
413
professes it unconditionally and from the bottom of his heart
has to make sacrifices that soon deprive life of the sweetness
which is demanded to make it enjoyable, and thereby turn away
the will from it, thus lead to resignation. Yet just what makes
integrity honourable is the sacrifices which it costs; in trifles it
is not admired. Its nature really consists in this, that the just man
does not throw upon others, by craft or force, the burdens and
sorrows which life brings with it, as the unjust man does, but
bears himself what falls to his lot; and thus he has to bear the
full burden of the evil imposed upon human life, undiminished.
Justice thereby becomes a means of advancing the denial of the
will to live, for want and suffering, those true conditions of
human life, are its consequence, and these lead to resignation.
Still more quickly does the virtue of benevolence, caritas, which
goes further, lead to the same result; for on account of it one
takes over even the sufferings which originally fell to the lot
of others, therefore appropriates to oneself a larger share of
these than in the course of things would come to the particular
individual. He who is inspired with this virtue has recognised
his own being in all others. And thereby he identifies his own
lot with that of humanity in general; but this is a hard lot, that
of care, suffering, and death. Whoever, then, by renouncing [425]
every accidental advantage, desires for himself no other lot than
that of humanity in general cannot desire even this long. The
clinging to life and its pleasures must now soon yield, and give
place to a universal renunciation; consequently the denial of the
will will take place. Since now, in accordance with this, poverty,
privation, and special sufferings of many kinds are introduced
simply by the perfect exercise of the moral virtues, asceticism
in the narrowest sense, thus the surrender of all possessions, the
intentional seeking out of what is disagreeable and repulsive,
self-mortification, fasts, the hair shirt, and the scourge—all this
is rejected by many, and perhaps rightly, as superfluous. Justice
itself is the hair shirt that constantly harasses its owner and the
414 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
charity that gives away what is needed, provides constant fasts.45
Just on this account Buddhism is free from all strict and excessive
asceticism, which plays a large part in Brahmanism, thus from
intentional self-mortification. It rests satisfied with the celibacy,
voluntary poverty, humility, and obedience of the monks, with
abstention from animal food, as also from all worldliness. Since,
further, the goal to which the moral virtues lead is that which
is here pointed out, the Vedanta philosophy46 rightly says that
after the entrance of true knowledge, with entire resignation in
its train, thus the new birth, then the morality or immorality of
the past life is a matter of indifference, and uses here also the
saying so often quoted by the Brahmans: “Finditur nodus cordis,
dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes, ejusque opera evanescunt, viso
supremo illo” (Sancara, sloca 32).[426]
Now, however objectionable this view may be to many, to
whom a reward in heaven or a punishment in hell is a much
more satisfactory explanation of the ethical significance of hu-
man action, just as the good Windischmann rejects that doctrine,
while he expounds it, yet whoever is able to go to the bottom of
the matter will find that in the end it agrees with that Christian
doctrine especially urged by Luther, that it is not works but only
the faith which enters through the work of grace, that saves us,
and that therefore we can never be justified by our deeds, but can
only obtain the forgiveness of our sins through the merits of the
Mediator. It is indeed easy to see that without such assumptions
Christianity would have to teach infinite punishment for all, and
45 If, on the contrary, asceticism is admitted, the list of the ultimate motives
of human action, given in my prize essay on the foundation of morals, namely:
(1) our own good, (2) the ill of others, and (3) the good of others, must be
supplemented by a fourth, our own ill; which I merely mention here in passing
in the interests of systematic consistency. In the essay referred to this fourth
motive had to be passed over in silence, for the question asked was stated in
the spirit of the philosophical ethics prevailing in Protestant Europe.

415
Brahmanism endless re-births for all, thus no salvation would be
reached by either. The sinful works and their consequences must
be annulled and annihilated, whether by extraneous pardon or by
the entrance of a better knowledge; otherwise the world could
hope for no salvation; afterwards, however, they become a matter
of indifference. This is also the ºμƒ±Ωøπ± ∫±π ±∆μ√π¬ º±¡ƒπ…Ω,
the announcement of which the risen Christ exclusively imposes
upon His Apostles as the sum of their mission (Luke xxiv. 47).
The moral virtues are really not the ultimate end, but only a
step towards it. This step is signified in the Christian myth by
the eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, with
which moral responsibility enters, together with original sin.
The latter itself is in truth the assertion of the will to live: the
denial of the will to live, in consequence of the appearance of
a better knowledge, is, on the other hand, salvation. Between
these two, then, lies the sphere of morality; it accompanies man
as a light upon his path from the assertion to the denial of the
will, or, mythically, from original sin to salvation through faith
in the mediation of the incarnate God (Avatar); or, according to
the teaching of the Vedas, through all re-births, which are the
consequence of the works in each case, until right knowledge
appears, and with it salvation (final emancipation), Mokscha, [427]
i.e., reunion with Brahma. The Buddhists, however, with perfect
honesty, only indicate the matter negatively, by Nirvana, which
is the negation of this world, or of Sansara. If Nirvana is de-
fined as nothing, this only means that the Sansara contains no
single element which could assist the definition or construction
of Nirvana. Just on this account the Jainas, who differ from
the Buddhists only in name, call the Brahmans who believe in
the Vedas Sabdapramans, a nickname which is meant to signify
that they believe upon hearsay what cannot be known or proved
(“Asiat. Researches,” vol. vi. P. 474).
When certain ancient philosophers, such as Orpheus, the
Pythagoreans, and Plato (e.g., in the “Phædo,” pp. 151, 183 seq.,
416 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
Bip.; and see Clem. Alex. strom., iii. p. 400 seq.), just like the
Apostle Paul, lament the union of soul and body, and desire to
be freed from it, we understand the real and true meaning of this
complaint, since we have recognised, in the second book, that the
body is the will itself, objectively perceived as a phenomenon in
space.
In the hour of death it is decided whether the man returns into
the womb of nature or belongs no more to nature at all, but ——
—— ——: for this opposite we lack image, conception, and
word, just because these are all taken from the objectification of
the will, therefore belong to this, and consequently can in no way
express the absolute opposite of it, which accordingly remains
for us a mere negation. However, the death of the individual is
in each case the unweariedly repeated question of nature to the
will to live, “Hast thou enough? Wilt thou escape from me?”
In order that it may occur often enough, the individual life is so
short. In this spirit are conceived the ceremonies, prayers, and
exhortations of the Brahmans at the time of death, as we find
them preserved in the Upanischad in several places; and so also
are the Christian provisions for the suitable employment of the[428]
hour of death by means of exhortation, confession, communion,
and extreme unction: hence also the Christian prayers for de-
liverance from sudden death. That at the present day it is just
this that many desire only proves that they no longer stand at the
Christian point of view, which is that of the denial of the will
to live, but at that of its assertion, which is the heathen point of
view.
But he will fear least to become nothing in death who has
recognised that he is already nothing now, and who consequently
no longer takes any share in his individual phenomenon, because
in him knowledge has, as it were, burnt up and consumed the
will, so that no will, thus no desire for individual existence,
remains in him any more.
Individuality inheres indeed primarily in the intellect; and the
417
intellect, reflecting the phenomenon, belongs to the phenomenon,
which has the principium individuationis as its form. But it in-
heres also in the will, inasmuch as the character is individual:
yet the character itself is abolished in the denial of the will. Thus
individuality inheres in the will only in its assertion, not in its
denial. Even the holiness which is connected with every purely
moral action depends upon the fact that such an action ultimately
springs from the immediate knowledge of the numerical identity
of the inner nature of all living things.47 But this identity only
really exists in the condition of the denial of the will (Nirvana),
for the assertion of the will (Sansara) has for its form the phenom-
enal appearance of it in multiplicity. Assertion of the will to live,
the phenomenal world, the diversity of all beings, individuality,
egoism, hatred, wickedness, all spring from one root; and so also,
on the other hand, do the world as thing in itself, the identity of
all beings, justice, benevolence, the denial of the will to live. If
now, as I have sufficiently proved, even the moral virtues spring
from the consciousness of that identity of all beings, but this lies,
not in the phenomenon, but only in the thing in itself, in the root [429]
of all beings, the moral action is a momentary passing through
the point, the permanent return to which is the denial of the will
to live.
It follows, as a deduction from what has been said, that we
have no ground to assume that there are more perfect intelligences
than that of human beings. For we see that even this degree of
intelligence is sufficient to impart to the will that knowledge in
consequence of which it denies and abolishes itself, upon which
the individuality, and consequently the intelligence, which is
merely a tool of individual, and therefore animal nature, perish.
This will appear to us less open to objection if we consider that
we cannot conceive even the most perfect intelligences possi-
ble, which for this end we may experimentally assume, existing
47 Cf. Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik, p. 274 (second edition, p. 271).
418 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
through an endless time, which would be much too poor to afford
them constantly new objects worthy of them. Because the nature
of all things is at bottom one, all knowledge of them is necessarily
tautological. If now this nature once becomes comprehended,
as by those most perfect intelligences it soon would be com-
prehended, what would then remain but the wearisomeness of
mere repetition through an infinite time? Thus from this side
also we are pointed to the fact that the end of all intelligence
can only be reaction upon the will; since, however, all willing is
an error, it remains the last work of intelligence to abolish the
willing, whose ends it had hitherto served. Accordingly even the
most perfect intelligence possible can only be a transition step
to that to which no knowledge can ever extend: indeed such an
intelligence can, in the nature of things, only assume the position
of the moment of the attainment of perfect insight.
In agreement with all these considerations, and also with what
is proved in the second book as to the origin of knowledge in
the will, the assertion of which it reflects in fulfilling the sole
function of knowledge, that of being serviceable to the ends of
the will, while true salvation lies in its denial, we see all religions[430]
at their highest point pass over into mysticism and mysteries,
i.e., into darkness and veiled obscurity, which for knowledge
signify merely an empty spot, the point where knowledge neces-
sarily ceases; therefore for thought this can only be expressed by
negations, but for sense perception it is indicated by symbolical
signs; in temples by dim light and silence; in Brahmanism indeed
by the required suspension of all thought and perception for the
sake of sinking oneself profoundly in the grounds of one's own
being, mentally pronouncing the mysterious Oum.48 Mysticism
48 If we keep in view the essential immanence of our knowledge and of all
knowledge, which arises from the fact that it is a secondary thing which has
only appeared for the ends of the will, it then becomes explicable to us that
all mystics of all religions ultimately attain to a kind of ecstasy, in which all
and every knowledge, with its whole fundamental form, object and subject,
419
in the widest sense is every guidance to the immediate con-
sciousness of that to which neither perception nor conception,
thus in general no knowledge extends. The mystic is thus op-
posed to the philosopher by the fact that he begins from within,
while the philosopher begins from without. The mystic starts
from his inner, positive, individual experience, in which he finds
himself to be the eternal and only being, &c. But nothing of
this is communicable except the assertions which one has to
accept upon his word; consequently he cannot convince. The
philosopher, on the other hand, starts from what is common to
all, from the objective phenomenon which lies before all, and
from the facts of consciousness as they are present in all. His
method is therefore reflection upon all this, and combination [431]
of the data given in it: accordingly he can convince. He ought
therefore to beware of falling into the way of the mystics, and, for
example, by the assertion of intellectual intuitions or pretended
immediate apprehensions of the reason, to seek to make a vain
show of positive knowledge of that which is for ever inaccessible
to all knowledge, or at the most can be indicated by means of a
negation. The value and worth of philosophy lies in the fact that
it rejects all assumptions which cannot be established, and takes
as its data only what can be certainly proved in the world given in
external perception, in the forms of apprehension of this world,
which are constitutive of our intellect, and in the consciousness
entirely ceases, and only in this sphere, which lies beyond all knowledge, do
they claim to have reached their highest goal, for they have then attained to the
sphere in which there is no longer any subject and object, and consequently no
more knowledge, just because there is no more will, the service of which is the
sole destiny of knowledge.
Now, whoever has comprehended this will no longer regard it as beyond
all measure extravagant that Fakirs should sit down, and, contemplating the
tip of their nose, seek to banish all thought and perception, and that in many
passages of the Upanischads instructions are given to sink oneself, silently and
inwardly pronouncing the mysterious Oum, in the depths of one's own being,
where subject and object and all knowledge disappear.
420 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
of one's own self which is common to all. Therefore it must
remain cosmology, and cannot become theology. Its theme must
limit itself to the world; to express in all aspects what this is,
what it is in its inmost nature, is all that it can honestly achieve.
Now it answers to this that my system when it reaches its highest
point assumes a negative character, thus ends with a negation.
It can here speak only of what is denied, given up: but what is
thereby won, what is laid hold of, it is obliged (at the conclusion
of the fourth book) to denote as nothing, and can only add the
consolation that it is merely a relative, not an absolute nothing.
For if something is none of all the things which we know, it is
certainly for us, speaking generally, nothing. But it does not yet
follow from this that it is absolutely nothing, that from every
possible point of view and in every possible sense it must be
nothing, but only that we are limited to a completely negative
knowledge of it, which may very well lie in the limitation of
our point of view. Now it is just here that the mystic proceeds
positively, and therefore it is just from this point that nothing but
mysticism remains. However, any one who wishes this kind of
supplement to the negative knowledge to which alone philoso-
phy can guide him will find it in its most beautiful and richest
form in the Oupnekhat, then also in the Enneads of Plotinus,[432]
in Scotus Erigena, in passages of Jakob Böhm, but especially
in the marvellous work of Madame de Guion, Les Torrens, and
in Angelus Silesius; finally also in the poems of the Sufis, of
which Tholuk has given us a collection translated into Latin,
and another translated into German, and in many other works.
The Sufis are the Gnostics of Islam. Hence Sadi denotes them
by a word which may be translated “full of insight.” Theism,
calculated with reference to the capacity of the multitude, places
the source of existence without us, as an object. All mysticism,
and so also Sufism, according to the various degrees of its ini-
tiation, draws it gradually back within us, as the subject, and
the adept recognises at last with wonder and delight that he is
421
it himself. This procedure, common to all mysticism, we find
not only expressed by Meister Eckhard, the father of German
mysticism, in the form of a precept for the perfect ascetic, “that
he seek not God outside himself” (Eckhard's works, edited by
Pfeiffer, vol. i. p. 626), but also very naïvely exhibited by
Eckhard's spiritual daughter, who sought him out, when she had
experienced that conversion in herself, to cry out joyfully to him,
“Sir, rejoice with me, I have become God” (loc. cit., p. 465). The
mysticism of the Sufis also expresses itself throughout precisely
in accordance with this spirit, principally as a revelling in the
consciousness that one is oneself the kernel of the world and the
source of all existence, to which all returns. Certainly there also
often appears the call to surrender all volition as the only way
in which deliverance from individual existence and its suffering
is possible, yet subordinated and required as something easy. In
the mysticism of the Hindus, on the other hand, the latter side
comes out much more strongly, and in Christian mysticism it
is quite predominant, so that pantheistic consciousness, which
is essential to all mysticism, here only appears in a secondary
manner, in consequence of the surrender of all volition, as union
with God. Corresponding to this difference of the conception, [433]
Mohammedan mysticism has a very serene character, Christian
mysticism a gloomy and melancholy character, while that of the
Hindus, standing above both, in this respect also holds the mean.
Quietism, i.e., surrender of all volition, asceticism, i.e., in-
tentional mortification of one's own will, and mysticism, i.e.,
consciousness of the identity of one's own nature with that of
all things or with the kernel of the world, stand in the closest
connection; so that whoever professes one of them is gradually
led to accept the others, even against his intention. Nothing can
be more surprising than the agreement with each other of the
writers who present these doctrines, notwithstanding the greatest
difference of their age, country, and religion, accompanied by the
firm certainty and inward confidence with which they set forth the permanence of their inner experience. They do not constitute
a sect, which adheres to, defends, and propagates a favourite
dogma once laid hold of; indeed the Indian, Christian, and Mo-
hammedan mystics, quietists, and ascetics are different in every
respect, except the inner significance and spirit of their teaching.
A very striking example of this is afforded by the comparison of
the Torrens of Madame de Guion with the teaching of the Vedas,
especially with the passage in the Oupnekhat, vol. i. p. 63, which
contains the content of that French work in the briefest form,
but accurately and even with the same images, and yet could not
possibly have been known to Madame de Guion in 1680. In the
“Deutschen Theologie” (the only unmutilated edition, Stuttgart,
1851) it is said in chapters 2 and 3 that both the fall of the devil
and that of Adam consisted in the fact that the one as the other
ascribed to himself the I and me, the mine and to me, and on
p. 89 it is said: “In true love there remains neither I nor me,
mine, to me, thou, thine, and the like.” Now, corresponding to
this, it is said in the “Kural,” from the Tamilian by Graul, p. 8:
“The passion of the mine directed outwardly, and that of the I[434]
directed inwardly, cease” (cf. ver. 346). And in the “Manual
of Buddhism” by Spence Hardy, p. 258, Buddha says: “My
disciples reject the thoughts I am this, or this is mine.” In general,
if we look away from the forms which are introduced by external
circumstances and go to the bottom of the matter, we will find
that Sakya Muni and Meister Eckhard teach the same; only that
the former dared to express his thoughts directly, while the latter
is obliged to clothe them in the garments of the Christian myth
and adapt his expressions to this. He carries this, however, so
far that with him the Christian myth has become little more than
a symbolical language, just as the Hellenic myth became for
the Neo-Platonists: he takes it throughout allegorically. In the
same respect it is worth noticing that the transition of St. Francis
from prosperity to the mendicant life is similar to the still greater
step of Buddha Sakya Muni from prince to beggar, and that, corresponding to this, the life of St. Francis, and also the order
he founded, was just a kind of Sannyasiism. Indeed it deserves to
be mentioned that his relationship with the Indian spirit appears
also in his great love for the brutes and frequent intercourse with
them, when he always calls them his sisters and brothers; and his
beautiful Cantico also bears witness to his inborn Indian spirit by
the praise of the sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the water, the
fire, and the earth.49

Even the Christian quietists must often have had little or no
knowledge of each other; for example, Molinos and Madame de
Guion of Tauler and the “Deutsche Theologie,” or Gichtel of the
former. In any case, the great difference of their culture, in that
some of them, like Molinos, were learned, others, like Gichtel
and many more, were the reverse, has no essential influence upon
their teaching. Their great internal agreement, along with the [435]
firmness and certainty of their utterances, proves all the more
that they speak from real inward experience, from an experience
which certainly is not accessible to all, but is possessed only by
a few favoured individuals, and therefore has received the name
of the work of grace, the reality of which, however, for the above
reasons, is not to be doubted. But in order to understand all
this one must read the mystics themselves, and not be contented
with second-hand reports of them; for every one must himself
be comprehended before one judges concerning him. Thus to
become acquainted with quietism I specially recommend Meister
Eckhard, the “Deutsche Theologie,” Tauler, Madame de Guion,
Antoinette Bourignon, the English Bunyan, Molinos50 and Gich-

profound seriousness of asceticism, the life of Pascal, edited by
Reuchlin, together with his history of the Port-Royal, and also
the Histoire de Sainte Elisabeth, par le comte de Montalembert,
and La vie de Rancé, par Chateaubriand, are very well worth
reading, but yet by no means exhaust all that is important in this
class. Whoever has read such writings, and compared their spirit
with that of ascetism and quietism as it runs through all works of
Brahmanism and Buddhism, and speaks in every page, will ad-
mit that every philosophy, which must in consistency reject that
whole mode of thought, which it can only do by explaining the
representatives of it to be either impostors or mad-men, must just
on this account necessarily be false. But all European systems,
with the exception of mine, find themselves in this position.
Truly it must be an extraordinary madness which, under the most
widely different circumstances and persons possible, spoke with
such agreement, and, moreover, was raised to the position of a[436]
chief doctrine of their religion, by the most ancient and numer-
ous peoples of the earth, something like three-fourths of all the
inhabitants of Asia. But no philosophy can leave the theme of
quietism and asceticism undecided if the question is proposed to
it; because this theme is, in its matter, identical with that of all
metaphysics and ethics. Here then is a point upon which I ex-
pect and desire that every philosophy, with its optimism, should
declare itself. And if, in the judgment of contemporaries, the
paradoxical and unexampled agreement of my philosophy with
quietism and asceticism appears as an open stumbling-block, I,
on the contrary, see just in that agreement a proof of its sole
correctness and truth, and also a ground of explanation of why it
is ignored and kept secret by the Protestant universities.
For not only the religions of the East, but also true Christiani-
ty, has throughout that ascetic fundamental character which my
philosophy explains as the denial of the will to live; although
Protestantism, especially in its present form, seeks to conceal
this. Yet even the open enemies of Christianity who have ap-
425
peared in the most recent times have ascribed to it the doctrines
of renunciation, self-denial, perfect chastity, and, in general,
mortification of the will, which they quite correctly denote by
the name of the “anti-cosmic tendency,” and have fully proved
that such doctrines are essentially proper to original and genuine
Christianity. In this they are undeniably right. But that they set
up this as an evident and patent reproach to Christianity, while
just here lies its profoundest truth, its high value, and its sublime
character,—this shows an obscuring of the mind, which can only
be explained by the fact that these men's minds, unfortunately
like thousands more at the present day in Germany, are complete-
ly spoiled and distorted by the miserable Hegelism, that school
of dulness, that centre of misunderstanding and ignorance, that
mind-destroying, spurious wisdom, which now at last begins to
be recognised as such, and the veneration of which will soon [437]
be left to the Danish Academy, in whose eyes even that gross
charlatan is a summus philosophus, for whom it takes the field:—
“Car ils suivront la créance et estude,
De l'ignorante et sotte multitude,
Dont le plus lourd sera reça pour juge.”
—RABELAIS.

In any case, the ascetic tendency is unmistakable in the gen-
uine and original Christianity as it developed in the writings of
the Church Fathers from its kernel in the New Testament; it is the
summit towards which all strives upwards. As its chief doctrine
we find the recommendation of genuine and pure celibacy (this
first and most important step in the denial of the will to live),
which is already expressed in the New Testament.51 Strauss
also, in his “Life of Jesus” (vol i. p. 618 of the first edition),
says, with reference to the recommendation of celibacy given
51 Matt. xix. 11 seq.; Luke xx. (1 Thess. iv. 3; 1 John iii. 3); Rev. 35-37; 1
Cor. vii. 1-11 and 25-40, xiv. 4.

in Matt. xix. 11 seq., “That the doctrine of Jesus may not
run counter to the ideas of the present day, men have hastened
to introduce surreptitiously the thought that Jesus only praised
celibacy with reference to the circumstances of the time, and in
order to leave the activity of the Apostles unfettered; but there
is even less indication of this in the context than in the kindred
passage, 1 Cor. vii. 25 seq.; but we have here again one of
the places where ascetic principles, such as prevailed among the
Essenes, and probably still more widely among the Jews, appear
in the teaching of Jesus also.” This ascetic tendency appears
more decidedly later than at the beginning, when Christianity,
still seeking adherents, dared not pitch its demands too high;
and by the beginning of the third century it is expressly urged.
Marriage, in genuine Christianity, is merely a compromise with
the sinful nature of man, as a concession, something allowed to
those who lack strength to aspire to the highest, an expedient[438]
to avoid greater evil: in this sense it receives the sanction of the
Church in order that the bond may be indissoluble. But celibacy
and virginity are set up as the higher consecration of Christianity
through which one enters the ranks of the elect. Through these
alone does one attain the victor's crown, which even at the present
day is signified by the wreath upon the coffin of the unmarried,
and also by that which the bride lays aside on the day of her
marriage.
A piece of evidence upon this point, which certainly comes
to us from the primitive times of Christianity, is the pregnant
answer of the Lord, quoted by Clemens Alexandrinus (Strom. iii.
6 et 9) from the Gospel of the Egyptians: “§√ £±ª…º√ A ∫≈¡πø¬
¿≈Ω∏±ΩøºμΩ√, ºμ«¡π ¿øƒμ ∏±Ω±ƒø¬ π√«≈√μπ; ºμ«¡π¬ ±Ω μπ¿μΩ,

gebit mors? Dominus guoadlusque inguit vos, mulieres, paritis).
“§ø≈ƒΩ μ√ƒπ, ºμ«¡π¬ ±Ω ±1 μ¿π∏≈ºπ±π μΩμ¡≥…√π” (Hoc est, quamdiu
operabuntur cupiditates), adds Clement, c. 9, with which he at
once connects the famous passage, Rom. v. 12. Further on,

c. 13, he quotes the words of Cassianus: “†≈Ω∏±ΩøºμΩ∑¬ ƒ∑¬
£±ª…º∑¬, ¿øƒμ ≥Ω…√∏∑√μƒ±π ƒ± ¿μ¡π aΩ ∑¡μƒø, μ∆∑ A ∫≈¡πø¬,

(Cum interrogaret Salome, quando cognoscentur ea, de quibus
interrogabat, ait Dominus: quando pudoris indumentum concul-
caveritis, et quando duo facto fuerint unum, et masculum cum
fæmina nec masculum, nec fæminium), i.e., when she no longer
needs the veil of modesty, since all distinction of sex will have
disappeared.

With regard to this point the heretics have certainly gone
furthest: even in the second century the Tatianites or Encratites,
the Gnostics, the Marcionites, the Montanists, Valentinians, and
Cassians; yet only because with reckless consistency they gave
honour to the truth, and therefore, in accordance with the spirit
of Christianity, they taught perfect continence; while the Church
prudently declared to be heresy all that ran counter to its far-see- [439]
ing policy. Augustine says of the Tatianites: “Nuptias damnant,
atque omnino pares eas fornicationibus aliisque corruptionibus
faciunt: nec recipiunt in suum numerum conjugio utentem, sive
marem, sive fœminam. Non vescunlur carnibus, easque abomi-
nantur.” (De hœresi ad quod vult Deum. hœr., 25.) But even the
orthodox Fathers look upon marriage in the light indicated above,
and zealously preach entire continence, the ≥Ωμπ±. Athanasius
gives as the cause of marriage: “Iƒπ ≈¿ø¿π¿ƒøΩƒμ¬ μ√ºμΩ ƒ√

... nam finis, a Deo prœlatus, erat, nos non per nuptias et
corruptionem fieri: sed transgressio mandati nuptias introduxit,
propter legis violationem Adœ.—Exposit. in psalm. 50). Tertullian calls marriage genus mali inferioris, ex indulgentia ortum
(De pudicitia, c. 16) and says: “Matrimonium et stuprum est commixtio carnis; scilicet cujus concupiscentiam dominus stu-
pro adœquavit. Ergo, inguis, jam et primas, id est unas nuptias
destruis? Nec immerito: quoniam et ipsœ ex eo constant, quod
est stuprum” (De exhort. castit., c. 9). Indeed, Augustine himself
commits himself entirely to this doctrine and all its results, for
he says: “Novi quosdam, qui murmurent: quid, si, inquiunt,
omnes velint ab omni concubitu abstinere, unde subsistet genus
humanum? Utinam omnes hoc vellent! dumtaxat in caritate, de
corde puro et conscientia bona, et fide non ficta: multo citius
Dei civitas compleretur, ut acceleraretur terminus mundi” (De
bono conjugali, c. 10). And again: “Non vos ab hoc studio, quo
multos ad imitandum vos excitatis, frangat querela vanorum,
qui dicunt: quomodo subsistet genus humanum, si omnes fuerint
continentes? Quasi propter aliud retardetur hoc seculum, nisi
ut impleatur prœdestinatus numerus ille sanctorum, quo citius
impleto, profecto nec terminus seculi differetur” (De bono indi-
viduitatis, c. 23). One sees at once that he identifies salvation[440]
with the end of the world. The other passages in the works of
Augustine which bear on this point will be found collected in
the “Confessio Augustiniana e D. Augustini operibus compilata
a Hieronymo Torrense,” 1610, under the headings De matrimo-
nio, De cœlibatu, &c., and any one may convince himself from
these that in ancient, genuine Christianity marriage was only a
concession, which besides this was supposed to have only the
begetting of children as its end, that, on the other hand, perfect
continence was the true virtue far to be preferred to this. To
those, however, who do not wish to go back to the authorities
themselves I recommend two works for the purpose of removing
any kind of doubt as to the tendency of Christianity we are speak-
ing about: Carové, “Ueber das Cölibatgesetz,” 1832, and Lind,
“De cœlibatu Christianorum per tria priora secula,” Havniœ,
1839. It is, however, by no means the views of these writers
themselves to which I refer, for these are opposed to mine, but
solely to their carefully collected accounts and quotations, which
429
deserve full acceptance as quite trustworthy, just because both
these writers are opponents of celibacy, the former a rationalistic
Catholic, and the other a Protestant candidate in theology, who
speaks exactly like one. In the first-named work we find, vol.
i. p. 166, in that reference, the following result expressed: “In
accordance with the Church view, as it may be read in canonical
Church Fathers, in the Synodal and Papal instructions, and in
innumerable writings of orthodox Catholics, perpetual chastity is
called a divine, heavenly, angelic virtue, and the obtaining of the
assistance of divine grace for this end is made dependent upon
earnest prayer. We have already shown that this Augustinian
doctrine is by Canisius and in the decrees of the Council of Trent
expressed as an unchanging belief of the Church. That, however,
it has been retained as a dogma till the present day is sufficiently
established by the June number, 1831, of the magazine ‘Der Katholik.’ 

It is said there, p. 263: ‘In Catholicism the obser- [441]
vance of a perpetual chastity, for the sake of God, appears as in
itself the highest merit of man. The view that the observance
of continual chastity as an end in itself sanctifies and exalts the
man is, as every instructed Catholic is convinced, deeply rooted
in Christianity, both as regards its spirit and its express precepts.
The decrees of the Council of Trent have abolished all possible
doubt on this point....’ It must at any rate be confessed by every
unprejudiced person, not only that the doctrine expressed by ‘Der
Katholik’ is really Catholic, but also that the proofs adduced may
be quite irrefutable for a Catholic reason, because they are drawn
so directly from the ecclesiastical view, taken by the Church, of
life and its destiny.” It is further said in the same work, p. 270:
“Although both Paul calls the forbidding to marry a false doctrine, and the still Judaistic author of the Epistle to the Hebrews
enjoins that marriage shall be held in honour by all, and the bed
kept undefiled (Heb. xiii 4), yet the main tendency of these two
sacred writers is not on that account to be mistaken. Virginity
is for both the perfect state, marriage only a make-shift for the weak, and only as such to be held inviolable. The highest effort,
on the other hand, was directed to complete, material putting off
of self. The self must turn and refrain from all that tends only
to its own pleasure, and that only temporarily.” Lastly, p. 288:
“We agree with the Abbé Zaccaria, who asserts that celibacy (not
the law of celibacy) is before everything to be deduced from the
teaching of Christ and the Apostle Paul.”

What is opposed to this specially Christian view is everywhere
and always merely the Old Testament, with its ¿±Ωƒ± ∫±ª± ªπ±Ω.
This appears with peculiar distinctness from that important third
book of the Stromata of Clement, where, arguing against the en-
cratistic heretics mentioned above, he constantly opposes to them
only Judaism, with its optimistic history of creation, with which
the world-denying tendency of the New Testament is certainly[442]
in contradiction. But the connection of the New Testament with
the Old is at bottom only external, accidental, and forced; and
the one point at which Christian doctrine can link itself on to the
latter is only to be found, as has been said, in the story of the fall,
which, moreover, stands quite isolated in the Old Testament, and
is made no further use of. But, in accordance with the account in
the Gospels, it is just the orthodox adherents of the Old Testament
who bring about the crucifixion of the founder of Christianity,
because they find his teaching in conflict with their own. In
the said third book of the Stromata of Clement the antagonism
between optimism with theism on the one hand, and pessimism
with ascetic morality on the other, comes out with surprising
distinctness. This book is directed against the Gnostics, who just
taught pessimism and asceticism, that is, μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ± (abstinence
of every kind, but especially from all sexual satisfaction); on
account of which Clement censures them vigorously. But, at
the same time, it becomes apparent that even the spirit of the
Old Testament stands in this antagonism with that of the New
Testament. For, apart from the fall, which appears in the Old
Testament like a hors d'œuvre, the spirit of the Old Testament is diametrically opposed to that of the New Testament—the former
optimistic, the latter pessimistic. Clement himself brings this
contradiction out prominently at the end of the eleventh chapter
(¿¡ø√±¿øƒμπΩøºμΩøΩ ƒøΩ †±≈ªøΩ ƒÛ ö¡π√ƒ√ ∫.ƒ.ª.), although he
will not allow that it is a real contradiction, but explains it as only
apparent,—like a good Jew, as he is. In general it is interesting
to see how with Clement the New and the Old Testament get
mixed up together; and he strives to reconcile them, yet for the
most part drives out the New Testament with the Old. Just at
the beginning of the third chapter he objects to the Marcionites
that they find fault with the creation, after the example of Plato
and Pythagoras; for Marcion teaches that nature is bad, made [443]
out of bad materials (∆≈√π¬ ∫±∫∑, μ∫ ƒμ Qª∑¬ ∫±∫∑¬); therefore
one ought not to people this world, but to abstain from marriage
(º∑ ≤ø≈ªøºμΩøπ ƒøΩ ∫ø√ºøΩ √≈º¿ª∑¡ø≈Ω, ±¿μ«μ√∏±π ≥±ºø≈).
Now Clement, to whom in general the Old Testament is much
more congenial and convincing than the New, takes this very
much amiss. He sees in it their flagrant ingratitude to and enmity
and rebellion against him who has made the world, the just
demiurgus, whose work they themselves are, and yet despise the
use of his creatures, in impious rebellion “forsaking the natural
opinion” (±Ωƒπƒ±√√øºμΩøπ ƒÛ ¿øπ∑ƒ√ ƒÛ √∆…Ω, ... μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ¬ ƒ√
¿¡ø¬ ƒøΩ ¿μ¿øπ∑∫øƒ± μ«∏¡≥, º∑ ≤ø≈ªøºμΩøπ «¡∑√∏±π ƒøπ¬ Q¿Ω

ªø≥π√º…π). At the same time, in his holy zeal, he will not allow
the Marcionites even the honour of originality, but, armed with
his well-known erudition, he brings it against them, and supports
his case with the most beautiful quotations, that even the ancient
philosophers, that Heraclitus and Empedocles, Pythagoras and
Plato, Orpheus and Pindar, Herodotus and Euripides, and also
the Sibyls, lamented deeply the wretched nature of the world,
thus taught pessimism. Now in this learned enthusiasm he does
not observe that in this way he is just giving the Marcionites
water for their mill, for he shows that

“All the wisest of all the ages”
have taught and sung what they do, but confidently and boldly
he quotes the most decided and energetic utterances of the an-
cients in this sense. Certainly they cannot lead him astray. Wise
men may mourn the sadness of existence, poets may pour out
the most affecting lamentations about it, nature and experience
may cry out as loudly as they will against optimism,—all this
does not touch our Church Father: he holds his Jewish revelation
in his hand, and remains confident. The demiurgus made the
world. From this it is a priori certain that it is excellent, and it[444]
may look as it likes. The same thing then takes place with regard
to the second point, the μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ±, through which, according
to his view, the Marcionites show their ingratitude towards the
demiurgus (±«±¡π√μπΩ ƒÛ ¥∑ºπø≈¡≥Û) and the perversity with
which they put from them all his gifts (¥0 ±Ωƒπƒ±æπΩ ¿¡ø¬ ƒøΩ
¥∑ºπø≈¡≥øΩ, ƒ∑Ω «¡∑√πΩ ƒ…Ω ∫ø√ºπ∫…Ω ¿±¡±πƒø≈ºμΩøπ). Here
now the tragic poets have preceded the Encratites (to the preju-
dice of their originality) and have said the same things. For since
they also lament the infinite misery of existence, they have added
that it is better to bring no children into such a world; which
he now again supports with the most beautiful passages, and, at
the same time, accuses the Pythagoreans of having renounced
sexual pleasure on this ground. But all this touches him not; he
sticks to his principle that all these sin against the demiurgus, in
that they teach that one ought not to marry, ought not to beget
children, ought not to bring new miserable beings into the world,
ought not to provide new food for death (¥0 μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ±¬ ±√μ≤ø≈√π

ƒμ¡ø≈¬, º∑¥μ μ¿π«ø¡∑≥μπΩ ∏±Ω±ƒÛ ƒ¡ø∆∑Ω—c. 6). Since the
learned Church Father thus denounces μ≥∫¡±ƒμπ±, he seems to
have had no presentiment that just after his time the celibacy of the Christian priesthood would be more and more introduced, and
finally, in the eleventh century, raised to the position of a law,
because it is in keeping with the spirit of the New Testament. It is
just this spirit which the Gnostics have grasped more profoundly
and understood better than our Church Father, who is more Jew
than Christian. The conception of the Gnostics comes out very
clearly at the beginning of the ninth chapter, where the following
passage is quoted from the Gospel of the Egyptians: ë≈ƒø¬ μπ¿μΩ
A £…ƒ∑¡, “∑ª∏øΩ ∫±ƒ±ª≈√±π ƒ± μ¡≥± ƒ∑¬ ∏∑ªμπ±¬;” ∏∑ªμπ±¬

dixisse Servatorem: veni ad dissolvendum opera feminæ; feminæ
quidem, cupiditatis; opera autem, generationem et interitum);
but quite specially at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning
of the fourteenth chapter. The Church certainly was obliged to
consider how to set a religion upon its legs that could also walk
and stand in the world as it is, and among men; therefore it
declared these persons to be heretics. At the conclusion of the
seventh chapter our Church Father opposes Indian asceticism, as
bad, to Christian Judaism; whereby the fundamental difference
of the spirit of the two religions is clearly brought out. In Judaism
and Christianity everything runs back to obedience or disobedi-
ence to the command of God: Q¿±∫ø∑ ∫±π ¿±¡±∫ø∑; as befits us
creatures, !ºπΩ, ƒøπ¬ ¿μ¿ª±√ºμΩøπ¬ Q¿ø ƒ∑¬ ƒø≈ †±Ωƒø∫¡±ƒø¡ø¬
≤ø≈ª∑√μ…¬ (nobis, qui Omnipotentis voluntate efficti sumus),
chap. 14. Then comes, as a second duty, ª±ƒ¡μ≈μπΩ ∏μÛ ∂…Ωƒπ,
to serve God, extol His works, and overflow with thankfulness.
Certainly the matter has a very different aspect in Brahmanism
and Buddhism, for in the latter all improvement and conversion,
and the only deliverance we can hope for from this world of
suffering, this Sansara, proceeds from the knowledge of the four
fundamental truths: (1) dolor; (2) doloris ortus; (3) doloris inte-
ritus; (4) octopartita via ad doloris sedationem (Dammapadam,
ed. Fausböll, p. 35 et 347). The explanation of these four truths
will be found in Bournouf, “Introduct. à l'hist. du Buddhisme,”
434 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
p. 629, and in all expositions of Buddhism.

In truth, Judaism, with its ¿±Ωƒ± ∫±ª± ªπ±Ω, is not related to
Christianity as regards its spirit and ethical tendency, but Brah-
manism and Buddhism are. But the spirit and ethical tendency
are what is essential in a religion, not the myths in which these
are clothed. I therefore cannot give up the belief that the doctrines
of Christianity can in some way be derived from these primitive
religions. I have pointed out some traces of this in the second[446]
volume of the Parerga, § 179 (second edition, § 180). I have
to add to these that Epiphanias (Hæretic. xviii.) relates that
the first Jewish Christians of Jerusalem, who called themselves
Nazarenes, refrained from all animal food. On account of this
origin (or, at least, this agreement) Christianity belongs to the
ancient, true and sublime faith of mankind, which is opposed to
the false, shallow, and injurious optimism which exhibits itself
in Greek paganism, Judaism, and Islamism. The Zend religion
holds to a certain extent the mean, because it has opposed to
Ormuzd a pessimistic counterpoise in Ahriman. From this Zend
religion the Jewish religion proceeded, as J.G. Rhode has thor-
oughly proved in his book, “Die heilige Sage des Zendvolks;”
from Ormuzd has come Jehovah, and from Ahriman, Satan,
who, however, plays only a very subordinate rôle in Judaism,
indeed almost entirely disappears, whereby then optimism gains
the upper hand, and there only remains the myth of the fall as a
pessimistic element, which certainly (as the fable of Meschia and
Meschiane) is derived from the Zend-Avesta. Yet even this falls
into oblivion, till it is again taken up by Christianity along with
Satan. Ormuzd himself, however, is derived from Brahmanism,
although from a lower region of it; he is no other than Indra, that
subordinate god of the firmament and the atmosphere, who is
represented as frequently in rivalry with men. This has been very
clearly shown by J.J. Schmidt in his work on the relation of the
Gnostic-theosophic doctrines to the religions of the East. This
Indra-Ormuzd-Jehovah had afterwards to pass over into Chris-
435
tianity, because this religion arose in Judæa. But on account of
the cosmopolitan character of Christianity he laid aside his own
name to be denoted in the language of each converted nation
by the appellation of the superhuman beings he supplanted, as,
îμø¬, Deus, which comes from the Sanscrit Deva (from which
also devil comes), or among the Gothico-Germanic peoples by
the word God, Gott, which comes from Odin, Wodan, Guodan,
Godan. In the same way he assumed in Islamism, which also [447]
sprang from Judaism, the name of Allah, which also existed
earlier in Arabia. Analogous to this, the gods of the Greek Olym-
pus, when in prehistoric times they were transplanted to Italy,
also assumed the names of the previously reigning gods: hence
among the Romans Zeus is called Jupiter, Hera Juno, Hermes
Mercury, &c. In China the first difficulty of the missionaries
arose from the fact that the Chinese language has no appellation
of the kind and also no word for creating; for the three religions
of China know no gods either in the plural or in the singular.52
However the rest may be, that ¿±Ωƒ± ∫±ª± ªπ±Ω of the Old
Testament is really foreign to true Christianity; for in the New
Testament the world is always spoken of as something to which
one does not belong, which one does not love, nay, whose lord
is the devil.53 This agrees with the ascetic spirit of the denial
of one's self and the overcoming of the world which, just like
the boundless love of one's neighbour, even of one's enemy, is

53 For example, John xii. 25, 31, xiv. 30, xv. 18, 19, xvi. 33; Col. ii.
20; Eph. ii. 1-3; I John ii. 15-17, iv. 4, 5. On this opportunity one may
see how certain Protestant theologians, in their efforts to misinterpret the text
of the New Testament in conformity with their rationalistic, optimistic, and
unutterably shallow view of life, go so far that they actually falsify this text
in their translations. Thus H. A. Schott, in his new version given with the
Griesbach text of 1805, has translated the word ∫ø√ºø¬, John xv. 18, 19, by
Judœi, 1 John iv. 4, by profani homines; and Col. ii. 20, √ƒøπ«μπ± ƒø≈ ∫ø√ºøΩ
by elementa Judaica; while Luther everywhere renders the word honestly and
correctly by “Welt” (world).

the fundamental characteristic which Christianity has in com-
mon with Brahmanism and Buddhism, and which proves their
relationship. There is nothing in which one has to distinguish the
kernel so carefully from the shell as in Christianity. Just because
I prize this kernel highly I sometimes treat the shell with little
ceremony; it is, however, thicker than is generally supposed.
Protestantism, since it has eliminated asceticism and its central[448]
point, the meritoriousness of celibacy, has already given up the
inmost kernel of Christianity, and so far is to be regarded as a
falling away from it. This has become apparent in our own day by
the gradual transition of Protestantism into shallow rationalism,
this modern Pelagianism, which ultimately degenerates into the
doctrine of a loving father, who has made the world, in order
that things may go on very pleasantly in it (in which case, then,
he must certainly have failed), and who, if one only conforms
to his will in certain respects, will also afterwards provide a still
more beautiful world (with regard to which it is only a pity that
it has such a fatal entrance). That may be a good religion for
comfortable, married, and enlightened Protestant pastors; but it
is no Christianity. Christianity is the doctrine of the deep guilt
of the human race through its existence alone, and the longing
of the heart for deliverance from it, which, however, can only be
attained by the greatest sacrifices and by the denial of one's own
self, thus by an entire reversal of human nature. Luther may have
been perfectly right from the practical point of view, i.e., with
reference to the Church scandal of his time, which he wished
to remove, but not so from the theoretical point of view. The
more sublime a doctrine is, the more it is exposed to abuse at
the hands of human nature, which, on the whole, is of a low and
evil disposition: hence the abuses of Catholicism are so much
more numerous and so much greater than those of Protestantism.
Thus, for example, monasticism, that methodical denial of the
will practised in common for the sake of mutual encouragement,
is an institution of a sublime description, which, however, for this very reason is for the most part untrue to its spirit. The
shocking abuses of the Church excited in the honest mind of
Luther a lofty indignation. But in consequence of this he was led
to desire to limit as much as possible the claims of Christianity
itself, and for this end he first confined it to the words of the [449]
Bible; but then, in his well-meant zeal, he went too far, for he
attacked the very heart of Christianity in the ascetic principle.
For after the withdrawal of the ascetic principle, the optimistic
principle soon necessarily took its place. But in religions, as in
philosophy, optimism is a fundamental error which obstructs the
path of all truth. From all this it seems to me that Catholicism is a
shamefully abused, but Protestantism a degenerate Christianity;
thus, that Christianity in general has met the fate which befalls
all that is noble, sublime, and great whenever it has to dwell
among men.

However, even in the very lap of Protestantism, the essentially
ascetic and encratistic spirit of Christianity has made way for
itself; and in this case it has appeared in a phenomenon which
perhaps has never before been equalled in magnitude and def-
initeness, the highly remarkable sect of the Shakers, in North
America, founded by an Englishwoman, Anne Lee, in 1774.
The adherents of this sect have already increased to 6000, who
are divided into fifteen communities, and inhabit a number of
villages in the states of New York and Kentucky, especially in
the district of New Lebanon, near Nassau village. The funda-
mental characteristic of their religious rule of life is celibacy and
entire abstention from all sexual satisfaction. It is unanimously
admitted, even by the English and Americans who visit them, and
who laugh and jeer at them in every other respect, that this rule is
strictly and with perfect honesty observed; although brothers and
sisters sometimes even occupy the same house, eat at the same
table, nay, dance together in the religious services in church. For
whoever has made that hardest of all sacrifices may dance before
the Lord; he is a victor, he has overcome. Their singing in church
438 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
consists in general of cheerful, and partly even of merry, songs.
The church-dance, also, which follows the sermon is accompa-
nied by the singing of the rest. It is a lively dance, performed in
measured time, and concludes with a galop, which is carried on[450]
till the dancers are exhausted. Between each dance one of their
teachers cries aloud, “Think, that ye rejoice before the Lord for
having slain your flesh; for this is here the only use we make of
our refractory limbs.” To celibacy most of the other conditions
link themselves on of themselves. There are no families, and
therefore there is no private property, but community of goods.
All are clothed alike, in Quaker fashion, and with great neatness.
They are industrious and diligent: idleness is not endured. They
have also the enviable rule that they are to avoid all unnecessary
noise, such as shouting, door-slamming, whip-cracking, loud
knocking, &c. Their rule of life has been thus expressed by
one of them: “Lead a life of innocence and purity, love your
neighbours as yourself, live at peace with all men, and refrain
from war, blood-shed, and all violence against others, as well as
from all striving after worldly honour and distinction. Give to
each his own, and follow after holiness, without which no man
can see the Lord. Do good to all so far as your opportunity and
your power extends.” They persuade no one to join them, but
test those who present themselves by a novitiate of several years.
Moreover, every one is free to leave them; very rarely is any one
expelled for misconduct. Adopted children are carefully educat-
ed, and only when they are grown up do they voluntarily join the
sect. It is said that in the controversies of their ministers with
Anglican clergy the latter generally come off the worse, for the
arguments consist of passages from the New Testament. Fuller
accounts of them will be found particularly in Maxwell's “Run
through the United States,” 1841; also in Benedict's “History of
all Religions,” 1830; also in the Times, November 4, 1837, and in
the German magazine Columbus, May number, 1831. 

A German
sect in America, very similar to them, who also live in strict celibacy and continence, are the Rappists. An account of them is
given in F. Loher's “Geschichte und Zustande der Deutschen in
Amerika,” 1853. In Russia also the Raskolniks are a similar sect. [451]
The Gichtelians live also in strict chastity. But among the ancient
Jews we already find a prototype of all these sects, the Essenes,
of whom even Pliny gives an account (Hist. Nat., v. 15), and who
resembled the Shakers very much, not only in celibacy, but also
in other respects; for example, in dancing during divine service,
which leads to the opinion that the founder of the Shakers took
the Essenes as a pattern. In the presence of such facts as these
how does Luther's assertion look: “Ubi natura, quemadmodum a
Deo nobis insita est, fertur ac rapitur, FIERI NULLO MODO POTEST,
ut extra matrimonium caste vivatur”? (Catech. maj.)
Although Christianity, in essential respects, taught only what
all Asia knew long before, and even better, yet for Europe it
was a new and great revelation, in consequence of which the
spiritual tendency of the European nations was therefore entirely
transformed. For it disclosed to them the metaphysical signifi-
cance of existence, and therefore taught them to look away from
the narrow, paltry, ephemeral life of earth, and to regard it no
longer as an end in itself, but as a condition of suffering, guilt,
trial, conflict, and purification, out of which, by means of moral
achievements, difficult renunciation, and denial of oneself, one
may rise to a better existence, which is inconceivable by us. It
taught the great truth of the assertion and denial of the will to
live in the clothing of allegory by saying that through Adam's
fall the curse has come upon all, sin has come into the world, and
guilt is inherited by all; but that, on the other hand, through the
sacrificial death of Jesus all are reconciled, the world saved, guilt
abolished, and justice satisfied. In order, however, to understand
the truth itself that is contained in this myth one must not regard
men simply in time, as beings independent of each other, but
must comprehend the (Platonic) Idea of man, which is related
to the series of men, as eternity in itself is related to eternity drawn out as time; hence the eternal Idea man extended in time to the series of men through the connecting bond of generation
appears again in time as a whole. If now we keep the Idea
of man in view, we see that Adam's fall represents the finite,
animal, sinful nature of man, in respect of which he is a finite
being, exposed to sin, suffering, and death. On the other hand,
the life, teaching, and death of Jesus Christ represent the eternal,
supernatural side, the freedom, the salvation of man. Now every
man, as such and potentiâ, is both Adam and Jesus, according
as he comprehends himself, and his will thereupon determines
him; in consequence of which he is then condemned and given
over to death, or saved and attains to eternal life. Now these
truths, both in their allegorical and in their real acceptation, were
completely new as far as Greeks and Romans were concerned,
who were still entirely absorbed in life, and did not seriously
look beyond it. Let whoever doubts this see how Cicero (Pro
Cluentio, c. 61) and Sallust (Catil., c. 47) speak of the state after
death. The ancients, although far advanced in almost everything
else, remained children with regard to the chief concern, and
were surpassed in this even by the Druids, who at least taught
metempsychosis. That one or two philosophers, like Pythagoras
and Plato, thought otherwise alters nothing as regards the whole.
That great fundamental truth, then, which is contained in
Christianity, as in Brahmanism and Buddhism, the need of de-
liverance from an existence which is given up to suffering and
death, and the attainableness of this by the denial of the will,
thus by a decided opposition to nature, is beyond all comparison
the most important truth there can be; but, at the same time, it is
entirely opposed to the natural tendency of the human race, and
in its true grounds it is difficult to comprehend; as indeed all that
can only be thought generally and in the abstract is inaccessible
to the great majority of men. Therefore for these men there was
everywhere required, in order to bring that great truth within the[453]
sphere of its practical application, a mythical vehicle for it, as it
441
were a receptacle, without which it would be lost and dissipated.
The truth had therefore everywhere to borrow the garb of the
fable, and also constantly to endeavour to connect itself with
what in each case was historically given, already familiar, and
already revered. What sensu proprio remained inaccessible to
the great mass of mankind of all ages and lands, with their low
tone of mind, their intellectual stupidity and general brutality,
had, for practical purposes, to be brought home to them sensu
allegorico, in order to become their guiding star. So, then,
the religions mentioned above are to be regarded as the sacred
vessels in which the great truth, known and expressed for several
thousand years, indeed perhaps since the beginning of the human
race, which yet in itself, for the great mass of mankind always
remains a mystery, is, according to the measure of their powers,
made accessible to them, preserved and transmitted through the
centuries. Yet, because all that does not through and through
consist of the imperishable material of pure truth is subject to
destruction, whenever this fate befalls such a vessel, through
contact with a heterogeneous age, its sacred content must in
some way be saved and preserved for mankind by another. But
it is the task of philosophy, since it is one with pure truth, to
present that content pure and unmixed, thus merely in abstract
conceptions, and consequently without that vehicle, for those
who are capable of thinking, who are always an exceedingly
small number. It is therefore related to religions as a straight line
to several curves running near it: for it expresses sensu proprio,
thus reaches directly, what they show in veiled forms and reach
by circuitous routes.

If now, in order to illustrate what has just been said by an
example, and also to follow a philosophical fashion of my time, I
should wish perhaps to attempt to solve the profoundest mystery
of Christianity, that of the Trinity, in the fundamental conception [454]
of my philosophy, this could be done, with the licence permitted
in such interpretations, in the following manner. The Holy Ghost
442 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
is the distinct denial of the will to live: the man in whom this
exhibits itself in concreto is the Son; He is identical with the will
which asserts life, and thereby produces the phenomenon of this
perceptible world, i.e., with the Father, because the assertion and
denial are opposite acts of the same will whose capability for
both is the only true freedom. However, this is to be regarded as
a mere lusus ingenii.
Before I close this chapter I wish to adduce a few proofs in
support of what in § 68 of the first volume I denoted by the
expression îμ≈ƒ≈¡ø¬ ¿ªø≈¬, the bringing about of the denial of
the will by one's own deeply felt suffering, thus not merely by
the appropriation of the suffering of others, and the knowledge
of the vanity and wretchedness of our existence introduced by
this. We can arrive at a comprehension of what goes on in
the heart of a man, in the case of an elevation of this kind and
the accompanying purifying process, by considering what every
emotional man experiences on beholding a tragedy, which is
of kindred nature to this. In the third and fourth acts perhaps
such a man is distressed and disturbed by the ever more clouded
and threatened happiness of the hero; but when, in the fifth act,
this happiness is entirely wrecked and shattered, he experiences
a certain elevation of the soul, which affords him an infinitely
higher kind of pleasure than the sight of the happiness of the
hero, however great it might be, could ever have given. Now
this is the same thing, in the weak water-colours of sympathy
which is able to raise a well-known illusion, as that which takes
place with the energy of reality in the feeling of our own fate
when it is heavy misfortune that drives the man at last into the
haven of entire resignation. Upon this occurrence depend all
those conversions which completely transform men such as are[455]
described in the text. I may give here in a few words the story
of the conversion of the Abbé Rancé, as it is strikingly similar to
that of Raymond Lully, which is told in the text, and besides this
is memorable on account of its result. 

His youth was devoted to enjoyment and pleasure; finally, he lived in a relation of passion
with a Madame de Montbazon. One evening, when he visited
her, he found her room empty, in disorder and darkness. He
struck something with his foot; it was her head, which had been
severed from the trunk, because after her sudden death her corpse
could not otherwise be got into the lead coffin that stood beside
it. After overcoming an immense sorrow, Rancé now became,
in 1663, the reformer of the order of the Trappists, which at that
time had entirely relaxed the strictness of its rules. He joined this
order, and through him it was led back to that terrible degree of
renunciation which is still maintained at the present day at La
Trappe, and, as the methodically carried out denial of the will,
aided by the severest renunciation and an incredibly hard and
painful manner of life, fills the visitor with sacred awe, after he
has been touched at his reception by the humility of these genuine
monks, who, emaciated by fasting, by cold, by night watches,
prayers and penances, kneel before him, the worldling and the
sinner, to implore his blessing. Of all orders of monks, this one
alone has maintained itself in perfection in France, through all
changes; which is to be attributed to the profound earnestness
which in it is unmistakable, and excludes all secondary ends. It
has remained untouched even by the decline of religion, because
its root lies deeper in human nature than any positive system of
belief.

I have mentioned in the text that this great and rapid change
of the inmost being of man which we are here considering, and
which has hitherto been entirely neglected by philosophers, ap-
pears most frequently when, with full consciousness, he stands
in the presence of a violent and certain death, thus in the case [456]
of executions. But, in order to bring this process much more
distinctly before our eyes, I regard it as by no means unbecoming
to the dignity of philosophy to quote what has been said by some
criminals before their execution, even at the risk of incurring
the sneer that I encourage gallows' sermons. I certainly rather believe that the gallows is a place of quite peculiar revelations, and a watch-tower from which the man who even then retains
his presence of mind obtains a wider, clearer outlook into eter-
nity than most philosophers over the paragraphs of their rational
psychology and theology. The following speech on the gallows
was made on the 15th April, 1837, at Gloucester, by a man called
Bartlett, who had murdered his mother-in-law: “Englishmen and
fellow countrymen,—I have a few words to say to you, and they
shall be but very few. Yet let me entreat you, one and all, that
these few words that I shall utter may strike deep into your hearts.
Bear them in your mind, not only now while you are witnessing
this sad scene, but take them to your homes, take them, and
repeat them to your children and friends. I implore you as a
dying man—one for whom the instrument of death is even now
prepared—and these words are that you may loose yourselves
from the love of this dying world and its vain pleasures. Think
less of it and more of your God. Do this: repent, repent, for be
assured that without deep and true repentance, without turning
to your heavenly Father, you will never attain, nor can hold the
slightest hope of ever reaching those bowers of bliss to which I
trust I am now fast advancing” (Times, 18th April 1837).
Still more remarkable are the last words of the well-known
murderer, Greenacre, who was executed in London on the 1st of
May 1837. The English newspaper the Post gives the follow-
ing account, which is also reprinted in Galignani's Messenger
of the 6th of May 1837: “On the morning of his execution a
gentleman advised him to put his trust in God, and pray for
forgiveness through the mediation of Jesus Christ. Greenacre[457]
replied that forgiveness through the mediation of Christ was a
matter of opinion; for his part, he believed that in the sight of
the highest Being, a Mohammedan was as good as a Christian
and had just as much claim to salvation. Since his imprisonment
he had had his attention directed to theological subjects, and he
had become convinced that the gallows is a passport to heaven.”

The indifference displayed here towards positive religions is just
what gives this utterance greater weight, for it shows that it
is no fanatical delusion, but individual immediate knowledge
that lies at its foundation. The following incident may also
be mentioned which is given by Galignani's Messenger of the
15th August 1837, from the Limerick Chronicle: “Last Monday
Maria Cooney was executed for the revolting murder of Mrs.
Anderson. So deeply was this wretched woman impressed with
the greatness of her crime that she kissed the rope which was put
round her neck, while she humbly implored the mercy of God.”
Lastly this: the Times, of the 29th April 1845 gives several letters
which Hocker, who was condemned for the murder of Delarue,
wrote the day before his execution. In one of these he says: “I am
persuaded that unless the natural heart be broken, and renewed
by divine mercy, however noble and amiable it may be deemed
by the world, it can never think of eternity without inwardly
shuddering.” These are the outlooks into eternity referred to
above which are obtained from that watch-tower; and I have
had the less hesitation in giving them here since Shakspeare also
says—

“Out of these convertites
There is much matter to be heard and learned.”
—As You Like it, last scene.

Strauss, in his “Life of Jesus,” has proved that Christianity
also ascribes to suffering as such the purifying and sanctifying
power here set forth (Leben Jesu, vol. i. ch. 6, §§ 72 and 74).
He says that the beatitudes in the Sermon on the Mount have a
different sense in Luke (vi. 21) from that which they have in [458]
Matt. (v. 3), for only the latter adds ƒÛ ¿Ωμ≈º±ƒπ to º±∫±¡πøπ
ø1 ¿ƒ…«øπ, and ƒ∑Ω ¥π∫±πø√≈Ω∑Ω to ¿μπΩ…Ωƒμ¬. Thus by him
alone are the simple-minded, the humble, &c., meant, while by
Luke are meant the literally poor; so that here the contrast is
446 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
that between present suffering and future happiness. With the
Ebionites it is a capital principle that whoever takes his portion in
this age gets nothing in the future, and conversely. Accordingly
in Luke the blessings are followed by as many ø≈±π, woes, which
are addressed to the rich, ø1 ¿ªø≈√πøπ, the full, ø1 μº¿μ¿ª∑√ºμΩøπ,
and to them that laugh, ø1 ≥μª…Ωƒμ¬, in the Ebionite spirit. In the
same spirit, he says, p. 604, is the parable (Luke xvi. 19) of the
rich man and Lazarus given, which nowhere mentions any fault
of the former or any merit of the latter, and takes as the standard
of the future recompense, not the good done or the wickedness
practised, but the evil suffered here and the good things enjoyed,
in the Ebionite spirit. “A like estimation of outward poverty,”
Strauss goes on, “is also attributed to Jesus by the other synoptists
(Matt. xix. 16; Mark x. 17; Luke xviii. 18), in the story of the
rich young man and the saying about the camel and the eye of a
needle.”
If we go to the bottom of the matter we will recognise that
even in the most famous passages of the Sermon on the Mount
there is contained an indirect injunction to voluntary poverty, and
thereby to the denial of the will to live. For the precept (Matt. v.
40 seq.) to consent unconditionally to all demands made upon
us, to give our cloak also to him who will take away our coat,
&c., similarly (Matt. vi. 25-34) the precept to cast aside all care
for the future, even for the morrow, and so to live simply in the
present, are rules of life the observance of which inevitably leads
to absolute poverty, and which therefore just say in an indirect
manner what Buddha directly commands his disciples and has
confirmed by his own example: throw everything away and
become bhikkhu, i.e., beggars. This appears still more decidedly[459]
in the passage Matt. x. 9-15, where all possessions, even shoes
and a staff, are forbidden to the Apostles, and they are directed to
beg. These commands afterwards became the foundation of the
mendicant order of St. Francis (Bonaventuræ vita S. Francisci,
c. 3). Hence, then, I say that the spirit of Christian ethics is
447
identical with that of Brahmanism and Buddhism. In conformity
with the whole view expounded here Meister Eckhard also says
(Works, vol. i. p. 492): “The swiftest animal that bears thee to
perfection is suffering.”
[460]
Chapter XLIX. The Way Of Salvation.
There is only one inborn error, and that is, that we exist in order
to be happy. It is inborn in us because it is one with our existence
itself, and our whole being is only a paraphrase of it, nay, our
body is its monogram. We are nothing more than will to live and
the successive satisfaction of all our volitions is what we think
in the conception of happiness.
As long as we persist in this inborn error, indeed even become
rigidly fixed in it through optimistic dogmas, the world appears
to us full of contradictions. For at every step, in great things as in
small, we must experience that the world and life are by no means
arranged with a view to containing a happy existence. While
now by this the thoughtless man only finds himself tormented
in reality, in the case of him who thinks there is added to his
real pain the theoretical perplexity why a world and a life which
exist in order that one may be happy in them answer their end so
badly. First of all it finds expression in pious ejaculations, such
as, “Ah! why are the tears on earth so many?” &c. &c. But
in their train come disquieting doubts about the assumptions of
those preconceived optimistic dogmas. One may try if one will
to throw the blame of one's individual unhappiness now upon the
circumstances, now upon other men, now upon one's own bad
luck, or even upon one's own awkwardness, and may know well
how all these have worked together to produce it; but this in no
way alters the result that one has missed the real end of life,[461]
which consists indeed in being happy. The consideration of this
is, then, often very depressing, especially if life is already on the
wane; hence the countenances of almost all elderly persons wear
the expression of that which in English is called disappointment.
Besides this, however, hitherto every day of our life has taught
us that joys and pleasures, even if attained, are in themselves
delusive, do not perform what they promise, do not satisfy the
heart, and finally their possession is at least embittered by the disagreeables that accompany them or spring from them; while,
on the contrary, the pains and sorrows prove themselves very
real, and often exceed all expectation. Thus certainly everything
in life is calculated to recall us from that original error, and to
convince us that the end of our existence is not to be happy.
Indeed, if we regard it more closely and without prejudice, life
rather presents itself as specially intended to be such that we shall
not feel ourselves happy in it, for through its whole nature it bears
the character of something for which we have no taste, which
must be endured by us, and from which we have to return as
from an error that our heart may be cured of the passionate desire
of enjoyment, nay, of life, and turned away from the world. In
this sense, it would be more correct to place the end of life in our
woe than in our welfare. For the considerations at the conclusion
of the preceding chapter have shown that the more one suffers
the sooner one attains to the true end of life, and that the more
happily one lives the longer this is delayed. The conclusion of the
last letter of Seneca corresponds with this: bonum tunc habebis
tuum, quum intelliges infelicissimos esse felices; which certainly
seems to show the influence of Christianity. The peculiar effect
of the tragic drama also ultimately depends upon the fact that
it shakes that inborn error by vividly presenting in a great and
striking example the vanity of human effort and the nothingness
of this whole existence, and thus discloses the profound signif- [462]
icance of life; hence it is recognised as the sublimest form of
poetry. Whoever now has returned by one or other path from
that error which dwells in us a priori, that ¿¡…ƒø≈ »μ≈¥ø¬ of
our existence, will soon see all in another light, and will now
find the world in harmony with his insight, although not with his
wishes. Misfortunes of every kind and magnitude, although they
pain him, will no longer surprise him, for he has come to see that
it is just pain and trouble that tend towards the true end of life,
the turning away of the will from it. 

This will give him indeed a
wonderful composedness in all that may happen, similar to that with which a sick person who undergoes a long and painful cure
bears the pain of it as a sign of its efficacy. In the whole of
human existence suffering expresses itself clearly enough as its
true destiny. Life is deeply sunk in suffering, and cannot escape
from it; our entrance into it takes place amid tears, its course is
at bottom always tragic, and its end still more so. There is an
unmistakable appearance of intention in this. As a rule man's
destiny passes through his mind in a striking manner, at the very
summit of his desires and efforts, and thus his life receives a
tragic tendency by virtue of which it is fitted to free him from
the passionate desire of which every individual existence is an
example, and bring him into such a condition that he parts with
life without retaining a single desire for it and its pleasures.
Suffering is, in fact, the purifying process through which alone,
in most cases, the man is sanctified, i.e., is led back from the
path of error of the will to live. In accordance with this, the
salutary nature of the cross and of suffering is so often explained
in Christian books of edification, and in general the cross, an
instrument of suffering, not of doing, is very suitably the symbol
of the Christian religion. Nay, even the Preacher, who is still
Jewish, but so very philosophical, rightly says: “Sorrow is better
than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is
made better” (Eccles. vii. 3). Under the name of the ¥μΩƒ¡ø¬[463]
¿ªø≈¬ I have presented suffering as to a certain extent a substitute
for virtue and holiness; but here I must make the bold assertion
that, taking everything into consideration, we have more to hope
for our salvation and deliverance from what we suffer than from
what we do. Precisely in this spirit Lamartine very beautifully
says in his “Hymne à la douleur,” apostrophising pain:—
“Tu me traites sans doute en favori des cieux,
Car tu n'épargnes pas les larmes à mes yeux.
Eh bien! je les reçois comme tu les envoies,
Tes maux seront mes biens, et tes soupirs mes joies.
Je sens qu'il est en toi, sans avoir combattu,
