Here is the great gap which occurs in these supplements, on
account of the circumstance that I have already dealt with moral
philosophy in the narrower sense in the two prize essays published
under the title, “Die Grundprobleme der Ethik,” an acquaintance
with which is assumed, as I have said, in order to avoid useless
repetition. Therefore there only remains for me here a small
gleaning of isolated reflections which could not be discussed in
that work, the contents of which were, in the main, prescribed
by the Academies; least of all those reflections which demand a
higher point of view than that which is common to all, and which
I was there obliged to adhere to. Accordingly it will not surprise
the reader to find these reflections here in a very fragmentary
collection. This collection again has been continued in the eighth
and ninth chapters of the second volume of the Parerga.

That moral investigations are incomparably more difficult
than physical, and in general than any others, results from the
fact that they are almost immediately concerned with the thing
in itself, namely, with that manifestation of it in which, directly
discovered by the light of knowledge, it reveals its nature as will.

Physical truths, on the other hand, remain entirely in the province
of the idea, i.e., of the phenomenon, and merely show how the
lowest manifestations of the will present themselves in the idea
in conformity to law. Further, the consideration of the world[403]
from the physical side, however far and successfully it may be
pursued, is in its results without any consolation for us: on the
moral side alone is consolation to be found; for here the depths
of our own inner nature disclose themselves to the consideration.
But my philosophy is the only one which confers upon ethics
its complete and whole rights; for only if the true nature of man
is his own will, and consequently he is, in the strictest sense, his
43 This chapter is connected with §§ 55, 62, 67 of the first volume.

own work, are his deeds really entirely his and to be ascribed to
him. On the other hand, whenever he has another origin, or is
the work of a being different from himself, all his guilt falls back
upon this origin, or originator. For operari sequitur esse.
To connect the force which produces the phenomenon of the
world, and consequently determines its nature, with the morality
of the disposition or character, and thus to establish a moral
order of the world as the foundation of the physical,—this has
been since Socrates the problem of philosophy. Theism solved it
in a childish manner, which could not satisfy mature humanity.
Therefore pantheism opposed itself to it whenever it ventured to
do so, and showed that nature bears in itself the power by virtue
of which it appears. With this, however, ethics had necessarily
to be given up. Spinoza, indeed, attempts here and there to
preserve it by means of sophistry, but for the most part gives it up
altogether, and, with a boldness which excites astonishment and
repugnance, explains the distinction between right and wrong,
and in general between good and evil, as merely conventional,
thus in itself empty (for example, Eth. iv., prop. 37, schol. 2).
After having met with unmerited neglect for more than a hundred
years, Spinoza has, in general, become too much esteemed in this
century through the reaction caused by the swing of the pendulum
of opinion. All pantheism must ultimately be overthrown by the
inevitable demands of ethics, and then by the evil and suffering
of the world. If the world is a theophany, then all that man, or
even the brute, does is equally divine and excellent; nothing [404]
can be censurable, and nothing more praiseworthy than the rest:
thus there is no ethics. Hence, in consequence of the revived
Spinozism of our own day, thus of pantheism, the treatment of
ethics has sunk so low and become so shallow that it has been
made a mere instruction as to the proper life of a citizen and a
member of a family, in which the ultimate end of human existence
is supposed to consist: thus in methodical, complete, smug, and
comfortable philistinism. Pantheism, indeed, has only led to such shallow vulgarisms through the fact that (by a shameful misuse of the e quovis ligno fit Mercurius) a common mind, Hegel, has, by
the well-known means, been falsely stamped as a great philosopher, and a herd of his disciples, at first suborned, afterwards
only stupid, received his weighty words. Such outrages on the
human mind do not remain unpunished: the seed has sprouted.

In the same spirit it was then asserted that ethics should have for
its material not the conduct of individuals, but that of nations,
that this alone was a theme worthy of it. Nothing can be more
perverse than this view, which rests on the most vulgar realism.
For in every individual appears the whole undivided will to live,
the thing in itself, and the microcosm is like the macrocosm.
The masses have no more content than each individual. Ethics is
concerned not with actions and their results, but with willing, and
willing itself takes place only in the individual. Not the fate of
nations, which exists only in the phenomenon, but that of the in-
dividual is decided morally. Nations are really mere abstractions;
individuals alone actually exist. Thus, then, is pantheism related
to ethics. But the evil and misery of the world are not in accord
even with theism; hence it sought assistance from all kinds of
evasions, theodicies, which yet were irretrievably overthrown
by the arguments of Hume and Voltaire. Pantheism, however,
is completely untenable in the presence of that bad side of the
world. Only when the world is regarded entirely from without[405]
and from the physical side alone, and nothing else is kept in view
but the constant restorative order, and the comparative imperish-
ableness of the whole which is thereby introduced, is it perhaps
possible to explain it as a god, yet always only symbolically. But
if one enters within, thus considers also the subjective and moral
side, with its preponderance of want, suffering, and misery, of
dissension, wickedness, madness, and perversity, then one soon
becomes conscious with horror that the last thing imaginable one
has before one is a theophany. I, however, have shown, and
especially in my work “Ueber den Willen in der Natur” have proved, that the force which works and acts in nature is identical
with the will in us. Thereby the moral order of the world is
brought into direct connection with the force which produces
the phenomenon of the world. For the phenomenon of the will
must exactly correspond to its nature. Upon this depends the
exposition of eternal justice given in §§ 63 and 64 of the first
volume, and the world, although subsisting by its own power,
receives throughout a moral tendency. Accordingly the problem
which has been discussed from the time of Socrates is now for
the first time really solved, and the demand of thinking reason
directed to morality is satisfied. Yet I have never professed to
propound a philosophy which leaves no questions unanswered.

In this sense philosophy is really impossible: it would be the
science of omniscience. But est quadam prodire tenus, si non
datur ultra: there is a limit to which reflection can penetrate and
can so far lighten the night of our existence, although the horizon
always remains dark. My doctrine reaches this limit in the will to
live, which in its own manifestation asserts or denies itself. To
wish, however, to go beyond this is, in my eyes, like wishing to
fly beyond the atmosphere. We must stop there; even although
new problems arise out of those which have been solved. Besides
this, however, we must refer to the fact that the validity of the [406]
principle of sufficient reason is limited to the phenomenon; this
was the theme of my first essay on that principle, which was
published as early as 1813.
I now go on to supplement particular points, and shall begin
by supporting, with two passages from classical poetry, my ex-
planation of weeping given in § 67 of the first volume, that it
springs from sympathy the object of which is one's own self.
At the end of the eighth book of the “Odyssey,” Ulysses, who
in all his many sorrows is never represented as weeping, bursts
into tears, when, still unknown, he hears his early heroic life
and deeds sung by the bard Demodocus in the palace of the
Phæacian king, for this remembrance of the brilliant period of
396 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
his life contrasts with his present wretchedness. Thus not this
itself directly, but the objective consideration of it, the picture
of his present summoned up by his past, calls forth his tears;
he feels sympathy with himself. Euripides makes the innocently
condemned Hypolytus, bemoaning his own fate, express the
same feeling:
“¶μ≈ μπ∏Ω ∑Ω μº±≈ƒøΩ ¿¡ø√≤ªμ¿μπΩ μΩ±ΩƒπøΩ
√ƒ±Ω∏Ω, a¬ μ¥±∫¡≈¬Ω, Aπ± ¿±√«øºμΩ ∫±∫±” (1084).
(Heu, si liceret mihi, me ipsum extrinsecus spectare, quanto-
pere deflerem mala, quæ patior.)
Finally, as a proof of my explanation, an anecdote may be
given here which I take from the English journal The Herald of
the 16th July 1836. A client, when he had heard his case set forth
by his counsel in court, burst into a flood of tears, and cried,
“I never knew I had suffered half so much till I heard it here
to-day.”

I have shown in § 55 of the first volume how, notwithstanding
the unalterable nature of the character, i.e., of the special fundamental will of a man, a real moral repentance is yet possible. I wish, however, to add the following explanation, which I must
preface by a few definitions. Inclination is every strong suscep-
tibility of the will for motives of a certain kind. Passion is an
inclination so strong that the motives which excite it exercise a[407]
power over the will, which is stronger than that of every possible
motive that can oppose them; thus its mastery over the will
becomes absolute, and consequently with reference to it the will
is passive or suffering. It must, however, be remarked here that
passions seldom reach the degree at which they fully answer to
the definition, but rather bear their name as mere approximations
to it: therefore there are then still counter-motives which are able
at least to restrict their effect, if only they appear distinctly in
consciousness. The emotion is just as irresistible, but yet only
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 397
a passing excitement of the will, by a motive which receives its
power, not from a deeply rooted inclination, but merely from
the fact that, appearing suddenly, it excludes for the moment
the counter-effect of all other motives, for it consists of an idea,
which completely obscures all others by its excessive vividness,
or, as it were, conceals them entirely by its too close proximity,
so that they cannot enter consciousness and act on the will,
whereby, therefore, the capacity for reflection, and with it intel-
lectual freedom, is to a certain extent abolished. Accordingly the
emotion is related to the passion as delirium to madness.
Moral repentance is now conditioned by the fact that before
the act the inclination to it did not leave the intellect free scope,
because it did not allow it to contemplate clearly and fully the
counter-motives, but rather turned it ever anew to the motives
in its own favour. But now, after the act has been performed,
these motives are, by this itself, neutralised, and consequently
have become ineffective. Now reality brings before the intellect
the counter-motives as the consequences of the act which have
already appeared; and the intellect now knows that they would
have been the stronger if it had only adequately contemplated and
weighed them. Thus the man becomes conscious that he has done
what was really not in accordance with his will. This knowledge
is repentance, for he has not acted with full intellectual freedom;
for all the motives did not attain to efficiency. What excluded [408]
the motives opposed to the action was in the case of the hasty
action the emotion, and in the case of the deliberate action the
passion. It has also often depended upon the circumstance that
his reason certainly presented to him the counter-motives in the
abstract, but was not supported by a sufficiently strong imagina-
tion to present to him their whole content and true significance
in images. Examples of what has been said are the cases in
which revenge, jealousy, or avarice have led to murder. 

After it
is committed they are extinguished, and now justice, sympathy,
the remembrance of former friendship, raise their voices and say all that they would have said before if they had been allowed
to speak. Then enters the bitter repentance, which says, “If it
were not done it would never happen.” An incomparable rep-
resentation of this is afforded by the old Scottish ballad, which
has also been translated by Herder, “Edward, Edward.” In an
analogous manner, the neglect of one's own good may occasion
an egotistical repentance. For example, when an otherwise unad-
visable marriage is concluded in consequence of passionate love,
which now is extinguished just by the marriage, and for the first
time the counter-motives of personal interest, lost independence,
&c., &c., come into consciousness, and speak as they would
have spoken before if they had been allowed utterance. All such
actions accordingly spring from a relative weakness of intellect,
because it lets itself be mastered by the will, just where its func-
tion as the presenter of motives ought to have been inexorably
fulfilled, without allowing itself to be disturbed by the will. The
vehemence of the will is here only indirectly the cause, in that
it interferes with the intellect, and thereby prepares for itself
repentance. The reasonableness of the character √…∆¡ø√≈Ω∑,
which is opposed to passionateness, really consists in this, that
the will never overpowers the intellect to such an extent as to
prevent it from correctly exercising its function of the distinct,
full, and clear exposition of the motives in the abstract for the[409]
reason, in the concrete for the imagination. Now this may just
as well depend upon the moderation and mildness of the will
as upon the strength of the intellect. All that is required is that
the latter should be relatively strong enough for the will that is
present, thus that the two should stand in a suitable relation to
each other.

The following explanations have still to be added to the fun-
damental characteristics of the philosophy of law expounded in
§ 62 of the first volume, and also in my prize essay on the
foundation of morals, § 17.

Those who, with Spinoza, deny that there is a right apart from the State, confound the means for enforcing the right with the
right itself. Certainly the right is insured protection only in the
State. But it itself exists independently of the State. For by force
it can only be suppressed, never abolished. Accordingly the State
is nothing more than an institution for protection, which has
become necessary through the manifold attacks to which man is
exposed, and which he would not be able to ward off alone, but
only in union with others. So, then, the aims of the State are—
(1.) First of all, outward protection, which may just as well
become needful against lifeless forces of nature or wild beasts
as against men, consequently against other nations; although this
case is the most frequent and important, for the worst enemy
of man is man: homo homini lupus. Since, in consequence of
this aim, nations always set up the principle, in words if not
with deeds, that they wish to stand to each other in a purely
defensive, never in an aggressive relation, they recognise the law
of nations. This is at bottom nothing but natural law, in the only
sphere of its practical activity that remains to it, between nation
and nation, where it alone must reign, because its stronger son,
positive law, cannot assert itself, since it requires a judge and an
executive. Accordingly the law of nations consists of a certain
degree of morality in the dealings of nations with each other, the
maintenance of which is a question of honour for mankind. The [410]
bar at which cases based on this law are tried is that of public opinion.

(2.) Protection within, thus protection of the members of a
State against each other, consequently security of private right,
by means of the maintenance of an honest state of things, which
consists in this, that the concentrated forces of all protect each
individual, from which arises an appearance as if all were honest,
i.e., just, thus as if no one wished to injure the others.
But, as is always the way in human affairs, the removal of one
evil generally opens the way for a new one; thus the granting
of that double protection introduces the need of a third, namely:

(3.) Protection against the protector, i.e., against him or those
to whom the society has transferred the management of the pro-
tection, thus the guarantee of public right. This appears most
completely attainable by dividing and separating from each other
the threefold unity of the protective power, thus the legislature,
the judicature, and the executive, so that each is managed by
others, and independently of the rest. The great value, indeed
the fundamental idea of the monarchy appears to me to lie in the
fact that because men remain men one must be placed so high,
and so much power, wealth, security, and absolute inviolability
given him that there remains nothing for him to desire, to hope,
and to fear for himself; whereby the egoism which dwells in
him, as in every one, is annihilated, as it were, by neutralisation,
and he is now able, as if he were no longer a man, to practise
justice, and to keep in view no longer his own but only the
public good. This is the source of the seemingly superhuman
nature that everywhere accompanies royalty, and distinguishes it
so infinitely from the mere presidency. Therefore it must also be
hereditary, not elective; partly in order that no one may see his
equal in the king; partly that the king himself may only be able to
provide for his successors by caring for the welfare of the State,
which is absolutely one with that of his family.[411]

If other ends besides that of protection, here explained, are
ascribed to the State, this may easily endanger the true end.
According to my explanation, the right of property arises only
through the expenditure of labour upon things. This truth, which
has already often been expressed, finds a noteworthy confirma-
tion in the fact that it is asserted, even in a practical regard,
in a declaration of the American ex-president, Quincey Adams,
which is to be found in the Quarterly Review of 1840, No. 130;
and also in French, in the “Bibliothèque universelle de Genêve,”
July 1840, No. 55. I will give it here in German (English of
Quarterly Review): “There are moralists who have questioned
the right of the Europeans to intrude upon the possessions of the aboriginals in any case, and under any limitations whatsoever; 
but have they maturely considered the whole subject? The Indian
right of possession itself stands, with regard to the greatest part
of the country, upon a questionable foundation. Their cultivated
fields, their constructed habitations, a space of ample sufficiency
for their subsistence, and whatever they had annexed of them-
selves by personal labour, was undoubtedly by the laws of nature
theirs. But what is the right of a huntsman to the forest of a
thousand miles over which he has accidentally ranged in quest
of prey?” &c. In the same way, those who in our own day
have seen occasion to combat communism with reasons (for
example, the Archbishop of Paris, in his pastoral of June 1851)
have always brought forward the argument that property is the
result of work, as it were only embodied work. This is further
evidence that the right of property can only be established by the
application of work to things, for only in this respect does it find
free recognition and make itself morally valid.

An entirely different kind of proof of the same truth is afforded
by the moral fact that while the law punishes poaching just as
severely as theft, and in many countries more severely, yet civil
honour, which is irrevocably lost by the latter, is really not [412]
affected by the former; but the poacher, if he has been guilty
of nothing else, is certainly tainted with a fault, but yet is not
regarded, like the thief, as dishonourable and shunned by all.
For the principles of civil honour rest upon moral and not upon
mere positive law; but game is not an object upon which labour
is bestowed, and thus also is not an object of a morally valid
possession: the right to it is therefore entirely a positive one, and
is not morally recognised.

According to my view, the principle ought to lie at the basis
of criminal law that it is not really the man but only the deed
which is punished, in order that it may not recur. The criminal is
merely the subject in whom the deed is punished, in order that
the law in consequence of which the punishment is inflicted may retain its deterrent power. This is the meaning of the expression, “He is forfeited to the law.” According to Kant's explanation,
which amounts to a jus talionis, it is not the deed but the man
that is punished. 

The penitentiary system also seeks not so much
to punish the deed as the man, in order to reform him. It thereby
sets aside the real aim of punishment, determent from the deed,
in order to attain the very problematic end of reformation. But it
is always a doubtful thing to attempt to attain two different ends
by one means: how much more so if the two are in any sense
opposite ends. Education is a benefit, punishment ought to be
an evil; the penitentiary prison is supposed to accomplish both
at once. Moreover, however large a share untutored ignorance,
combined with outward distress, may have in many crimes, yet
we dare not regard these as their principal cause, for innumer-
able persons living in the same ignorance and under absolutely
similar circumstances commit no crimes. Thus the substance of
the matter falls back upon the personal, moral character; but this,
as I have shown in my prize essay on the freedom of the will, is
absolutely unalterable. Therefore moral reformation is really not
possible, but only determent from the deed through fear. At the[413]
same time, the correction of knowledge and the awakening of
the desire to work can certainly be attained; it will appear what
effect this can produce. Besides this, it appears to me, from the
aim of punishment set forth in the text, that, when possible, the
apparent severity of the punishment should exceed the actual: but
solitary confinement achieves the reverse. Its great severity has
no witnesses, and is by no means anticipated by any one who has
not experienced it; thus it does not deter. It threatens him who is
tempted to crime by want and misery with the opposite pole of
human suffering, ennui: but, as Goethe rightly observes—
“When real affliction is our lot,
Then do we long for ennui.”

The contemplation of it will deter him just as little as the sight
of the palatial prisons which are built by honest men for rogues.
If, however, it is desired that these penitentiary prisons should
be regarded as educational institutions, then it is to be regretted
that the entrance to them is only obtained by crimes, instead of
which it ought to have preceded them.

That punishment, as Beccaria has taught, ought to bear a
proper proportion to the crime does not depend upon the fact that
it would be an expiation of it, but rather on the fact that the pledge
ought to be proportionate to the value of that for which it answers.
Therefore every one is justified in demanding the pledge of the
life of another as a guarantee for the security of his own life, but
not for the security of his property, for which the freedom, and so
forth, of another is sufficient pledge. For the security of the life of
the citizens capital punishment is therefore absolutely necessary.

Those who wish to abolish it should be answered, “First remove
murder from the world, and then capital punishment ought to
follow.” It ought also to be inflicted for the clear attempt to
murder just as for murder itself; for the law desires to punish the [414]
deed, not to revenge its consequences. In general the injury to
be guarded against affords the right measure for the punishment
which is to be threatened, but it does not give the moral baseness
of the forbidden action. Therefore the law may rightly impose
the punishment of imprisonment for allowing a flower-pot to fall
from a window, or impose hard labour for smoking in the woods
during the summer, and yet permit it in the winter. But to impose
the punishment of death, as in Poland, for shooting an ure-ox is
too much, for the maintenance of the species of ure-oxen may
not be purchased with human life. In determining the measure
of the punishment, along with the magnitude of the injury to be
guarded against, we have to consider the strength of the motives
which impel to the forbidden action. Quite a different standard
of punishment would be established if expiation, retribution, jus
talionis, were its true ground. But the criminal code ought to be
404 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
nothing but a register of counter-motives for possible criminal
actions: therefore each of these motives must decidedly outweigh
the motives which lead to these actions, and indeed so much the
more the greater the evil is which would arise from the action
to be guarded against, the stronger the temptation to it, and the
more difficult the conviction of the criminal;—always under the
correct assumption that the will is not free, but determinable by
motives;—apart from this it could not be got at at all. So much
for the philosophy of law.

In my prize essay on the freedom of the will (p. 50 seq.)
I have proved the originality and unalterableness of the inborn
character, from which the moral content of the course of life
proceeds. It is established as a fact. But in order to understand
problems in their full extent it is sometimes necessary to oppose
opposites sharply to each other. In this case, then, let one recall
how incredibly great is the inborn difference between man and
man, in a moral and in an intellectual regard. Here nobleness and
wisdom; there wickedness and stupidity. In one the goodness[415]
of the heart shines out of the eyes, or the stamp of genius is
enthroned in his countenance. The base physiognomy of another
is the impression of moral worthlessness and intellectual dulness,
imprinted by the hands of nature itself, unmistakable and inerad-
icable; he looks as if he must be ashamed of existence. But to
this outward appearance the inner being really corresponds. We
cannot possibly assume that such differences, which transform
the whole being of the man, and which nothing can abolish,
which, further, in conflict with his circumstances, determine his
course of life, could exist without guilt or merit on the part of
those affected by them, and be merely the work of chance. Even
from this it is evident that the man must be in a certain sense his
own work. But now, on the other hand, we can show the source
of these differences empirically in the nature of the parents; and
besides this, the meeting and connection of these parents has
clearly been the work of the most accidental circumstances. 

By such considerations, then, we are forcibly directed to the distinc-
tion between the phenomenon and the true being of things, which
alone can contain the solution of that problem. The thing in itself
only reveals itself by means of the forms of the phenomenon;
therefore what proceeds from the thing in itself must yet appear
in those forms, thus also in the bonds of causality. Accordingly it
will present itself to us here as a mysterious and incomprehensible
guidance of things, of which the external empirical connection
would be the mere tool. Yet all that happens appears in this
empirical connection introduced by causes, thus necessarily and
determined from without, while its true ground lies in the inner
nature of what thus manifests itself. Certainly we can here see
the solution of the problem only from afar, and when we reflect
upon it we fall into an abyss of thought—as Hamlet very truly
says, “thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls.” In my essay in
the first volume of the Parerga “On the Appearance of Intention [416]
in the Fate of Individuals” I have set forth my thoughts upon this
mysterious guidance of things, a guidance which indeed can only
be conceived symbolically.
In § 14 of my prize essay on the foundation of morals there
will be found an exposition of egoism, as regards its nature; and
the following attempt to discover its root may be looked upon
as supplementary to that paragraph. Nature itself contradicts
itself directly, according as it speaks from the individual or the
universal, from within or from without, from the centre or the
periphery. It has its centre in every individual; for each individual
is the whole will to live. Therefore, even if this individual is only
an insect or a worm, nature itself speaks out of it thus: “I alone am
all in all: in my maintenance everything is involved; the rest may
perish, it is really nothing.” So speaks nature from the particular
standpoint, thus from the point of view of self-consciousness,
and upon this depends the egoism of every living thing. 

On the
other hand, from the universal point of view,—which is that of
the consciousness of other things, that of objective knowledge, which for the moment looks away from the individual with
whom the knowledge is connected,—from without then, from
the periphery nature speaks thus: “The individual is nothing, and
less than nothing. I destroy millions of individuals every day, for
sport and pastime: I abandon their fate to the most capricious and
wilful of my children, chance, who harasses them at pleasure.
I produce millions of new individuals every day, without any
diminution of my productive power; just as little as the power of a
mirror is exhausted by the number of reflections of the sun, which
it casts on the wall one after another. The individual is nothing.”
Only he who knows how to really reconcile and eliminate this
patent contradiction of nature has a true answer to the question
as to the perishableness and imperishableness of his own self. I
believe I have given, in the first four chapters of this fourth book[417]
of the supplements, an adequate introduction to such knowledge.
What is said above may further be illustrated in the following
manner. Every individual, when he looks within, recognises
in his nature, which is his will, the thing in itself, therefore
that which everywhere alone is real. Accordingly he conceives
himself as the kernel and centre of the world, and regards himself
as of infinite importance. If, on the other hand, he looks without,
then he is in the province of the idea the mere phenomenon,
where he sees himself as an individual among an infinite number
of other individuals, accordingly as something very insignificant,
nay, vanishing altogether. Consequently every individual, even
the most insignificant, every I, when regarded from within, is all
in all; regarded from without, on the other hand, he is nothing,
or at least as good as nothing. Hence upon this depends the great
difference between what each one necessarily is in his own eyes
and what he is in the eyes of others, consequently the egoism
with which every one reproaches every one else.
In consequence of this egoism our fundamental error of all is
this, that with reference to each other we are reciprocally not I.

On the other hand, to be just, noble, and benevolent is nothing else than to translate my metaphysics into actions. To say that
time and space are mere forms of our knowledge, not conditions
of things in themselves, is the same as to say that the doctrine of
metempsychosis, “Thou shalt one day be born as him whom thou
now injurest, and in thy turn shalt suffer like injury,” is identical
with the formula of the Brahmans, which has frequently been
mentioned, Tat twam asi, “This thou art.” All true virtue proceeds
from the immediate and intuitive knowledge of the metaphysical
identity of all beings, which I have frequently shown, especially
in § 22 of my prize essay on the foundation of morals. But just
on this account it is not the result of a special pre-eminence of
intellect; on the contrary, even the weakest intellect is sufficient
to see through the principium individuationis, which is what is [418]
required in this matter. Accordingly we may find the most ex-
cellent character even in the case of a very weak understanding.
And further, the excitement of our sympathy is accompanied by
no exertion of our intellect. It rather appears that the requisite
penetration of the principium individuationis would be present
in every one if it were not that the will opposes this, and by
virtue of its immediate mysterious and despotic influence upon
the intellect generally prevents it from arising; so that ultimately
all guilt falls back upon the will, as indeed is in conformity with
the fact.

The doctrine of metempsychosis, touched on above, deviates
from the truth merely through the circumstance that it transfers
to the future what already is now. It makes my true inner nature
exist in others only after my death, while, according to the truth,
it already lives in them now, and death merely removes the
illusion on account of which I am not aware of this; just as an
innumerable host of stars constantly shine above our heads, but
only become visible to us when the one sun near the earth has set.

From this point of view my individual existence, however much,
like that sun, it may outshine everything, appears ultimately only
as a hindrance which stands between me and the knowledge of the true extent of my being. And because every individual, in his
knowledge, is subject to this hindrance, it is just individuation
that keeps the will to live in error as to its own nature; it is the
Mâyâ of Brahmanism. Death is a refutation of this error, and
abolishes it. I believe that at the moment of death we become
conscious that it is a mere illusion that has limited our existence
to our person. Indeed empirical traces of this may be found in
several states which are related to death by the abolition of the
concentration of consciousness in the brain, among which the
magnetic sleep is the most prominent; for in it, if it reaches a high
degree, our existence shows itself through various symptoms,
beyond our persons and in other beings, most strikingly by direct[419]
participation in the thoughts of another individual, and ultimately
even by the power of knowing the absent, the distant, and even
the future, thus by a kind of omnipresence.

Upon this metaphysical identity of the will, as the thing in
itself, in the infinite multiplicity of its phenomena, three principal
phenomena depend, which may be included under the common
name of sympathies: (1) sympathy proper, which, as I have
shown, is the basis of justice and benevolence, caritas; (2) sexual
love, with capricious selection, amor, which is the life of the
species, that asserts its precedence over that of the individual; (3)
magic, to which animal magnetism and sympathetic cures also
belong. Accordingly sympathy may be defined as the empirical
appearance of the metaphysical identity of the will, through the
physical multiplicity of its phenomena, whereby a connection
shows itself which is entirely different from that brought about
by means of the forms of the phenomenon which we comprehend
under the principle of sufficient reason.
