“Ye wise men, highly, deeply learned,
Who think it out and know,
How, when, and where do all things pair?
Why do they kiss and love?
Ye men of lofty wisdom, say
What happened to me then;
Search out and tell me where, how, when,
And why it happened thus.”
—BÜRGER.

This chapter is the last of four whose various reciprocal relations,
by virtue of which, to a certain extent, they constitute a subordi-
nate whole, the attentive reader will recognise without it being
needful for me to interrupt my exposition by recalling them or
referring to them.

We are accustomed to see poets principally occupied with
describing the love of the sexes. This is as a rule the chief theme
of all dramatic works, tragical as well as comical, romantic as
well as classical, Indian as well as European. Not less is it the
material of by far the largest part of lyrical and also of epic
poetry, especially if we class with the latter the enormous piles
of romances which for centuries every year has produced in all
the civilised countries of Europe as regularly as the fruits of the
earth. As regards their main contents, all these works are nothing
else than many-sided brief or lengthy descriptions of the passion
we are speaking of. Moreover, the most successful pictures
of it—such, for example, as Romeo and Juliet, La Nouvelle
Hélöise, and Werther—have gained immortal fame. Yet, when Rochefoucauld imagines that it is the same with passionate love
as with ghosts, of which every one speaks, but which no one has seen; and Lichtenberg also in his essay, “Ueber die Macht
der Liebe,” disputes and denies the reality and naturalness of
that passion, they are greatly in error. For it is impossible that
something which is foreign and contrary to human nature, thus a
mere imaginary caricature, could be unweariedly represented by
poetic genius in all ages, and received by mankind with unaltered
interest; for nothing that is artistically beautiful can be without
truth:—

“Rien n'est beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable.”
—BOIL.

Certainly, however, it is also confirmed by experience, al-
though not by the experience of every day, that that which as
a rule only appears as a strong yet still controllable inclination
may rise under certain circumstances to a passion which exceeds
all others in vehemence, and which then sets aside all consid-
erations, overcomes all obstacles with incredible strength and
perseverance, so that for its satisfaction life is risked without
hesitation, nay, if that satisfaction is still withheld, is given as the
price of it. Werthers and Jacopo Ortis exist not only in romance,
but every year can show at least half a dozen of them in Europe:
Sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi; for their sorrows find no other
chroniclers than the writers of official registers or the reporters
of the newspapers. Yet the readers of the police news in English
and French journals will attest the correctness of my assertion.
Still greater, however, is the number of those whom the same
passion brings to the madhouse. Finally, every year can show
cases of the double suicide of a pair of lovers who are opposed by
outward circumstances. In such cases, however, it is inexplicable
to me how those who, certain of mutual love, expect to find
the supremest bliss in the enjoyment of this, do not withdraw
themselves from all connections by taking the extremest steps,[338]
and endure all hardships, rather than give up with life a pleasure
which is greater than any other they can conceive. 

As regards the lower grades of that passion, and the mere approaches to it,
every one has them daily before his eyes, and, as long as he is
not old, for the most part also in his heart.

So then, after what has here been called to mind, no one
can doubt either the reality or the importance of the matter; and
therefore, instead of wondering that a philosophy should also
for once make its own this constant theme of all poets, one
ought rather to be surprised that a thing which plays throughout
so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been
disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw
material. The one who has most concerned himself with it is
Plato, especially in the “Symposium” and the “Phædrus.” Yet
what he says on the subject is confined to the sphere of myths,
fables, and jokes, and also for the most part concerns only the
Greek love of youths. The little that Rousseau says upon our
theme in the “Discours sur l'inégalité” (p. 96, ed. Bip.) is false
and insufficient. Kant's explanation of the subject in the third part
of the essay, “Ueber das Gefühl des Schönen und Erhabenen”
(p. 435 seq. of Rosenkranz's edition), is very superficial and
without practical knowledge, therefore it is also partly incorrect.
Lastly, Platner's treatment of the matter in his “Anthropology”
(§ 1347 seq.) every one will find dull and shallow. On the other
hand, Spinoza's definition, on account of its excessive naïveté,
deserves to be quoted for the sake of amusement: “Amor est
titillatio, concomitante idea causæ externæ” (Eth. iv., prop. 44,
dem.) Accordingly I have no predecessors either to make use of
or to refute. The subject has pressed itself upon me objectively,
and has entered of its own accord into the connection of my
consideration of the world. Moreover, least of all can I hope for
approbation from those who are themselves under the power of [339]
this passion, and who accordingly seek to express the excess of
their feelings in the sublimest and most ethereal images. To them
my view will appear too physical, too material, however meta-
physical and even transcendent it may be at bottom. Meanwhile
330 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
let them reflect that if the object which to-day inspires them to
write madrigals and sonnets had been born eighteen years earlier
it would scarcely have won a glance from them.
For all love, however ethereally it may bear itself, is rooted in
the sexual impulse alone, nay, it absolutely is only a more def-
initely determined, specialised, and indeed in the strictest sense
individualised sexual impulse. If now, keeping this in view, one
considers the important part which the sexual impulse in all its
degrees and nuances plays not only on the stage and in novels,
but also in the real world, where, next to the love of life, it shows
itself the strongest and most powerful of motives, constantly lays
claim to half the powers and thoughts of the younger portion of
mankind, is the ultimate goal of almost all human effort, exerts
an adverse influence on the most important events, interrupts the
most serious occupations every hour, sometimes embarrasses for
a while even the greatest minds, does not hesitate to intrude with
its trash interfering with the negotiations of statesmen and the in-
vestigations of men of learning, knows how to slip its love letters
and locks of hair even into ministerial portfolios and philosoph-
ical manuscripts, and no less devises daily the most entangled
and the worst actions, destroys the most valuable relationships,
breaks the firmest bonds, demands the sacrifice sometimes of
life or health, sometimes of wealth, rank, and happiness, nay,
robs those who are otherwise honest of all conscience, makes
those who have hitherto been faithful, traitors; accordingly, on
the whole, appears as a malevolent demon that strives to pervert,
confuse, and overthrow everything;—then one will be forced
to cry, Wherefore all this noise? Wherefore the straining and
storming, the anxiety and want? It is merely a question of[340]
every Hans finding his Grethe.37 Why should such a trifle play
so important a part, and constantly introduce disturbance and
confusion into the well-regulated life of man? But to the earnest
37 I have not ventured to express myself distinctly here: the courteous reader
must therefore translate the phrase into Aristophanic language.
331
investigator the spirit of truth gradually reveals the answer. It is
no trifle that is in question here; on the contrary, the importance
of the matter is quite proportionate to the seriousness and ardour
of the effort. The ultimate end of all love affairs, whether they
are played in sock or cothurnus, is really more important than
all other ends of human life, and is therefore quite worthy of
the profound seriousness with which every one pursues it. That
which is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the
next generation. The dramatis personæ who shall appear when
we are withdrawn are here determined, both as regards their
existence and their nature, by these frivolous love affairs. As the
being, the existentia, of these future persons is absolutely condi-
tioned by our sexual impulse generally, so their nature, essentia,
is determined by the individual selection in its satisfaction, i.e.,
by sexual love, and is in every respect irrevocably fixed by this.
This is the key of the problem: we shall arrive at a more accurate
knowledge of it in its application if we go through the degrees of
love, from the passing inclination to the vehement passion, when
we shall also recognise that the difference of these grades arises
from the degree of the individualisation of the choice.
The collective love affairs of the present generation taken
together are accordingly, of the whole human race, the serious
meditatio compositionis generationis futuræ, e qua iterum pen-
dent innumeræ generationes. This high importance of the matter,
in which it is not a question of individual weal or woe, as in all
other matters, but of the existence and special nature of the hu-
man race in future times, and therefore the will of the individual
appears at a higher power as the will of the species;—this it [341]
is on which the pathetic and sublime elements in affairs of love
depend, which for thousands of years poets have never wearied
of representing in innumerable examples; because no theme can
equal in interest this one, which stands to all others which only
concern the welfare of individuals as the solid body to the sur-
face, because it concerns the weal and woe of the species. Just on
332 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
this account, then, is it so difficult to impart interest to a drama
without the element of love, and, on the other hand, this theme is
never worn out even by daily use.
That which presents itself in the individual consciousness as
sexual impulse in general, without being directed towards a def-
inite individual of the other sex, is in itself, and apart from the
phenomenon, simply the will to live. But what appears in con-
sciousness as a sexual impulse directed to a definite individual
is in itself the will to live as a definitely determined individual.
Now in this case the sexual impulse, although in itself a subjec-
tive need, knows how to assume very skilfully the mask of an
objective admiration, and thus to deceive our consciousness; for
nature requires this stratagem to attain its ends. But yet that in
every case of falling in love, however objective and sublime this
admiration may appear, what alone is looked to is the production
of an individual of a definite nature is primarily confirmed by
the fact that the essential matter is not the reciprocation of love,
but possession, i.e., the physical enjoyment. The certainty of the
former can therefore by no means console us for the want of the
latter; on the contrary, in such a situation many a man has shot
himself. On the other hand, persons who are deeply in love, and
can obtain no return of it, are contented with possession, i.e., with
the physical enjoyment. This is proved by all forced marriages,
and also by the frequent purchase of the favour of a woman, in
spite of her dislike, by large presents or other sacrifices, nay,
even by cases of rape. That this particular child shall be begotten[342]
is, although unknown to the parties concerned, the true end of the
whole love story; the manner in which it is attained is a secondary
consideration. Now, however loudly persons of lofty and senti-
mental soul, and especially those who are in love, may cry out
here about the gross realism of my view, they are yet in error. For
is not the definite determination of the individualities of the next
generation a much higher and more worthy end than those exu-
berant feelings and super-sensible soap bubbles of theirs? Nay,
333
among earthly aims, can there be one which is greater or more
important? It alone corresponds to the profoundness with which
passionate love is felt, to the seriousness with which it appears,
and the importance which it attributes even to the trifling details
of its sphere and occasion. Only so far as this end is assumed as
the true one do the difficulties encountered, the infinite exertions
and annoyances made and endured for the attainment of the loved
object, appear proportionate to the matter. For it is the future
generation, in its whole individual determinateness, that presses
into existence by means of those efforts and toils. Nay, it is itself
already active in that careful, definite, and arbitrary choice for
the satisfaction of the sexual impulse which we call love. The
growing inclination of two lovers is really already the will to live
of the new individual which they can and desire to produce; nay,
even in the meeting of their longing glances its new life breaks
out, and announces itself as a future individuality harmoniously
and well composed. They feel the longing for an actual union
and fusing together into a single being, in order to live on only as
this; and this longing receives its fulfilment in the child which is
produced by them, as that in which the qualities transmitted by
them both, fused and united in one being, live on. Conversely,
the mutual, decided and persistent aversion between a man and
a maid is a sign that what they could produce would only be
a badly organised, in itself inharmonious and unhappy being. [343]
Hence there lies a deeper meaning in the fact that Calderon,
though he calls the atrocious Semiramis the daughter of the air,
yet introduces her as the daughter of rape followed by the murder
of the husband.
But, finally, what draws two individuals of different sex ex-
clusively to each other with such power is the will to live, which
exhibits itself in the whole species, and which here anticipates in
the individual which these two can produce an objectification of
its nature answering to its aims. This individual will have the will,
or character, from the father, the intellect from the mother, and
334 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the corporisation from both; yet, for the most part, the figure will
take more after the father, the size after the mother,—according
to the law which comes out in the breeding of hybrids among the
brutes, and principally depends upon the fact that the size of the
fœtus must conform to the size of the uterus. Just as inexplicable
as the quite special individuality of any man, which is exclusively
peculiar to him, is also the quite special and individual passion
of two lovers; indeed at bottom the two are one and the same:
the former is explicite what the latter was implicite. The moment
at which the parents begin to love each other—to fancy each
other, as the very happy English expression has it—is really to be
regarded as the first appearance of a new individual and the true
punctum saliens of its life, and, as has been said, in the meeting
and fixing of their longing glances there appears the first germ
of the new being, which certainly, like all germs, is generally
crushed out. This new individual is to a certain extent a new
(Platonic) Idea; and now, as all Ideas strive with the greatest ve-
hemence to enter the phenomenal world, eagerly seizing for this
end upon the matter which the law of causality divides among
them all, so also does this particular Idea of a human individual-
ity strive with the greatest eagerness and vehemence towards its
realisation in the phenomenon. This eagerness and vehemence[344]
is just the passion of the two future parents for each other. It has
innumerable degrees, the two extremes of which may at any rate
be described as ë∆¡ø¥πƒ∑ ¿±Ω¥∑ºø¬ and ø≈¡±Ωπ±; in its nature,
however, it is everywhere the same. On the other hand, it will
be in degree so much the more powerful the more individualised
it is; that is, the more the loved individual is exclusively suited,
by virtue of all his or her parts and qualities, to satisfy the
desire of the lover and the need established by his or her own
individuality. What is really in question here will become clear
in the further course of our exposition. Primarily and essentially
the inclination of love is directed to health, strength, and beauty,
consequently also to youth; because the will first of all seeks to
335
exhibit the specific character of the human species as the basis
of all individuality: ordinary amorousness (ë∆¡ø¥πƒ∑ ¿±Ω¥∑ºø¬)
does not go much further. To these, then, more special claims
link themselves on, which we shall investigate in detail further
on, and with which, when they see satisfaction before them, the
passion increases. But the highest degrees of this passion spring
from that suitableness of two individualities to each other on
account of which the will, i.e., the character, of the father and the
intellect of the mother, in their connection, make up precisely
that individual towards which the will to live in general which
exhibits itself in the whole species feels a longing proportionate
to this its magnitude, and which therefore exceeds the measure
of a mortal heart, and the motives of which, in the same way,
lie beyond the sphere of the individual intellect. This is thus
the soul of a true and great passion. Now the more perfect is
the mutual adaptation of two individuals to each other in each
of the many respects which have further to be considered, the
stronger will be their mutual passion. Since there do not exist
two individuals exactly alike, there must be for each particular
man a particular woman—always with reference to what is to be
produced—who corresponds most perfectly. A really passionate [345]
love is as rare as the accident of these two meeting. Since, how-
ever, the possibility of such a love is present in every one, the
representations of it in the works of the poets are comprehensible
to us. Just because the passion of love really turns about that
which is to be produced, and its qualities, and because its kernel
lies here, a friendship without any admixture of sexual love can
exist between two young and good-looking persons of different
sex, on account of the agreement of their disposition, character,
and mental tendencies; nay, as regards sexual love there may
even be a certain aversion between them. The reason of this is to
be sought in the fact that a child produced by them would have
physical or mental qualities which were inharmonious; in short,
its existence and nature would not answer the ends of the will to
336 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
live as it exhibits itself in the species. On the other hand, in the
case of difference of disposition, character, and mental tendency,
and the dislike, nay, enmity, proceeding from this, sexual love
may yet arise and exist; when it then blinds us to all that; and if
it here leads to marriage it will be a very unhappy one.
Let us now set about the more thorough investigation of the
matter. Egoism is so deeply rooted a quality of all individuals in
general, that in order to rouse the activity of an individual being
egoistical ends are the only ones upon which we can count with
certainty. Certainly the species has an earlier, closer, and greater
claim upon the individual than the perishable individuality itself.
Yet when the individual has to act, and even make sacrifices for
the continuance and quality of the species, the importance of the
matter cannot be made so comprehensible to his intellect, which
is calculated merely with regard to individual ends, as to have
its proportionate effect. Therefore in such a case nature can only
attain its ends by implanting a certain illusion in the individual,
on account of which that which is only a good for the species[346]
appears to him as a good for himself, so that when he serves
the species he imagines he is serving himself; in which process
a mere chimera, which vanishes immediately afterwards, floats
before him, and takes the place of a real thing as a motive. This
illusion is instinct. In the great majority of cases this is to be
regarded as the sense of the species, which presents what is of
benefit to it to the will. Since, however, the will has here become
individual, it must be so deluded that it apprehends through the
sense of the individual what the sense of the species presents to
it, thus imagines it is following individual ends while in truth it
is pursuing ends which are merely general (taking this word in
its strictest sense). The external phenomenon of instinct we can
best observe in the brutes where its rôle is most important; but it
is in ourselves alone that we arrive at a knowledge of its internal
process, as of everything internal. Now it is certainly supposed
that man has almost no instinct; at any rate only this, that the
337
new-born babe seeks for and seizes the breast of its mother. But,
in fact, we have a very definite, distinct, and complicated instinct,
that of the selection of another individual for the satisfaction of
the sexual impulse, a selection which is so fine, so serious, and
so arbitrary. With this satisfaction in itself, i.e., so far as it is a
sensual pleasure resting upon a pressing want of the individual,
the beauty or ugliness of the other individual has nothing to
do. Thus the regard for this which is yet pursued with such
ardour, together with the careful selection which springs from it,
is evidently connected, not with the chooser himself—although
he imagines it is so—but with the true end, that which is to be
produced, which is to receive the type of the species as purely
and correctly as possible. Through a thousand physical accidents
and moral aberrations there arise a great variety of deteriorations
of the human form; yet its true type, in all its parts, is always
again established: and this takes place under the guidance of the [347]
sense of beauty, which always directs the sexual impulse, and
without which this sinks to the level of a disgusting necessity.
Accordingly, in the first place, every one will decidedly prefer
and eagerly desire the most beautiful individuals, i.e., those in
whom the character of the species is most purely impressed; but,
secondly, each one will specially regard as beautiful in another
individual those perfections which he himself lacks, nay, even
those imperfections which are the opposite of his own. Hence,
for example, little men love big women, fair persons like dark,
&c. &c. The delusive ecstasy which seizes a man at the sight of
a woman whose beauty is suited to him, and pictures to him a
union with her as the highest good, is just the sense of the species,
which, recognising the distinctly expressed stamp of the same,
desires to perpetuate it with this individual. Upon this decided
inclination to beauty depends the maintenance of the type of the
species: hence it acts with such great power. We shall examine
specially further on the considerations which it follows. Thus
what guides man here is really an instinct which is directed to
338 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
doing the best for the species, while the man himself imagines
that he only seeks the heightening of his own pleasure. In fact,
we have in this an instructive lesson concerning the inner nature
of all instinct, which, as here, almost always sets the individual
in motion for the good of the species. For clearly the pains with
which an insect seeks out a particular flower, or fruit, or dung,
or flesh, or, as in the case of the ichneumonidæ, the larva of
another insect, in order to deposit its eggs there only, and to attain
this end shrinks neither from trouble nor danger, is thoroughly
analogous to the pains with which for his sexual satisfaction a
man carefully chooses a woman with definite qualities which
appeal to him individually, and strives so eagerly after her that in
order to attain this end he often sacrifices his own happiness in
life, contrary to all reason, by a foolish marriage, by love affairs
which cost him wealth, honour, and life, even by crimes such as
adultery or rape, all merely in order to serve the species in the[348]
most efficient way, although at the cost of the individual, in ac-
cordance with the will of nature which is everywhere sovereign.
Instinct, in fact, is always an act which seems to be in accordance
with the conception of an end, and yet is entirely without such
a conception. Nature implants it wherever the acting individual
is incapable of understanding the end, or would be unwilling to
pursue it. Therefore, as a rule, it is given only to the brutes, and
indeed especially to the lowest of them which have least under-
standing; but almost only in the case we are here considering it
is also given to man, who certainly could understand the end,
but would not pursue it with the necessary ardour, that is, even
at the expense of his individual welfare. Thus here, as in the
case of all instinct, the truth assumes the form of an illusion,
in order to act upon the will. It is a voluptuous illusion which
leads the man to believe he will find a greater pleasure in the
arms of a woman whose beauty appeals to him than in those
of any other; or which indeed, exclusively directed to a single
individual, firmly convinces him that the possession of her will
339
ensure him excessive happiness. Therefore he imagines he is
taking trouble and making sacrifices for his own pleasure, while
he does so merely for the maintenance of the regular type of
the species, or else a quite special individuality, which can only
come from these parents, is to attain to existence. The character
of instinct is here so perfectly present, thus an action which seems
to be in accordance with the conception of an end, and yet is
entirely without such a conception, that he who is drawn by that
illusion often abhors the end which alone guides it, procreation,
and would like to hinder it; thus it is in the case of almost all
illicit love affairs. In accordance with the character of the matter
which has been explained, every lover will experience a marvel-
lous disillusion after the pleasure he has at last attained, and will
wonder that what was so longingly desired accomplishes nothing [349]
more than every other sexual satisfaction; so that he does not see
himself much benefited by it. That wish was related to all his
other wishes as the species is related to the individual, thus as the
infinite to the finite. The satisfaction, on the other hand, is really
only for the benefit of the species, and thus does not come within
the consciousness of the individual, who, inspired by the will
of the species, here served an end with every kind of sacrifice,
which was not his own end at all. Hence, then, every lover,
after the ultimate consummation of the great work, finds himself
cheated; for the illusion has vanished by means of which the
individual was here the dupe of the species, Accordingly Plato
very happily says: “!¥øΩ∑ ¿±Ωƒ…Ω ±ª±∂øΩμ√ƒ±ƒøΩ” (voluptas
ommlum maxime vaniloqua), Phileb. 319.
But all this reflects light on the instincts and mechanical ten-
dencies of the brutes. They also are, without doubt, involved in a
kind of illusion, which deceives them with the prospect of their
own pleasure, while they work so laboriously and with so much
self-denial for the species, the bird builds its nest, the insect
seeks the only suitable place for its eggs, or even hunts for prey
which, unsuited for its own enjoyment, must be laid beside the
340 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
eggs as food for the future larvæ, the bees, the wasps, the ants
apply themselves to their skilful dwellings and highly complicat-
ed economy. They are all guided with certainty by an illusion,
which conceals the service of the species under the mask of an
egotistical end. This is probably the only way to comprehend
the inner or subjective process that lies at the foundation of the
manifestations of instinct. Outwardly, however, or objectively,
we find in those creatures which are to a large extent governed
by instinct, especially in insects, a preponderance of the ganglion
system, i.e., the subjective nervous system, over the objective
or cerebral system; from which we must conclude that they are
moved, not so much by objective, proper apprehension as by[350]
subjective ideas exciting desire, which arise from the influence of
the ganglion system upon the brain, and accordingly by a kind of
illusion; and this will be the physiological process in the case of
all instinct. For the sake of illustration I will mention as another
example of instinct in the human species, although a weak one,
the capricious appetite of women who are pregnant. It seems to
arise from the fact that the nourishment of the embryo sometimes
requires a special or definite modification of the blood which
flows to it, upon which the food which produces such a modifi-
cation at once presents itself to the pregnant woman as an object
of ardent longing, thus here also an illusion arises. Accordingly
woman has one instinct more than man; and the ganglion system
is also much more developed in the woman. That man has fewer
instincts than the brutes and that even these few can be easily
led astray, may be explained from the great preponderance of the
brain in his case. The sense of beauty which instinctively guides
the selection for the satisfaction of sexual passion is led astray
when it degenerates into the tendency to pederasty; analogous
to the fact that the blue-bottle (Musca vomitoria), instead of
depositing its eggs, according to instinct, in putrefying flesh, lays
them in the blossom of the Arum dracunculus, deceived by the
cadaverous smell of this plant.
341
Now that an instinct entirely directed to that which is to be
produced lies at the foundation of all sexual love will receive
complete confirmation from the fuller analysis of it, which we
cannot therefore avoid. First of all we have to remark here
that by nature man is inclined to inconstancy in love, woman
to constancy. The love of the man sinks perceptibly from the
moment it has obtained satisfaction; almost every other woman
charms him more than the one he already possesses; he longs for
variety. The love of the woman, on the other hand, increases just
from that moment. This is a consequence of the aim of nature [351]
which is directed to the maintenance, and therefore to the greatest
possible increase, of the species. The man can easily beget over
a hundred children a year; the woman, on the contrary, with
however many men, can yet only bring one child a year into the
world (leaving twin births out of account). Therefore the man
always looks about after other women; the woman, again, sticks
firmly to the one man; for nature moves her, instinctively and
without reflection, to retain the nourisher and protector of the
future offspring. Accordingly faithfulness in marriage is with the
man artificial, with the woman it is natural, and thus adultery on
the part of the woman is much less pardonable than on the part
of the man, both objectively on account of the consequences and
also subjectively on account of its unnaturalness.
But in order to be thorough and gain full conviction that the
pleasure in the other sex, however objective it may seem to us,
is yet merely disguised instinct, i.e., sense of the species, which
strives to maintain its type, we must investigate more fully the
considerations which guide us in this pleasure, and enter into
the details of this, rarely as these details which will have to
be mentioned here may have figured in a philosophical work
before. These considerations divide themselves into those which
directly concern the type of the species, i.e., beauty, those which
are concerned with physical qualities, and lastly, those which
are merely relative, which arise from the requisite correction or
342 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
neutralisation of the one-sided qualities and abnormities of the
two individuals by each other. We shall go through them one by
one.
The first consideration which guides our choice and incli-
nation is age. In general we accept the age from the years
when menstruation begins to those when it ceases, yet we give
the decided preference to the period from the eighteenth to the
twenty-eighth year. Outside of those years, on the other hand,
no woman can attract us: an old woman, i.e., one who no longer
menstruates, excites our aversion. Youth without beauty has[352]
still always attraction; beauty without youth has none. Clearly
the unconscious end which guides us here is the possibility of
reproduction in general: therefore every individual loses attrac-
tion for the opposite sex in proportion as he or she is removed
from the fittest period for begetting or conceiving. The second
consideration is that of health. Acute diseases only temporarily
disturb us, chronic diseases or cachexia repel us, because they are
transmitted to the child. The third consideration is the skeleton,
because it is the basis of the type of the species. Next to age
and disease nothing repels us so much as a deformed figure;
even the most beautiful face cannot atone for it; on the contrary,
even the ugliest face when accompanied by a straight figure is
unquestionably preferred. Further, we feel every disproportion
of the skeleton most strongly; for example, a stunted, dumpy,
short-boned figure, and many such; also a halting gait, where it
is not the result of an extraneous accident. On the other hand, a
strikingly beautiful figure can make up for all defects: it enchants
us. Here also comes in the great value which all attach to the
smallness of the feet: it depends upon the fact that they are an
essential characteristic of the species, for no animal has the tarsus
and the metatarsus taken together so small as man, which accords
with his upright walk; he is a plantigrade. Accordingly Jesus
Sirach also says (xxvi. 23, according to the revised translation
by Kraus): “A woman with a straight figure and beautiful feet
343
is like columns of gold in sockets of silver.” The teeth also
are important; because they are essential for nourishment and
quite specially hereditary. The fourth consideration is a certain
fulness of flesh; thus a predominance of the vegetative function,
of plasticity; because this promises abundant nourishment for
the fœtus; hence great leanness repels us in a striking degree. A
full female bosom exerts an exceptional charm upon the male
sex; because, standing in direct connection with the female [353]
functions of propagation, it promises abundant nourishment to
the new-born child. On the other hand, excessively fat women
excite our disgust: the cause is that this indicates atrophy of the
uterus, thus barrenness; which is not known by the head, but
by instinct. The last consideration of all is the beauty of the
face. Here also before everything else the bones are considered;
therefore we look principally for a beautiful nose, and a short
turned-up nose spoils everything. A slight inclination of the
nose downwards or upwards has decided the happiness in life of
innumerable maidens, and rightly so, for it concerns the type of
the species. A small mouth, by means of small maxillæ, is very
essential as specifically characteristic of the human countenance,
as distinguished from the muzzle of the brutes. A receding or,
as it were, cut-away chin is especially disagreeable, because
mentum prominulum is an exclusive characteristic of our species.
Finally comes the regard for beautiful eyes and forehead; it is
connected with the psychical qualities, especially the intellectual
which are inherited from the mother.
The unconscious considerations which, on the other hand,
the inclination of women follows naturally cannot be so exact-
ly assigned. In general the following may be asserted: They
give the preference to the age from thirty to thirty-five years,
especially over that of youths who yet really present the height
of human beauty. The reason is that they are not guided by
taste but by instinct, which recognises in the age named the
acme of reproductive power. In general they look less to beauty,
344 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
especially of the face. It is as if they took it upon themselves
alone to impart this to the child. They are principally won by the
strength of the man, and the courage which is connected with
this; for these promise the production of stronger children, and
also a brave protector for them. Every physical defect of the
man, every divergence from the type, may with regard to the
child be removed by the woman in reproduction, through the fact
that she herself is blameless in these respects, or even exceeds[354]
in the opposite direction. Only those qualities of the man have
to be excepted which are peculiar to his sex, and which therefore
the mother cannot give to the child: such are the manly structure
of the skeleton, broad shoulders, slender hips, straight bones,
muscular power, courage, beard, &c. Hence it arises that women
often love ugly men, but never an unmanly man, because they
cannot neutralise his defects.
The second class of the considerations which lie at the foun-
dation of sexual love are those which regard psychical qualities.
Here we shall find that the woman is throughout attracted by the
qualities of the heart or character in the man, as those which are
inherited from the father. The woman is won especially by firm-
ness of will, decision, and courage, and perhaps also by honesty
and good-heartedness. On the other hand, intellectual gifts exer-
cise no direct and instinctive power over her, just because they
are not inherited from the father. Want of understanding does a
man no harm with women; indeed extraordinary mental endow-
ment, or even genius, might sooner influence them unfavourably
as an abnormity. Hence one often sees an ugly, stupid, and coarse
fellow get the better of a cultured, able, and amiable man with
women. Also marriages from love are sometimes consummated
between natures which are mentally very different: for example,
the man is rough, powerful, and stupid; the woman tenderly
sensitive, delicately thoughtful, cultured, æsthetic, &c.; or the
man is a genius and learned, the woman a goose:
345
“Sic visum Veneri; cui placet impares
Formas atque animos sub juga aënea
Sævo mittere cum joco.”
The reason is, that here quite other considerations than the
intellectual predominate,—those of instinct. In marriage what is
looked to is not intellectual entertainment, but the production of
children: it is a bond of the heart, not of the head. It is a vain [355]
and absurd pretence when women assert that they have fallen
in love with the mind of a man, or else it is the over-straining
of a degenerate nature. Men, on the other hand, are not deter-
mined in their instinctive love by the qualities of character of the
woman; hence so many Socrateses have found their Xantippes;
for example, Shakspeare, Albrecht Dürer, Byron, &c. The in-
tellectual qualities, however, certainly influence here, because
they are inherited from the mother. Yet their influence is easily
outweighed by that of physical beauty, which acts directly, as
concerning a more essential point. However, it happens, either
from the feeling or the experience of that influence, that mothers
have their daughters taught the fine arts, languages, and so forth
in order to make them attractive to men, whereby they wish to
assist the intellect by artificial means, just as, in case of need,
they assist the hips and the bosom. Observe that here we are
speaking throughout only of that entirely immediate instinctive
attraction from which alone love properly so called grows. That
a woman of culture and understanding prizes understanding and
intellect in a man, that a man from rational reflection should test
and have regard to the character of his bride, has nothing to do
with the matter with which we are dealing here. Such things
lie at the bottom of a rational choice in marriage, but not of the
passionate love, which is our theme.
Hitherto I have only taken account of the absolute consider-
ations, i.e., those which hold good for every one: I come now
to the relative considerations, which are individual, because in
346 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
their case what is looked to is the rectification of the type of the
species, which is already defectively presented, the correction of
the divergences from it which the chooser's own person already
bears in itself, and thus the return to the pure presentation of
the type. Here, then, each one loves what he lacks. Starting
from the individual constitution, and directed to the individual
constitution, the choice which rests upon such relative con-[356]
siderations is much more definite, decided, and exclusive than
that which proceeds merely from the absolute considerations;
therefore the source of really passionate love will lie, as a rule,
in these relative considerations, and only that of the ordinary and
slighter inclination in the absolute considerations. Accordingly it
is not generally precisely correct and perfect beauties that kindle
great passions. For such a truly passionate inclination to arise
something is required which can only be expressed by a chemical
metaphor: two persons must neutralise each other, like acid and
alkali, to a neutral salt. The essential conditions demanded for this
are the following. First: all sex is one-sided. This one-sidedness
is more distinctly expressed in one individual than in another;
therefore in every individual it can be better supplemented and
neutralised by one than by another individual of the opposite sex,
for each one requires a one-sidedness which is the opposite of
his own to complete the type of humanity in the new individual
that is to be produced, the constitution of which is always the
goal towards which all tends. Physiologists know that manhood
and womanhood admit of innumerable degrees, through which
the former sinks to the repulsive gynander and hypospadæus,
and the latter rises to the graceful androgyne; from both sides
complete hermaphrodism can be reached, at which point stand
those individuals who, holding the exact mean between the two
sexes, can be attributed to neither, and consequently are unfit
to propagate the species. Accordingly, the neutralisation of two
individualities by each other, of which we are speaking, demands
that the definite degree of his manhood shall exactly correspond
347
to the definite degree of her womanhood; so that the one-sided-
ness of each exactly annuls that of the other. Accordingly, the
most manly man will seek the most womanly woman, and vice
versâ, and in the same way every individual will seek another
corresponding to him or her in degree of sex. Now how far the [357]
required relation exists between two individuals is instinctively
felt by them, and, together with the other relative considerations,
lies at the foundation of the higher degrees of love. While, there-
fore, the lovers speak pathetically of the harmony of their souls,
the heart of the matter is for the most part the agreement or suit-
ableness pointed out here with reference to the being which is to
be produced and its perfection, and which is also clearly of much
more importance than the harmony of their souls, which often,
not long after the marriage, resolves itself into a howling discord.
Now, here come in the further relative considerations, which
depend upon the fact that every one endeavours to neutralise by
means of the other his weaknesses, defects, and deviations from
the type, so that they will not perpetuate themselves, or even
develop into complete abnormities in the child which is to be
produced. The weaker a man is as regards muscular power the
more will he seek for strong women; and the woman on her side
will do the same. But since now a less degree of muscular power
is natural and regular in the woman, women as a rule will give
the preference to strong men. Further, the size is an important
consideration. Little men have a decided inclination for big
women, and vice versâ; and indeed in a little man the preference
for big women will be so much the more passionate if he himself
was begotten by a big father, and only remains little through the
influence of his mother; because he has inherited from his father
the vascular system and its energy, which was able to supply
a large body with blood. If, on the other hand, his father and
grandfather were both little, that inclination will make itself less
felt. At the foundation of the aversion of a big woman to big
men lies the intention of nature to avoid too big a race, if with
348 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the strength which this woman could impart to them they would
be too weak to live long. If, however, such a woman selects
a big husband, perhaps for the sake of being more presentable
in society, then, as a rule, her offspring will have to atone for[358]
her folly. Further, the consideration as to the complexion is
very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the
latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and
blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an
abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In
no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they
indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian
origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white
colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he
has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that
consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the
womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white
race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded
or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only
exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the
hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white.
The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four
centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the
Hindu to our own.38 Therefore in sexual love nature strives to
return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the
white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though
not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one
also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of
his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly
the more important the part is. Therefore snub-nosed individuals
have an inexpressible liking for hook-noses, parrot-faces; and it
is the same with regard to all other parts. Men with excessively
slim, long bodies and limbs can find beauty in a body which
38 The fuller discussion of this subject will be found in the “Parerga,” vol. ii.
§ 92 of the first edition (second edition, pp. 167-170).
349
is even beyond measure stumpy and short. The considerations
with regard to temperament act in an analogous manner. Each [359]
will prefer the temperament opposed to his own; yet only in
proportion as his one is decided. Whoever is himself in some
respect very perfect does not indeed seek and love imperfection
in this respect, but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others;
because he himself insures the children against great imperfec-
tion of this part. For example, whoever is himself very white will
not object to a yellow complexion; but whoever has the latter
will find dazzling whiteness divinely beautiful. The rare case in
which a man falls in love with a decidedly ugly woman occurs
when, besides the exact harmony of the degree of sex explained
above, the whole of her abnormities are precisely the opposite,
and thus the corrective, of his. The love is then wont to reach a
high degree.
The profound seriousness with which we consider and ponder
each bodily part of the woman, and she on her part does the same,
the critical scrupulosity with which we inspect a woman who
begins to please us, the capriciousness of our choice, the keen
attention with which the bridegroom observes his betrothed, his
carefulness not to be deceived in any part, and the great value
which he attaches to every excess or defect in the essential parts,
all this is quite in keeping with the importance of the end. For
the new being to be produced will have to bear through its whole
life a similar part. For example, if the woman is only a little
crooked, this may easily impart to her son a hump, and so in
all the rest. Consciousness of all this certainly does not exist.
On the contrary, every one imagines that he makes that careful
selection in the interest of his own pleasure (which at bottom
cannot be interested in it at all); but he makes it precisely as,
under the presupposition of his own corporisation, is most in
keeping with the interest of the species, to maintain the type
of which as pure as possible is the secret task. The individual
acts here, without knowing it, by order of something higher than
350 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
itself, the species; hence the importance which it attaches to[360]
things which may and indeed must be, indifferent to itself as
such. There is something quite peculiar in the profound uncon-
scious seriousness with which two young persons of opposite
sex who see each other for the first time regard each other, in the
searching and penetrating glance they cast at one another, in the
careful review which all the features and parts of their respective
persons have to endure. This investigating and examining is the
meditation of the genius of the species on the individual which is
possible through these two and the combination of its qualities.
According to the result of this meditation is the degree of their
pleasure in each other and their yearning for each other. This
yearning, even after it has attained a considerable degree, may
be suddenly extinguished again by the discovery of something
that had previously remained unobserved. In this way, then, the
genius of the species meditates concerning the coming race in all
who are capable of reproduction. The nature of this race is the
great work with which Cupid is occupied, unceasingly active,
speculating, and pondering. In comparison with the importance
of his great affair, which concerns the species and all coming
races, the affairs of individuals in their whole ephemeral totality
are very trifling; therefore he is always ready to sacrifice these
regardlessly. For he is related to them as an immortal to mortals,
and his interests to theirs as infinite to finite. Thus, in the
consciousness of managing affairs of a higher kind than all those
which only concern individual weal or woe, he carries them on
sublimely, undisturbed in the midst of the tumult of war, or in
the bustle of business life, or during the raging of a plague, and
pursues them even into the seclusion of the cloister.
We have seen in the above that the intensity of love increases
with its individualisation, because we have shown that the phys-
ical qualities of two individuals can be such that, for the purpose
of restoring as far as possible the type of the species, the one[361]
is quite specially and perfectly the completion or supplement of
351
the other, which therefore desires it exclusively. Already in this
case a considerable passion arises, which at once gains a nobler
and more sublime appearance from the fact that it is directed to
an individual object, and to it alone; thus, as it were, arises at the
special order of the species. For the opposite reason, the mere
sexual impulse is ignoble, because without individualisation it is
directed to all, and strives to maintain the species only as regards
quantity, with little respect to quality. But the individualising,
and with it the intensity of the love, can reach so high a degree
that without its satisfaction all the good things in the world, and
even life itself, lose their value. It is then a wish which attains a
vehemence that no other wish ever reaches, and therefore makes
one ready for any sacrifice, and in case its fulfilment remains
unalterably denied, may lead to madness or suicide. At the foun-
dation of such an excessive passion there must lie, besides the
considerations we have shown above, still others which we have
not thus before our eyes. We must therefore assume that here not
only the corporisation, but the will of the man and the intellect of
the woman are specially suitable to each other, in consequence
of which a perfectly definite individual can be produced by them
alone, whose existence the genius of the species has here in
view, for reasons which are inaccessible to us, since they lie in
the nature of the thing in itself. Or, to speak more exactly, the
will to live desires here to objectify itself in a perfectly definite
individual, which can only be produced by this father with this
mother. This metaphysical desire of the will in itself has primar-
ily no other sphere of action in the series of existences than the
hearts of the future parents, which accordingly are seized with
this ardent longing, and now imagine themselves to desire on
their own account what really for the present has only a purely
metaphysical end, i.e., an end which lies outside the series of
actually existing things. Thus it is the ardent longing to enter [362]
existence of the future individual which has first become possible
here, a longing which proceeds from the primary source of all
352 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
being, and exhibits itself in the phenomenal world as the lofty
passion of the future parents for each other, paying little regard
to all that is outside itself; in fact, as an unparalleled illusion, on
account of which such a lover would give up all the good things
of this world to enjoy the possession of this woman, who yet can
really give him nothing more than any other. That yet it is just
this possession that is kept in view here is seen from the fact that
even this lofty passion, like all others, is extinguished in its enjoy-
ment—to the great astonishment of those who are possessed by
it. It also becomes extinct when, through the woman turning out
barren (which, according to Hufeland, may arise from nineteen
accidental constitutional defects), the real metaphysical end is
frustrated; just as daily happens in millions of germs trampled
under foot, in which yet the same metaphysical life principle
strives for existence; for which there is no other consolation
than that an infinity of space, time, and matter, and consequently
inexhaustible opportunity for return, stands open to the will to
live.
The view which is here expounded must once have been
present to the mind of Theophrastus Paracelsus, even if only in
a fleeting form, though he has not handled this subject, and my
whole system of thought was foreign to him; for, in quite a differ-
ent context and in his desultory manner, he wrote the following
remarkable words: “Hi sunt, quos Deus copulavit, ut eam, quæ
fuit Uriæ et David; quamvis ex diametro (sic enim sibi humana
mens persuadebat) cum justo et legitimo matrimonio pugnaret
hoc.... sed propter Salomonem, QUI ALIUNDE NASCI NON POTUIT,
nisi ex Bathseba, conjuncto David semine, quamvis meretrice,
conjunxit eos Deus” (De vita longa, i. 5).
The longing of love, the 1ºμ¡ø¬, which the poets of all ages
are unceasingly occupied with expressing in innumerable forms,[363]
and do not exhaust the subject, nay, cannot do it justice, this
longing, which attaches the idea of endless happiness to the
possession of a particular woman, and unutterable pain to the
353
thought that this possession cannot be attained,—this longing
and this pain cannot obtain their material from the wants of an
ephemeral individual; but they are the sighs of the spirit of the
species, which sees here, to be won or lost, a means for the
attainment of its ends which cannot be replaced, and therefore
groans deeply. The species alone has infinite life, and therefore is
capable of infinite desires, infinite satisfaction, and infinite pain.
But these are here imprisoned in the narrow breast of a mortal.
No wonder, then, if such a breast seems like to burst, and can find
no expression for the intimations of infinite rapture or infinite
misery with which it is filled. This, then, affords the materials
for all erotic poetry of a sublime kind, which accordingly rises
into transcendent metaphors, soaring above all that is earthly.
This is the theme of Petrarch, the material for the St. Preuxs,
Werthers, and Jacopo Ortis, who apart from it could not be
understood nor explained. For that infinite esteem for the loved
one cannot rest upon some spiritual excellences, or in general
upon any objective, real qualities of hers; for one thing, because
she is often not sufficiently well known to the lover, as was the
case with Petrarch. The spirit of the species alone can see at one
glance what worth she has for it, for its ends. And great passions
also arise, as a rule, at the first glance:
“Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”
—SHAKSPEARE, “As You Like it,” iii. 5.
In this regard a passage in the romance of “Guzman de Al-
farache,” by Mateo Aleman, which has been famous for 250
years, is remarkable: “No es necessario, para que uno ame, que
pase distancia de tiempo, que siga discurso, ni haga eleccion,
sino que con aquella primera y sola vista, concurran juntamente
cierta correspondencia ó consonancia, ó lo que acá solemos [364]
vulgarmente decir, una confrontacion de sangre, a que por par-
ticular influxo suelen mover las estrellas.” (For one to love it
is not necessary that much time should pass, that he should set
354 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
about reflecting and make a choice; but only that at that first and
only glance a certain correspondence and consonance should be
encountered on both sides, or that which in common life we are
wont to call a sympathy of the blood, and to which a special
influence of the stars generally impels), P. ii. lib. iii. c. 5.
Accordingly the loss of the loved one, through a rival, or through
death, is also for the passionate lover a pain that surpasses all
others, just because it is of a transcendental kind, since it affects
him not merely as an individual, but attacks him in his essentia
æterna, in the life of the species into whose special will and
service he was here called. Hence jealousy is such torment and
so grim, and the surrender of the loved one is the greatest of
all sacrifices. A hero is ashamed of all lamentations except the
lamentation of love, because in this it is not he but the species
that laments. In Calderon's “Zenobia the Great” there is in the
first act a scene between Zenobia and Decius in which the latter
says:
“Cielos, luego tu me quieres? Perdiera cien mil victorias,
Volviérame,” &c.
(Heaven! then thou lovest me? For this I would lose a
thousand victories, would turn about, &c.)
Here, honour, which hitherto outweighed every interest, is
beaten out of the field as soon as sexual love, i.e., the interest
of the species, comes into play, and sees before it a decided
advantage; for this is infinitely superior to every interest of mere
individuals, however important it may be. Therefore to this alone
honour, duty, and fidelity yield after they have withstood every
other temptation, including the threat of death. In the same way
we find in private life that conscientiousness is in no point so
rare as in this: it is here sometimes set aside even by persons[365]
who are otherwise honest and just, and adultery is recklessly
committed when passionate love, i.e., the interest of the species,
has mastered them. It even seems as if in this they believed
355
themselves to be conscious of a higher right than the interests of
individuals can ever confer; just because they act in the interest
of the species. In this reference Chamfort's remark is worth
noticing: “Quand un homme et une femme ont l'un pour l'autre
une passion violente, il me semble toujours que quelque soient
les obstacles qui les séparent, un mari, des parens, etc., les deux
amans sont l'un a l'autre, de par la Nature, qu'ils s'appartiennent
de droit divin, malgré les lois et les conventions humaines.”
Whoever is inclined to be incensed at this should be referred
to the remarkable indulgence which the Saviour shows in the
Gospel to the woman taken in adultery, in that He also assumes
the same guilt in the case of all present. From this point of view
the greater part of the “Decameron” appears as mere mocking
and jeering of the genius of the species at the rights and interests
of individuals which it tramples under foot. Differences of rank
and all similar circumstances, when they oppose the union of
passionate lovers, are set aside with the same ease and treated
as nothing by the genius of the species, which, pursuing its ends
that concern innumerable generations, blows off as spray such
human laws and scruples. From the same deep-lying grounds,
when the ends of passionate love are concerned, every danger
is willingly encountered, and those who are otherwise timorous
here become courageous. In plays and novels also we see, with
ready sympathy, the young persons who are fighting the battle
of their love, i.e., the interest of the species, gain the victory
over their elders, who are thinking only of the welfare of the
individuals. For the efforts of the lovers appear to us as much
more important, sublime, and therefore right, than anything that
can be opposed to them, as the species is more important than
the individual. Accordingly the fundamental theme of almost
all comedies is the appearance of the genius of the species [366]
with its aims, which are opposed to the personal interest of the
individuals presented, and therefore threaten to undermine their
happiness. As a rule it attains its end, which, as in accordance
356 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
with poetical justice, satisfies the spectator, because he feels
that the aims of the species are much to be preferred to those
of the individual. Therefore at the conclusion he leaves the
victorious lovers quite confidently, because he shares with them
the illusion that they have founded their own happiness, while
they have rather sacrificed it to the choice of the species, against
the will and foresight of their elders. It has been attempted in
single, abnormal comedies to reverse the matter and bring about
the happiness of the individuals at the cost of the aims of the
species; but then the spectator feels the pain which the genius of
the species suffers, and is not consoled by the advantages which
are thereby assured to the individuals. As examples of this kind
two very well-known little pieces occur to me: “La reine de 16
ans,” and “Le marriage de raison.” In tragedies containing love
affairs, since the aims of the species are frustrated, the lovers who
were its tools, generally perish also; for example, in “Romeo and
Juliet,” “Tancred,” “Don Carlos,” “Wallenstein,” “The Bride of
Messina,” and many others.
The love of a man often affords comical, and sometimes also
tragical phenomena; both because, taken possession of by the
spirit of the species, he is now ruled by this, and no longer
belongs to himself: his conduct thereby becomes unsuited to
the individual. That which in the higher grades of love imparts
such a tinge of poetry and sublimeness to his thoughts, which
gives them even a transcendental and hyperphysical tendency,
on account of which he seems to lose sight altogether of his real,
very physical aim, is at bottom this, that he is now inspired by the
spirit of the species whose affairs are infinitely more important
than all those which concern mere individuals, in order to find
under the special directions of this spirit the whole existence[367]
of an indefinitely long posterity with this individual and exactly
determined nature, which it can receive only from him as father
and the woman he loves as mother, and which otherwise could
never, as such, attain to existence, while the objectification of
357
the will to live expressly demands this existence. It is the feel-
ing that he is acting in affairs of such transcendent importance
which raises the lover so high above everything earthly, nay,
even above himself, and gives such a hyperphysical clothing to
his very physical desires, that love becomes a poetical episode
even in the life of the most prosaic man; in which last case the
matter sometimes assumes a comical aspect. That mandate of
the will which objectifies itself in the species exhibits itself in
the consciousness of the lover under the mask of the anticipation
of an infinite blessedness which is to be found for him in the
union with this female individual. Now, in the highest grades of
love this chimera becomes so radiant that if it cannot be attained
life itself loses all charm, and now appears so joyless, hollow,
and insupportable that the disgust at it even overcomes the fear
of death, so that it is then sometimes voluntarily cut short. The
will of such a man has been caught in the vortex of the will of
the species, or this has obtained such a great predominance over
the individual will that if such a man cannot be effective in the
first capacity, he disdains to be so in the last. The individual
is here too weak a vessel to be capable of enduring the infinite
longing of the will of the species concentrated upon a definite
object. In this case, therefore, the issue is suicide, sometimes
the double suicide of the two lovers; unless, to save life, nature
allows madness to intervene, which then covers with its veil the
consciousness of that hopeless state. No year passes without
proving the reality of what has been expounded by several cases
of all these kinds.
Not only, however, has the unsatisfied passion of love some- [368]
times a tragic issue, but the satisfied passion also leads oftener
to unhappiness than to happiness. For its demands often conflict
so much with the personal welfare of him who is concerned that
they undermine it, because they are incompatible with his other
circumstances, and disturb the plan of life built upon them. Nay,
not only with external circumstances is love often in contradic-
358 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
tion, but even with the lover's own individuality, for it flings
itself upon persons who, apart from the sexual relation, would
be hateful, contemptible, and even abhorrent to the lover. But
so much more powerful is the will of the species than that of
the individual that the lover shuts his eyes to all those qualities
which are repellent to him, overlooks all, ignores all, and binds
himself for ever to the object of his passion—so entirely is he
blinded by that illusion, which vanishes as soon as the will of
the species is satisfied, and leaves behind a detested companion
for life. Only from this can it be explained that we often see
very reasonable and excellent men bound to termagants and
she-devils, and cannot conceive how they could have made such
a choice. On this account the ancients represented love as blind.
Indeed, a lover may even know distinctly and feel bitterly the
faults of temperament and character of his bride, which promise
him a miserable life, and yet not be frightened away:—
“I ask not, I care not,
If guilt's in thy heart,
I know that I love thee
Whatever thou art.”
For ultimately he seeks not his own things, but those of a third
person, who has yet to come into being, although he is involved
in the illusion that what he seeks is his own affair. But it is
just this not seeking of one's own things which is everywhere
the stamp of greatness, that gives to passionate love also a touch
of sublimity, and makes it a worthy subject of poetry. Finally,
sexual love is compatible even with the extremest hatred towards
its object: therefore Plato has compared it to the love of the wolf[369]
for the sheep. This case appears when a passionate lover, in spite
of all efforts and entreaties, cannot obtain a favourable hearing
on any condition:—
“I love and hate her.”
359
—SHAKSPEARE, Cymb., iii. 5.
The hatred of the loved one which then is kindled sometimes
goes so far that the lover murders her, and then himself. One
or two examples of this generally happen every year; they will
be found in the newspapers. Therefore Goethe's lines are quite
correct:—
“By all despised love! By hellish element!
Would that I knew a worse, that I might swear by!”
It is really no hyperbole if a lover describes the coldness of
his beloved and the delight of her vanity, which feeds on his
sufferings, as cruelty; for he is under the influence of an impulse
which, akin to the instinct of insects, compels him, in spite of
all grounds of reason, to pursue his end unconditionally, and
to undervalue everything else: he cannot give it up. Not one
but many a Petrarch has there been who was compelled to drag
through life the unsatisfied ardour of love, like a fetter, an iron
weight at his foot, and breathe his sighs in lonely woods; but only
in the one Petrarch dwelt also the gift of poetry; so that Goethe's
beautiful lines hold good of him:—
“And when in misery the man was dumb
A god gave me the power to tell my sorrow.”
360 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
In fact, the genius of the species wages war throughout with
the guardian geniuses of individuals, is their pursuer and enemy,
always ready relentlessly to destroy personal happiness in order
to carry out its ends; nay, the welfare of whole nations has
sometimes been sacrificed to its humours. An example of this is
given us by Shakspeare in “Henry VI.,” pt. iii., act 3, sc. 2 and 3.
All this depends upon the fact that the species, as that in which [370]
the root of our being lies, has a closer and earlier right to us
than the individual; hence its affairs take precedence. From the
feeling of this the ancients personified the genius of the species
in Cupid, a malevolent, cruel, and therefore ill-reputed god, in
spite of his childish appearance; a capricious, despotic demon,
but yet lord of gods and men:
“£≈ ¥Ω… ∏μ…Ω ƒ≈¡±ΩΩμ ∫Ω±Ω∏¡…¿…Ω, ï¡…¬!”
(Tu, deorum hominumque tyranne, Amor!)
A deadly shot, blindness, and wings are his attributes. The
latter signify inconstancy; and this appears, as a rule, only with
the disillusion which is the consequence of satisfaction.
Because the passion depended upon an illusion, which rep-
resented that which has only value for the species as valuable
for the individual, the deception must vanish after the attainment
of the end of the species. The spirit of the species which took
possession of the individual sets it free again. Forsaken by this
spirit, the individual falls back into its original limitation and
narrowness, and sees with wonder that after such a high, heroic,
and infinite effort nothing has resulted for its pleasure but what
every sexual gratification affords. Contrary to expectation, it
finds itself no happier than before. It observes that it has been the
dupe of the will of the species. Therefore, as a rule, a Theseus
who has been made happy will forsake his Ariadne. If Petrarch's
passion had been satisfied, his song would have been silenced
from that time forth, like that of the bird as soon as the eggs are
laid.
361
Here let me remark in passing that however much my meta-
physics of love will displease the very persons who are entangled
in this passion, yet if rational considerations in general could
avail anything against it, the fundamental truth disclosed by me
would necessarily fit one more than anything else to subdue it.
But the saying of the old comedian will, no doubt, remain true:
“Quæ res in se neque consilium, neque modum habet ullum, eam [371]
consilio regere non potes.”
Marriages from love are made in the interest of the species,
not of the individuals. Certainly the persons concerned imagine
they are advancing their own happiness; but their real end is one
which is foreign to themselves, for it lies in the production of an
individual which is only possible through them. Brought togeth-
er by this aim, they ought henceforth to try to get on together
as well as possible. But very often the pair brought together
by that instinctive illusion, which is the essence of passionate
love, will, in other respects, be of very different natures. This
comes to light when the illusion vanishes, as it necessarily must.
Accordingly love marriages, as a rule, turn out unhappy; for
through them the coming generation is cared for at the expense
of the present. “Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con
dolores” (Who marries from love must live in sorrow), says
the Spanish proverb. The opposite is the case with marriages
contracted for purposes of convenience, generally in accordance
with the choice of the parents. The considerations prevailing
here, of whatever kind they may be, are at least real, and cannot
vanish of themselves. Through them, however, the happiness of
the present generation is certainly cared for, to the disadvantage
of the coming generation, and notwithstanding this it remains
problematical. The man who in his marriage looks to money
more than to the satisfaction of his inclination lives more in the
individual than in the species; which is directly opposed to the
truth; hence it appears unnatural, and excites a certain contempt.
A girl who, against the advice of her parents, rejects the offer of a
362 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
rich and not yet old man, in order, setting aside all considerations
of convenience, to choose according to her instinctive inclination
alone, sacrifices her individual welfare to the species. But just on
this account one cannot withhold from her a certain approbation;
for she has preferred what is of most importance, and has acted[372]
in the spirit of nature (more exactly, of the species), while the
parents advised in the spirit of individual egoism. In accordance
with all this, it appears as if in making a marriage either the indi-
vidual or the interests of the species must come off a loser. And
this is generally the case; for that convenience and passionate
love should go hand in hand is the rarest of lucky accidents. The
physical, moral, or intellectual deficiency of the nature of most
men may to some extent have its ground in the fact that marriages
are ordinarily entered into not from pure choice and inclination,
but from all kinds of external considerations, and on account
of accidental circumstances. If, however, besides convenience,
inclination is also to a certain extent regarded, this is, as it were,
an agreement with the genius of the species. Happy marriages
are well known to be rare; just because it lies in the nature of
marriage that its chief end is not the present but the coming
generation. However, let me add, for the consolation of tender,
loving natures, that sometimes passionate sexual love associates
itself with a feeling of an entirely different origin—real friend-
ship based upon agreement of disposition, which yet for the most
part only appears when sexual love proper is extinguished in its
satisfaction. This friendship will then generally spring from the
fact that the supplementing and corresponding physical, moral,
and intellectual qualities of the two individuals, from which
sexual love arose, with reference to the child to be produced,
are, with reference also to the individuals themselves, related to
each other in a supplementary manner as opposite qualities of
temperament and mental gifts, and thereby form the basis of a
harmony of disposition.
The whole metaphysics of love here dealt with stands in close
363
connection with my metaphysics in general, and the light which
it throws upon this may be summed up as follows.
We have seen that the careful selection for the satisfaction of
the sexual impulse, a selection which rises through innumerable [373]
degrees up to that of passionate love, depends upon the highly
serious interest which man takes in the special personal consti-
tution of the next generation. Now this exceedingly remarkable
interest confirms two truths which have been set forth in the
preceding chapters. (1.) The indestructibility of the true nature of
man, which lives on in that coming generation. For that interest
which is so lively and eager, and does not spring from reflection
and intention, but from the inmost characteristics and tendencies
of our nature, could not be so indelibly present and exercise such
great power over man if he were absolutely perishable, and were
merely followed in time by a race actually and entirely different
from him. (2.) That his true nature lies more in the species than
in the individual. For that interest in the special nature of the
species, which is the root of all love, from the passing inclination
to the serious passion, is for every one really the highest concern,
the success or failure of which touches him most sensibly; there-
fore it is called par excellence the affair of the heart. Moreover,
when this interest has expressed itself strongly and decidedly,
everything which merely concerns one's own person is postponed
and necessarily sacrificed to it. Through this, then, man shows
that the species lies closer to him than the individual, and he
lives more immediately in the former than in the latter. Why
does the lover hang with complete abandonment on the eyes of
his chosen one, and is ready to make every sacrifice for her?
Because it is his immortal part that longs after her; while it is
only his mortal part that desires everything else. That vehement
or intense longing directed to a particular woman is accordingly
an immediate pledge of the indestructibility of the kernel of our
being, and of its continued existence in the species. But to regard
this continued existence as something trifling and insufficient is
364 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
an error which arises from the fact that under the conception of
the continued life of the species one thinks nothing more than the[374]
future existence of beings similar to us, but in no regard identical
with us; and this again because, starting from knowledge directed
towards without, one takes into consideration only the external
form of the species as we apprehend it in perception, and not
its inner nature. But it is just this inner nature which lies at the
foundation of our own consciousness as its kernel, and hence
indeed is more immediate than this itself, and, as thing in itself,
free from the principium individuationis, is really the same and
identical in all individuals, whether they exist together or after
each other. Now this is the will to live, thus just that which
desires life and continuance so vehemently. This accordingly
is spared and unaffected by death. It can attain to no better
state than its present one; and consequently for it, with life, the
constant suffering and striving of the individuals is certain. To
free it from this is reserved for the denial of the will to live, as
the means by which the individual will breaks away from the
stem of the species, and surrenders that existence in it. We lack
conceptions for that which it now is; indeed all data for such
conceptions are wanting. We can only describe it as that which
is free to be will to live or not. Buddhism denotes the latter case
by the word Nirvana, the etymology of which was given in the
note at the end of chapter 41. It is the point which remains for
ever unattainable to all human knowledge, just as such.
If now, from the standpoint of this last consideration, we
contemplate the turmoil of life, we behold all occupied with its
want and misery, straining all their powers to satisfy its infinite
needs and to ward off its multifarious sorrows, yet without daring
to hope anything else than simply the preservation of this tor-
mented existence for a short span of time. In between, however,
in the midst of the tumult, we see the glances of two lovers meet
longingly: yet why so secretly, fearfully, and stealthily? Because
these lovers are the traitors who seek to perpetuate the whole[375]
365
want and drudgery, which would otherwise speedily reach an
end; this they wish to frustrate, as others like them have frustrated
it before. This consideration already passes over into the subject
of the following chapter.39

principles, the wide prevalence of the practice of pederasty, among different
nations and in different ages. It is omitted.—Trs.]
