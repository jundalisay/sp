27 This chapter is connected with § 54 of the first volume.

Death is the true inspiring genius, or the muse of philosophy, wherefore Socrates has defined the latter as ∏±Ω±ƒø≈ ºμªμƒ∑. In- deed without death men would scarcely philosophise. Therefore it will be quite in order that a special consideration of this should have its place here at the beginning of the last, most serious, and most important of our books.

The brute lives without a proper knowledge of death; therefore
the individual brute enjoys directly the absolute imperishableness
of the species, for it is only conscious of itself as endless. In the
case of men the terrifying certainty of death necessarily entered
with reason. But as everywhere in nature with every evil a means
of cure, or at least some compensation, is given, the same reflec-
tion which introduces the knowledge of death also assists us to
metaphysical points of view, which comfort us concerning it, and
of which the brute has no need and is incapable. All religious and
philosophical systems are principally directed to this end, and
are thus primarily the antidote to the certainty of death, which the
reflective reason produces out of its own means. Yet the degree
in which they attain this end is very different, and certainly one
religion or philosophy will, far more than the others, enable men
to look death in the face with a quiet glance. Brahmanism and [250]
Buddhism, which teach man to regard himself as himself, the
original being, the Brahm, to which all coming into being and
passing away is essentially foreign, will achieve much more in
this respect than such as teach that man is made out of nothing,
and actually begins at birth his existence derived from another.

Answering to this we find in India a confidence and a contempt for death of which one has no conception in Europe. It is, in
fact, a hazardous thing to force upon a man, by early imprinting
them, weak and untenable conceptions in this important regard,
and thereby making him for ever incapable of taking up correct
and stable ones. For example, to teach him that he recently came
out of nothing, and consequently through an eternity has been
nothing, but yet for the future will be imperishable, is just the
same as to teach him that although he is through and through
the work of another, yet he will be held responsible through
all eternity for his actions. If, then, when the mind ripens and
reflection appears, the untenable nature of such doctrines forces
itself upon him, he has nothing better to put in its place, nay,
is no longer capable of understanding anything better, and thus
loses the comfort which nature had destined for him also, as a
compensation for the certainty of death. In consequence of such
a process, we see even now in England (1844), among ruined
factory hands, the Socialists, and in Germany, among ruined
students, the young Hegelians, sink to the absolutely physical
point of view, which leads to the result: edite, bibite, post mortem
nulla voluptas, and so far may be defined as bestialism.
However, after all that has been taught concerning death, it
cannot be denied that, at least in Europe, the opinion of men,
nay, often even of the same individual, very frequently vacillates
between the conception of death as absolute annihilation and the
assumption that we are, as it were, with skin and hair, immortal.
Both are equally false: but we have not so much to find a correct
mean as rather to gain the higher point of view from which such[251]
notions disappear of themselves.

In these considerations I shall first of all start from the purely
empirical standpoint. Here there primarily lies before us the
undeniable fact that, according to the natural consciousness, man
not only fears death for his own person more than anything else,
but also weeps violently over the death of those that belong to
him, and indeed clearly not egotistically, for his own loss, but out of sympathy for the great misfortune that has befallen them.

Therefore he also censures those who in such a case neither weep
nor show sadness as hard-hearted and unloving. It is parallel
with this that revenge, in its highest degree, seeks the death of
the adversary as the greatest evil that can be inflicted. Opinions
change with time and place; but the voice of nature remains
always and everywhere the same, and is therefore to be heeded
before everything else. Now here it seems distinctly to say that
death is a great evil. In the language of nature death means
annihilation. And that death is a serious matter may be concluded
from the fact that, as every one knows, life is no joke. We must
indeed deserve nothing better than these two.

In fact, the fear of death is independent of all knowledge; for
the brute has it, although it does not know death. Everything that
is born brings it with it into the world. But this fear of death is
a priori only the reverse side of the will to live, which indeed
we all are. Therefore in every brute the fear of its destruction
is inborn, like the care for its maintenance. Thus it is the fear
of death, and not the mere avoidance of pain, which shows
itself in the anxious carefulness with which the brute seeks to
protect itself, and still more its brood, from everything that might
become dangerous. Why does the brute flee, trembling, and seek
to conceal itself? Because it is simply the will to live, but, as
such, is forfeited to death, and wishes to gain time. Such also, by
nature, is man. The greatest evil, the worst that can anywhere [252]
threaten, is death; the greatest fear is the fear of death. Nothing
excites us so irresistibly to the most lively interest as danger to
the life of others; nothing is so shocking as an execution. Now
the boundless attachment to life which appears here cannot have
sprung from knowledge and reflection; to these it rather appears
foolish, for the objective worth of life is very uncertain, and at
least it remains doubtful whether it is preferable to not being,
nay, if experience and reflection come to be expressed, not being
must certainly win. If one knocked on the graves, and asked the dead whether they wished to rise again, they would shake their
heads. 

Such is the opinion of Socrates in “Plato's Apology,” and
even the gay and amiable Voltaire cannot help saying, “On aime
la vie; mais le néant ne laisse pas d'avoir du bon;” and again,
“Je ne sais pas ce que c'est que la vie éternelle, mais celle-ci
est une mauvaise plaisanterie.” Besides, life must in any case
soon end; so that the few years which perhaps one has yet to
be vanish entirely before the endless time when one will be no
more. Accordingly it appears to reflection even ludicrous to be
so anxious about this span of time, to tremble so much if our
own life or that of another is in danger, and to compose tragedies
the horror of which has its strength in the fear of death. That
powerful attachment to life is therefore irrational and blind; it
can only be explained from the fact that our whole inner nature
is itself will to live, to which, therefore, life must appear as
the highest good, however embittered, short, and uncertain it
may always be; and that that will, in itself and originally, is
unconscious and blind. Knowledge, on the contrary, far from
being the source of that attachment to life, even works against
it, for it discloses the worthlessness of life, and thus combats the
fear of death. When it conquers, and accordingly the man faces
death courageously and composedly, this is honoured as great
and noble, thus we hail then the triumph of knowledge over the
blind will to live, which is yet the kernel of our own being. In[253]
the same way we despise him in whom knowledge is defeated
in that conflict, and who therefore clings unconditionally to life,
struggles to the utmost against approaching death, and receives
it with despair;28 and yet in him it is only the most original
being of ourselves and of nature that expresses itself. We may
here ask, in passing, how could this boundless love of life and
endeavour to maintain it in every way as long as possible be regarded as base, contemptible, and by the adherents of every
religion as unworthy of this, if it were the gift of good gods, to be
recognised with thankfulness? And how could it then seem great
and noble to esteem it lightly? Meanwhile, what is confirmed by
these considerations is—(1.) that the will to live is the inmost
nature of man; (2.) that in itself it is unconscious and blind; (3.)
that knowledge is an adventitious principle, which is originally
foreign to the will; (4.) that knowledge conflicts with the will,
and that our judgment applauds the victory of knowledge over
the will.

If what makes death seem so terrible to us were the thought of
not being, we would necessarily think with equal horror of the
time when as yet we were not. For it is irrefutably certain that
not being after death cannot be different from not being before
birth, and consequently is also no more deplorable. A whole
eternity has run its course while as yet we were not, but that
by no means disturbs us. On the other hand, we find it hard,
nay, unendurable, that after the momentary intermezzo of an
ephemeral existence, a second eternity should follow in which
we shall no longer be. Should, then, this thirst for existence
have arisen because we have now tasted it and have found it so
delightful? As was already briefly explained above, certainly
not; far sooner could the experience gained have awakened an [254]
infinite longing for the lost paradise of non-existence. To the
hope, also, of the immortality of the soul there is always added
that of a “better world”—a sign that the present world is not
much good. Notwithstanding all this, the question as to our state
after death has certainly been discussed, in books and verbally,
ten thousand times oftener than the question as to our state before
birth. Yet theoretically the one is just as near at hand and as
fair a problem as the other; and besides, whoever had answered
the one would soon see to the bottom of the other. We have
fine declamations about how shocking it would be to think that
the mind of man, which embraces the world, and has so many
248 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
very excellent thoughts, should sink with him into the grave;
but we hear nothing about this mind having allowed a whole
eternity to pass before it came into being with these its qualities,
and how the world must have had to do without it all that time.
Yet no question presents itself more naturally to knowledge,
uncorrupted by the will, than this: An infinite time has passed
before my birth; what was I during this time? Metaphysically,
it might perhaps be answered, “I was always I; that is, all who
during that time said I, were just I.” But let us look away from
this to our present entirely empirical point of view, and assume
that I did not exist at all. Then I can console myself as to the
infinite time after my death, when I shall not be, with the infinite
time when I already was not, as a well-accustomed, and indeed
very comfortable, state. For the eternity a parte post without me
can be just as little fearful as the eternity a parte ante without
me, since the two are distinguished by nothing except by the
interposition of an ephemeral dream of life. All proofs, also, for
continued existence after death may just as well be applied in
partem ante, where they then demonstrate existence before life,
in the assumption of which the Hindus and Buddhists therefore
show themselves very consistent. Kant's ideality of time alone[255]
solves all these riddles. But we are not speaking of that now.
This, however, results from what has been said, that to mourn for
the time when one will be no more is just as absurd as it would
be to mourn over the time when as yet one was not; for it is all
the same whether the time which our existence does not fill is
related to that which it does fill, as future or as past.
But, also, regarded entirely apart from these temporal con-
siderations, it is in and for itself absurd to look upon not being
as an evil; for every evil, as every good, presupposes existence,
nay, even consciousness: but the latter ceases with life, as also in
sleep and in a swoon; therefore the absence of it is well known
to us, and trusted, as containing no evil at all: its entrance, how-
ever, is always an affair of a moment. 

From this point of view Epicurus considered death, and therefore quite rightly said, “A
∏±Ω±ƒø¬ º∑¥μΩ ¿¡ø¬ !º±¬” (Death does not concern us); with the
explanation that when we are death is not, and when death is we
are not (Diog. Laert., x. 27). To have lost what cannot be missed
is clearly no evil. Therefore ceasing to be ought to disturb us
as little as not having been. Accordingly from the standpoint of
knowledge there appears absolutely no reason to fear death. But
consciousness consists in knowing; therefore, for consciousness
death is no evil. Moreover, it is really not this knowing part of
our ego that fears death, but the fuga mortis proceeds entirely and
alone from the blind will, of which everything living is filled. To
this, however, as was already mentioned above, it is essential,
just because it is will to live, whose whole nature consists in
the effort after life and existence, and which is not originally
endowed with knowledge, but only in consequence of its objec-
tification in animal individuals. If now the will, by means of
knowledge, beholds death as the end of the phenomenon with
which it has identified itself, and to which, therefore, it sees itself
limited, its whole nature struggles against it with all its might.
Whether now it has really something to fear from death we will [256]
investigate further on, and will then remember the real source
of the fear of death, which has been shown here along with the
requisite distinction of the willing and the knowing part of our
nature.

Corresponding to this, then, what makes death so terrible to
us is not so much the end of life—for this can appear to no
one specially worthy of regret—but rather the destruction of the
organism; really because this is the will itself exhibiting itself
as body. But we only really feel this destruction in the evils of
disease or of old age; death itself, on the other hand, consists
for the subject only in the moment when consciousness vanishes
because the activity of the brain ceases. The extension of the
stoppage to all the other parts of the organism which follows
this is really already an event after death. 

Thus death, in a subjective regard, concerns the consciousness alone. Now what the
vanishing of this may be every one can to a certain extent judge
of from going to sleep; but it is still better known to whoever
has really fainted, for in this the transition is not so gradual, nor
accompanied by dreams, but first the power of sight leaves us,
still fully conscious, and then immediately the most profound
unconsciousness enters; the sensation that accompanies it, so far
as it goes, is anything but disagreeable; and without doubt, as
sleep is the brother of death, so the swoon is its twin-brother.
Even violent death cannot be painful, for even severe wounds are
not felt at all till some time afterwards, often not till the outward
signs of them are observed. If they are rapidly mortal, conscious-
ness will vanish before this discovery; if they result in death later,
then it is the same as with other illnesses. All those also who have
lost consciousness in water, or from charcoal fumes, or through
hanging are well known to say that it happened without pain.

Now, finally, the death which is properly in accordance with
nature, death from old age, euthanasia, is a gradual vanishing and
sinking out of existence in an imperceptible manner. Little by[257]
little in old age, the passions and desires, with the susceptibility
for their objects, are extinguished; the emotions no longer find
anything to excite them; for the power of presenting ideas to the
mind always becomes weaker, its images fainter; the impressions
no longer cleave to us, but pass over without leaving a trace, the
days roll ever faster, events lose their significance, everything
grows pale. The old man stricken in years totters about or rests
in a corner now only a shadow, a ghost of his former self. What
remains there for death to destroy? One day a sleep is his last,
and his dreams are ——. They are the dreams which Hamlet
inquires after in the famous soliloquy. I believe we dream them
even now.
I have here also to remark that the maintenance of the life
process, although it has a metaphysical basis, does not go on
without resistance, and consequently not without effort. It is this
251
to which the organism yields every night, on account of which
it then suspends the brain function and diminishes certain secre-
tions, the respiration, the pulse, and the development of heat.
From this we may conclude that the entire ceasing of the life
process must be a wonderful relief to its motive force; perhaps
this has some share in the expression of sweet contentment on
the faces of most dead persons. In general the moment of death
may be like the moment of awaking from a heavy dream that has
oppressed us like a nightmare.
Up to this point the result we have arrived at is that death,
however much it may be feared, can yet really be no evil. But
often it even appears as a good thing, as something wished for,
as a friend. All that have met with insuperable obstacles to their
existence or their efforts, that suffer from incurable diseases or
inconsolable griefs, have as a last refuge, which generally opens
to them of its own accord, the return into the womb of nature,
from which they arose for a short time, enticed by the hope of
more favourable conditions of existence than have fallen to their [258]
lot, and the same path out of which constantly remains open.
That return is the cessio bonorum of life. Yet even here it is only
entered upon after a physical and moral conflict: so hard does
one struggle against returning to the place from which one came
out so lightly and readily, to an existence which has so much
suffering and so little pleasure to offer. The Hindus give the god
of death, Yama, two faces; one very fearful and terrible, and one
very cheerful and benevolent. This partly explains itself from the
reflections we have just made.

At the empirical point of view at which we still stand, the
following consideration is one which presents itself of its own
accord, and therefore deserves to be accurately defined by illus-
tration, and thereby referred to its proper limits. The sight of a
dead body shows me that sensibility, irritability, circulation of
the blood, reproduction, &c., have here ceased. I conclude from
this with certainty that what actuated these hitherto, which was
252 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
yet always something unknown to me, now actuates them no
longer, thus has departed from them. But if I should now wish
to add that this must have been just what I have known only
as consciousness, consequently as intelligence (soul), this would
be not only an unjustified but clearly a false conclusion. For
consciousness has always showed itself to me not as the cause,
but as the product and result of the organised life, for it rose
and sank in consequence of this in the different periods of life,
in health and sickness, in sleep, in a swoon, in awaking, &c.,
thus always appeared as effect, never as cause of the organised
life, always showed itself as something which arises and passes
away, and again arises, so long as the conditions of this still
exist, but not apart from them. Nay, I may also have seen that
the complete derangement of consciousness, madness, far from
dragging down with it and depressing the other forces, or indeed
endangering life, heightens these very much, especially irritabil-
ity or muscular force, and rather lengthens than shortens life, if[259]
other causes do not come in. Then, also: I knew individuality
as a quality of everything organised, and therefore, if this is a
self-conscious organism, also of consciousness. But there exists
no occasion now to conclude that individuality was inherent in
that vanished principle, which imparts life, and is completely
unknown to me; all the less so as I see that everywhere in nature
each particular phenomenon is the work of a general force which
is active in thousands of similar phenomena. But, on the other
hand, there is just as little occasion to conclude that because the
organised life has ceased here that force which hitherto actuated
it has also become nothing; as little as to infer the death of the
spinner from the stopping of the spinning-wheel. If a pendulum,
by finding its centre of gravity, at last comes to rest, and thus
its individual apparent life has ceased, no one will imagine that
gravitation is now annihilated; but every one comprehends that,
after as before, it is active in innumerable phenomena. 

Certainly
it might be urged against this comparison, that here also, in this pendulum, gravitation has not ceased to be active, but only to manifest its activity palpably; whoever insists on this may think,
instead, of an electrical body, in which, after its discharge, elec-
tricity has actually ceased to be active. I only wished to show in
this that we ourselves recognise in the lowest forces of nature an
eternity and ubiquity with regard to which the transitory nature
of their fleeting phenomena never makes us err for a moment.
So much the less, then, should it come into our mind to regard
the ceasing of life as the annihilation of the living principle, and
consequently death as the entire destruction of the man. Because
the strong arm which, three thousand years ago, bent the bow of
Ulysses is no more, no reflective and well-regulated understand-
ing will regard the force which acted so energetically in it as
entirely annihilated, and therefore, upon further reflection, will
also not assume that the force which bends the bow to-day first
began with this arm. The thought lies far nearer us, that the [260]
force which earlier actuated the life which now has vanished is
the same which is active in the life which now flourishes: nay,
this is almost inevitable. Certainly, however, we know that, as
was explained in the second book, only that is perishable which
is involved in the causal series; but only the states and forms
are so involved. On the other hand, untouched by the change
of these which is introduced by causes, there remain on the one
side matter, and on the other side natural forces: for both are the
presupposition of all these changes. But the principle of our life
we must, primarily at least, conceive as a force of nature, until
perhaps a more profound investigation has brought us to know
what it is in itself. Thus, taken simply as a force of nature, the
vital force remains entirely undisturbed by the change of forms
and states, which the bond of cause and effect introduces and
carries off again, and which alone are subject to the process
of coming into being and passing away, as it lies before us
in experience. Thus so far the imperishable nature of our true
being can be proved with certainty. 

But it is true this will not satisfy the claims which are wont to be made upon proofs of our
continued existence after death, nor insure the consolation which
is expected from such proofs. However, it is always something;
and whoever fears death as an absolute annihilation cannot afford
to despise the perfect certainty that the inmost principle of his
life remains untouched by it. Nay, the paradox might be set up,
that that second thing also which, just like the forces of nature,
remains untouched by the continual change under the guidance
of causality, thus matter, by its absolute permanence, insures us
indestructibility, by virtue of which whoever was incapable of
comprehending any other might yet confidently trust in a certain
imperishableness. “What!” it will be said, “the permanence of the
mere dust, of the crude matter, is to be regarded as a continuance
of our being?” Oh! do you know this dust, then? Do you[261]
know what it is and what it can do? Learn to know it before
you despise it. This matter which now lies there as dust and
ashes will soon, dissolved in water, form itself as a crystal, will
shine as metal, will then emit electric sparks, will by means of
its galvanic intensity manifest a force which, decomposing the
closest combinations, reduces earths to metals; nay, it will, of
its own accord, form itself into plants and animals, and from its
mysterious womb develop that life for the loss of which you, in
your narrowness, are so painfully anxious. Is it, then, absolutely
nothing to continue to exist as such matter? Nay, I seriously
assert that even this permanence of matter affords evidence of the
indestructibility of our true nature, though only as in an image or
simile, or, rather, only as in outline. To see this we only need to
call to mind the explanation of matter given in chapter 24, from
which it resulted that mere formless matter—this basis of the
world of experience which is never perceived for itself alone, but
assumed as constantly remaining—is the immediate reflection,
the visibility in general, of the thing in itself, thus of the will.

Therefore, whatever absolutely pertains to the will as such holds
good also of matter, and it reflects the true eternal nature of the will under the image of temporal imperishableness. Because, as
has been said, nature does not lie, no view which has sprung
from a purely objective comprehension of it, and been logically
thought out, can be absolutely false, but at the most only very
one-sided and imperfect. Such, however, is, indisputably, con-
sistent materialism; for instance, that of Epicurus, just as well as
the absolute idealism opposed to it, like that of Berkeley, and in
general every philosophical point of view which has proceeded
from a correct apperçu, and been honestly carried out. Only they
are all exceedingly one-sided comprehensions, and therefore, in
spite of their opposition, they are all true, each from a definite
point of view; but as soon as one has risen above this point of
view, then they only appear as relatively and conditionally true. [262]
The highest standpoint alone, from which one surveys them all
and knows them in their relative truth, but also beyond this, in
their falseness, can be that of absolute truth so far as this is in
general attainable. Accordingly we see, as was shown above,
that in the very crude, and therefore very old, point of view of
materialism proper the indestructibility of our true nature in itself
is represented, as by a mere shadow of it, the imperishableness of
matter; as in the already higher naturalism of an absolute physics
it is represented by the ubiquity and eternity of the natural forces,
among which the vital force is at least to be counted. Thus
even these crude points of view contain the assertion that the
living being suffers no absolute annihilation through death, but
continues to exist in and with the whole of nature.
The considerations which have brought us to this point, and to
which the further explanations link themselves on, started from
the remarkable fear of death which fills all living beings. But
now we will change the standpoint and consider how, in contrast
to the individual beings, the whole of nature bears itself with
reference to death. In doing this, however, we still always remain
upon the ground of experience.

Certainly we know no higher game of chance than that for death and life. Every decision about this we watch with the
utmost excitement, interest, and fear; for in our eyes all in all
is at stake. On the other hand, nature, which never lies, but is
always straightforward and open, speaks quite differently upon
this theme, speaks like Krishna in the Bhagavadgita. What it
says is: The death or the life of the individual is of no signif-
icance. It expresses this by the fact that it exposes the life of
every brute, and even of man, to the most insignificant accidents
without coming to the rescue. Consider the insect on your path;
a slight, unconscious turning of your step is decisive as to its
life or death. Look at the wood-snail, without any means of
flight, of defence, of deception, of concealment, a ready prey[263]
for all. Look at the fish carelessly playing in the still open net;
the frog restrained by its laziness from the flight which might
save it; the bird that does not know of the falcon that soars
above it; the sheep which the wolf eyes and examines from
the thicket. All these, provided with little foresight, go about
guilelessly among the dangers that threaten their existence every
moment. Since now nature exposes its organisms, constructed
with such inimitable skill, not only to the predatory instincts of
the stronger, but also to the blindest chance, to the humour of
every fool, the mischievousness of every child without reserve,
it declares that the annihilation of these individuals is indifferent
to it, does it no harm, has no significance, and that in these cases
the effect is of no more importance than the cause. It says this
very distinctly, and it does not lie; only it makes no comments
on its utterances, but rather expresses them in the laconic style
of an oracle. If now the all-mother sends forth her children
without protection to a thousand threatening dangers, this can
only be because she knows that if they fall they fall back into
her womb, where they are safe; therefore their fall is a mere jest.
Nature does not act otherwise with man than with the brutes.
Therefore its declaration extends also to man: the life and death
of the individual are indifferent to it. 

Accordingly, in a certain sense, they ought also to be indifferent to us, for we ourselves are
indeed nature. Certainly, if only we saw deep enough, we would
agree with nature, and regard life and death as indifferently as it
does. Meanwhile, by means of reflection, we must attribute that
carelessness and indifference of nature towards the life of the
individuals to the fact that the destruction of such a phenomenon
does not in the least affect its true and proper nature.
If we further ponder the fact, that not only, as we have just
seen, are life and death dependent upon the most trifling acci-
dents, but that the existence of the organised being in general is
an ephemeral one, that animal and plant arise to-day and pass [264]
away to-morrow, and birth and death follow in quick succession,
while to the unorganised things which stand so much lower an
incomparably longer duration is assured, and an infinite duration
to the absolutely formless matter alone, to which, indeed, we
attribute this a priori,—then, I think, the thought must follow of
its own accord, even from the purely empirical, but objective and
unprejudiced comprehension of such an order of things, that this
is only a superficial phenomenon, that such a constant arising
and passing away can by no means touch the root of things, but
can only be relative, nay, only apparent, in which the true inner
nature of that thing is not included, the nature which everywhere
evades our glance and is thoroughly mysterious, but rather that
this continues to exist undisturbed by it; although we can neither
apprehend nor conceive the manner in which this happens, and
must therefore think of it only generally as a kind of tour de
passe-passe which took place there. For that, while what is most
imperfect, the lowest, the unorganised, continues to exist unas-
sailed, it is just the most perfect beings, the living creatures, with
their infinitely complicated and inconceivably ingenious organ-
isations, which constantly arise, new from the very foundation,
and after a brief span of time absolutely pass into nothingness, to
make room for other new ones like them coming into existence
out of nothing—this is something so obviously absurd that it can never be the true order of things, but rather a mere veil which
conceals this, or, more accurately, a phenomenon conditioned
by the nature of our intellect. Nay, the whole being and not
being itself of these individuals, in relation to which death and
life are opposites, can only be relative. Thus the language of
nature, in which it is given us as absolute, cannot be the true and
ultimate expression of the nature of things and of the order of the
world, but indeed only a patois du pays, i.e., something merely
relatively true,—something to be understood cum grano salis, or, to speak properly, something conditioned by our intellect; I
say, an immediate, intuitive conviction of the kind which I have
tried to describe in words will press itself upon every one; i.e.,
certainly only upon every one whose mind is not of an utterly
ordinary species, which is absolutely only capable of knowing
the particular simply and solely as such, which is strictly limited
to the knowledge of individuals, after the manner of the intellect
of the brutes. Whoever, on the other hand, by means of a capacity
of an only somewhat higher power, even just begins to see in
the individual beings their universal, their Ideas, will also, to
a certain extent, participate in that conviction, and that indeed
as an immediate, and therefore certain, conviction. In fact, it
is also only small, limited minds that fear death quite seriously
as their annihilation, and persons of decidedly superior capacity
are completely free from such terrors. Plato rightly bases the
whole of philosophy upon the knowledge of the doctrine of Ideas,
i.e., upon the perception of the universal in the particular. But
the conviction here described, which proceeds directly from the
comprehension of nature, must have been exceedingly vivid in
those sublime authors of the Upanishads of the Vedas, who can
scarcely be thought of as mere men, for it speaks to us so forcibly
out of an innumerable number of their utterances that we must
ascribe this immediate illumination of their mind to the fact that
these wise men, standing nearer the origin of our race in time,
comprehended the nature of things more clearly and profoundly
259
than the already deteriorated race, Aπøπ Ω≈Ω ≤¡øƒøπ μπ√πΩ, is able
to do. But certainly their comprehension is assisted by the natural
world of India, which is endowed with life in a very different
degree from our northern world. However, thorough reflection,
as pursued by Kant's great mind, leads by another path to the
same result, for it teaches us that our intellect, in which that
phenomenal world which changes so fast exhibits itself, does [266]
not comprehend the true ultimate nature of things, but merely
its phenomenal manifestation, and indeed, as I add, because it is
originally only destined to present the motives to our will, i.e., to
be serviceable to it in the pursuit of its paltry ends.
Let us, however, carry our objective and unprejudiced consid-
eration of nature still further. If I kill a living creature, whether
a dog, a bird, a frog, or even only an insect, it is really incon-
ceivable that this being, or rather the original force by virtue of
which such a marvellous phenomenon exhibited itself just the
moment before, in its full energy and love of life, should have
been annihilated by my wicked or thoughtless act. And again,
on the other hand, the millions of animals of every kind which
come into existence every moment, in infinite variety, full of
force and activity, can never, before the act of their generation,
have been nothing at all, and have attained from nothing to
an absolute beginning. If now in this way I see one of these
withdraw itself from my sight, without me knowing where it
goes, and another appear without me knowing whence it comes;
if, moreover, both have the same form, the same nature, the same
character, and only not the same matter, which yet during their
existence they continually throw off and renew; then certainly
the assumption, that that which vanishes and that which appears
in its place are one and the same, which has only experienced
a slight alteration, a renewal of the form of its existence, and
that consequently death is for the species what sleep is for the
individual; this assumption, I say, lies so close at hand that it
is impossible not to light upon it, unless the mind, perverted in early youth by the imprinting of false views, hurries it out
of the way, even from a distance, with superstitious fear. 

But
the opposite assumption that the birth of an animal is an arising
out of nothing, and accordingly that its death is its absolute
annihilation, and this with the further addition that man, who has
also originated out of nothing, has yet an individual, endless[267]
existence, and indeed a conscious existence, while the dog, the
ape, the elephant, are annihilated by death, is really something
against which the healthy mind revolts and which it must regard
as absurd. If, as is sufficiently often repeated, the comparison of
the results of a system with the utterances of the healthy mind
is supposed to be a touchstone of its truth, I wish the adherents
of the system which was handed down from Descartes to the
pre-Kantian eclectics, nay, which even now is still the prevailing
view of the great majority of cultured people in Europe, would
apply this touchstone here.
Throughout and everywhere the true symbol of nature is the
circle, because it is the schema or type of recurrence. This is,
in fact, the most universal form in nature, which it carries out
in everything, from the course of the stars down to the death
and the genesis of organised beings, and by which alone, in the
ceaseless stream of time, and its content, a permanent existence,
i.e., a nature, becomes possible.
If in autumn we consider the little world of insects, and see
how one prepares its bed to sleep the long, rigid winter-sleep;
another spins its cocoon to pass the winter as a chrysalis, and
awake in spring rejuvenated and perfected; and, finally, how
most of them, intending themselves to rest in the arms of death,
merely arrange with care the suitable place for their egg, in order
to issue forth again from it some day renewed;—this is nature's
great doctrine of immortality, which seeks to teach us that there
is no radical difference between sleep and death, but the one
endangers existence just as little as the other. The care with
which the insect prepares a cell, or hole, or nest, deposits its egg in it, together with food for the larva that will come out of it in
the following spring, and then quietly dies, is just like the care
with which in the evening a man lays ready his clothes and his
breakfast for the next morning, and then quietly goes to sleep;
and at bottom it could not take place at all if it were not that the [268]
insect which dies in autumn is in itself, and according to its true
nature, just as much identical with the one which is hatched out
in the spring as the man who lies down to sleep is identical with
the man who rises from it.

If now, after these considerations, we return to ourselves and
our own species, then cast our glance forward far into the future,
and seek to present to our minds the future generations, with the
millions of their individuals in the strange form of their customs
and pursuits, and then interpose with the question: Whence will
all these come? Where are they now? Where is the fertile womb
of that nothing, pregnant with worlds, which still conceals the
coming races? Would not the smiling and true answer to this
be, Where else should they be than there where alone the real
always was and will be, in the present and its content?—thus
with thee, the foolish questioner, who in this mistaking of his
own nature is like the leaf upon the tree, which, fading in autumn
and about to fall, complains at its destruction, and will not be
consoled by looking forward to the fresh green which will clothe
the tree in spring, but says lamenting, “I am not these! These are
quite different leaves!” Oh, foolish leaf! Whither wilt thou? And
whence should others come? Where is the nothing whose abyss
thou fearest? Know thine own nature, that which is so filled
with thirst for existence; recognise it in the inner, mysterious,
germinating force of the tree, which, constantly one and the same
in all generations of leaves, remains untouched by all arising and
passing away. And now, ø1∑ ¿μ¡ ∆≈ªª…Ω ≥μΩμ∑, ƒøπ∑¥μ ∫±π

Whether
the fly which now buzzes round me goes to sleep in the evening,
and buzzes again tomorrow, or dies in the evening, and in spring another fly buzzes which has sprung from its egg: that is in itself
the same thing; but therefore the knowledge which exhibits this
as two fundamentally different things is not unconditioned, but[269]
relative, a knowledge of the phenomenon, not of the thing in
itself. In the morning the fly exists again; it also exists again in
the spring. What distinguishes for it the winter from the night? In
Burdach's “Physiology,” vol. i. § 275, we read, “Till ten o'clock
in the morning no Cercaria ephemera (one of the infusoria) is to
be seen (in the infusion), and at twelve the whole water swarms
with them. In the evening they die, and the next morning they
again appear anew.” So it was observed by Nitzsch six days
running.

So everything lingers but a moment, and hastens on to death.
The plant and the insect die at the end of the summer, the brute
and the man after a few years: death reaps unweariedly. Yet
notwithstanding this, nay, as if this were not so at all, every-
thing is always there and in its place, just as if everything were
imperishable. The plant always thrives and blooms, the insect
hums, the brute and the man exist in unwasted youth, and the
cherries that have already been enjoyed a thousand times we
have again before us every summer. The nations also exist as
immortal individuals, although sometimes their names change;
even their action, what they do and suffer, is always the same;
although history always pretends to relate something different:
for it is like the kaleidoscope, which at every turn shows a new
figure, while we really always have the same thing before our
eyes. What then presses itself more irresistibly upon us than the
thought that that arising and passing away does not concern the
real nature of things, but this remains untouched by it, thus is im-
perishable, and therefore all and each that wills to exist actually
exists continuously and without end. Accordingly at every given
point of time all species of animals, from the gnat to the elephant,
exist together complete. They have already renewed themselves
many thousand times, and withal have remained the same. 

They know nothing of others like them, who have lived before them, [270]
or will live after them; it is the species which always lives, and
in the consciousness of the imperishable nature of the species
and their identity with it the individuals cheerfully exist. The
will to live manifests itself in an endless present, because this is
the form of the life of the species, which, therefore, never grows
old, but remains always young. Death is for it what sleep is for
the individual, or what winking is for the eye, by the absence of
which the Indian gods are known, if they appear in human form.
As through the entrance of night the world vanishes, but yet does
not for a moment cease to exist, so man and brute apparently
pass away through death, and yet their true nature continues, just
as undisturbed by it. Let us now think of that alternation of death
and birth as infinitely rapid vibrations, and we have before us
the enduring objectification of the will, the permanent Ideas of
being, fixed like the rainbow on the waterfall. This is temporal
immortality. In consequence of this, notwithstanding thousands
of years of death and decay, nothing has been lost, not an atom
of the matter, still less anything of the inner being, that exhibits
itself as nature. Therefore every moment we can cheerfully cry,
“In spite of time, death, and decay, we are still all together!”
Perhaps we would have to except whoever had once said from
the bottom of his heart, with regard to this game, “I want no
more.” But this is not yet the place to speak of this.
But we have certainly to draw attention to the fact that the
pain of birth and the bitterness of death are the two constant
conditions under which the will to live maintains itself in its
objectification, i.e., our inner nature, untouched by the course
of time and the death of races, exists in an everlasting present,
and enjoys the fruit of the assertion of the will to live. This is
analogous to the fact that we can only be awake during the day
on condition that we sleep during the night; indeed the latter is
the commentary which nature offers us for the understanding of [271]
264 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
that difficult passage.29
For the substratum, or the content, ¿ª∑¡…º±, or the material of
the present, is through all time really the same. The impossibility
of knowing this identity directly is just time, a form and limitation
of our intellect. That on account of it, for example, the future
event is not yet, depends upon an illusion of which we become
conscious when that event has come. That the essential form
of our intellect introduces such an illusion explains and justifies
itself from the fact that the intellect has come forth from the
hands of nature by no means for the apprehension of the nature
of things, but merely for the apprehension of motives, thus for
the service of an individual and temporal phenomenon of will.30
Whoever comprehends the reflections which here occupy us
will also understand the true meaning of the paradoxical doctrine
of the Eleatics, that there is no arising and passing away, but the
whole remains immovable: “†±¡ºμΩπ¥∑¬ ∫±π úμªπ√√ø¬ ±Ω√¡ø≈Ω
≥μΩμ√πΩ ∫±π ∆∏ø¡±Ω, ¥π± ƒø ΩøºπæμπΩ ƒø ¿±Ω ±∫πΩ∑ƒøΩ” (Par-
menides et Melissus ortum et interitum tollebant, quoniam nihil
moveri putabant), Stob. Ecl., i. 21. Light is also thrown here
upon the beautiful passage of Empedocles which Plutarch has
preserved for us in the book, “Adversus Coloten,” c. 12:—[272]

29 The suspension of the animal functions is sleep, that of the organic functions
is death.

30 There is only one present, and this is always: for it is the sole form of actual
existence. One must attain to the insight that the past is not in itself different
from the present, but only in our apprehension, which has time as its form, on
account of which alone the present exhibits itself as different from the past.
To assist this insight, imagine all the events and scenes of human life, bad
and good, fortunate and unfortunate, pleasing and terrible, as they successively
present themselves in the course of time and difference of places, in the most
checkered multifariousness and variety, as at once and together, and always
present in the Nunc stans, while it is only apparently that now this and now
that is; then what the objectification of the will to live really means will be
understood. Our pleasure also in genre painting depends principally upon the
fact that it fixes the fleeting scenes of life. The dogma of metempsychosis has
proceeded from the feeling of the truth which has just been expressed.

The very remarkable and, in its place, astonishing passage in
Diderot's “Jacques le fataliste,” deserves not less to be mentioned
here: “Un château immense, au frontispice duquel on lisait: ‹ Je
n'appartiens à personne, et j'appartiens à tout le monde: vous y
étiez avant que d'y entrer, vous y serez encore, quand vous en
sortirez ›.”
Certainly in the sense in which, when he is begotten, the man
arises out of nothing, he becomes nothing through death. But
really to learn to know this “nothing” would be very interesting;
for it only requires moderate acuteness to see that this empirical
nothing is by no means absolute, i.e., such as would in every
sense be nothing. We are already led to this insight by the
observation that all qualities of the parents recur in the children,
thus have overcome death. Of this, however, I will speak in a
special chapter.
There is no greater contrast than that between the ceaseless
flight of time, which carries its whole content with it, and the
rigid immobility of what is actually present, which at all times is
one and the same. And if from this point of view we watch in a
266 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
purely objective manner the immediate events of life, the Nunc
stans becomes clear and visible to us in the centre of the wheel of[273]
time. To the eye of a being of incomparably longer life, which at
one glance comprehended the human race in its whole duration,
the constant alternation of birth and death would present itself
as a continuous vibration, and accordingly it would not occur
to it at all to see in this an ever new arising out of nothing and
passing into nothing; but just as to our sight the quickly revolving
spark appears as a continuous circle, the rapidly vibrating spring
as a permanent triangle, the vibrating cord as a spindle, so to
this eye the species would appear as that which has being and
permanence, death and life as vibrations.

We will have false conceptions of the indestructibility of our
true nature by death, so long as we do not make up our minds to
study it primarily in the brutes, but claim for ourselves alone a
class apart from them, under the boastful name of immortality.
But it is this pretension alone, and the narrowness of view from
which it proceeds, on account of which most men struggle so
obstinately against the recognition of the obvious truth that we
are essentially, and in the chief respect, the same as the brutes;
nay, that they recoil at every hint of our relationship with these.
But it is this denial of the truth which more than anything else
closes against them the path to real knowledge of the indestruc-
tibility of our nature. For if we seek anything upon a wrong
path, we have just on that account forsaken the right path, and
upon the path we follow we will never attain to anything in the
end but late disillusion. Up, then, follow the truth, not according
to preconceived notions, but as nature leads! First of all, learn
to recognise in the aspect of every young animal the existence
of the species that never grows old, which, as a reflection of its
eternal youth, imparts to every individual a temporary youth, and
lets it come forth as new and fresh as if the world were of to-day.
Let one ask himself honestly whether the swallow of this year's
spring is absolutely a different one from the swallow of the first
267
spring, and whether really between the two the miracle of the [274]
creation out of nothing has repeated itself millions of times, in
order to work just as often into the hands of absolute annihilation.
I know well that if I seriously assured any one that the cat which
now plays in the yard is still the same one which made the same
springs and played the same tricks there three hundred years ago,
he would think I was mad; but I also know that it is much madder
to believe that the cat of to-day is through and through and in its
whole nature quite a different one from the cat of three hundred
years ago. One only requires truly and seriously to sink oneself
in the contemplation of one of these higher vertebrates in order to
become distinctly conscious that this unfathomable nature, taken
as a whole, as it exists there, cannot possibly become nothing;
and yet, on the other hand, one knows its transitoriness. This
depends upon the fact that in this animal the infinite nature of
its Idea (species) is imprinted in the finiteness of the individual.
For in a certain sense it is of course true that in the individual
we always have before us another being—in the sense which
depends upon the principle of sufficient reason, in which are
also included time and space, which constitute the principium
individuationis. But in another sense it is not true—in the sense
in which reality belongs to the permanent forms of things, the
Ideas alone, and which was so clearly evident to Plato that it
became his fundamental thought, the centre of his philosophy;
and he made the comprehension of it the criterion of capacity for
philosophising in general.

As the scattered drops of the roaring waterfall change with
lightning rapidity, while the rainbow, whose supporter they are,
remains immovably at rest, quite untouched by that ceaseless
change, so every Idea, i.e., every species of living creature re-
mains quite untouched by the continual change of its individuals.
But it is the Idea, or the species in which the will to live is
really rooted, and manifests itself; and therefore also the will [275]
is only truly concerned in the continuance of the species. For
268 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
example, the lions which are born and die are like the drops of
the waterfall; but the leonitas, the Idea or form of the lion, is like
the unshaken rainbow upon it. Therefore Plato attributed true
being to the Ideas alone, i.e., to the species; to the individuals
only a ceaseless arising and passing away. From the profound
consciousness of his imperishable nature really springs also the
confidence and peace of mind with which every brute, and even
human individual, moves unconcernedly along amid a host of
chances, which may annihilate it any moment, and, moreover,
moves straight on to death: out of its eyes, however, there shines
the peace of the species, which that death does not affect, and
does not concern. Even to man this peace could not be impart-
ed by uncertain and changing dogmas. But, as was said, the
contemplation of every animal teaches that death is no obstacle
to the kernel of life, to the will in its manifestation. What an
unfathomable mystery lies, then, in every animal! Look at the
nearest one; look at your dog, how cheerfully and peacefully he
lives! Many thousands of dogs have had to die before it came to
this one's turn to live. But the death of these thousands has not
affected the Idea of the dog; it has not been in the least disturbed
by all that dying. Therefore the dog exists as fresh and endowed
with primitive force as if this were its first day and none could
ever be its last; and out of its eyes there shines the indestructible
principle in it, the archæus. What, then, has died during those
thousands of years? Not the dog—it stands unscathed before us;
merely its shadow, its image in our form of knowledge, which
is bound to time. Yet how can one even believe that that passes
away which for ever and ever exists and fills all time? Certainly
the matter can be explained empirically; in proportion as death
destroyed the individuals, generation produced new ones. But
this empirical explanation is only an apparent explanation: it
puts one riddle in the place of the other. The metaphysical[276]
understanding of the matter, although not to be got so cheaply, is
yet the only true and satisfying one.

Kant, in his subjective procedure, brought to light the truth
that time cannot belong to the thing in itself, because it lies pre-
formed in our apprehension. Now death is the temporal end of
the temporal phenomenon; but as soon as we abstract time, there
is no longer any end, and this word has lost all significance. But
I, here upon the objective path, am trying to show the positive
side of the matter, that the thing in itself remains untouched by
time, and by that which is only possible through time, arising
and passing away, and that the phenomena in time could not
have even that ceaselessly fleeting existence which stands next
to nothingness, if there were not in them a kernel of the infinite.
Eternity is certainly a conception which has no perception as its
foundation; accordingly it has also a merely negative content; it
signifies a timeless existence. Time is yet merely an image of
eternity, A «¡øΩø¬ μ0∫…Ω ƒøΩ ±0…Ωø¬, as Plotinus has it; and in
the same way our temporal existence is a mere image of our true
nature. This must lie in eternity, just because time is only the
form of our knowledge; but on account of this alone do we know
our own existence, and that of all things as transitory, finite, and
subject to annihilation.
In the second book I have shown that the adequate objectivity
of the will as the thing in itself, at each of its grades, is the
(Platonic) Idea; similarly in the third book that the Ideas of
things have the pure subject of knowledge as their correlative;
consequently the knowledge of them only appears exceptionally
and temporarily under specially favourable conditions. For in-
dividual knowledge, on the other hand, thus in time, the Idea
presents itself under the form of the species, which is the Idea
broken up through its entrance into time. 

Therefore the species
is the most immediate objectification of the thing in itself, i.e., [277]
of the will to live. The inmost nature of every brute, and also
of man, accordingly lies in the species; thus the will to live,
which is so powerfully active, is rooted in this, not really in the
individual. On the other hand, in the individual alone lies the immediate consciousness: accordingly it imagines itself different
from the species, and therefore fears death. The will to live
manifests itself in relation to the individual as hunger and the
fear of death: in relation to the species as sexual instinct and
passionate care for the offspring. In agreement with this we
find nature, which is free from that delusion of the individual,
as careful for the maintenance of the species as it is indifferent
to the destruction of the individuals: the latter are always only
means, the former is the end. Therefore a glaring contrast appears
between its niggardliness in the endowment of the individuals
and its prodigality when the species is concerned. In the latter
case from one individual are often annually obtained a hundred
thousand germs, and more; for example, from trees, fishes, crabs,
termites, and many others. In the former case, on the contrary,
only barely enough in the way of powers and organs is given to
each to enable it with ceaseless effort to maintain its life. And,
therefore, if an animal is injured or weakened it must, as a rule,
starve. And where an incidental saving was possible, through
the circumstance that one part could upon necessity be dispensed
with, it has been withheld, even out of order. Hence, for example,
many caterpillars are without eyes; the poor creatures grope in
the dark from leaf to leaf, which, since they lack feelers, they do
by moving three-fourths of their body back and forward in the air,
till they find some object. Hence they often miss their food which
is to be found close by. But this happens in consequence of the
lex parsimoniæ naturæ, to the expression of which natura nihil
facit supervacaneum one may add et nihil largitur. The same
tendency of nature shows itself also in the fact that the more fit[278]
the individual is, on account of his age, for the propagation of
the species, the more powerfully does the vis naturæ medicatrix
manifest itself in him, and therefore his wounds heal easily, and
he easily recovers from diseases. This diminishes along with the
power of generation, and sinks low after it is extinct; for now in
the eyes of nature the individual has become worthless.

If now we cast another glance at the scale of existences, with
the whole of their accompanying gradations of consciousness,
from the polyp up to man, we see this wonderful pyramid, kept
in ceaseless oscillation certainly by the constant death of the
individuals, yet by means of the bond of generation, enduring in
the species through the infinite course of time. While, then, as
was explained above, the objective, the species, presents itself
as indestructible, the subjective, which consists merely in the
self-consciousness of these beings, seems to be of the shortest
duration, and to be unceasingly destroyed, in order, just as often,
to come forth again from nothing in an incomprehensible man-
ner. But, indeed, one must be very short-sighted to let oneself
be deceived by this appearance, and not to comprehend that,
although the form of temporal permanence only belongs to the
objective, the subjective, i.e., the will, which lives and manifests
itself in all, and with it the subject of the knowledge in which
all exhibits itself, must be not less indestructible; because the
permanence of the objective, or external, can yet only be the
phenomenal appearance of the indestructibility of the subjective
or internal; for the former can possess nothing which it has not
received on loan from the latter; and cannot be essentially and
originally an objective, a phenomenon, and then secondarily and
accidentally a subjective, a thing in itself, a self-consciousness.
For clearly the former as a manifestation presupposes something
which manifests itself, as being for other presupposes a being
for self, and as object presupposes a subject; and not conversely:
because everywhere the root of things must lie in that which [279]
they are for themselves, thus in the subjective, not in the ob-
jective, i.e., in that which they are only for others, in a foreign
consciousness. Accordingly we found in the first book that the
right starting-point for philosophy is essentially and necessarily
the subjective, i.e., the idealistic starting-point; and also that the
opposite starting-point, that which proceeds from the objective,
leads to materialism. At bottom, however, we are far more one
272 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
with the world than we commonly suppose: its inner nature is
our will, its phenomenal appearance is our idea. For any one
who could bring this unity of being to distinct consciousness, the
difference between the continuance of the external world after
his death and his own continuance after death would vanish. The
two would present themselves to him as one and the same; nay,
he would laugh at the delusion that could separate them. For
the understanding of the indestructibility of our nature coincides
with that of the identity of the macrocosm and the microcosm.
Meanwhile one may obtain light upon what is said here by a
peculiar experiment, performed by means of the imagination, an
experiment which might be called metaphysical. Let any one try
to present vividly to his mind the time, in any case not far distant,
when he will be dead. Then he thinks himself away and lets the
world go on existing; but soon, to his own astonishment, he will
discover that he was nevertheless still there. For he intended to
present the world to his mind without himself; but the ego is the
immediate element in consciousness, through which alone the
world is brought about, and for which alone it exists. This centre
of all existence, this kernel of all reality, is to be abolished, and
yet the world is to go on existing; it is a thought which can
be conceived in the abstract, but not realised. The endeavour
to accomplish this, the attempt to think the secondary without
the primary, the conditioned without the condition, that which
is supported without the supporter, always fails, much in the
same way as the attempt to think an equilateral, right-angled[280]
triangle, or a destruction or origination of matter, and similar
impossibilities. Instead of what was intended, the feeling here
presses upon us that the world is not less in us than we in it,
and that the source of all reality lies within us. The result is
really this: the time when I shall not be will objectively come;
but subjectively it can never come. It might therefore, indeed,
be asked, how far every one, in his heart, actually believes in a
thing which he really cannot conceive at all; or whether, since the profound consciousness of the indestructibleness of our true
nature associates itself with that merely intellectual experiment,
which, however, has already been made more or less distinctly
by every one, whether, I say, our own death is not perhaps for us
at bottom the most incredible thing in the world.

The deep conviction of the indestructibleness of our nature
through death, which, as is also shown by the inevitable qualms
of conscience at its approach, every one carries at the bottom of
his heart, depends altogether upon the consciousness of the orig-
inal and eternal nature of our being: therefore Spinoza expresses
it thus: “Sentimus, experimurque, nos æternos esse.” For a rea-
sonable man can only think of himself as imperishable, because
he thinks of himself as without beginning, as eternal, in fact as
timeless. Whoever, on the other hand, regards himself as having
become out of nothing must also think that he will again become
nothing; for that an eternity had passed before he was, and then a
second eternity had begun, through which he will never cease to
be, is a monstrous thought. Really the most solid ground for our
immortality is the old principle: “Ex nihilo nihil fit, et in nihilum
nihil potest reverti.” Theophrastus Paracelsus very happily says
(Works, Strasburg, 1603, vol. ii. p. 6): “The soul in me has
arisen out of something; therefore it does not come to nothing;
for it comes out of something.” He gives the true reason. But
whoever regards the birth of the man as his absolute beginning [281]
must regard death as his absolute end. For both are what they
are in the same sense; consequently every one can only think of
himself as immortal so far as he also thinks of himself as unborn,
and in the same sense. What birth is, that also is death, according
to its nature and significance: it is the same line drawn in two
directions. If the former is an actual arising out of nothing, then
the latter is also an actual annihilation. But in truth it is only by
means of the eternity of our real being that we can conceive it
as imperishable, and consequently this imperishableness is not
temporal. 

The assumption that man is made out of nothing leads necessarily to the assumption that death is his absolute end. Thus
in this the Old Testament is perfectly consistent; for no doctrine
of immortality is suitable to a creation out of nothing. New
Testament Christianity has such a doctrine because it is Indian
in spirit, and therefore more than probably also of Indian origin,
although only indirectly, through Egypt. But to the Jewish stem,
upon which that Indian wisdom had to be grafted in the Holy
Land, such a doctrine is as little suited as the freedom of the will
to its determinism, or as “Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam Jungere si velit.”
It is always bad if one cannot be thoroughly original, and dare
not carve out of the whole wood. Brahmanism and Buddhism,
on the other hand, have quite consistently, besides the continued
existence after death, an existence before birth to expiate the
guilt of which we have this life. Moreover, how distinctly con-
scious they were of the necessary consistency in this is shown by
the following passage from Colebrooke's “History of the Indian
Philosophy” in the “Transac. of the Asiatic London Society,”
vol. i. p. 577: “Against the system of the Bhagavatas which
is but partially heretical, the objection upon which the chief[282]
stress is laid by Vyaso is, that the soul would not be eternal if it
were a production, and consequently had a beginning.” Further,
in Upham's “Doctrine of Buddhism,” p. 110, it is said: “The lot
in hell of impious persons called Deitty is the most severe: these
are they who, discrediting the evidence of Buddha, adhere to the
heretical doctrine that all living beings had their beginning in the
mother's womb, and will have their end in death.”

Whoever conceives his existence as merely accidental must
certainly fear that he will lose it by death. On the other hand,
whoever sees, even only in general, that his existence rests upon
some kind of original necessity will not believe that this which
has produced so wonderful a thing is limited to such a brief span
of time, but that it is active in every one. But he will recognise
275
his existence as necessary who reflects that up till now, when he
exists, already an infinite time, thus also an infinity of changes,
has run its course, but in spite of this he yet exists; thus the
Whole range of all possible states has already exhausted itself
without being able to destroy his existence. If he could ever
not be, he would already not be now. For the infinity of the
time that has already elapsed, with the exhausted possibility of
the events in it, guarantees that what exists, exists necessarily.
Therefore every one must conceive himself as a necessary being,
i.e., as a being whose existence would follow from its true and
exhaustive definition if one only had it. In this line of thought,
then, really lies the only immanent proof of the imperishableness
of our nature, i.e., the only proof of this that holds good within
the sphere of empirical data. In this nature existence must inhere,
because it shows itself as independent of all states which can
possibly be introduced through the chain of causes; for these
states have already done what they could, and yet our existence
has remained unshaken by it, as the ray of light by the storm
wind which it cuts through. If time, of its own resources, could [283]
bring us to a happy state, then we would already have been there
long ago; for an infinite time lies behind us. But also: if it
could lead us to destruction, we would already have long been
no more. From the fact that we now exist, it follows, if well
considered, that we must at all times exist. For we are ourselves
the nature which time has taken up into itself in order to fill its
void; consequently it fills the whole of time, present, past, and
future, in the same way, and it is just as impossible for us to fall
out of existence as to fall out of space. Carefully considered, it is
inconceivable that what once exists in all the strength of reality
should ever become nothing, and then not be, through an infinite
time. Hence has arisen the Christian doctrine of the restoration of
all things, that of the Hindus of the constantly repeated creation
of the world by Brahma, together with similar dogmas of the
Greek philosophers. The great mystery of our being and not being, to explain which these and all kindred dogmas have been
devised, ultimately rests upon the fact that the same thing which
objectively constitutes an infinite course of time is subjectively
an indivisible, ever present present: but who comprehends it?
It has been most distinctly set forth by Kant in his immortal
doctrine of the ideality of time and the sole reality of the thing
in itself. For it results from this that the really essential part of
things, of man, of the world, lies permanently and enduringly in
the Nunc stans, firm and immovable; and that the change of the
phenomena and events is a mere consequence of our apprehen-
sion of them by means of our form of perception, which is time.
Accordingly, instead of saying to men, “Ye have arisen through
birth, but are immortal,” one ought to say to them, “Ye are not
nothing,” and teach them to understand this in the sense of the
saying attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, “§ø ≥±¡ @Ω μπ √ƒ±π”
(Quod enim est, erit semper), Stob. Ecl., i. 43, 6. If, however, this
does not succeed, but the anxious heart raises its old lament, “I[284]
see all beings arise through birth out of nothing, and after a brief
term again return to this; my existence also, now in the present,
will soon lie in the distant past, and I will be nothing!”—the
right answer is, “Dost thou not exist? Hast thou not within thee
the valuable present, after which ye children of time so eagerly
strive, now within, actually within? And dost thou understand
how thou hast attained to it? Knowest thou the paths which have
led thee to it, that thou canst know they will be shut against thee
by death? An existence of thyself after the destruction of thy
body is not conceivable by thee as possible; but can it be more
inconceivable to thee than thy present existence, and how thou
hast attained to it? Why shouldst thou doubt but that the secret
paths to this present, which stood open to thee, will also stand
open to every future present?”

If, then, considerations of this kind are at any rate adapted
to awaken the conviction that there is something in us which
death cannot destroy, this yet only takes place by raising us to a point of view from which birth is not the beginning of our
existence. But from this it follows that what is proved to be
indestructible by death is not properly the individual, which,
moreover, as having arisen through generation, and having in
itself the qualities of the father and mother, presents itself as a
mere difference of the species, but as such can only be finite.
As, in accordance with this, the individual has no recollection
of its existence before its birth, so it can have no remembrance
of its present existence after death. But every one places his
ego in consciousness; this seems to him therefore to be bound to
individuality, with which, besides, everything disappears which
is peculiar to him, as to this, and distinguishes him from others.
His continued existence without individuality becomes to him
therefore indistinguishable from the continuance of other beings,
and he sees his ego sink. But whoever thus links his existence to
the identity of consciousness, and therefore desires an endless [285]
existence after death for this, ought to reflect that he can certainly
only attain this at the price of just as endless a past before birth.
For since he has no remembrance of an existence before birth,
thus his consciousness begins with birth, he must accept his birth
as an origination of his existence out of nothing. But then he
purchases the endless time of his existence after death for just
as long a time before birth; thus the account balances without
any profit for him. If, on the other hand, the existence which
death leaves untouched is different from that of the individual
consciousness, then it must be independent of birth, just as of
death; and therefore, with regard to it, it must be equally true to
say, “I will always be,” and “I have always been;” which then
gives two infinities for one. But the great equivocation really
lies in the word “I,” as any one will see at once who remembers
the contents of our second book, and the separation which is
made there of the willing from the knowing part of our nature.
According as I understand this word I can say, “Death is my
complete end;” or, “This my personal phenomenal existence is just as infinitely small a part of my true nature as I am of the
world.” But the “I” is the dark point in consciousness, as on the
retina the exact point at which the nerve of sight enters is blind,
as the brain itself is entirely without sensation, the body of the
sun is dark, and the eye sees all except itself. 

Our faculty of
knowledge is directed entirely towards without, in accordance
with the fact that it is the product of a brain function, which
has arisen for the purpose of mere self-maintenance, thus of the
search for nourishment and the capture of prey. Therefore every
one knows himself only as this individual as it presents itself
in external perception. If, on the other hand, he could bring to
consciousness what he is besides and beyond this, then he would
willingly give up his individuality, smile at the tenacity of his
attachment to it, and say, “What is the loss of this individuality
to me, who bear in myself the possibility of innumerable indi-[286]
vidualities?” He would see that even if a continued existence of
his individuality does not lie before him, it is yet quite as good
as if he had such an existence, because he carries in himself
complete compensation for it. Besides, however, it may further
be taken into consideration that the individuality of most men is
so miserable and worthless that with it they truly lose nothing,
and that that in them which may still have some worth is the
universal human element; but to this imperishableness can be
promised. Indeed, even the rigid unalterableness and essential
limitation of every individual would, in the case of an endless
duration of it, necessarily at last produce such great weariness
by its monotony that only to be relieved of this one would prefer
to become nothing. To desire that the individuality should be
immortal really means to wish to perpetuate an error infinitely.
For at bottom every individuality is really only a special error,
a false step, something that had better not be; nay, something
which it is the real end of life to bring us back from. This
also finds confirmation in the fact that the great majority, indeed
really all men, are so constituted that they could not be happy in whatever kind of world they might be placed. In proportion as
such a world excluded want and hardship, they would become
a prey to ennui, and in proportion as this was prevented, they
would fall into want, misery, and suffering. Thus for a blessed
condition of man it would be by no means sufficient that he
should be transferred to a “better world,” but it would also be
necessary that a complete change should take place in himself;
that thus he should no longer be what he is, and, on the contrary,
should become what he is not. But for this he must first of all
cease to be what he is: this desideratum is, as a preliminary,
supplied by death, the moral necessity of which can already be
seen from this point of view. To be transferred to another world
and to have his whole nature changed are, at bottom, one and
the same. Upon this also ultimately rests that dependence of the [287]
objective upon the subjective which the idealism of our first book
shows. Accordingly here lies the point at which the transcendent
philosophy links itself on to ethics. If one considers this one
will find that the awaking from the dream of life is only possible
through the disappearance along with it of its whole ground-warp
also, But this is its organ itself, the intellect together with its
forms, with which the dream would spin itself out without end,
so firmly is it incorporated with it. That which really dreamt
this dream is yet different from it, and alone remains over. On
the other hand, the fear that with death all will be over may be
compared to the case of one who imagines in a dream that there
are only dreams without a dreamer. But now, after an individual
consciousness has once been ended by death, would it even be
desirable that it should be kindled again in order to continue for
ever? The greater part of its content, nay, generally its whole
content, is nothing but a stream of small, earthly, paltry thoughts
and endless cares. Let them, then, at last be stilled! Therefore
with a true instinct, the ancients inscribed upon their gravestones:
Securitati perpetuæ;—or Bonæ quieti. But if here, as so often has
happened, a continued existence of the individual consciousness should be desired, in order to connect with it a future reward or
punishment, what would really be aimed at in this would simply
be the compatibility of virtue and egoism. But these two will
never embrace: they are fundamentally opposed. On the other
hand, the conviction is well founded, which the sight of noble
conduct calls forth, that the spirit of love, which enjoins one man
to spare his enemy, and another to protect at the risk of his life
some one whom he has never seen before, can never pass away
and become nothing.
The most thorough answer to the question as to the contin-
ued existence of the individual after death lies in Kant's great
doctrine of the ideality of time, which just here shows itself
specially fruitful and rich in consequences, for it substitutes[288]
a purely theoretical but well-proved insight for dogmas which
upon one path as upon the other lead to the absurd, and thus
settles at once the most exciting of all metaphysical questions.
Beginning, ending, and continuing are conceptions which derive
their significance simply and solely from time, and are therefore
valid only under the presupposition of this. But time has no
absolute existence; it is not the manner of being of the thing in
itself, but merely the form of our knowledge of our existence
and nature, and that of all things, which is just on this account
very imperfect, and is limited to mere phenomena. Thus with
reference to this knowledge alone do the conceptions of ceasing
and continuing find application, not with reference to that which
exhibits itself in these, the inner being of things in relation to
which these conceptions have therefore no longer any meaning.
For this shows itself also in the fact that an answer to the ques-
tion which arises from those time-conceptions is impossible, and
every assertion of such an answer, whether upon one side or the
other, is open to convincing objections. One might indeed assert
that our true being continues after death because it is false that it
is destroyed; but one might just as well assert that it is destroyed
because it is false that it continues: at bottom the one is as true
281
as the other. Accordingly something like an antinomy might
certainly be set up here. But it would rest upon mere negations.
In it one would deny two contradictorily opposite predicates of
the subject of the judgment, but only because the whole category
of these predicates would be inapplicable to that subject. But if
now one denies these two predicates, not together, but separately,
it appears as if the contradictory opposite of the predicate which
in each case is denied were proved of the subject of the judgment.
This, however, depends upon the fact that here incommensurable
quantities are compared, for the problem removes us to a scene
where time is abolished, and yet asks about temporal properties
which it is consequently equally false to attribute to, or to deny [289]
of the subject. This just means: the problem is transcendent. In
this sense death remains a mystery.

On the other hand, adhering to that distinction between phe-
nomenon and thing in itself, we can make the assertion that, as
phenomenon, man is certainly perishable, but yet his true being
will not be involved in this. Thus this true being is indestructible,
although, on account of the elimination of time-conceptions
which is connected with it, we cannot attribute to it continu-
ance. Accordingly we would be led here to the conception of
an indestructibility which would yet be no continuance. Now
this is a conception which, having been obtained on the path of
abstraction, can certainly also be thought in the abstract, but yet
cannot be supported by any perception, and consequently cannot
really become distinct; yet, on the other hand, we must here keep
in mind that we have not, like Kant, absolutely given up the
knowledge of the thing in itself, but know that it is to be sought
for in the will. It is true that we have never asserted an absolute
and exhaustive knowledge of the thing in itself, but rather have
seen very well that it is impossible to know anything as it is
absolutely and in itself. For as soon as I know, I have an idea;
but this idea, just because it is my idea, cannot be identical with
what is known, but repeats it in an entirely different form, for it makes a being for other out of a being for self, and is thus
always to be regarded as a phenomenal appearance of the thing
in itself. Therefore for a knowing consciousness, however it may
be constituted, there can be always only phenomena. This is not
entirely obviated even by the fact that it is my own nature which
is known; for, since it falls within my knowing consciousness,
it is already a reflex of my nature, something different from
this itself, thus already in a certain degree phenomenon. So far,
then, as I am a knowing being, I have even in my own nature
really only a phenomenon; so far, on the other hand, as I am
directly this nature itself, I am not a knowing being. For it is[290]
sufficiently proved in the second book that knowledge is only a
secondary property of our being, and introduced by its animal
nature. Strictly speaking, then, we know even our own will
always merely as phenomenon, and not as it may be absolutely
in and for itself. But in that second book, and also in my work
upon the will in nature, it is fully explained and proved that
if, in order to penetrate into the inner nature of things, leaving
what is given merely indirectly and from without, we stick to
the only phenomenon into the nature of which an immediate
insight from within is attainable, we find in this quite definitely,
as the ultimate kernel of reality, the will, in which therefore we
recognise the thing in itself in so far as it has here no longer space,
although it still has time, for its form consequently really only in
its most immediate manifestation, and with the reservation that
this knowledge of it is still not exhaustive and entirely adequate.
Thus in this sense we retain here also the conception of will as
that of the thing in itself.
The conception of ceasing to be is certainly applicable to
man as a phenomenon in time, and empirical knowledge plainly
presents death as the end of this temporal existence. The end of
the person is just as real as was its beginning, and in the same
sense as before birth we were not, after death we shall be no
more. Yet no more can be destroyed by death than was produced by birth; thus not that through which birth first became possible.

In this sense natus et denatus is a beautiful expression. But now
the whole of empirical knowledge affords us merely phenomena;
therefore only phenomena are involved in the temporal processes
of coming into being and passing away, and not that which
manifests itself in the phenomena, the thing in itself. For this the
opposition of coming into being and passing away conditioned
by the brain, does not exist at all, but has here lost meaning and
significance. It thus remains untouched by the temporal end of [291]
a temporal phenomenon, and constantly retains that existence to
which the conceptions of beginning, end, and continuance are
not applicable. But the thing in itself, so far as we can follow it, is
in every phenomenal being the will of this being: so also in man.
Consciousness, on the other hand, consists in knowledge. But
knowledge, as activity of the brain, and consequently as function
of the organism, belongs, as has been sufficiently proved, to the
mere phenomenon, and therefore ends with this. The will alone,
whose work, or rather whose image was the body, is that which
is indestructible. The sharp distinction of will from knowledge,
together with the primacy of the former, which constitutes the
fundamental characteristic of my philosophy, is therefore the
only key to the contradiction which presents itself in so many
ways, and arises ever anew in every consciousness, even the
most crude, that death is our end, and that yet we must be eternal
and indestructible, thus the sentimus, experimurque nos æternos
esse of Spinoza. All philosophers have erred in this: they place
the metaphysical, the indestructible, the eternal element in man
in the intellect. It lies exclusively in the will, which is entirely
different from the intellect, and alone is original. 

The intellect,
as was most fully shown in the second book, is a secondary
phenomenon, and conditioned by the brain, therefore beginning
and ending with this. The will alone is that which conditions,
the kernel of the whole phenomenon, consequently free from
the forms of the phenomenon to which time belongs, thus also indestructible. Accordingly with death consciousness is certainly
lost, but not that which produced and sustained consciousness;
life is extinguished, but not the principle of life also, which
manifested itself in it. Therefore a sure feeling informs every
one that there is something in him which is absolutely imperish-
able and indestructible. Indeed the freshness and vividness of
memories of the most distant time, of earliest childhood, bears
witness to the fact that something in us does not pass away with[292]
time, does not grow old, but endures unchanged. But what this
imperishable element is one could not make clear to oneself. It
is not consciousness any more than it is the body upon which
clearly consciousness depends. But it is just that which, when
it appears in consciousness, presents itself as will. Beyond this
immediate manifestation of it we certainly cannot go; because
we cannot go beyond consciousness; therefore the question what
that may be when it does not come within consciousness, i.e.,
what it is absolutely in itself, remains unanswerable.
In the phenomenon, and by means of its forms, time and
space, as principium individuationis, what presents itself is that
the human individual perishes, while the human race, on the
contrary, always remains and lives. But in the true being of
things, which is free from these forms, this whole distinction
between the individual and the race also disappears, and the two
are immediately one. The whole will to live is in the individual,
as it is in the race, and therefore the continuance of the species is
merely the image of the indestructibility of the individual.
Since, then, the infinitely important understanding of the inde-
structibility of our true nature by death depends entirely upon the
distinction between phenomenon and thing in itself, I wish now
to bring this difference into the clearest light by explaining it in
the opposite of death, thus in the origin of the animal existence,
i.e., generation. For this process, which is just as mysterious as
death, presents to us most directly the fundamental opposition
between the phenomenal appearance and the true being of things, i.e., between the world as idea and the world as will, and also
the entire heterogeneity of the laws of these two. The act of
procreation presents itself to us in a twofold manner: first, for
self-consciousness, whose only object, as I have often shown, is
the will, with all its affections; and then for the consciousness
of other things, i.e., the world of idea, or the empirical reality [293]
of things. Now, from the side of the will, thus inwardly, subjec-
tively, for self-consciousness, that act presents itself as the most
immediate and complete satisfaction of the will, i.e., as sensual
pleasure. From the side of the idea, on the other hand, thus
externally, objectively, for the consciousness of other things, this
act is just the woof of the most cunning of webs, the foundation
of the inexpressibly complicated animal organism, which then
only requires to be developed to become visible to our astonished
eyes. This organism, whose infinite complication and perfection
is only known to him who has studied anatomy, cannot, from the
side of the idea, be otherwise conceived and thought of than as a
system devised with the most ingenious forethought and carried
out with the most consummate skill and exactness, as the most
arduous work of profound reflection. But from the side of the
will we know, through self-consciousness, the production of this
organism as the work of an act which is exactly the opposite
of all reflection, an impetuous, blind impulse, an exceedingly
pleasurable sensation. This opposition is closely related to the
infinite contrast, which is shown above, between the absolute
facility with which nature produces its works, together with the
correspondingly boundless carelessness with which it abandons
them to destruction, and the incalculably ingenious and studied
construction of these very works, judging from which they must
have been infinitely difficult to make, and their maintenance
should have been provided for with all conceivable care; while
we have the opposite before our eyes. If now by this certainly
very unusual consideration, we have brought together in the
boldest manner the two heterogeneous sides of the world, and, as it were, grasped them with one hand, we must now hold them
fast in order to convince ourselves of the entire invalidity of the
laws of the phenomenon, or the world as idea, for that of will, or
the thing in itself. Then it will become more comprehensible to
us that while on the side of the idea, that is, in the phenomenal[294]
world, there exhibits itself to us now an arising out of nothing,
and now an entire annihilation of what has arisen, from that
other side, or in itself, a nature lies before us with reference
to which the conceptions of arising and passing away have no
significance. For, by going back to the root, where, by means
of self-consciousness, the phenomenon and the thing in itself
meet, we have just, as it were, palpably apprehended that the two
are absolutely incommensurable, and the whole manner of being
of the one, together with all the fundamental laws of its being,
signify nothing, and less than nothing, in the other. I believe that
this last consideration will only be rightly understood by a few,
and that it will be displeasing and even offensive to all who do
not understand it, but I shall never on this account omit anything
that can serve to illustrate my fundamental thought.

At the beginning of this chapter I have explained that the great
clinging to life, or rather fear of death, by no means springs from
knowledge, in which case it would be the result of the known
value of life; but that that fear of death has its root directly in the
will, out of the original nature of which it proceeds, in which it
is entirely without knowledge, and therefore blind will to live.
As we are allured into life by the wholly illusory inclination to
sensual pleasure, so we are retained in it by the fear of death,
which is certainly just as illusory. Both spring directly from the
will, which in itself is unconscious. If, on the contrary, man
were merely a knowing being, then death would necessarily be
to him not only indifferent, but even welcome. The reflection to
which we have here attained now teaches that what is affected
by death is merely the knowing consciousness, and the will, on
the other hand, because it is the thing in itself, which lies at the
287
foundation of every phenomenon, is free from all that depends
upon temporal determinations, thus is also imperishable. Its
striving towards existence and manifestation, from which the [295]
world results, is constantly satisfied, for this accompanies it as
the shadow accompanies the body, for it is merely the visibility
of its nature. That yet in us it fears death results from the fact
that here knowledge presents its existence to it as merely in the
individual phenomenon, whence the illusion arises that it will
perish with this, as my image in a mirror seems to be destroyed
along with it if the mirror is broken; this then, as contrary to its
original nature, which is a blind striving towards existence, fills
it with horror. From this now it follows that that in us which
alone is capable of fearing death, and also alone fears it, the
will, is not affected by it; and that, on the other hand, what is
affected by it and really perishes is that which from its nature is
capable of no fear, and in general of no desire or emotion, and is
therefore indifferent to being and not being, the mere subject of
knowledge, the intellect, whose existence consists in its relation
to the world of idea, i.e., the objective world, whose correlative
it is, and with whose existence its own is ultimately one. Thus,
although the individual consciousness does not survive death,
yet that survives it which alone struggles against it—the will.
This also explains the contradiction that from the standpoint of
knowledge philosophers have always proved with cogent reasons
that death is no evil; yet the fear of death remains inevitable for
all, because it is rooted, not in knowledge, but in the will. It is
also a result of the fact that only the will, and not the intellect,
is indestructible, that all religions and philosophies promise a
reward in eternity only to the virtues of the will, or heart, not to
those of the intellect, or head.

The following may also serve to illustrate this consideration.
The will, which constitutes our true being, is of a simple nature;
it merely wills, and does not know. The subject of knowledge,
on the other hand, is a secondary phenomenon, arising from the
288 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
objectification of the will; it is the point of unity of the sensibility[296]
of the nervous system, as it were the focus in which the rays of
the activity of all the parts of the brain unite. With this, then, it
must perish. In self-consciousness, as that which alone knows, it
stands over against the will as its spectator, and, although sprung
from it, knows it as something different from itself, something
foreign to it, and consequently also only empirically, in time, by
degrees, in its successive excitements and acts, and also learns
its decisions only a posteriori, and often very indirectly. This
explains the fact that our own nature is a riddle to us, i.e., to our
intellect, and that the individual regards itself as having newly
arisen and as perishable; although its true nature is independent
of time, thus is eternal. As now the will does not know, so
conversely the intellect, or the subject of knowledge, is simply
and solely knowing, without ever willing. This can be proved
even physically in the fact that, as was already mentioned in the
second book, according to Bichat, the various emotions directly
affect all parts of the organism and disturb their functions, with
the exception of the brain, which can only be affected by them
very indirectly, i.e., just in consequence of those disturbances
(De la vie et de la mort, art. 6, § 2). But from this it follows
that the subject of knowledge, for itself and as such, cannot take
part or interest in anything, but for it the being or not being of
everything, nay, even of its own self, is a matter of indifference.
Now why should this purely neutral being be immortal? It ends
with the temporal manifestation of the will, i.e., the individual,
as it arose with it. It is the lantern which is extinguished when
it has served its end. The intellect, like the perceptible world
which exists only in it, is a mere phenomenon; but the finiteness
of both does not affect that of which they are the phenomenal
appearance. The intellect is the function of the cerebral nervous
system; but the latter, like the rest of the body, is the objectivity
of the will. Therefore the intellect depends upon the somatic[297]
life of the organism; but this itself depends upon the will. 

The organised body may thus, in a certain sense, be regarded as
the link between the will and the intellect; although really it is
only the will itself exhibiting itself spatially in the perception
of the intellect. Death and birth are the constant renewal of
the consciousness of the will, in itself without end and without
beginning, which alone is, as it were, the substance of existence
(but each such renewal brings a new possibility of the denial
of the will to live). Consciousness is the life of the subject of
knowledge, or the brain, and death is its end. And therefore,
finally, consciousness is always new, in each case beginning at
the beginning. The will alone is permanent; and, moreover, it is
it alone that permanence concerns; for it is the will to live. The
knowing subject for itself is not concerned about anything. In the
ego, however, the two are bound up together. In every animal
existence the will has achieved an intellect which is the light by
which it here pursues its ends. It may be remarked by the way
that the fear of death may also partly depend upon the fact that
the individual will is so loath to separate from the intellect which
has fallen to its lot through the course of nature, its guide and
guard, without which it knows that it is helpless and blind.
Finally, this explanation also agrees with the commonplace
moral experience which teaches us that the will alone is real,
while its objects, on the other hand, as conditioned by knowledge,
are only phenomena, are only froth and vapour, like the wine
which Mephistopheles provided in Auerbach's cellar: after every
sensuous pleasure we also say, “And yet it seemed as I were
drinking wine.”
The terrors of death depend for the most part upon the false
illusion that now the ego vanishes and the world remains. But
rather is the opposite the case; the world vanishes, but the inmost
kernel of the ego, the supporter and producer of that subject, in [298]
whose idea alone the world has its existence, remains. With the
brain the intellect perishes, and with the intellect the objective
world, its mere idea. That in other brains, afterwards as before, a similar world lives and moves is, with reference to the intellect
which perishes, a matter of indifference. If, therefore, reality
proper did not lie in the will, and if the moral existence were
not that which extends beyond death, then, since the intellect,
and with it its world, is extinguished, the true nature of things in
general would be no more than an endless succession of short and
troubled dreams, without connection among themselves; for the
permanence of unconscious nature consists merely in the idea of
time of conscious nature. Thus a world-spirit dreaming without
end or aim, dreams which for the most part are very troubled and
heavy, would then be all in all.

When, now, an individual experiences the fear of death, we
have really before us the extraordinary, nay, absurd, spectacle of
the lord of the worlds, who fills all with his being, and through
whom alone everything that is has its existence, desponding and
afraid of perishing, of sinking into the abyss of eternal nothing-
ness;—while, in truth, all is full of him, and there is no place
where he is not, no being in which he does not live; for it is
not existence that supports him, but he that supports existence.
Yet it is he who desponds in the individual who suffers from
the fear of death, for he is exposed to the illusion produced by
the principium individuationis that his existence is limited to the
nature which is now dying. This illusion belongs to the heavy
dream into which, as the will to live, he has fallen. But one might
say to the dying individual: “Thou ceasest to be something which
thou hadst done better never to become.”
So long as no denial of the will takes place, what death leaves
untouched is the germ and kernel of quite another existence, in
which a new individual finds itself again, so fresh and original[299]
that it broods over itself in astonishment. What sleep is for the
individual, death is for the will as thing in itself. It would not
endure to continue the same actions and sufferings throughout an
eternity without true gain, if memory and individuality remained
to it. It flings them off, and this is lethe; and through this sleep of death it reappears refreshed and fitted out with another intellect,
as a new being—“a new day tempts to new shores.”

As the self-asserting will to live man has the root of his
existence in the species. Accordingly death is the loss of one individuality and the assumption of another, consequently a change
of individuality under the exclusive guidance of one's own will.
For in this alone lies the eternal power which could produce its
existence with its ego, yet, on account of its nature, was not able
to maintain it in existence. For death is the démenti which the
essence (essentia) of every one receives in its claim to existence
(existentia), the appearance of a contradiction which lies in every
individual existence:
“For all that arises
Is worthy of being destroyed.”

But an infinite number of such existences, each with its ego,
stands within reach of this power, thus of the will, which, howev-
er, will again prove just as transitory and perishable. Since now
every ego has its separate consciousness, that infinite number of
them is, with reference to such an ego, not different from a single
one. From this point of view it appears to me not accidental that
ævum, ±0…Ω, signifies both the individual term of life and infinite
time. Indeed from this point of view it may be seen, although
indistinctly, that ultimately and in themselves both are the same;
and according to this there would really be no difference whether
I existed only through my term of life or for an infinite time.
Certainly, however, we cannot obtain an idea of all that is said [300]
above entirely without time-concepts; yet when we are dealing
with the thing in itself these ought to be excluded. But it belongs
to the unalterable limitations of our intellect that it can never
entirely cast off this first and most immediate form of all its
ideas, in order to operate without it. 

Therefore we certainly come
here upon a kind of metempsychosis, although with the important difference that it does not concern the whole »≈«∑, not the knowing being, but the will alone; and thus, with the conscious-
ness that the form of time only enters here as an unavoidable
concession to the limitation of our intellect, so many absurdities
which accompany the doctrine of metempsychosis disappear. If,
indeed, we now call in the assistance of the fact, to be explained
in chapter 43, that the character, i.e., the will, is inherited from
the father, and the intellect, on the other hand, from the mother,
it agrees very well with our view that the will of a man, in itself
individual, separated itself in death from the intellect received
from the mother in generation, and in accordance with its now
modified nature, under the guidance of the absolutely necessary
course of the world harmonising with this, received through a
new generation a new intellect, with which it became a new
being, which had no recollection of an earlier existence; for the
intellect, which alone has the faculty of memory, is the mortal
part or the form, while the will is the eternal part, the substance.
In accordance with this, this doctrine is more correctly denoted by
the word palingenesis than by metempsychosis. These constant
new births, then, constitute the succession of the life-dreams
of a will which in itself is indestructible, until, instructed and
improved by so much and such various successive knowledge in
a constantly new form, it abolishes or abrogates itself.
The true and, so to speak, esoteric doctrine of Buddhism,
as we have come to know it through the latest investigations,
also agrees with this view, for it teaches not metempsychosis,
but a peculiar palingenesis, resting upon a moral basis which[301]
it works out and explains with great profundity. This may be
seen from the exposition of the subject, well worth reading and
pondering, which is given in Spence Hardy's “Manual of Bud-
dhism,” pp. 394-96 (with which compare pp. 429, 440, and 445
of the same book), the confirmation of which is to be found in
Taylor's “Prabodh Chandro Daya,” London, 1812, p. 35; also
in Sangermano's “Burmese Empire,” p. 6, and in the “Asiatic
Researches,” vol. vi. p. 179, and vol. ix. p. 256. The very useful

German compendium of Buddhism by Köppen is also right upon
this point. Yet for the great mass of Buddhists this doctrine is too
subtle; therefore to them simple metempsychosis is preached as
a comprehensible substitute.

Besides, it must not be neglected that even empirical grounds
support a palingenesis of this kind. As a matter of fact there
does exist a connection between the birth of the newly appearing
beings and the death of those that are worn out. It shows itself
in the great fruitfulness of the human race which appears as a
consequence of devastating diseases. When in the fourteenth
century the black death had for the most part depopulated the
old world, a quite abnormal fruitfulness appeared among the
human race, and twin-births were very frequent. The circum-
stance was also very remarkable that none of the children born
at this time obtained their full number of teeth; thus nature,
exerting itself to the utmost, was niggardly in details. This is
related by F. Schnurrer, “Chronik der Seuchen,” 1825. Casper
also, “Ueber die wahrscheinliche Lebensdauer des Menschen,”
1835, confirms the principle that the number of births in a given
population has the most decided influence upon the length of life
and mortality in it, as this always keeps pace with the mortality:
so that always and everywhere the deaths and the births increase
and decrease in like proportion; which he places beyond doubt
by an accumulation of evidence collected from many lands and
their various provinces. And yet it is impossible that there can [302]
be a physical causal connection between my early death and the
fruitfulness of a marriage with which I have nothing to do, or
conversely. Thus here the metaphysical appears undeniably and
in a stupendous manner as the immediate ground of explanation
of the physical. Every new-born being indeed comes fresh and
blithe into the new existence, and enjoys it as a free gift: but
there is, and can be, nothing freely given. Its fresh existence is
paid for by the old age and death of a worn-out existence which
has perished, but which contained the indestructible seed out of which this new existence has arisen: they are one being. To show
the bridge between the two would certainly be the solution of a
great riddle.

The great truth which is expressed here has never been en-
tirely unacknowledged, although it could not be reduced to its
exact and correct meaning, which is only possible through the
doctrine of the primacy and metaphysical nature of the will and
the secondary, merely organic nature of the intellect. We find
the doctrine of metempsychosis, springing from the earliest and
noblest ages of the human race, always spread abroad in the
earth as the belief of the great majority of mankind, nay, really
as the teaching of all religions, with the exception of that of
the Jews and the two which have proceeded from it: in the
most subtle form, however, and coming nearest to the truth, as
has already been mentioned, in Buddhism. Accordingly, while
Christians console themselves with the thought of meeting again
in another world, in which one regains one's complete personality
and knows oneself at once, in those other religions the meeting
again is already going on now, only incognito. In the succession
of births, and by virtue of metempsychosis or palingenesis, the
persons who now stand in close connection or contact with us
will also be born along with us at the next birth, and will have the
same or analogous relations and sentiments towards us as now,
whether these are of a friendly or a hostile description. (Cf.,[303]
for example, Spence Hardy's “Manual of Buddhism,” p. 162.)
Recognition is certainly here limited to an obscure intimation, a
reminiscence which cannot be brought to distinct consciousness,
and refers to an infinitely distant time;—with the exception, how-
ever, of Buddha himself, who has the prerogative of distinctly
knowing his own earlier births and those of others;—as this is
described in the “Jâtaka.” But, in fact, if at favourable moment
one contemplates, in a purely objective manner, the action of
men in reality; the intuitive conviction is forced upon one that
it not only is and remains constantly the same, according to the (Platonic) Idea, but also that the present generation, in its true
inner nature, is precisely and substantially identical with every
generation that has been before it. The question simply is in what
this true being consists. The answer which my doctrine gives to
this question is well known. The intuitive conviction referred to
may be conceived as arising from the fact that the multiplying-
glasses, time and space, lose for a moment their effect. With
reference to the universality of the belief in metempsychosis,
Obry says rightly, in his excellent book, “Du Nirvana Indien,”
p. 13: “Cette vieille croyance a fait le tour du monde, et était
tellement répandue dans la haute antiquité, qu'un docte Anglican l'avait jugée sans père, sans mère, et sans généalogie” (Ths.
Burnet, dans Beausobre, Hist. du Manichéisme, ii. p. 391).

Taught already in the "Vedas," as in all the sacred books of India,
metempsychosis is well known to be the kernel of Brahmanism
and Buddhism. It accordingly prevails at the present day in the
whole of non-Mohammedan Asia, thus among more than half
of the whole human race, as the firmest conviction, and with an
incredibly strong practical influence. It was also the belief of
the Egyptians (Herod., ii. 123), from whom it was received with
enthusiasm by Orpheus. Pythagoras, and Plato: the Pythagore-
ans, however, specially retained it. That it was also taught in the
mysteries of the Greeks undeniably follows from the ninth book [304]
of Plato's “Laws” (pp. 38 and 42, ed. Bip.) Nemesius indeed
(De nat. hom., c. 2) says: “öøπΩ∑ ºμΩ øPΩ ¿±Ωƒμ¬ ªª∑Ωμ¬,
ø1 ƒ∑Ω »≈«∑Ω ±∏±Ω±ƒøΩ ±¿ø∆∑Ω±ºμΩøπ, ƒ∑Ω ºμƒμΩ√…º±ƒ…√πΩ
¥ø≥º±ƒπ∂ø≈√π.” (Communiter igitur omnes Græci, qui animam
immortalem statuerunt, eam de uno corpore in aliud transferri
censuerunt.) The “Edda” also, especially in the “Völuspá,” teach-
es metempsychosis. Not less was it the foundation of the religion
of the Druids (Cæs. de bello Gall., vi.; A. Pictet, Le mystère
des Bardes de l'ile de Bretagne, 1856). Even a Mohammedan
sect in Hindostan, the Bohrahs, of which Colebrooke gives a
full account in the “Asiatic Researches,” vol. vii. p. 336 sqq.,
296 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
believes in metempsychosis, and accordingly refrains from all
animal food. Also among American Indians and negro tribes,
nay, even among the natives of Australia, traces of this belief are
found, as appears from a minute description given in the Times
of 29th January 1841 of the execution of two Australian savages
for arson and murder. It is said there: “The younger of the two
prisoners met his end with a dogged and a determined spirit, as
it appeared, of revenge; the only intelligible expressions made
use of conveyed an impression that he would rise up a ‘white
fellow,’ which it was considered strengthened his resolution.”
Also in a book by Ungewitter, “Der Welttheil Australien,” it is
related that the Papuas in Australia regarded the whites as their
own relations who had returned to the world. According to all
this, the belief in metempsychosis presents itself as the natural
conviction of man, whenever he reflects at all in an unprejudiced
manner. It would really be that which Kant falsely asserts of his
three pretended Ideas of the reason, a philosopheme natural to
human reason, which proceeds from its forms; and when it is not
found it must have been displaced by positive religious doctrines
coming from a different source. I have also remarked that it is at
once obvious to every one who hears of it for the first time. Let
any one only observe how earnestly Lessing defends it in the last[305]
seven paragraphs of his “Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts.”

Lichtenberg also says in his “Selbstcharacteristik:” “I cannot get
rid of the thought that I died before I was born.” Even the excessively empirical Hume says in his sceptical essay on immortality, p. 23: “The metempsychosis is therefore the only system of this
kind that philosophy can hearken to.”31 What resists this belief,
31 This posthumous essay is to be found in the “Essays on Suicide and the
Immortality of the Soul” by the late David Hume, Basil, 1799, sold by James
Decker. By this reprint at Bâle these two works of one of the greatest thinkers
and writers of England were rescued from destruction, when in their own land,
in consequence of the stupid and utterly contemptible bigotry which prevailed,
they had been suppressed through the influence of a powerful and insolent
priesthood, to the lasting shame of England. They are entirely passionless, which is spread over the whole human race and commends itself alike to the wise and to the vulgar, is Judaism, together with the
two religions which have sprung from it, because they teach the
creation of man out of nothing, and he has then the hard task
of linking on to this the belief in an endless existence a parte
post. They certainly have succeeded, with fire and sword, in
driving out of Europe and part of Asia that consoling primitive
belief of mankind; it is still doubtful for how long. Yet how
difficult this was is shown by the oldest Church histories. Most
of the heretics were attached to this primitive belief; for example,
Simonists, Basilidians, Valentinians, Marcionists, Gnostics, and
Manichæans. The Jews themselves have in part fallen into it,
as Tertullian and Justinus (in his dialogues) inform us. In the
Talmud it is related that Abel's soul passed into the body of
Seth, and then into that of Moses. Even the passage of the
Bible, Matt. xvi. 13-15, only obtains a rational meaning if we
understand it as spoken under the assumption of the dogma of
metempsychosis. Luke, it is true, who also has the passage (ix.
18-20), adds the words Aƒπ ¿¡ø∆∑ƒ∑¬ ƒπ¬ ƒ…Ω ±¡«±π…Ω ±Ωμ√ƒ√,
and thus attributes to the Jews the assumption that such an ancient prophet can rise again body and all, which, since they know
that he has already lain between six and seven hundred years in
his grave, and consequently has long since turned to dust, would
be a palpable absurdity. In Christianity, however, the doctrine
of original sin, i.e., the doctrine of punishment for the sins of
another individual, has taken the place of the transmigration of
souls and the expiation in this way of all the sins committed in
an earlier life. Both identify, and that with a moral tendency, the
existing man with one who has existed before; the transmigration
of souls does so directly, original sin indirectly.

Death is the great reprimand which the will to live, or more
especially the egoism, which is essential to this, receives through
the course of nature; and it may be conceived as a punishment
coldly rational investigations of the two subjects named.

for our existence.32 It is the painful loosing of the knot which
the act of generation had tied with sensual pleasure, the violent
destruction coming from without of the fundamental error of our
nature: the great disillusion. We are at bottom something that
ought not to be: therefore we cease to be. Egoism consists really
in the fact that man limits all reality to his own person, in that
he imagines that he lives in this alone and not in others. Death
teaches him better, for it destroys this person, so that the true
nature of man, which is his will, will henceforth live only in other
individuals; while his intellect, which itself belonged only to the
phenomenon, i.e., to the world as idea, and was merely the form
of the external world, also continues to exist in the condition of
being idea, i.e., in the objective being of things as such, thus also
only in the existence of what was hitherto the external world. His
whole ego thus lives from this time forth only in that which he had
hitherto regarded as non-ego: for the difference between external
and internal ceases. We call to mind here that the better man is[307]
he who makes the least difference between himself and others,
does not regard them as absolute non-ego, while for the bad man
this difference is great, nay, absolute. I have worked this out in
my prize essay on the foundation of morals. According to what
was said above, the degree in which death can be regarded as the
annihilation of the man is in proportion to this difference. But
if we start from the fact that the distinction of outside me and in
me, as a spatial distinction, is only founded in the phenomenon,
not in the thing in itself, thus is no absolutely real distinction,
then we shall see in the losing of our own individuality only
the loss of a phenomenon, thus only an apparent loss. However
much reality that distinction has in the empirical consciousness,
yet from the metaphysical standpoint the propositions, “I perish,
but the world endures,” and “The world perishes but I endure,”
are at bottom not really different.

32 Death says: Thou art the product of an act which should not have been;
therefore to expiate it thou must die.

But, besides all this, death is the great opportunity no longer to
be I;—to him who uses it. During life the will of man is without
freedom: his action takes place with necessity upon the basis
of his unalterable character in the chain of motives. But every
one remembers much that he has done, and on account of which
he is by no means satisfied with himself. If now he were to go
on living, he would go on acting in the same way, on account
of the unalterable nature of his character. Accordingly he must
cease to be what he is in order to be able to arise out of the
germ of his nature as a new and different being. Therefore death
looses these bonds; the will again becomes free; for freedom
lies in the Esse, not in the Operari. “Finditur nodus cordis,
dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes, ejusque opera evanescunt,” is
a very celebrated saying of the Vedas, which all Vedantic writers
frequently repeat.33 Death is the moment of that deliverance from
the one-sidedness of an individuality which does not constitute [308]
the inmost kernel of our being, but is rather to be thought of as
a kind of aberration of it. The true original freedom re-enters
at this moment, which, in the sense indicated, may be regarded
as a restitutio in integrum. The peace and quietness upon the
countenance of most dead persons seems to have its origin in this.
Quiet and easy is, as a rule, the death of every good man: but to
die willingly, to die gladly, to die joyfully, is the prerogative of
the resigned, of him who surrenders and denies the will to live.
For only he wills to die really, and not merely apparently, and
consequently he needs and desires no continuance of his person.
The existence which we know he willingly gives up: what he
gets instead of it is in our eyes nothing, because our existence
is, with reference to that, nothing. The Buddhist faith calls it
Nirvana,34 i.e., extinction.
33 Sancara, s. de theologumenis Vedanticorum, ed. F. H. H. Windischmann,
p. 37; “Oupnekhat,” vol. i. p. 387 et p. 78; Colebrooke's “Miscellaneous
Essays,” vol. i. p. 363.
34 The etymology of the word Nirvana is variously given. According to
300 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
[309]
Colebrooke (“Transact. of the Royal Asiat. Soc.,” vol. i. p. 566) it comes from
va, “to blow,” like the wind, and the prefixed negative nir, and thus signifies a
calm, but as an adjective “extinguished.” Obry, also, Du Nirvana Indien, p. 3,
says: “Nirvanam en sanscrit signifie à la lettre extinction, telle que celle d'un
feu.” According to the “Asiatic Journal,” vol. xxiv. p. 735, the word is really
Neravana, from nera, “without,” and vana, “life,” and the meaning would be
annihilatio. In “Eastern Monachism,” by Spence Hardy, p. 295, Nirvana is
derived from vana, “sinful desires,” with the negative nir. J. J. Schmidt, in his
translation of the history of the Eastern Mongolians, says that the Sanscrit word
Nirvana is translated into Mongolian by a phrase which signifies “departed
from misery,” “escaped from misery.” According to the learned lectures of
the same in the St. Petersburg Academy, Nirvana is the opposite of Sanfara,
which is the world of constant re-birth, of longings and desires, of illusion
of the senses and changing forms, of being born, growing old, becoming
sick, and dying. In the Burmese language the word Nirvana, according to
the analogy of other Sanscrit words, becomes transformed into Nieban, and
is translated by “complete vanishing.” See Sangermano's “Description of the
Burmese Empire,” translated by Tandy, Rome, 1833, § 27. In the first edition
of 1819 I also wrote Nieban, because we then knew Buddhism only from
meagre accounts of the Burmese.
