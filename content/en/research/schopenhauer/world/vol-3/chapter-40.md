Chapter XL. Preface.
The supplements to this fourth book would be very considerable
if it were not that two of its principal subjects which stand
specially in need of being supplemented—the freedom of the
will and the foundation of ethics—have, on the occasion of prize
questions being set by two Scandinavian Academies, been fully
worked out by me in the form of a monograph, which was laid
before the public in the year 1841 under the title, “The Two
Fundamental Problems of Ethics.” Accordingly I assume an ac-
quaintance on the part of my readers with the work which has just
been mentioned, just as unconditionally as in the supplements to
the second book I have assumed it with regard to the work “On
the Will in Nature.” In general I make the demand that whoever
wishes to make himself acquainted with my philosophy shall read
every line of me. For I am no voluminous writer, no fabricator
of compendiums, no earner of pecuniary rewards, not one whose
writings aim at the approbation of a minister; in a word, not one
whose pen is under the influence of personal ends. I strive after
nothing but the truth, and write as the ancients wrote, with the
sole intention of preserving my thoughts, so that they may be
for the benefit of those who understand how to meditate upon
them and prize them. Therefore I have written little, but that [248]
little with reflection and at long intervals, and accordingly I have
also confined within the smallest possible limits those repetitions
which in philosophical works are sometimes unavoidable on
account of the connection, and from which no single philosopher
is free; so that by far the most of what I have to say is only to
be found in one place. On this account, then, whoever wishes to
learn from me and understand me must leave nothing unread that
I have written. Yet one can judge me and criticise me without
this, as experience has shown; and to this also I further wish
much pleasure.
242 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
Meanwhile the space gained by the said elimination of two
important subjects will be very welcome to us. For since those
explanations, which every man has more at heart than anything
else, and which therefore in every system, as ultimate results,
form the apex of its pyramid, are also crowded together in my
last book, a larger space will gladly be granted to every firmer
proof or more accurate account of these. Besides this we have
been able to discuss here, as belonging to the doctrine of the
“assertion of the will to live,” a question which in our fourth
book itself remained untouched, as it was also entirely neglected
by all philosophers before me: it is the inner significance and real
nature of the sexual love, which sometimes rises to a vehement
passion—a subject which it would not have been paradoxical to
take up in the ethical part of philosophy if its importance had
been known.

Chapter XLI.27 On Death And Its Relation
To The Indestructibility Of Our True
Nature.
Death is the true inspiring genius, or the muse of philosophy,
wherefore Socrates has defined the latter as ∏±Ω±ƒø≈ ºμªμƒ∑. In-
deed without death men would scarcely philosophise. Therefore
it will be quite in order that a special consideration of this should
have its place here at the beginning of the last, most serious, and
most important of our books.
The brute lives without a proper knowledge of death; therefore
the individual brute enjoys directly the absolute imperishableness
of the species, for it is only conscious of itself as endless. In the
case of men the terrifying certainty of death necessarily entered
with reason. But as everywhere in nature with every evil a means
of cure, or at least some compensation, is given, the same reflec-
tion which introduces the knowledge of death also assists us to
metaphysical points of view, which comfort us concerning it, and
of which the brute has no need and is incapable. All religious and
philosophical systems are principally directed to this end, and
are thus primarily the antidote to the certainty of death, which the
reflective reason produces out of its own means. Yet the degree
in which they attain this end is very different, and certainly one
religion or philosophy will, far more than the others, enable men
to look death in the face with a quiet glance. Brahmanism and [250]
Buddhism, which teach man to regard himself as himself, the
original being, the Brahm, to which all coming into being and
passing away is essentially foreign, will achieve much more in
this respect than such as teach that man is made out of nothing,
and actually begins at birth his existence derived from another.
Answering to this we find in India a confidence and a contempt
27 This chapter is connected with § 54 of the first volume.
244 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
for death of which one has no conception in Europe. It is, in
fact, a hazardous thing to force upon a man, by early imprinting
them, weak and untenable conceptions in this important regard,
and thereby making him for ever incapable of taking up correct
and stable ones. For example, to teach him that he recently came
out of nothing, and consequently through an eternity has been
nothing, but yet for the future will be imperishable, is just the
same as to teach him that although he is through and through
the work of another, yet he will be held responsible through
all eternity for his actions. If, then, when the mind ripens and
reflection appears, the untenable nature of such doctrines forces
itself upon him, he has nothing better to put in its place, nay,
is no longer capable of understanding anything better, and thus
loses the comfort which nature had destined for him also, as a
compensation for the certainty of death. In consequence of such
a process, we see even now in England (1844), among ruined
factory hands, the Socialists, and in Germany, among ruined
students, the young Hegelians, sink to the absolutely physical
point of view, which leads to the result: edite, bibite, post mortem
nulla voluptas, and so far may be defined as bestialism.
However, after all that has been taught concerning death, it
cannot be denied that, at least in Europe, the opinion of men,
nay, often even of the same individual, very frequently vacillates
between the conception of death as absolute annihilation and the
assumption that we are, as it were, with skin and hair, immortal.
Both are equally false: but we have not so much to find a correct
mean as rather to gain the higher point of view from which such[251]
notions disappear of themselves.
In these considerations I shall first of all start from the purely
empirical standpoint. Here there primarily lies before us the
undeniable fact that, according to the natural consciousness, man
not only fears death for his own person more than anything else,
but also weeps violently over the death of those that belong to
him, and indeed clearly not egotistically, for his own loss, but
245
out of sympathy for the great misfortune that has befallen them.
Therefore he also censures those who in such a case neither weep
nor show sadness as hard-hearted and unloving. It is parallel
with this that revenge, in its highest degree, seeks the death of
the adversary as the greatest evil that can be inflicted. Opinions
change with time and place; but the voice of nature remains
always and everywhere the same, and is therefore to be heeded
before everything else. Now here it seems distinctly to say that
death is a great evil. In the language of nature death means
annihilation. And that death is a serious matter may be concluded
from the fact that, as every one knows, life is no joke. We must
indeed deserve nothing better than these two.
In fact, the fear of death is independent of all knowledge; for
the brute has it, although it does not know death. Everything that
is born brings it with it into the world. But this fear of death is
a priori only the reverse side of the will to live, which indeed
we all are. Therefore in every brute the fear of its destruction
is inborn, like the care for its maintenance. Thus it is the fear
of death, and not the mere avoidance of pain, which shows
itself in the anxious carefulness with which the brute seeks to
protect itself, and still more its brood, from everything that might
become dangerous. Why does the brute flee, trembling, and seek
to conceal itself? Because it is simply the will to live, but, as
such, is forfeited to death, and wishes to gain time. Such also, by
nature, is man. The greatest evil, the worst that can anywhere [252]
threaten, is death; the greatest fear is the fear of death. Nothing
excites us so irresistibly to the most lively interest as danger to
the life of others; nothing is so shocking as an execution. Now
the boundless attachment to life which appears here cannot have
sprung from knowledge and reflection; to these it rather appears
foolish, for the objective worth of life is very uncertain, and at
least it remains doubtful whether it is preferable to not being,
nay, if experience and reflection come to be expressed, not being
must certainly win. If one knocked on the graves, and asked the
246 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
dead whether they wished to rise again, they would shake their
heads. Such is the opinion of Socrates in “Plato's Apology,” and
even the gay and amiable Voltaire cannot help saying, “On aime
la vie; mais le néant ne laisse pas d'avoir du bon;” and again,
“Je ne sais pas ce que c'est que la vie éternelle, mais celle-ci
est une mauvaise plaisanterie.” Besides, life must in any case
soon end; so that the few years which perhaps one has yet to
be vanish entirely before the endless time when one will be no
more. Accordingly it appears to reflection even ludicrous to be
so anxious about this span of time, to tremble so much if our
own life or that of another is in danger, and to compose tragedies
the horror of which has its strength in the fear of death. That
powerful attachment to life is therefore irrational and blind; it
can only be explained from the fact that our whole inner nature
is itself will to live, to which, therefore, life must appear as
the highest good, however embittered, short, and uncertain it
may always be; and that that will, in itself and originally, is
unconscious and blind. Knowledge, on the contrary, far from
being the source of that attachment to life, even works against
it, for it discloses the worthlessness of life, and thus combats the
fear of death. When it conquers, and accordingly the man faces
death courageously and composedly, this is honoured as great
and noble, thus we hail then the triumph of knowledge over the
blind will to live, which is yet the kernel of our own being. In[253]
the same way we despise him in whom knowledge is defeated
in that conflict, and who therefore clings unconditionally to life,
struggles to the utmost against approaching death, and receives
it with despair;28 and yet in him it is only the most original
being of ourselves and of nature that expresses itself. We may
here ask, in passing, how could this boundless love of life and
endeavour to maintain it in every way as long as possible be
28 In gladiatoriis pugnis timidos et supplices, et, ut vivere liceat, obsecrantes
etiam odisse solemus; fortes et animosos, et se acriter ipsos morti offerentes
servare cupimus (Cic. pro Milone, c. 34).
247
regarded as base, contemptible, and by the adherents of every
religion as unworthy of this, if it were the gift of good gods, to be
recognised with thankfulness? And how could it then seem great
and noble to esteem it lightly? Meanwhile, what is confirmed by
these considerations is—(1.) that the will to live is the inmost
nature of man; (2.) that in itself it is unconscious and blind; (3.)
that knowledge is an adventitious principle, which is originally
foreign to the will; (4.) that knowledge conflicts with the will,
and that our judgment applauds the victory of knowledge over
the will.
If what makes death seem so terrible to us were the thought of
not being, we would necessarily think with equal horror of the
time when as yet we were not. For it is irrefutably certain that
not being after death cannot be different from not being before
birth, and consequently is also no more deplorable. A whole
eternity has run its course while as yet we were not, but that
by no means disturbs us. On the other hand, we find it hard,
nay, unendurable, that after the momentary intermezzo of an
ephemeral existence, a second eternity should follow in which
we shall no longer be. Should, then, this thirst for existence
have arisen because we have now tasted it and have found it so
delightful? As was already briefly explained above, certainly
not; far sooner could the experience gained have awakened an [254]
infinite longing for the lost paradise of non-existence. To the
hope, also, of the immortality of the soul there is always added
that of a “better world”—a sign that the present world is not
much good. Notwithstanding all this, the question as to our state
after death has certainly been discussed, in books and verbally,
ten thousand times oftener than the question as to our state before
birth. Yet theoretically the one is just as near at hand and as
fair a problem as the other; and besides, whoever had answered
the one would soon see to the bottom of the other. We have
fine declamations about how shocking it would be to think that
the mind of man, which embraces the world, and has so many
248 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
very excellent thoughts, should sink with him into the grave;
but we hear nothing about this mind having allowed a whole
eternity to pass before it came into being with these its qualities,
and how the world must have had to do without it all that time.
Yet no question presents itself more naturally to knowledge,
uncorrupted by the will, than this: An infinite time has passed
before my birth; what was I during this time? Metaphysically,
it might perhaps be answered, “I was always I; that is, all who
during that time said I, were just I.” But let us look away from
this to our present entirely empirical point of view, and assume
that I did not exist at all. Then I can console myself as to the
infinite time after my death, when I shall not be, with the infinite
time when I already was not, as a well-accustomed, and indeed
very comfortable, state. For the eternity a parte post without me
can be just as little fearful as the eternity a parte ante without
me, since the two are distinguished by nothing except by the
interposition of an ephemeral dream of life. All proofs, also, for
continued existence after death may just as well be applied in
partem ante, where they then demonstrate existence before life,
in the assumption of which the Hindus and Buddhists therefore
show themselves very consistent. Kant's ideality of time alone[255]
solves all these riddles. But we are not speaking of that now.
This, however, results from what has been said, that to mourn for
the time when one will be no more is just as absurd as it would
be to mourn over the time when as yet one was not; for it is all
the same whether the time which our existence does not fill is
related to that which it does fill, as future or as past.
But, also, regarded entirely apart from these temporal con-
siderations, it is in and for itself absurd to look upon not being
as an evil; for every evil, as every good, presupposes existence,
nay, even consciousness: but the latter ceases with life, as also in
sleep and in a swoon; therefore the absence of it is well known
to us, and trusted, as containing no evil at all: its entrance, how-
ever, is always an affair of a moment. From this point of view
249
Epicurus considered death, and therefore quite rightly said, “A
∏±Ω±ƒø¬ º∑¥μΩ ¿¡ø¬ !º±¬” (Death does not concern us); with the
explanation that when we are death is not, and when death is we
are not (Diog. Laert., x. 27). To have lost what cannot be missed
is clearly no evil. Therefore ceasing to be ought to disturb us
as little as not having been. Accordingly from the standpoint of
knowledge there appears absolutely no reason to fear death. But
consciousness consists in knowing; therefore, for consciousness
death is no evil. Moreover, it is really not this knowing part of
our ego that fears death, but the fuga mortis proceeds entirely and
alone from the blind will, of which everything living is filled. To
this, however, as was already mentioned above, it is essential,
just because it is will to live, whose whole nature consists in
the effort after life and existence, and which is not originally
endowed with knowledge, but only in consequence of its objec-
tification in animal individuals. If now the will, by means of
knowledge, beholds death as the end of the phenomenon with
which it has identified itself, and to which, therefore, it sees itself
limited, its whole nature struggles against it with all its might.
Whether now it has really something to fear from death we will [256]
investigate further on, and will then remember the real source
of the fear of death, which has been shown here along with the
requisite distinction of the willing and the knowing part of our
nature.
Corresponding to this, then, what makes death so terrible to
us is not so much the end of life—for this can appear to no
one specially worthy of regret—but rather the destruction of the
organism; really because this is the will itself exhibiting itself
as body. But we only really feel this destruction in the evils of
disease or of old age; death itself, on the other hand, consists
for the subject only in the moment when consciousness vanishes
because the activity of the brain ceases. The extension of the
stoppage to all the other parts of the organism which follows
this is really already an event after death. Thus death, in a sub-
250 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
jective regard, concerns the consciousness alone. Now what the
vanishing of this may be every one can to a certain extent judge
of from going to sleep; but it is still better known to whoever
has really fainted, for in this the transition is not so gradual, nor
accompanied by dreams, but first the power of sight leaves us,
still fully conscious, and then immediately the most profound
unconsciousness enters; the sensation that accompanies it, so far
as it goes, is anything but disagreeable; and without doubt, as
sleep is the brother of death, so the swoon is its twin-brother.
Even violent death cannot be painful, for even severe wounds are
not felt at all till some time afterwards, often not till the outward
signs of them are observed. If they are rapidly mortal, conscious-
ness will vanish before this discovery; if they result in death later,
then it is the same as with other illnesses. All those also who have
lost consciousness in water, or from charcoal fumes, or through
hanging are well known to say that it happened without pain.
And now, finally, the death which is properly in accordance with
nature, death from old age, euthanasia, is a gradual vanishing and
sinking out of existence in an imperceptible manner. Little by[257]
little in old age, the passions and desires, with the susceptibility
for their objects, are extinguished; the emotions no longer find
anything to excite them; for the power of presenting ideas to the
mind always becomes weaker, its images fainter; the impressions
no longer cleave to us, but pass over without leaving a trace, the
days roll ever faster, events lose their significance, everything
grows pale. The old man stricken in years totters about or rests
in a corner now only a shadow, a ghost of his former self. What
remains there for death to destroy? One day a sleep is his last,
and his dreams are ——. They are the dreams which Hamlet
inquires after in the famous soliloquy. I believe we dream them
even now.
I have here also to remark that the maintenance of the life
process, although it has a metaphysical basis, does not go on
without resistance, and consequently not without effort. It is this
251
to which the organism yields every night, on account of which
it then suspends the brain function and diminishes certain secre-
tions, the respiration, the pulse, and the development of heat.
From this we may conclude that the entire ceasing of the life
process must be a wonderful relief to its motive force; perhaps
this has some share in the expression of sweet contentment on
the faces of most dead persons. In general the moment of death
may be like the moment of awaking from a heavy dream that has
oppressed us like a nightmare.
Up to this point the result we have arrived at is that death,
however much it may be feared, can yet really be no evil. But
often it even appears as a good thing, as something wished for,
as a friend. All that have met with insuperable obstacles to their
existence or their efforts, that suffer from incurable diseases or
inconsolable griefs, have as a last refuge, which generally opens
to them of its own accord, the return into the womb of nature,
from which they arose for a short time, enticed by the hope of
more favourable conditions of existence than have fallen to their [258]
lot, and the same path out of which constantly remains open.
That return is the cessio bonorum of life. Yet even here it is only
entered upon after a physical and moral conflict: so hard does
one struggle against returning to the place from which one came
out so lightly and readily, to an existence which has so much
suffering and so little pleasure to offer. The Hindus give the god
of death, Yama, two faces; one very fearful and terrible, and one
very cheerful and benevolent. This partly explains itself from the
reflections we have just made.
At the empirical point of view at which we still stand, the
following consideration is one which presents itself of its own
accord, and therefore deserves to be accurately defined by illus-
tration, and thereby referred to its proper limits. The sight of a
dead body shows me that sensibility, irritability, circulation of
the blood, reproduction, &c., have here ceased. I conclude from
this with certainty that what actuated these hitherto, which was
252 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
yet always something unknown to me, now actuates them no
longer, thus has departed from them. But if I should now wish
to add that this must have been just what I have known only
as consciousness, consequently as intelligence (soul), this would
be not only an unjustified but clearly a false conclusion. For
consciousness has always showed itself to me not as the cause,
but as the product and result of the organised life, for it rose
and sank in consequence of this in the different periods of life,
in health and sickness, in sleep, in a swoon, in awaking, &c.,
thus always appeared as effect, never as cause of the organised
life, always showed itself as something which arises and passes
away, and again arises, so long as the conditions of this still
exist, but not apart from them. Nay, I may also have seen that
the complete derangement of consciousness, madness, far from
dragging down with it and depressing the other forces, or indeed
endangering life, heightens these very much, especially irritabil-
ity or muscular force, and rather lengthens than shortens life, if[259]
other causes do not come in. Then, also: I knew individuality
as a quality of everything organised, and therefore, if this is a
self-conscious organism, also of consciousness. But there exists
no occasion now to conclude that individuality was inherent in
that vanished principle, which imparts life, and is completely
unknown to me; all the less so as I see that everywhere in nature
each particular phenomenon is the work of a general force which
is active in thousands of similar phenomena. But, on the other
hand, there is just as little occasion to conclude that because the
organised life has ceased here that force which hitherto actuated
it has also become nothing; as little as to infer the death of the
spinner from the stopping of the spinning-wheel. If a pendulum,
by finding its centre of gravity, at last comes to rest, and thus
its individual apparent life has ceased, no one will imagine that
gravitation is now annihilated; but every one comprehends that,
after as before, it is active in innumerable phenomena. Certainly
it might be urged against this comparison, that here also, in this
253
pendulum, gravitation has not ceased to be active, but only to
manifest its activity palpably; whoever insists on this may think,
instead, of an electrical body, in which, after its discharge, elec-
tricity has actually ceased to be active. I only wished to show in
this that we ourselves recognise in the lowest forces of nature an
eternity and ubiquity with regard to which the transitory nature
of their fleeting phenomena never makes us err for a moment.
So much the less, then, should it come into our mind to regard
the ceasing of life as the annihilation of the living principle, and
consequently death as the entire destruction of the man. Because
the strong arm which, three thousand years ago, bent the bow of
Ulysses is no more, no reflective and well-regulated understand-
ing will regard the force which acted so energetically in it as
entirely annihilated, and therefore, upon further reflection, will
also not assume that the force which bends the bow to-day first
began with this arm. The thought lies far nearer us, that the [260]
force which earlier actuated the life which now has vanished is
the same which is active in the life which now flourishes: nay,
this is almost inevitable. Certainly, however, we know that, as
was explained in the second book, only that is perishable which
is involved in the causal series; but only the states and forms
are so involved. On the other hand, untouched by the change
of these which is introduced by causes, there remain on the one
side matter, and on the other side natural forces: for both are the
presupposition of all these changes. But the principle of our life
we must, primarily at least, conceive as a force of nature, until
perhaps a more profound investigation has brought us to know
what it is in itself. Thus, taken simply as a force of nature, the
vital force remains entirely undisturbed by the change of forms
and states, which the bond of cause and effect introduces and
carries off again, and which alone are subject to the process
of coming into being and passing away, as it lies before us
in experience. Thus so far the imperishable nature of our true
being can be proved with certainty. But it is true this will not
254 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
satisfy the claims which are wont to be made upon proofs of our
continued existence after death, nor insure the consolation which
is expected from such proofs. However, it is always something;
and whoever fears death as an absolute annihilation cannot afford
to despise the perfect certainty that the inmost principle of his
life remains untouched by it. Nay, the paradox might be set up,
that that second thing also which, just like the forces of nature,
remains untouched by the continual change under the guidance
of causality, thus matter, by its absolute permanence, insures us
indestructibility, by virtue of which whoever was incapable of
comprehending any other might yet confidently trust in a certain
imperishableness. “What!” it will be said, “the permanence of the
mere dust, of the crude matter, is to be regarded as a continuance
of our being?” Oh! do you know this dust, then? Do you[261]
know what it is and what it can do? Learn to know it before
you despise it. This matter which now lies there as dust and
ashes will soon, dissolved in water, form itself as a crystal, will
shine as metal, will then emit electric sparks, will by means of
its galvanic intensity manifest a force which, decomposing the
closest combinations, reduces earths to metals; nay, it will, of
its own accord, form itself into plants and animals, and from its
mysterious womb develop that life for the loss of which you, in
your narrowness, are so painfully anxious. Is it, then, absolutely
nothing to continue to exist as such matter? Nay, I seriously
assert that even this permanence of matter affords evidence of the
indestructibility of our true nature, though only as in an image or
simile, or, rather, only as in outline. To see this we only need to
call to mind the explanation of matter given in chapter 24, from
which it resulted that mere formless matter—this basis of the
world of experience which is never perceived for itself alone, but
assumed as constantly remaining—is the immediate reflection,
the visibility in general, of the thing in itself, thus of the will.
Therefore, whatever absolutely pertains to the will as such holds
good also of matter, and it reflects the true eternal nature of the
255
will under the image of temporal imperishableness. Because, as
has been said, nature does not lie, no view which has sprung
from a purely objective comprehension of it, and been logically
thought out, can be absolutely false, but at the most only very
one-sided and imperfect. Such, however, is, indisputably, con-
sistent materialism; for instance, that of Epicurus, just as well as
the absolute idealism opposed to it, like that of Berkeley, and in
general every philosophical point of view which has proceeded
from a correct apperçu, and been honestly carried out. Only they
are all exceedingly one-sided comprehensions, and therefore, in
spite of their opposition, they are all true, each from a definite
point of view; but as soon as one has risen above this point of
view, then they only appear as relatively and conditionally true. [262]
The highest standpoint alone, from which one surveys them all
and knows them in their relative truth, but also beyond this, in
their falseness, can be that of absolute truth so far as this is in
general attainable. Accordingly we see, as was shown above,
that in the very crude, and therefore very old, point of view of
materialism proper the indestructibility of our true nature in itself
is represented, as by a mere shadow of it, the imperishableness of
matter; as in the already higher naturalism of an absolute physics
it is represented by the ubiquity and eternity of the natural forces,
among which the vital force is at least to be counted. Thus
even these crude points of view contain the assertion that the
living being suffers no absolute annihilation through death, but
continues to exist in and with the whole of nature.
The considerations which have brought us to this point, and to
which the further explanations link themselves on, started from
the remarkable fear of death which fills all living beings. But
now we will change the standpoint and consider how, in contrast
to the individual beings, the whole of nature bears itself with
reference to death. In doing this, however, we still always remain
upon the ground of experience.
Certainly we know no higher game of chance than that for
256 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
death and life. Every decision about this we watch with the
utmost excitement, interest, and fear; for in our eyes all in all
is at stake. On the other hand, nature, which never lies, but is
always straightforward and open, speaks quite differently upon
this theme, speaks like Krishna in the Bhagavadgita. What it
says is: The death or the life of the individual is of no signif-
icance. It expresses this by the fact that it exposes the life of
every brute, and even of man, to the most insignificant accidents
without coming to the rescue. Consider the insect on your path;
a slight, unconscious turning of your step is decisive as to its
life or death. Look at the wood-snail, without any means of
flight, of defence, of deception, of concealment, a ready prey[263]
for all. Look at the fish carelessly playing in the still open net;
the frog restrained by its laziness from the flight which might
save it; the bird that does not know of the falcon that soars
above it; the sheep which the wolf eyes and examines from
the thicket. All these, provided with little foresight, go about
guilelessly among the dangers that threaten their existence every
moment. Since now nature exposes its organisms, constructed
with such inimitable skill, not only to the predatory instincts of
the stronger, but also to the blindest chance, to the humour of
every fool, the mischievousness of every child without reserve,
it declares that the annihilation of these individuals is indifferent
to it, does it no harm, has no significance, and that in these cases
the effect is of no more importance than the cause. It says this
very distinctly, and it does not lie; only it makes no comments
on its utterances, but rather expresses them in the laconic style
of an oracle. If now the all-mother sends forth her children
without protection to a thousand threatening dangers, this can
only be because she knows that if they fall they fall back into
her womb, where they are safe; therefore their fall is a mere jest.
Nature does not act otherwise with man than with the brutes.
Therefore its declaration extends also to man: the life and death
of the individual are indifferent to it. Accordingly, in a certain
257
sense, they ought also to be indifferent to us, for we ourselves are
indeed nature. Certainly, if only we saw deep enough, we would
agree with nature, and regard life and death as indifferently as it
does. Meanwhile, by means of reflection, we must attribute that
carelessness and indifference of nature towards the life of the
individuals to the fact that the destruction of such a phenomenon
does not in the least affect its true and proper nature.
If we further ponder the fact, that not only, as we have just
seen, are life and death dependent upon the most trifling acci-
dents, but that the existence of the organised being in general is
an ephemeral one, that animal and plant arise to-day and pass [264]
away to-morrow, and birth and death follow in quick succession,
while to the unorganised things which stand so much lower an
incomparably longer duration is assured, and an infinite duration
to the absolutely formless matter alone, to which, indeed, we
attribute this a priori,—then, I think, the thought must follow of
its own accord, even from the purely empirical, but objective and
unprejudiced comprehension of such an order of things, that this
is only a superficial phenomenon, that such a constant arising
and passing away can by no means touch the root of things, but
can only be relative, nay, only apparent, in which the true inner
nature of that thing is not included, the nature which everywhere
evades our glance and is thoroughly mysterious, but rather that
this continues to exist undisturbed by it; although we can neither
apprehend nor conceive the manner in which this happens, and
must therefore think of it only generally as a kind of tour de
passe-passe which took place there. For that, while what is most
imperfect, the lowest, the unorganised, continues to exist unas-
sailed, it is just the most perfect beings, the living creatures, with
their infinitely complicated and inconceivably ingenious organ-
isations, which constantly arise, new from the very foundation,
and after a brief span of time absolutely pass into nothingness, to
make room for other new ones like them coming into existence
out of nothing—this is something so obviously absurd that it can
258 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
never be the true order of things, but rather a mere veil which
conceals this, or, more accurately, a phenomenon conditioned
by the nature of our intellect. Nay, the whole being and not
being itself of these individuals, in relation to which death and
life are opposites, can only be relative. Thus the language of
nature, in which it is given us as absolute, cannot be the true and
ultimate expression of the nature of things and of the order of the
world, but indeed only a patois du pays, i.e., something merely
relatively true,—something to be understood cum grano salis,[265]
or, to speak properly, something conditioned by our intellect; I
say, an immediate, intuitive conviction of the kind which I have
tried to describe in words will press itself upon every one; i.e.,
certainly only upon every one whose mind is not of an utterly
ordinary species, which is absolutely only capable of knowing
the particular simply and solely as such, which is strictly limited
to the knowledge of individuals, after the manner of the intellect
of the brutes. Whoever, on the other hand, by means of a capacity
of an only somewhat higher power, even just begins to see in
the individual beings their universal, their Ideas, will also, to
a certain extent, participate in that conviction, and that indeed
as an immediate, and therefore certain, conviction. In fact, it
is also only small, limited minds that fear death quite seriously
as their annihilation, and persons of decidedly superior capacity
are completely free from such terrors. Plato rightly bases the
whole of philosophy upon the knowledge of the doctrine of Ideas,
i.e., upon the perception of the universal in the particular. But
the conviction here described, which proceeds directly from the
comprehension of nature, must have been exceedingly vivid in
those sublime authors of the Upanishads of the Vedas, who can
scarcely be thought of as mere men, for it speaks to us so forcibly
out of an innumerable number of their utterances that we must
ascribe this immediate illumination of their mind to the fact that
these wise men, standing nearer the origin of our race in time,
comprehended the nature of things more clearly and profoundly
259
than the already deteriorated race, Aπøπ Ω≈Ω ≤¡øƒøπ μπ√πΩ, is able
to do. But certainly their comprehension is assisted by the natural
world of India, which is endowed with life in a very different
degree from our northern world. However, thorough reflection,
as pursued by Kant's great mind, leads by another path to the
same result, for it teaches us that our intellect, in which that
phenomenal world which changes so fast exhibits itself, does [266]
not comprehend the true ultimate nature of things, but merely
its phenomenal manifestation, and indeed, as I add, because it is
originally only destined to present the motives to our will, i.e., to
be serviceable to it in the pursuit of its paltry ends.
Let us, however, carry our objective and unprejudiced consid-
eration of nature still further. If I kill a living creature, whether
a dog, a bird, a frog, or even only an insect, it is really incon-
ceivable that this being, or rather the original force by virtue of
which such a marvellous phenomenon exhibited itself just the
moment before, in its full energy and love of life, should have
been annihilated by my wicked or thoughtless act. And again,
on the other hand, the millions of animals of every kind which
come into existence every moment, in infinite variety, full of
force and activity, can never, before the act of their generation,
have been nothing at all, and have attained from nothing to
an absolute beginning. If now in this way I see one of these
withdraw itself from my sight, without me knowing where it
goes, and another appear without me knowing whence it comes;
if, moreover, both have the same form, the same nature, the same
character, and only not the same matter, which yet during their
existence they continually throw off and renew; then certainly
the assumption, that that which vanishes and that which appears
in its place are one and the same, which has only experienced
a slight alteration, a renewal of the form of its existence, and
that consequently death is for the species what sleep is for the
individual; this assumption, I say, lies so close at hand that it
is impossible not to light upon it, unless the mind, perverted
260 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
in early youth by the imprinting of false views, hurries it out
of the way, even from a distance, with superstitious fear. But
the opposite assumption that the birth of an animal is an arising
out of nothing, and accordingly that its death is its absolute
annihilation, and this with the further addition that man, who has
also originated out of nothing, has yet an individual, endless[267]
existence, and indeed a conscious existence, while the dog, the
ape, the elephant, are annihilated by death, is really something
against which the healthy mind revolts and which it must regard
as absurd. If, as is sufficiently often repeated, the comparison of
the results of a system with the utterances of the healthy mind
is supposed to be a touchstone of its truth, I wish the adherents
of the system which was handed down from Descartes to the
pre-Kantian eclectics, nay, which even now is still the prevailing
view of the great majority of cultured people in Europe, would
apply this touchstone here.
Throughout and everywhere the true symbol of nature is the
circle, because it is the schema or type of recurrence. This is,
in fact, the most universal form in nature, which it carries out
in everything, from the course of the stars down to the death
and the genesis of organised beings, and by which alone, in the
ceaseless stream of time, and its content, a permanent existence,
i.e., a nature, becomes possible.
If in autumn we consider the little world of insects, and see
how one prepares its bed to sleep the long, rigid winter-sleep;
another spins its cocoon to pass the winter as a chrysalis, and
awake in spring rejuvenated and perfected; and, finally, how
most of them, intending themselves to rest in the arms of death,
merely arrange with care the suitable place for their egg, in order
to issue forth again from it some day renewed;—this is nature's
great doctrine of immortality, which seeks to teach us that there
is no radical difference between sleep and death, but the one
endangers existence just as little as the other. The care with
which the insect prepares a cell, or hole, or nest, deposits its egg
261
in it, together with food for the larva that will come out of it in
the following spring, and then quietly dies, is just like the care
with which in the evening a man lays ready his clothes and his
breakfast for the next morning, and then quietly goes to sleep;
and at bottom it could not take place at all if it were not that the [268]
insect which dies in autumn is in itself, and according to its true
nature, just as much identical with the one which is hatched out
in the spring as the man who lies down to sleep is identical with
the man who rises from it.
If now, after these considerations, we return to ourselves and
our own species, then cast our glance forward far into the future,
and seek to present to our minds the future generations, with the
millions of their individuals in the strange form of their customs
and pursuits, and then interpose with the question: Whence will
all these come? Where are they now? Where is the fertile womb
of that nothing, pregnant with worlds, which still conceals the
coming races? Would not the smiling and true answer to this
be, Where else should they be than there where alone the real
always was and will be, in the present and its content?—thus
with thee, the foolish questioner, who in this mistaking of his
own nature is like the leaf upon the tree, which, fading in autumn
and about to fall, complains at its destruction, and will not be
consoled by looking forward to the fresh green which will clothe
the tree in spring, but says lamenting, “I am not these! These are
quite different leaves!” Oh, foolish leaf! Whither wilt thou? And
whence should others come? Where is the nothing whose abyss
thou fearest? Know thine own nature, that which is so filled
with thirst for existence; recognise it in the inner, mysterious,
germinating force of the tree, which, constantly one and the same
in all generations of leaves, remains untouched by all arising and
passing away. And now, ø1∑ ¿μ¡ ∆≈ªª…Ω ≥μΩμ∑, ƒøπ∑¥μ ∫±π

the fly which now buzzes round me goes to sleep in the evening,
and buzzes again tomorrow, or dies in the evening, and in spring
262 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
another fly buzzes which has sprung from its egg: that is in itself
the same thing; but therefore the knowledge which exhibits this
as two fundamentally different things is not unconditioned, but[269]
relative, a knowledge of the phenomenon, not of the thing in
itself. In the morning the fly exists again; it also exists again in
the spring. What distinguishes for it the winter from the night? In
Burdach's “Physiology,” vol. i. § 275, we read, “Till ten o'clock
in the morning no Cercaria ephemera (one of the infusoria) is to
be seen (in the infusion), and at twelve the whole water swarms
with them. In the evening they die, and the next morning they
again appear anew.” So it was observed by Nitzsch six days
running.
So everything lingers but a moment, and hastens on to death.
The plant and the insect die at the end of the summer, the brute
and the man after a few years: death reaps unweariedly. Yet
notwithstanding this, nay, as if this were not so at all, every-
thing is always there and in its place, just as if everything were
imperishable. The plant always thrives and blooms, the insect
hums, the brute and the man exist in unwasted youth, and the
cherries that have already been enjoyed a thousand times we
have again before us every summer. The nations also exist as
immortal individuals, although sometimes their names change;
even their action, what they do and suffer, is always the same;
although history always pretends to relate something different:
for it is like the kaleidoscope, which at every turn shows a new
figure, while we really always have the same thing before our
eyes. What then presses itself more irresistibly upon us than the
thought that that arising and passing away does not concern the
real nature of things, but this remains untouched by it, thus is im-
perishable, and therefore all and each that wills to exist actually
exists continuously and without end. Accordingly at every given
point of time all species of animals, from the gnat to the elephant,
exist together complete. They have already renewed themselves
many thousand times, and withal have remained the same. They
263
know nothing of others like them, who have lived before them, [270]
or will live after them; it is the species which always lives, and
in the consciousness of the imperishable nature of the species
and their identity with it the individuals cheerfully exist. The
will to live manifests itself in an endless present, because this is
the form of the life of the species, which, therefore, never grows
old, but remains always young. Death is for it what sleep is for
the individual, or what winking is for the eye, by the absence of
which the Indian gods are known, if they appear in human form.
As through the entrance of night the world vanishes, but yet does
not for a moment cease to exist, so man and brute apparently
pass away through death, and yet their true nature continues, just
as undisturbed by it. Let us now think of that alternation of death
and birth as infinitely rapid vibrations, and we have before us
the enduring objectification of the will, the permanent Ideas of
being, fixed like the rainbow on the waterfall. This is temporal
immortality. In consequence of this, notwithstanding thousands
of years of death and decay, nothing has been lost, not an atom
of the matter, still less anything of the inner being, that exhibits
itself as nature. Therefore every moment we can cheerfully cry,
“In spite of time, death, and decay, we are still all together!”
Perhaps we would have to except whoever had once said from
the bottom of his heart, with regard to this game, “I want no
more.” But this is not yet the place to speak of this.
But we have certainly to draw attention to the fact that the
pain of birth and the bitterness of death are the two constant
conditions under which the will to live maintains itself in its
objectification, i.e., our inner nature, untouched by the course
of time and the death of races, exists in an everlasting present,
and enjoys the fruit of the assertion of the will to live. This is
analogous to the fact that we can only be awake during the day
on condition that we sleep during the night; indeed the latter is
the commentary which nature offers us for the understanding of [271]
264 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
that difficult passage.29
For the substratum, or the content, ¿ª∑¡…º±, or the material of
the present, is through all time really the same. The impossibility
of knowing this identity directly is just time, a form and limitation
of our intellect. That on account of it, for example, the future
event is not yet, depends upon an illusion of which we become
conscious when that event has come. That the essential form
of our intellect introduces such an illusion explains and justifies
itself from the fact that the intellect has come forth from the
hands of nature by no means for the apprehension of the nature
of things, but merely for the apprehension of motives, thus for
the service of an individual and temporal phenomenon of will.30
Whoever comprehends the reflections which here occupy us
will also understand the true meaning of the paradoxical doctrine
of the Eleatics, that there is no arising and passing away, but the
whole remains immovable: “†±¡ºμΩπ¥∑¬ ∫±π úμªπ√√ø¬ ±Ω√¡ø≈Ω

menides et Melissus ortum et interitum tollebant, quoniam nihil
moveri putabant), Stob. Ecl., i. 21. Light is also thrown here
upon the beautiful passage of Empedocles which Plutarch has
preserved for us in the book, “Adversus Coloten,” c. 12:—[272]
29 The suspension of the animal functions is sleep, that of the organic functions
is death.
30 There is only one present, and this is always: for it is the sole form of actual
existence. One must attain to the insight that the past is not in itself different
from the present, but only in our apprehension, which has time as its form, on
account of which alone the present exhibits itself as different from the past.
To assist this insight, imagine all the events and scenes of human life, bad
and good, fortunate and unfortunate, pleasing and terrible, as they successively
present themselves in the course of time and difference of places, in the most
checkered multifariousness and variety, as at once and together, and always
present in the Nunc stans, while it is only apparently that now this and now
that is; then what the objectification of the will to live really means will be
understood. Our pleasure also in genre painting depends principally upon the
fact that it fixes the fleeting scenes of life. The dogma of metempsychosis has
proceeded from the feeling of the truth which has just been expressed.

The very remarkable and, in its place, astonishing passage in
Diderot's “Jacques le fataliste,” deserves not less to be mentioned
here: “Un château immense, au frontispice duquel on lisait: ‹ Je
n'appartiens à personne, et j'appartiens à tout le monde: vous y
étiez avant que d'y entrer, vous y serez encore, quand vous en
sortirez ›.”
Certainly in the sense in which, when he is begotten, the man
arises out of nothing, he becomes nothing through death. But
really to learn to know this “nothing” would be very interesting;
for it only requires moderate acuteness to see that this empirical
nothing is by no means absolute, i.e., such as would in every
sense be nothing. We are already led to this insight by the
observation that all qualities of the parents recur in the children,
thus have overcome death. Of this, however, I will speak in a
special chapter.
There is no greater contrast than that between the ceaseless
flight of time, which carries its whole content with it, and the
rigid immobility of what is actually present, which at all times is
one and the same. And if from this point of view we watch in a
266 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
purely objective manner the immediate events of life, the Nunc
stans becomes clear and visible to us in the centre of the wheel of[273]
time. To the eye of a being of incomparably longer life, which at
one glance comprehended the human race in its whole duration,
the constant alternation of birth and death would present itself
as a continuous vibration, and accordingly it would not occur
to it at all to see in this an ever new arising out of nothing and
passing into nothing; but just as to our sight the quickly revolving
spark appears as a continuous circle, the rapidly vibrating spring
as a permanent triangle, the vibrating cord as a spindle, so to
this eye the species would appear as that which has being and
permanence, death and life as vibrations.
We will have false conceptions of the indestructibility of our
true nature by death, so long as we do not make up our minds to
study it primarily in the brutes, but claim for ourselves alone a
class apart from them, under the boastful name of immortality.
But it is this pretension alone, and the narrowness of view from
which it proceeds, on account of which most men struggle so
obstinately against the recognition of the obvious truth that we
are essentially, and in the chief respect, the same as the brutes;
nay, that they recoil at every hint of our relationship with these.
But it is this denial of the truth which more than anything else
closes against them the path to real knowledge of the indestruc-
tibility of our nature. For if we seek anything upon a wrong
path, we have just on that account forsaken the right path, and
upon the path we follow we will never attain to anything in the
end but late disillusion. Up, then, follow the truth, not according
to preconceived notions, but as nature leads! First of all, learn
to recognise in the aspect of every young animal the existence
of the species that never grows old, which, as a reflection of its
eternal youth, imparts to every individual a temporary youth, and
lets it come forth as new and fresh as if the world were of to-day.
Let one ask himself honestly whether the swallow of this year's
spring is absolutely a different one from the swallow of the first
267
spring, and whether really between the two the miracle of the [274]
creation out of nothing has repeated itself millions of times, in
order to work just as often into the hands of absolute annihilation.
I know well that if I seriously assured any one that the cat which
now plays in the yard is still the same one which made the same
springs and played the same tricks there three hundred years ago,
he would think I was mad; but I also know that it is much madder
to believe that the cat of to-day is through and through and in its
whole nature quite a different one from the cat of three hundred
years ago. One only requires truly and seriously to sink oneself
in the contemplation of one of these higher vertebrates in order to
become distinctly conscious that this unfathomable nature, taken
as a whole, as it exists there, cannot possibly become nothing;
and yet, on the other hand, one knows its transitoriness. This
depends upon the fact that in this animal the infinite nature of
its Idea (species) is imprinted in the finiteness of the individual.
For in a certain sense it is of course true that in the individual
we always have before us another being—in the sense which
depends upon the principle of sufficient reason, in which are
also included time and space, which constitute the principium
individuationis. But in another sense it is not true—in the sense
in which reality belongs to the permanent forms of things, the
Ideas alone, and which was so clearly evident to Plato that it
became his fundamental thought, the centre of his philosophy;
and he made the comprehension of it the criterion of capacity for
philosophising in general.
As the scattered drops of the roaring waterfall change with
lightning rapidity, while the rainbow, whose supporter they are,
remains immovably at rest, quite untouched by that ceaseless
change, so every Idea, i.e., every species of living creature re-
mains quite untouched by the continual change of its individuals.
But it is the Idea, or the species in which the will to live is
really rooted, and manifests itself; and therefore also the will [275]
is only truly concerned in the continuance of the species. For
268 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
example, the lions which are born and die are like the drops of
the waterfall; but the leonitas, the Idea or form of the lion, is like
the unshaken rainbow upon it. Therefore Plato attributed true
being to the Ideas alone, i.e., to the species; to the individuals
only a ceaseless arising and passing away. From the profound
consciousness of his imperishable nature really springs also the
confidence and peace of mind with which every brute, and even
human individual, moves unconcernedly along amid a host of
chances, which may annihilate it any moment, and, moreover,
moves straight on to death: out of its eyes, however, there shines
the peace of the species, which that death does not affect, and
does not concern. Even to man this peace could not be impart-
ed by uncertain and changing dogmas. But, as was said, the
contemplation of every animal teaches that death is no obstacle
to the kernel of life, to the will in its manifestation. What an
unfathomable mystery lies, then, in every animal! Look at the
nearest one; look at your dog, how cheerfully and peacefully he
lives! Many thousands of dogs have had to die before it came to
this one's turn to live. But the death of these thousands has not
affected the Idea of the dog; it has not been in the least disturbed
by all that dying. Therefore the dog exists as fresh and endowed
with primitive force as if this were its first day and none could
ever be its last; and out of its eyes there shines the indestructible
principle in it, the archæus. What, then, has died during those
thousands of years? Not the dog—it stands unscathed before us;
merely its shadow, its image in our form of knowledge, which
is bound to time. Yet how can one even believe that that passes
away which for ever and ever exists and fills all time? Certainly
the matter can be explained empirically; in proportion as death
destroyed the individuals, generation produced new ones. But
this empirical explanation is only an apparent explanation: it
puts one riddle in the place of the other. The metaphysical[276]
understanding of the matter, although not to be got so cheaply, is
yet the only true and satisfying one.
269
Kant, in his subjective procedure, brought to light the truth
that time cannot belong to the thing in itself, because it lies pre-
formed in our apprehension. Now death is the temporal end of
the temporal phenomenon; but as soon as we abstract time, there
is no longer any end, and this word has lost all significance. But
I, here upon the objective path, am trying to show the positive
side of the matter, that the thing in itself remains untouched by
time, and by that which is only possible through time, arising
and passing away, and that the phenomena in time could not
have even that ceaselessly fleeting existence which stands next
to nothingness, if there were not in them a kernel of the infinite.
Eternity is certainly a conception which has no perception as its
foundation; accordingly it has also a merely negative content; it
signifies a timeless existence. Time is yet merely an image of
eternity, A «¡øΩø¬ μ0∫…Ω ƒøΩ ±0…Ωø¬, as Plotinus has it; and in
the same way our temporal existence is a mere image of our true
nature. This must lie in eternity, just because time is only the
form of our knowledge; but on account of this alone do we know
our own existence, and that of all things as transitory, finite, and
subject to annihilation.
In the second book I have shown that the adequate objectivity
of the will as the thing in itself, at each of its grades, is the
(Platonic) Idea; similarly in the third book that the Ideas of
things have the pure subject of knowledge as their correlative;
consequently the knowledge of them only appears exceptionally
and temporarily under specially favourable conditions. For in-
dividual knowledge, on the other hand, thus in time, the Idea
presents itself under the form of the species, which is the Idea
broken up through its entrance into time. Therefore the species
is the most immediate objectification of the thing in itself, i.e., [277]
of the will to live. The inmost nature of every brute, and also
of man, accordingly lies in the species; thus the will to live,
which is so powerfully active, is rooted in this, not really in the
individual. On the other hand, in the individual alone lies the
270 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
immediate consciousness: accordingly it imagines itself different
from the species, and therefore fears death. The will to live
manifests itself in relation to the individual as hunger and the
fear of death: in relation to the species as sexual instinct and
passionate care for the offspring. In agreement with this we
find nature, which is free from that delusion of the individual,
as careful for the maintenance of the species as it is indifferent
to the destruction of the individuals: the latter are always only
means, the former is the end. Therefore a glaring contrast appears
between its niggardliness in the endowment of the individuals
and its prodigality when the species is concerned. In the latter
case from one individual are often annually obtained a hundred
thousand germs, and more; for example, from trees, fishes, crabs,
termites, and many others. In the former case, on the contrary,
only barely enough in the way of powers and organs is given to
each to enable it with ceaseless effort to maintain its life. And,
therefore, if an animal is injured or weakened it must, as a rule,
starve. And where an incidental saving was possible, through
the circumstance that one part could upon necessity be dispensed
with, it has been withheld, even out of order. Hence, for example,
many caterpillars are without eyes; the poor creatures grope in
the dark from leaf to leaf, which, since they lack feelers, they do
by moving three-fourths of their body back and forward in the air,
till they find some object. Hence they often miss their food which
is to be found close by. But this happens in consequence of the
lex parsimoniæ naturæ, to the expression of which natura nihil
facit supervacaneum one may add et nihil largitur. The same
tendency of nature shows itself also in the fact that the more fit[278]
the individual is, on account of his age, for the propagation of
the species, the more powerfully does the vis naturæ medicatrix
manifest itself in him, and therefore his wounds heal easily, and
he easily recovers from diseases. This diminishes along with the
power of generation, and sinks low after it is extinct; for now in
the eyes of nature the individual has become worthless.
271
If now we cast another glance at the scale of existences, with
the whole of their accompanying gradations of consciousness,
from the polyp up to man, we see this wonderful pyramid, kept
in ceaseless oscillation certainly by the constant death of the
individuals, yet by means of the bond of generation, enduring in
the species through the infinite course of time. While, then, as
was explained above, the objective, the species, presents itself
as indestructible, the subjective, which consists merely in the
self-consciousness of these beings, seems to be of the shortest
duration, and to be unceasingly destroyed, in order, just as often,
to come forth again from nothing in an incomprehensible man-
ner. But, indeed, one must be very short-sighted to let oneself
be deceived by this appearance, and not to comprehend that,
although the form of temporal permanence only belongs to the
objective, the subjective, i.e., the will, which lives and manifests
itself in all, and with it the subject of the knowledge in which
all exhibits itself, must be not less indestructible; because the
permanence of the objective, or external, can yet only be the
phenomenal appearance of the indestructibility of the subjective
or internal; for the former can possess nothing which it has not
received on loan from the latter; and cannot be essentially and
originally an objective, a phenomenon, and then secondarily and
accidentally a subjective, a thing in itself, a self-consciousness.
For clearly the former as a manifestation presupposes something
which manifests itself, as being for other presupposes a being
for self, and as object presupposes a subject; and not conversely:
because everywhere the root of things must lie in that which [279]
they are for themselves, thus in the subjective, not in the ob-
jective, i.e., in that which they are only for others, in a foreign
consciousness. Accordingly we found in the first book that the
right starting-point for philosophy is essentially and necessarily
the subjective, i.e., the idealistic starting-point; and also that the
opposite starting-point, that which proceeds from the objective,
leads to materialism. At bottom, however, we are far more one
272 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
with the world than we commonly suppose: its inner nature is
our will, its phenomenal appearance is our idea. For any one
who could bring this unity of being to distinct consciousness, the
difference between the continuance of the external world after
his death and his own continuance after death would vanish. The
two would present themselves to him as one and the same; nay,
he would laugh at the delusion that could separate them. For
the understanding of the indestructibility of our nature coincides
with that of the identity of the macrocosm and the microcosm.
Meanwhile one may obtain light upon what is said here by a
peculiar experiment, performed by means of the imagination, an
experiment which might be called metaphysical. Let any one try
to present vividly to his mind the time, in any case not far distant,
when he will be dead. Then he thinks himself away and lets the
world go on existing; but soon, to his own astonishment, he will
discover that he was nevertheless still there. For he intended to
present the world to his mind without himself; but the ego is the
immediate element in consciousness, through which alone the
world is brought about, and for which alone it exists. This centre
of all existence, this kernel of all reality, is to be abolished, and
yet the world is to go on existing; it is a thought which can
be conceived in the abstract, but not realised. The endeavour
to accomplish this, the attempt to think the secondary without
the primary, the conditioned without the condition, that which
is supported without the supporter, always fails, much in the
same way as the attempt to think an equilateral, right-angled[280]
triangle, or a destruction or origination of matter, and similar
impossibilities. Instead of what was intended, the feeling here
presses upon us that the world is not less in us than we in it,
and that the source of all reality lies within us. The result is
really this: the time when I shall not be will objectively come;
but subjectively it can never come. It might therefore, indeed,
be asked, how far every one, in his heart, actually believes in a
thing which he really cannot conceive at all; or whether, since
273
the profound consciousness of the indestructibleness of our true
nature associates itself with that merely intellectual experiment,
which, however, has already been made more or less distinctly
by every one, whether, I say, our own death is not perhaps for us
at bottom the most incredible thing in the world.
The deep conviction of the indestructibleness of our nature
through death, which, as is also shown by the inevitable qualms
of conscience at its approach, every one carries at the bottom of
his heart, depends altogether upon the consciousness of the orig-
inal and eternal nature of our being: therefore Spinoza expresses
it thus: “Sentimus, experimurque, nos æternos esse.” For a rea-
sonable man can only think of himself as imperishable, because
he thinks of himself as without beginning, as eternal, in fact as
timeless. Whoever, on the other hand, regards himself as having
become out of nothing must also think that he will again become
nothing; for that an eternity had passed before he was, and then a
second eternity had begun, through which he will never cease to
be, is a monstrous thought. Really the most solid ground for our
immortality is the old principle: “Ex nihilo nihil fit, et in nihilum
nihil potest reverti.” Theophrastus Paracelsus very happily says
(Works, Strasburg, 1603, vol. ii. p. 6): “The soul in me has
arisen out of something; therefore it does not come to nothing;
for it comes out of something.” He gives the true reason. But
whoever regards the birth of the man as his absolute beginning [281]
must regard death as his absolute end. For both are what they
are in the same sense; consequently every one can only think of
himself as immortal so far as he also thinks of himself as unborn,
and in the same sense. What birth is, that also is death, according
to its nature and significance: it is the same line drawn in two
directions. If the former is an actual arising out of nothing, then
the latter is also an actual annihilation. But in truth it is only by
means of the eternity of our real being that we can conceive it
as imperishable, and consequently this imperishableness is not
temporal. The assumption that man is made out of nothing leads
274 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
necessarily to the assumption that death is his absolute end. Thus
in this the Old Testament is perfectly consistent; for no doctrine
of immortality is suitable to a creation out of nothing. New
Testament Christianity has such a doctrine because it is Indian
in spirit, and therefore more than probably also of Indian origin,
although only indirectly, through Egypt. But to the Jewish stem,
upon which that Indian wisdom had to be grafted in the Holy
Land, such a doctrine is as little suited as the freedom of the will
to its determinism, or as
“Humano capiti cervicem pictor equinam Jungere si velit.”
It is always bad if one cannot be thoroughly original, and dare
not carve out of the whole wood. Brahmanism and Buddhism,
on the other hand, have quite consistently, besides the continued
existence after death, an existence before birth to expiate the
guilt of which we have this life. Moreover, how distinctly con-
scious they were of the necessary consistency in this is shown by
the following passage from Colebrooke's “History of the Indian
Philosophy” in the “Transac. of the Asiatic London Society,”
vol. i. p. 577: “Against the system of the Bhagavatas which
is but partially heretical, the objection upon which the chief[282]
stress is laid by Vyaso is, that the soul would not be eternal if it
were a production, and consequently had a beginning.” Further,
in Upham's “Doctrine of Buddhism,” p. 110, it is said: “The lot
in hell of impious persons called Deitty is the most severe: these
are they who, discrediting the evidence of Buddha, adhere to the
heretical doctrine that all living beings had their beginning in the
mother's womb, and will have their end in death.”
Whoever conceives his existence as merely accidental must
certainly fear that he will lose it by death. On the other hand,
whoever sees, even only in general, that his existence rests upon
some kind of original necessity will not believe that this which
has produced so wonderful a thing is limited to such a brief span
of time, but that it is active in every one. But he will recognise
275
his existence as necessary who reflects that up till now, when he
exists, already an infinite time, thus also an infinity of changes,
has run its course, but in spite of this he yet exists; thus the
Whole range of all possible states has already exhausted itself
without being able to destroy his existence. If he could ever
not be, he would already not be now. For the infinity of the
time that has already elapsed, with the exhausted possibility of
the events in it, guarantees that what exists, exists necessarily.
Therefore every one must conceive himself as a necessary being,
i.e., as a being whose existence would follow from its true and
exhaustive definition if one only had it. In this line of thought,
then, really lies the only immanent proof of the imperishableness
of our nature, i.e., the only proof of this that holds good within
the sphere of empirical data. In this nature existence must inhere,
because it shows itself as independent of all states which can
possibly be introduced through the chain of causes; for these
states have already done what they could, and yet our existence
has remained unshaken by it, as the ray of light by the storm
wind which it cuts through. If time, of its own resources, could [283]
bring us to a happy state, then we would already have been there
long ago; for an infinite time lies behind us. But also: if it
could lead us to destruction, we would already have long been
no more. From the fact that we now exist, it follows, if well
considered, that we must at all times exist. For we are ourselves
the nature which time has taken up into itself in order to fill its
void; consequently it fills the whole of time, present, past, and
future, in the same way, and it is just as impossible for us to fall
out of existence as to fall out of space. Carefully considered, it is
inconceivable that what once exists in all the strength of reality
should ever become nothing, and then not be, through an infinite
time. Hence has arisen the Christian doctrine of the restoration of
all things, that of the Hindus of the constantly repeated creation
of the world by Brahma, together with similar dogmas of the
Greek philosophers. The great mystery of our being and not
276 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
being, to explain which these and all kindred dogmas have been
devised, ultimately rests upon the fact that the same thing which
objectively constitutes an infinite course of time is subjectively
an indivisible, ever present present: but who comprehends it?
It has been most distinctly set forth by Kant in his immortal
doctrine of the ideality of time and the sole reality of the thing
in itself. For it results from this that the really essential part of
things, of man, of the world, lies permanently and enduringly in
the Nunc stans, firm and immovable; and that the change of the
phenomena and events is a mere consequence of our apprehen-
sion of them by means of our form of perception, which is time.
Accordingly, instead of saying to men, “Ye have arisen through
birth, but are immortal,” one ought to say to them, “Ye are not
nothing,” and teach them to understand this in the sense of the
saying attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, “§ø ≥±¡ @Ω μπ √ƒ±π”
(Quod enim est, erit semper), Stob. Ecl., i. 43, 6. If, however, this
does not succeed, but the anxious heart raises its old lament, “I[284]
see all beings arise through birth out of nothing, and after a brief
term again return to this; my existence also, now in the present,
will soon lie in the distant past, and I will be nothing!”—the
right answer is, “Dost thou not exist? Hast thou not within thee
the valuable present, after which ye children of time so eagerly
strive, now within, actually within? And dost thou understand
how thou hast attained to it? Knowest thou the paths which have
led thee to it, that thou canst know they will be shut against thee
by death? An existence of thyself after the destruction of thy
body is not conceivable by thee as possible; but can it be more
inconceivable to thee than thy present existence, and how thou
hast attained to it? Why shouldst thou doubt but that the secret
paths to this present, which stood open to thee, will also stand
open to every future present?”
If, then, considerations of this kind are at any rate adapted
to awaken the conviction that there is something in us which
death cannot destroy, this yet only takes place by raising us to
277
a point of view from which birth is not the beginning of our
existence. But from this it follows that what is proved to be
indestructible by death is not properly the individual, which,
moreover, as having arisen through generation, and having in
itself the qualities of the father and mother, presents itself as a
mere difference of the species, but as such can only be finite.
As, in accordance with this, the individual has no recollection
of its existence before its birth, so it can have no remembrance
of its present existence after death. But every one places his
ego in consciousness; this seems to him therefore to be bound to
individuality, with which, besides, everything disappears which
is peculiar to him, as to this, and distinguishes him from others.
His continued existence without individuality becomes to him
therefore indistinguishable from the continuance of other beings,
and he sees his ego sink. But whoever thus links his existence to
the identity of consciousness, and therefore desires an endless [285]
existence after death for this, ought to reflect that he can certainly
only attain this at the price of just as endless a past before birth.
For since he has no remembrance of an existence before birth,
thus his consciousness begins with birth, he must accept his birth
as an origination of his existence out of nothing. But then he
purchases the endless time of his existence after death for just
as long a time before birth; thus the account balances without
any profit for him. If, on the other hand, the existence which
death leaves untouched is different from that of the individual
consciousness, then it must be independent of birth, just as of
death; and therefore, with regard to it, it must be equally true to
say, “I will always be,” and “I have always been;” which then
gives two infinities for one. But the great equivocation really
lies in the word “I,” as any one will see at once who remembers
the contents of our second book, and the separation which is
made there of the willing from the knowing part of our nature.
According as I understand this word I can say, “Death is my
complete end;” or, “This my personal phenomenal existence is
278 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
just as infinitely small a part of my true nature as I am of the
world.” But the “I” is the dark point in consciousness, as on the
retina the exact point at which the nerve of sight enters is blind,
as the brain itself is entirely without sensation, the body of the
sun is dark, and the eye sees all except itself. Our faculty of
knowledge is directed entirely towards without, in accordance
with the fact that it is the product of a brain function, which
has arisen for the purpose of mere self-maintenance, thus of the
search for nourishment and the capture of prey. Therefore every
one knows himself only as this individual as it presents itself
in external perception. If, on the other hand, he could bring to
consciousness what he is besides and beyond this, then he would
willingly give up his individuality, smile at the tenacity of his
attachment to it, and say, “What is the loss of this individuality
to me, who bear in myself the possibility of innumerable indi-[286]
vidualities?” He would see that even if a continued existence of
his individuality does not lie before him, it is yet quite as good
as if he had such an existence, because he carries in himself
complete compensation for it. Besides, however, it may further
be taken into consideration that the individuality of most men is
so miserable and worthless that with it they truly lose nothing,
and that that in them which may still have some worth is the
universal human element; but to this imperishableness can be
promised. Indeed, even the rigid unalterableness and essential
limitation of every individual would, in the case of an endless
duration of it, necessarily at last produce such great weariness
by its monotony that only to be relieved of this one would prefer
to become nothing. To desire that the individuality should be
immortal really means to wish to perpetuate an error infinitely.
For at bottom every individuality is really only a special error,
a false step, something that had better not be; nay, something
which it is the real end of life to bring us back from. This
also finds confirmation in the fact that the great majority, indeed
really all men, are so constituted that they could not be happy in
279
whatever kind of world they might be placed. In proportion as
such a world excluded want and hardship, they would become
a prey to ennui, and in proportion as this was prevented, they
would fall into want, misery, and suffering. Thus for a blessed
condition of man it would be by no means sufficient that he
should be transferred to a “better world,” but it would also be
necessary that a complete change should take place in himself;
that thus he should no longer be what he is, and, on the contrary,
should become what he is not. But for this he must first of all
cease to be what he is: this desideratum is, as a preliminary,
supplied by death, the moral necessity of which can already be
seen from this point of view. To be transferred to another world
and to have his whole nature changed are, at bottom, one and
the same. Upon this also ultimately rests that dependence of the [287]
objective upon the subjective which the idealism of our first book
shows. Accordingly here lies the point at which the transcendent
philosophy links itself on to ethics. If one considers this one
will find that the awaking from the dream of life is only possible
through the disappearance along with it of its whole ground-warp
also, But this is its organ itself, the intellect together with its
forms, with which the dream would spin itself out without end,
so firmly is it incorporated with it. That which really dreamt
this dream is yet different from it, and alone remains over. On
the other hand, the fear that with death all will be over may be
compared to the case of one who imagines in a dream that there
are only dreams without a dreamer. But now, after an individual
consciousness has once been ended by death, would it even be
desirable that it should be kindled again in order to continue for
ever? The greater part of its content, nay, generally its whole
content, is nothing but a stream of small, earthly, paltry thoughts
and endless cares. Let them, then, at last be stilled! Therefore
with a true instinct, the ancients inscribed upon their gravestones:
Securitati perpetuæ;—or Bonæ quieti. But if here, as so often has
happened, a continued existence of the individual consciousness
280 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
should be desired, in order to connect with it a future reward or
punishment, what would really be aimed at in this would simply
be the compatibility of virtue and egoism. But these two will
never embrace: they are fundamentally opposed. On the other
hand, the conviction is well founded, which the sight of noble
conduct calls forth, that the spirit of love, which enjoins one man
to spare his enemy, and another to protect at the risk of his life
some one whom he has never seen before, can never pass away
and become nothing.
The most thorough answer to the question as to the contin-
ued existence of the individual after death lies in Kant's great
doctrine of the ideality of time, which just here shows itself
specially fruitful and rich in consequences, for it substitutes[288]
a purely theoretical but well-proved insight for dogmas which
upon one path as upon the other lead to the absurd, and thus
settles at once the most exciting of all metaphysical questions.
Beginning, ending, and continuing are conceptions which derive
their significance simply and solely from time, and are therefore
valid only under the presupposition of this. But time has no
absolute existence; it is not the manner of being of the thing in
itself, but merely the form of our knowledge of our existence
and nature, and that of all things, which is just on this account
very imperfect, and is limited to mere phenomena. Thus with
reference to this knowledge alone do the conceptions of ceasing
and continuing find application, not with reference to that which
exhibits itself in these, the inner being of things in relation to
which these conceptions have therefore no longer any meaning.
For this shows itself also in the fact that an answer to the ques-
tion which arises from those time-conceptions is impossible, and
every assertion of such an answer, whether upon one side or the
other, is open to convincing objections. One might indeed assert
that our true being continues after death because it is false that it
is destroyed; but one might just as well assert that it is destroyed
because it is false that it continues: at bottom the one is as true
281
as the other. Accordingly something like an antinomy might
certainly be set up here. But it would rest upon mere negations.
In it one would deny two contradictorily opposite predicates of
the subject of the judgment, but only because the whole category
of these predicates would be inapplicable to that subject. But if
now one denies these two predicates, not together, but separately,
it appears as if the contradictory opposite of the predicate which
in each case is denied were proved of the subject of the judgment.
This, however, depends upon the fact that here incommensurable
quantities are compared, for the problem removes us to a scene
where time is abolished, and yet asks about temporal properties
which it is consequently equally false to attribute to, or to deny [289]
of the subject. This just means: the problem is transcendent. In
this sense death remains a mystery.
On the other hand, adhering to that distinction between phe-
nomenon and thing in itself, we can make the assertion that, as
phenomenon, man is certainly perishable, but yet his true being
will not be involved in this. Thus this true being is indestructible,
although, on account of the elimination of time-conceptions
which is connected with it, we cannot attribute to it continu-
ance. Accordingly we would be led here to the conception of
an indestructibility which would yet be no continuance. Now
this is a conception which, having been obtained on the path of
abstraction, can certainly also be thought in the abstract, but yet
cannot be supported by any perception, and consequently cannot
really become distinct; yet, on the other hand, we must here keep
in mind that we have not, like Kant, absolutely given up the
knowledge of the thing in itself, but know that it is to be sought
for in the will. It is true that we have never asserted an absolute
and exhaustive knowledge of the thing in itself, but rather have
seen very well that it is impossible to know anything as it is
absolutely and in itself. For as soon as I know, I have an idea;
but this idea, just because it is my idea, cannot be identical with
what is known, but repeats it in an entirely different form, for
282 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
it makes a being for other out of a being for self, and is thus
always to be regarded as a phenomenal appearance of the thing
in itself. Therefore for a knowing consciousness, however it may
be constituted, there can be always only phenomena. This is not
entirely obviated even by the fact that it is my own nature which
is known; for, since it falls within my knowing consciousness,
it is already a reflex of my nature, something different from
this itself, thus already in a certain degree phenomenon. So far,
then, as I am a knowing being, I have even in my own nature
really only a phenomenon; so far, on the other hand, as I am
directly this nature itself, I am not a knowing being. For it is[290]
sufficiently proved in the second book that knowledge is only a
secondary property of our being, and introduced by its animal
nature. Strictly speaking, then, we know even our own will
always merely as phenomenon, and not as it may be absolutely
in and for itself. But in that second book, and also in my work
upon the will in nature, it is fully explained and proved that
if, in order to penetrate into the inner nature of things, leaving
what is given merely indirectly and from without, we stick to
the only phenomenon into the nature of which an immediate
insight from within is attainable, we find in this quite definitely,
as the ultimate kernel of reality, the will, in which therefore we
recognise the thing in itself in so far as it has here no longer space,
although it still has time, for its form consequently really only in
its most immediate manifestation, and with the reservation that
this knowledge of it is still not exhaustive and entirely adequate.
Thus in this sense we retain here also the conception of will as
that of the thing in itself.
The conception of ceasing to be is certainly applicable to
man as a phenomenon in time, and empirical knowledge plainly
presents death as the end of this temporal existence. The end of
the person is just as real as was its beginning, and in the same
sense as before birth we were not, after death we shall be no
more. Yet no more can be destroyed by death than was produced
283
by birth; thus not that through which birth first became possible.
In this sense natus et denatus is a beautiful expression. But now
the whole of empirical knowledge affords us merely phenomena;
therefore only phenomena are involved in the temporal processes
of coming into being and passing away, and not that which
manifests itself in the phenomena, the thing in itself. For this the
opposition of coming into being and passing away conditioned
by the brain, does not exist at all, but has here lost meaning and
significance. It thus remains untouched by the temporal end of [291]
a temporal phenomenon, and constantly retains that existence to
which the conceptions of beginning, end, and continuance are
not applicable. But the thing in itself, so far as we can follow it, is
in every phenomenal being the will of this being: so also in man.
Consciousness, on the other hand, consists in knowledge. But
knowledge, as activity of the brain, and consequently as function
of the organism, belongs, as has been sufficiently proved, to the
mere phenomenon, and therefore ends with this. The will alone,
whose work, or rather whose image was the body, is that which
is indestructible. The sharp distinction of will from knowledge,
together with the primacy of the former, which constitutes the
fundamental characteristic of my philosophy, is therefore the
only key to the contradiction which presents itself in so many
ways, and arises ever anew in every consciousness, even the
most crude, that death is our end, and that yet we must be eternal
and indestructible, thus the sentimus, experimurque nos æternos
esse of Spinoza. All philosophers have erred in this: they place
the metaphysical, the indestructible, the eternal element in man
in the intellect. It lies exclusively in the will, which is entirely
different from the intellect, and alone is original. The intellect,
as was most fully shown in the second book, is a secondary
phenomenon, and conditioned by the brain, therefore beginning
and ending with this. The will alone is that which conditions,
the kernel of the whole phenomenon, consequently free from
the forms of the phenomenon to which time belongs, thus also
284 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
indestructible. Accordingly with death consciousness is certainly
lost, but not that which produced and sustained consciousness;
life is extinguished, but not the principle of life also, which
manifested itself in it. Therefore a sure feeling informs every
one that there is something in him which is absolutely imperish-
able and indestructible. Indeed the freshness and vividness of
memories of the most distant time, of earliest childhood, bears
witness to the fact that something in us does not pass away with[292]
time, does not grow old, but endures unchanged. But what this
imperishable element is one could not make clear to oneself. It
is not consciousness any more than it is the body upon which
clearly consciousness depends. But it is just that which, when
it appears in consciousness, presents itself as will. Beyond this
immediate manifestation of it we certainly cannot go; because
we cannot go beyond consciousness; therefore the question what
that may be when it does not come within consciousness, i.e.,
what it is absolutely in itself, remains unanswerable.
In the phenomenon, and by means of its forms, time and
space, as principium individuationis, what presents itself is that
the human individual perishes, while the human race, on the
contrary, always remains and lives. But in the true being of
things, which is free from these forms, this whole distinction
between the individual and the race also disappears, and the two
are immediately one. The whole will to live is in the individual,
as it is in the race, and therefore the continuance of the species is
merely the image of the indestructibility of the individual.
Since, then, the infinitely important understanding of the inde-
structibility of our true nature by death depends entirely upon the
distinction between phenomenon and thing in itself, I wish now
to bring this difference into the clearest light by explaining it in
the opposite of death, thus in the origin of the animal existence,
i.e., generation. For this process, which is just as mysterious as
death, presents to us most directly the fundamental opposition
between the phenomenal appearance and the true being of things,
285
i.e., between the world as idea and the world as will, and also
the entire heterogeneity of the laws of these two. The act of
procreation presents itself to us in a twofold manner: first, for
self-consciousness, whose only object, as I have often shown, is
the will, with all its affections; and then for the consciousness
of other things, i.e., the world of idea, or the empirical reality [293]
of things. Now, from the side of the will, thus inwardly, subjec-
tively, for self-consciousness, that act presents itself as the most
immediate and complete satisfaction of the will, i.e., as sensual
pleasure. From the side of the idea, on the other hand, thus
externally, objectively, for the consciousness of other things, this
act is just the woof of the most cunning of webs, the foundation
of the inexpressibly complicated animal organism, which then
only requires to be developed to become visible to our astonished
eyes. This organism, whose infinite complication and perfection
is only known to him who has studied anatomy, cannot, from the
side of the idea, be otherwise conceived and thought of than as a
system devised with the most ingenious forethought and carried
out with the most consummate skill and exactness, as the most
arduous work of profound reflection. But from the side of the
will we know, through self-consciousness, the production of this
organism as the work of an act which is exactly the opposite
of all reflection, an impetuous, blind impulse, an exceedingly
pleasurable sensation. This opposition is closely related to the
infinite contrast, which is shown above, between the absolute
facility with which nature produces its works, together with the
correspondingly boundless carelessness with which it abandons
them to destruction, and the incalculably ingenious and studied
construction of these very works, judging from which they must
have been infinitely difficult to make, and their maintenance
should have been provided for with all conceivable care; while
we have the opposite before our eyes. If now by this certainly
very unusual consideration, we have brought together in the
boldest manner the two heterogeneous sides of the world, and,
286 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
as it were, grasped them with one hand, we must now hold them
fast in order to convince ourselves of the entire invalidity of the
laws of the phenomenon, or the world as idea, for that of will, or
the thing in itself. Then it will become more comprehensible to
us that while on the side of the idea, that is, in the phenomenal[294]
world, there exhibits itself to us now an arising out of nothing,
and now an entire annihilation of what has arisen, from that
other side, or in itself, a nature lies before us with reference
to which the conceptions of arising and passing away have no
significance. For, by going back to the root, where, by means
of self-consciousness, the phenomenon and the thing in itself
meet, we have just, as it were, palpably apprehended that the two
are absolutely incommensurable, and the whole manner of being
of the one, together with all the fundamental laws of its being,
signify nothing, and less than nothing, in the other. I believe that
this last consideration will only be rightly understood by a few,
and that it will be displeasing and even offensive to all who do
not understand it, but I shall never on this account omit anything
that can serve to illustrate my fundamental thought.
At the beginning of this chapter I have explained that the great
clinging to life, or rather fear of death, by no means springs from
knowledge, in which case it would be the result of the known
value of life; but that that fear of death has its root directly in the
will, out of the original nature of which it proceeds, in which it
is entirely without knowledge, and therefore blind will to live.
As we are allured into life by the wholly illusory inclination to
sensual pleasure, so we are retained in it by the fear of death,
which is certainly just as illusory. Both spring directly from the
will, which in itself is unconscious. If, on the contrary, man
were merely a knowing being, then death would necessarily be
to him not only indifferent, but even welcome. The reflection to
which we have here attained now teaches that what is affected
by death is merely the knowing consciousness, and the will, on
the other hand, because it is the thing in itself, which lies at the
287
foundation of every phenomenon, is free from all that depends
upon temporal determinations, thus is also imperishable. Its
striving towards existence and manifestation, from which the [295]
world results, is constantly satisfied, for this accompanies it as
the shadow accompanies the body, for it is merely the visibility
of its nature. That yet in us it fears death results from the fact
that here knowledge presents its existence to it as merely in the
individual phenomenon, whence the illusion arises that it will
perish with this, as my image in a mirror seems to be destroyed
along with it if the mirror is broken; this then, as contrary to its
original nature, which is a blind striving towards existence, fills
it with horror. From this now it follows that that in us which
alone is capable of fearing death, and also alone fears it, the
will, is not affected by it; and that, on the other hand, what is
affected by it and really perishes is that which from its nature is
capable of no fear, and in general of no desire or emotion, and is
therefore indifferent to being and not being, the mere subject of
knowledge, the intellect, whose existence consists in its relation
to the world of idea, i.e., the objective world, whose correlative
it is, and with whose existence its own is ultimately one. Thus,
although the individual consciousness does not survive death,
yet that survives it which alone struggles against it—the will.
This also explains the contradiction that from the standpoint of
knowledge philosophers have always proved with cogent reasons
that death is no evil; yet the fear of death remains inevitable for
all, because it is rooted, not in knowledge, but in the will. It is
also a result of the fact that only the will, and not the intellect,
is indestructible, that all religions and philosophies promise a
reward in eternity only to the virtues of the will, or heart, not to
those of the intellect, or head.
The following may also serve to illustrate this consideration.
The will, which constitutes our true being, is of a simple nature;
it merely wills, and does not know. The subject of knowledge,
on the other hand, is a secondary phenomenon, arising from the
288 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
objectification of the will; it is the point of unity of the sensibility[296]
of the nervous system, as it were the focus in which the rays of
the activity of all the parts of the brain unite. With this, then, it
must perish. In self-consciousness, as that which alone knows, it
stands over against the will as its spectator, and, although sprung
from it, knows it as something different from itself, something
foreign to it, and consequently also only empirically, in time, by
degrees, in its successive excitements and acts, and also learns
its decisions only a posteriori, and often very indirectly. This
explains the fact that our own nature is a riddle to us, i.e., to our
intellect, and that the individual regards itself as having newly
arisen and as perishable; although its true nature is independent
of time, thus is eternal. As now the will does not know, so
conversely the intellect, or the subject of knowledge, is simply
and solely knowing, without ever willing. This can be proved
even physically in the fact that, as was already mentioned in the
second book, according to Bichat, the various emotions directly
affect all parts of the organism and disturb their functions, with
the exception of the brain, which can only be affected by them
very indirectly, i.e., just in consequence of those disturbances
(De la vie et de la mort, art. 6, § 2). But from this it follows
that the subject of knowledge, for itself and as such, cannot take
part or interest in anything, but for it the being or not being of
everything, nay, even of its own self, is a matter of indifference.
Now why should this purely neutral being be immortal? It ends
with the temporal manifestation of the will, i.e., the individual,
as it arose with it. It is the lantern which is extinguished when
it has served its end. The intellect, like the perceptible world
which exists only in it, is a mere phenomenon; but the finiteness
of both does not affect that of which they are the phenomenal
appearance. The intellect is the function of the cerebral nervous
system; but the latter, like the rest of the body, is the objectivity
of the will. Therefore the intellect depends upon the somatic[297]
life of the organism; but this itself depends upon the will. The
289
organised body may thus, in a certain sense, be regarded as
the link between the will and the intellect; although really it is
only the will itself exhibiting itself spatially in the perception
of the intellect. Death and birth are the constant renewal of
the consciousness of the will, in itself without end and without
beginning, which alone is, as it were, the substance of existence
(but each such renewal brings a new possibility of the denial
of the will to live). Consciousness is the life of the subject of
knowledge, or the brain, and death is its end. And therefore,
finally, consciousness is always new, in each case beginning at
the beginning. The will alone is permanent; and, moreover, it is
it alone that permanence concerns; for it is the will to live. The
knowing subject for itself is not concerned about anything. In the
ego, however, the two are bound up together. In every animal
existence the will has achieved an intellect which is the light by
which it here pursues its ends. It may be remarked by the way
that the fear of death may also partly depend upon the fact that
the individual will is so loath to separate from the intellect which
has fallen to its lot through the course of nature, its guide and
guard, without which it knows that it is helpless and blind.
Finally, this explanation also agrees with the commonplace
moral experience which teaches us that the will alone is real,
while its objects, on the other hand, as conditioned by knowledge,
are only phenomena, are only froth and vapour, like the wine
which Mephistopheles provided in Auerbach's cellar: after every
sensuous pleasure we also say, “And yet it seemed as I were
drinking wine.”
The terrors of death depend for the most part upon the false
illusion that now the ego vanishes and the world remains. But
rather is the opposite the case; the world vanishes, but the inmost
kernel of the ego, the supporter and producer of that subject, in [298]
whose idea alone the world has its existence, remains. With the
brain the intellect perishes, and with the intellect the objective
world, its mere idea. That in other brains, afterwards as before,
290 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
a similar world lives and moves is, with reference to the intellect
which perishes, a matter of indifference. If, therefore, reality
proper did not lie in the will, and if the moral existence were
not that which extends beyond death, then, since the intellect,
and with it its world, is extinguished, the true nature of things in
general would be no more than an endless succession of short and
troubled dreams, without connection among themselves; for the
permanence of unconscious nature consists merely in the idea of
time of conscious nature. Thus a world-spirit dreaming without
end or aim, dreams which for the most part are very troubled and
heavy, would then be all in all.
When, now, an individual experiences the fear of death, we
have really before us the extraordinary, nay, absurd, spectacle of
the lord of the worlds, who fills all with his being, and through
whom alone everything that is has its existence, desponding and
afraid of perishing, of sinking into the abyss of eternal nothing-
ness;—while, in truth, all is full of him, and there is no place
where he is not, no being in which he does not live; for it is
not existence that supports him, but he that supports existence.
Yet it is he who desponds in the individual who suffers from
the fear of death, for he is exposed to the illusion produced by
the principium individuationis that his existence is limited to the
nature which is now dying. This illusion belongs to the heavy
dream into which, as the will to live, he has fallen. But one might
say to the dying individual: “Thou ceasest to be something which
thou hadst done better never to become.”
So long as no denial of the will takes place, what death leaves
untouched is the germ and kernel of quite another existence, in
which a new individual finds itself again, so fresh and original[299]
that it broods over itself in astonishment. What sleep is for the
individual, death is for the will as thing in itself. It would not
endure to continue the same actions and sufferings throughout an
eternity without true gain, if memory and individuality remained
to it. It flings them off, and this is lethe; and through this sleep of
291
death it reappears refreshed and fitted out with another intellect,
as a new being—“a new day tempts to new shores.”
As the self-asserting will to live man has the root of his
existence in the species. Accordingly death is the loss of one in-
dividuality and the assumption of another, consequently a change
of individuality under the exclusive guidance of one's own will.
For in this alone lies the eternal power which could produce its
existence with its ego, yet, on account of its nature, was not able
to maintain it in existence. For death is the démenti which the
essence (essentia) of every one receives in its claim to existence
(existentia), the appearance of a contradiction which lies in every
individual existence:
“For all that arises
Is worthy of being destroyed.”
But an infinite number of such existences, each with its ego,
stands within reach of this power, thus of the will, which, howev-
er, will again prove just as transitory and perishable. Since now
every ego has its separate consciousness, that infinite number of
them is, with reference to such an ego, not different from a single
one. From this point of view it appears to me not accidental that
ævum, ±0…Ω, signifies both the individual term of life and infinite
time. Indeed from this point of view it may be seen, although
indistinctly, that ultimately and in themselves both are the same;
and according to this there would really be no difference whether
I existed only through my term of life or for an infinite time.
Certainly, however, we cannot obtain an idea of all that is said [300]
above entirely without time-concepts; yet when we are dealing
with the thing in itself these ought to be excluded. But it belongs
to the unalterable limitations of our intellect that it can never
entirely cast off this first and most immediate form of all its
ideas, in order to operate without it. Therefore we certainly come
here upon a kind of metempsychosis, although with the impor-
tant difference that it does not concern the whole »≈«∑, not the
292 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
knowing being, but the will alone; and thus, with the conscious-
ness that the form of time only enters here as an unavoidable
concession to the limitation of our intellect, so many absurdities
which accompany the doctrine of metempsychosis disappear. If,
indeed, we now call in the assistance of the fact, to be explained
in chapter 43, that the character, i.e., the will, is inherited from
the father, and the intellect, on the other hand, from the mother,
it agrees very well with our view that the will of a man, in itself
individual, separated itself in death from the intellect received
from the mother in generation, and in accordance with its now
modified nature, under the guidance of the absolutely necessary
course of the world harmonising with this, received through a
new generation a new intellect, with which it became a new
being, which had no recollection of an earlier existence; for the
intellect, which alone has the faculty of memory, is the mortal
part or the form, while the will is the eternal part, the substance.
In accordance with this, this doctrine is more correctly denoted by
the word palingenesis than by metempsychosis. These constant
new births, then, constitute the succession of the life-dreams
of a will which in itself is indestructible, until, instructed and
improved by so much and such various successive knowledge in
a constantly new form, it abolishes or abrogates itself.
The true and, so to speak, esoteric doctrine of Buddhism,
as we have come to know it through the latest investigations,
also agrees with this view, for it teaches not metempsychosis,
but a peculiar palingenesis, resting upon a moral basis which[301]
it works out and explains with great profundity. This may be
seen from the exposition of the subject, well worth reading and
pondering, which is given in Spence Hardy's “Manual of Bud-
dhism,” pp. 394-96 (with which compare pp. 429, 440, and 445
of the same book), the confirmation of which is to be found in
Taylor's “Prabodh Chandro Daya,” London, 1812, p. 35; also
in Sangermano's “Burmese Empire,” p. 6, and in the “Asiatic
Researches,” vol. vi. p. 179, and vol. ix. p. 256. The very useful
293
German compendium of Buddhism by Köppen is also right upon
this point. Yet for the great mass of Buddhists this doctrine is too
subtle; therefore to them simple metempsychosis is preached as
a comprehensible substitute.
Besides, it must not be neglected that even empirical grounds
support a palingenesis of this kind. As a matter of fact there
does exist a connection between the birth of the newly appearing
beings and the death of those that are worn out. It shows itself
in the great fruitfulness of the human race which appears as a
consequence of devastating diseases. When in the fourteenth
century the black death had for the most part depopulated the
old world, a quite abnormal fruitfulness appeared among the
human race, and twin-births were very frequent. The circum-
stance was also very remarkable that none of the children born
at this time obtained their full number of teeth; thus nature,
exerting itself to the utmost, was niggardly in details. This is
related by F. Schnurrer, “Chronik der Seuchen,” 1825. Casper
also, “Ueber die wahrscheinliche Lebensdauer des Menschen,”
1835, confirms the principle that the number of births in a given
population has the most decided influence upon the length of life
and mortality in it, as this always keeps pace with the mortality:
so that always and everywhere the deaths and the births increase
and decrease in like proportion; which he places beyond doubt
by an accumulation of evidence collected from many lands and
their various provinces. And yet it is impossible that there can [302]
be a physical causal connection between my early death and the
fruitfulness of a marriage with which I have nothing to do, or
conversely. Thus here the metaphysical appears undeniably and
in a stupendous manner as the immediate ground of explanation
of the physical. Every new-born being indeed comes fresh and
blithe into the new existence, and enjoys it as a free gift: but
there is, and can be, nothing freely given. Its fresh existence is
paid for by the old age and death of a worn-out existence which
has perished, but which contained the indestructible seed out of
294 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
which this new existence has arisen: they are one being. To show
the bridge between the two would certainly be the solution of a
great riddle.
The great truth which is expressed here has never been en-
tirely unacknowledged, although it could not be reduced to its
exact and correct meaning, which is only possible through the
doctrine of the primacy and metaphysical nature of the will and
the secondary, merely organic nature of the intellect. We find
the doctrine of metempsychosis, springing from the earliest and
noblest ages of the human race, always spread abroad in the
earth as the belief of the great majority of mankind, nay, really
as the teaching of all religions, with the exception of that of
the Jews and the two which have proceeded from it: in the
most subtle form, however, and coming nearest to the truth, as
has already been mentioned, in Buddhism. Accordingly, while
Christians console themselves with the thought of meeting again
in another world, in which one regains one's complete personality
and knows oneself at once, in those other religions the meeting
again is already going on now, only incognito. In the succession
of births, and by virtue of metempsychosis or palingenesis, the
persons who now stand in close connection or contact with us
will also be born along with us at the next birth, and will have the
same or analogous relations and sentiments towards us as now,
whether these are of a friendly or a hostile description. (Cf.,[303]
for example, Spence Hardy's “Manual of Buddhism,” p. 162.)
Recognition is certainly here limited to an obscure intimation, a
reminiscence which cannot be brought to distinct consciousness,
and refers to an infinitely distant time;—with the exception, how-
ever, of Buddha himself, who has the prerogative of distinctly
knowing his own earlier births and those of others;—as this is
described in the “Jâtaka.” But, in fact, if at favourable moment
one contemplates, in a purely objective manner, the action of
men in reality; the intuitive conviction is forced upon one that
it not only is and remains constantly the same, according to the
295
(Platonic) Idea, but also that the present generation, in its true
inner nature, is precisely and substantially identical with every
generation that has been before it. The question simply is in what
this true being consists. The answer which my doctrine gives to
this question is well known. The intuitive conviction referred to
may be conceived as arising from the fact that the multiplying-
glasses, time and space, lose for a moment their effect. With
reference to the universality of the belief in metempsychosis,
Obry says rightly, in his excellent book, “Du Nirvana Indien,”
p. 13: “Cette vieille croyance a fait le tour du monde, et était
tellement répandue dans la haute antiquité, qu'un docte Angli-
can l'avait jugée sans père, sans mère, et sans généalogie” (Ths.
Burnet, dans Beausobre, Hist. du Manichéisme, ii. p. 391).
Taught already in the "Vedas," as in all the sacred books of India,
metempsychosis is well known to be the kernel of Brahmanism
and Buddhism. It accordingly prevails at the present day in the
whole of non-Mohammedan Asia, thus among more than half
of the whole human race, as the firmest conviction, and with an
incredibly strong practical influence. It was also the belief of
the Egyptians (Herod., ii. 123), from whom it was received with
enthusiasm by Orpheus. Pythagoras, and Plato: the Pythagore-
ans, however, specially retained it. That it was also taught in the
mysteries of the Greeks undeniably follows from the ninth book [304]
of Plato's “Laws” (pp. 38 and 42, ed. Bip.) Nemesius indeed
(De nat. hom., c. 2) says: “öøπΩ∑ ºμΩ øPΩ ¿±Ωƒμ¬ ªª∑Ωμ¬,
ø1 ƒ∑Ω »≈«∑Ω ±∏±Ω±ƒøΩ ±¿ø∆∑Ω±ºμΩøπ, ƒ∑Ω ºμƒμΩ√…º±ƒ…√πΩ
¥ø≥º±ƒπ∂ø≈√π.” (Communiter igitur omnes Græci, qui animam
immortalem statuerunt, eam de uno corpore in aliud transferri
censuerunt.) The “Edda” also, especially in the “Völuspá,” teach-
es metempsychosis. Not less was it the foundation of the religion
of the Druids (Cæs. de bello Gall., vi.; A. Pictet, Le mystère
des Bardes de l'ile de Bretagne, 1856). Even a Mohammedan
sect in Hindostan, the Bohrahs, of which Colebrooke gives a
full account in the “Asiatic Researches,” vol. vii. p. 336 sqq.,
296 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
believes in metempsychosis, and accordingly refrains from all
animal food. Also among American Indians and negro tribes,
nay, even among the natives of Australia, traces of this belief are
found, as appears from a minute description given in the Times
of 29th January 1841 of the execution of two Australian savages
for arson and murder. It is said there: “The younger of the two
prisoners met his end with a dogged and a determined spirit, as
it appeared, of revenge; the only intelligible expressions made
use of conveyed an impression that he would rise up a ‘white
fellow,’ which it was considered strengthened his resolution.”
Also in a book by Ungewitter, “Der Welttheil Australien,” it is
related that the Papuas in Australia regarded the whites as their
own relations who had returned to the world. According to all
this, the belief in metempsychosis presents itself as the natural
conviction of man, whenever he reflects at all in an unprejudiced
manner. It would really be that which Kant falsely asserts of his
three pretended Ideas of the reason, a philosopheme natural to
human reason, which proceeds from its forms; and when it is not
found it must have been displaced by positive religious doctrines
coming from a different source. I have also remarked that it is at
once obvious to every one who hears of it for the first time. Let
any one only observe how earnestly Lessing defends it in the last[305]
seven paragraphs of his “Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts.”
Lichtenberg also says in his “Selbstcharacteristik:” “I cannot get
rid of the thought that I died before I was born.” Even the exces-
sively empirical Hume says in his sceptical essay on immortality,
p. 23: “The metempsychosis is therefore the only system of this
kind that philosophy can hearken to.”31 What resists this belief,
31 This posthumous essay is to be found in the “Essays on Suicide and the
Immortality of the Soul” by the late David Hume, Basil, 1799, sold by James
Decker. By this reprint at Bâle these two works of one of the greatest thinkers
and writers of England were rescued from destruction, when in their own land,
in consequence of the stupid and utterly contemptible bigotry which prevailed,
they had been suppressed through the influence of a powerful and insolent
priesthood, to the lasting shame of England. They are entirely passionless,
297
which is spread over the whole human race and commends itself
alike to the wise and to the vulgar, is Judaism, together with the
two religions which have sprung from it, because they teach the
creation of man out of nothing, and he has then the hard task
of linking on to this the belief in an endless existence a parte
post. They certainly have succeeded, with fire and sword, in
driving out of Europe and part of Asia that consoling primitive
belief of mankind; it is still doubtful for how long. Yet how
difficult this was is shown by the oldest Church histories. Most
of the heretics were attached to this primitive belief; for example,
Simonists, Basilidians, Valentinians, Marcionists, Gnostics, and
Manichæans. The Jews themselves have in part fallen into it,
as Tertullian and Justinus (in his dialogues) inform us. In the
Talmud it is related that Abel's soul passed into the body of
Seth, and then into that of Moses. Even the passage of the
Bible, Matt. xvi. 13-15, only obtains a rational meaning if we
understand it as spoken under the assumption of the dogma of
metempsychosis. Luke, it is true, who also has the passage (ix.
18-20), adds the words Aƒπ ¿¡ø∆∑ƒ∑¬ ƒπ¬ ƒ…Ω ±¡«±π…Ω ±Ωμ√ƒ√,
and thus attributes to the Jews the assumption that such an an- [306]
cient prophet can rise again body and all, which, since they know
that he has already lain between six and seven hundred years in
his grave, and consequently has long since turned to dust, would
be a palpable absurdity. In Christianity, however, the doctrine
of original sin, i.e., the doctrine of punishment for the sins of
another individual, has taken the place of the transmigration of
souls and the expiation in this way of all the sins committed in
an earlier life. Both identify, and that with a moral tendency, the
existing man with one who has existed before; the transmigration
of souls does so directly, original sin indirectly.
Death is the great reprimand which the will to live, or more
especially the egoism, which is essential to this, receives through
the course of nature; and it may be conceived as a punishment
coldly rational investigations of the two subjects named.
298 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
for our existence.32 It is the painful loosing of the knot which
the act of generation had tied with sensual pleasure, the violent
destruction coming from without of the fundamental error of our
nature: the great disillusion. We are at bottom something that
ought not to be: therefore we cease to be. Egoism consists really
in the fact that man limits all reality to his own person, in that
he imagines that he lives in this alone and not in others. Death
teaches him better, for it destroys this person, so that the true
nature of man, which is his will, will henceforth live only in other
individuals; while his intellect, which itself belonged only to the
phenomenon, i.e., to the world as idea, and was merely the form
of the external world, also continues to exist in the condition of
being idea, i.e., in the objective being of things as such, thus also
only in the existence of what was hitherto the external world. His
whole ego thus lives from this time forth only in that which he had
hitherto regarded as non-ego: for the difference between external
and internal ceases. We call to mind here that the better man is[307]
he who makes the least difference between himself and others,
does not regard them as absolute non-ego, while for the bad man
this difference is great, nay, absolute. I have worked this out in
my prize essay on the foundation of morals. According to what
was said above, the degree in which death can be regarded as the
annihilation of the man is in proportion to this difference. But
if we start from the fact that the distinction of outside me and in
me, as a spatial distinction, is only founded in the phenomenon,
not in the thing in itself, thus is no absolutely real distinction,
then we shall see in the losing of our own individuality only
the loss of a phenomenon, thus only an apparent loss. However
much reality that distinction has in the empirical consciousness,
yet from the metaphysical standpoint the propositions, “I perish,
but the world endures,” and “The world perishes but I endure,”
are at bottom not really different.
32 Death says: Thou art the product of an act which should not have been;
therefore to expiate it thou must die.
299
But, besides all this, death is the great opportunity no longer to
be I;—to him who uses it. During life the will of man is without
freedom: his action takes place with necessity upon the basis
of his unalterable character in the chain of motives. But every
one remembers much that he has done, and on account of which
he is by no means satisfied with himself. If now he were to go
on living, he would go on acting in the same way, on account
of the unalterable nature of his character. Accordingly he must
cease to be what he is in order to be able to arise out of the
germ of his nature as a new and different being. Therefore death
looses these bonds; the will again becomes free; for freedom
lies in the Esse, not in the Operari. “Finditur nodus cordis,
dissolvuntur omnes dubitationes, ejusque opera evanescunt,” is
a very celebrated saying of the Vedas, which all Vedantic writers
frequently repeat.33 Death is the moment of that deliverance from
the one-sidedness of an individuality which does not constitute [308]
the inmost kernel of our being, but is rather to be thought of as
a kind of aberration of it. The true original freedom re-enters
at this moment, which, in the sense indicated, may be regarded
as a restitutio in integrum. The peace and quietness upon the
countenance of most dead persons seems to have its origin in this.
Quiet and easy is, as a rule, the death of every good man: but to
die willingly, to die gladly, to die joyfully, is the prerogative of
the resigned, of him who surrenders and denies the will to live.
For only he wills to die really, and not merely apparently, and
consequently he needs and desires no continuance of his person.
The existence which we know he willingly gives up: what he
gets instead of it is in our eyes nothing, because our existence
is, with reference to that, nothing. The Buddhist faith calls it
Nirvana,34 i.e., extinction.
33 Sancara, s. de theologumenis Vedanticorum, ed. F. H. H. Windischmann,
p. 37; “Oupnekhat,” vol. i. p. 387 et p. 78; Colebrooke's “Miscellaneous
Essays,” vol. i. p. 363.
34 The etymology of the word Nirvana is variously given. According to
300 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
[309]
Colebrooke (“Transact. of the Royal Asiat. Soc.,” vol. i. p. 566) it comes from
va, “to blow,” like the wind, and the prefixed negative nir, and thus signifies a
calm, but as an adjective “extinguished.” Obry, also, Du Nirvana Indien, p. 3,
says: “Nirvanam en sanscrit signifie à la lettre extinction, telle que celle d'un
feu.” According to the “Asiatic Journal,” vol. xxiv. p. 735, the word is really
Neravana, from nera, “without,” and vana, “life,” and the meaning would be
annihilatio. In “Eastern Monachism,” by Spence Hardy, p. 295, Nirvana is
derived from vana, “sinful desires,” with the negative nir. J. J. Schmidt, in his
translation of the history of the Eastern Mongolians, says that the Sanscrit word
Nirvana is translated into Mongolian by a phrase which signifies “departed
from misery,” “escaped from misery.” According to the learned lectures of
the same in the St. Petersburg Academy, Nirvana is the opposite of Sanfara,
which is the world of constant re-birth, of longings and desires, of illusion
of the senses and changing forms, of being born, growing old, becoming
sick, and dying. In the Burmese language the word Nirvana, according to
the analogy of other Sanscrit words, becomes transformed into Nieban, and
is translated by “complete vanishing.” See Sangermano's “Description of the
Burmese Empire,” translated by Tandy, Rome, 1833, § 27. In the first edition
of 1819 I also wrote Nieban, because we then knew Buddhism only from
meagre accounts of the Burmese.
Chapter XLII. The Life Of The Species.
In the preceding chapter it was called to mind that the (Platonic)
Ideas of the different grades of beings, which are the adequate
objectification of the will to live, exhibit themselves in the knowl-
edge of the individual, which is bound to the form of time, as the
species, i.e., as the successive individuals of one kind connected
by the bond of generation, and that therefore the species is the
Idea (μ0¥ø¬, species) broken up in time. Accordingly the true
nature of every living thing lies primarily in its species: yet
the species again has its existence only in the individuals. Now,
although the will only attains to self-consciousness in the individ-
ual, thus knows itself immediately only as the individual, yet the
deep-seated consciousness that it is really the species in which
his true nature objectifies itself appears in the fact that for the
individual the concerns of the species as such, thus the relations
of the sexes, the production and nourishment of the offspring,
are of incomparably greater importance and consequence than
everything else. Hence, then, arises in the case of the brutes, heat
or rut (an excellent description of the vehemence of which will
be found in Burdach's “Physiology,” vol. i. §§ 247, 257), and, in
the case of man, the careful and capricious selection of the other
individual for the satisfaction of the sexual impulse, which can
rise to the height of passionate love, to the fuller investigation
of which I shall devote a special chapter: hence also, finally the
excessive love of parents for their offspring. [310]
In the supplements to the second book the will was compared
to the root and the intellect to the crown of the tree; and this is
the case inwardly or psychologically. But outwardly or physio-
logically the genitals are the root and the head the crown. The
nourishing part is certainly not the genitals, but the villi of the
intestines: yet not the latter but the former are the root; because
through them the individual is connected with the species in
which it is rooted. For physically the individual is a production
302 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
of the species, metaphysically a more or less perfect picture of
the Idea, which, in the form of time, exhibits itself as species. In
agreement with the relation expressed here, the greatest vitality,
and also the decrepitude of the brain and the genital organs, is
simultaneous and stands in connection. The sexual impulse is to
be regarded as the inner life of the tree (the species) upon which
the life of the individual grows, like a leaf that is nourished
by the tree, and assists in nourishing the tree; this is why that
impulse is so strong, and springs from the depths of our nature.
To castrate an individual means to cut him off from the tree of
the species upon which he grows, and thus severed, leave him to
wither: hence the degradation of his mental and physical powers.
That the service of the species, i.e., fecundation, is followed in
the case of every animal individual by momentary exhaustion
and debility of all the powers, and in the case of most insects
indeed by speedy death, on account of which Celsus said, “Se-
minis emissio est partis animæ jactura;” that in the case of man
the extinction of the generative power shows that the individual
approaches death; that excessive use of this power at every age
shortens life, while, on the other hand, temperance in this respect
increases all the powers, and especially the muscular powers, on
which account it was part of the training of the Greek athletes;
that the same restraint lengthens the life of the insect even to the
following spring; all this points to the fact that the life of the
individual is at bottom only borrowed from the species, and that[311]
all vital force is, as it were, force of the species restricted by
being dammed up. But this is to be explained from the fact that
the metaphysical substratum of life reveals itself directly in the
species and only by means of this in the individual. Accordingly
the Lingam with the Yoni, as the symbol of the species and its
immortality, is worshipped in India, and, as the counterpoise of
death, is ascribed as an attribute to the very divinity who presides
over death, Siva.
But without myth or symbol, the vehemence of the sexual im-
Chapter XLII. The Life Of The Species. 303
pulse, the keen intentness and profound seriousness with which
every animal, including man, pursues its concerns, shows that it
is through the function which serves it that the animal belongs
to that in which really and principally its true being lies, the
species; while all other functions and organs directly serve only
the individual, whose existence is at bottom merely secondary.
In the vehemence of that impulse, which is the concentration
of the whole animal nature, the consciousness further expresses
itself that the individual does not endure, and therefore all must
be staked on the maintenance of the species, in which its true
existence lies.
To illustrate what has been said, let us now imagine a brute
in rut, and in the act of generation. We see a seriousness and
intentness never known in it at any other time. Now what goes on
in it? Does it know that it must die, and that through its present
occupation a new individual, which yet entirely resembles itself,
will arise in order to take its place? Of all this it knows nothing,
for it does not think. But it is as intently careful for the continu-
ance of the species in time as if it knew all that. For it is conscious
that it desires to live and exist, and it expresses the highest degree
of this volition in the act of generation; this is all that then takes
place in its consciousness. This is also quite sufficient for the
permanence of the kind; just because the will is the radical and [312]
knowledge the adventitious. On this account the will does not
require to be guided by knowledge throughout; but whenever in
its primitive originality it has resolved, this volition will objectify
itself of its own accord in the world of the idea. If now in this
way it is that definite animal form which we have thought of
that wills life and existence, it does not will life and existence in
general, but in this particular form. Therefore it is the sight of its
form in the female of its species that stimulates the will of the
brute to the act of generation. This volition of the brute, when
regarded from without and under the form of time, presents itself
as such an animal form maintained through an infinite time by
304 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the constantly repeated replacement of one individual by anoth-
er, thus by the alternation of death and reproduction, which so
regarded appear only as the pulse-beats of that form (π¥μ±, μ0¥ø¬,
species) which endures through all time. They may be compared
to the forces of attraction and repulsion in which matter consists.
That which is shown here in the brute holds good also of man;
for although in him the act of generation is accompanied by
complete knowledge of its final cause, yet it is not guided by
this knowledge, but proceeds directly from the will to live as its
concentration. It is accordingly to be reckoned among instinctive
actions. For in reproduction the brute is just as little guided by
knowledge of the end as in mechanical instincts; in these also
the will manifests itself, in the main, without the mediation of
knowledge, which here, as there, is only concerned with details.
Reproduction is, to a certain extent, the most marvellous of all
instincts, and its work the most astonishing.
These considerations explain why the sexual desire has a very
different character from every other; it is not only the strongest,
but even specifically of a more powerful kind than any other. It
is everywhere tacitly assumed as necessary and inevitable, and
is not, like other desires, a matter of taste and disposition. For
it is the desire which even constitutes the nature of man. In[313]
conflict with it no motive is so strong that it would be certain
of victory. It is so pre-eminently the chief concern that no other
pleasures make up for the deprivation of its satisfaction; and,
moreover, for its sake both brute and man undertake every danger
and every conflict. A very naïve expression of this disposition is
the well-known inscription on the door of the fornix at Pompeii,
decorated with the phallus: “Heic habitat felicitas:” this was for
those going in naïve, for those coming out ironical, and in itself
humorous. On the other hand, the excessive power of the sexual
passion is seriously and worthily expressed in the inscription
which (according to Theon of Smyrna, De Musica, c. 47), Osiris
had placed upon the column he erected to the eternal gods: “To
Chapter XLII. The Life Of The Species. 305
Eros, the spirit, the heaven, the sun, the moon, the earth, the
night, the day, and the father of all that is and that shall be;”
also in the beautiful apostrophe with which Lucretius begins his
work:
“Æneadum genetrix, hominum divomque voluptas,
Alma Venus cet.”
To all this corresponds the important rôle which the relation
of the sexes plays in the world of men, where it is really the
invisible central point of all action and conduct, and peeps out
everywhere in spite of all veils thrown over it. It is the cause of
war and the end of peace, the basis of what is serious, and the aim
of the jest, the inexhaustible source of wit, the key to all allusions,
and the meaning of all mysterious hints, of all unspoken offers
and all stolen glances, the daily meditation of the young, and
often also of the old, the hourly thought of the unchaste, and
even against their will the constantly recurring imagination of
the chaste, the ever ready material of a joke, just because the
profoundest seriousness lies at its foundation. It is, however, the
piquant element and the joke of life that the chief concern of
all men is secretly pursued and ostensibly ignored as much as [314]
possible. But, in fact, we see it every moment seat itself, as the
true and hereditary lord of the world, out of the fulness of its
own strength, upon the ancestral throne, and looking down from
thence with scornful glances, laugh at the preparations which
have been made to bind it, imprison it, or at least to limit it
and wherever it is possible to keep it concealed, or even so to
master it that it shall only appear as a subordinate, secondary
concern of life. But all this agrees with the fact that the sexual
passion is the kernel of the will to live, and consequently the
concentration of all desire; therefore in the text I have called the
genital organs the focus of the will. Indeed, one may say man is
concrete sexual desire; for his origin is an act of copulation and
306 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
his wish of wishes is an act of copulation, and this tendency alone
perpetuates and holds together his whole phenomenal existence.
The will to live manifests itself indeed primarily as an effort
to sustain the individual; yet this is only a step to the effort
to sustain the species, and the latter endeavour must be more
powerful in proportion as the life of the species surpasses that of
the individual in duration, extension, and value. Therefore sexual
passion is the most perfect manifestation of the will to live, its
most distinctly expressed type; and the origin of the individual
in it, and its primacy over all other desires of the natural man,
are both in complete agreement with this.
One other remark of a physiological nature is in place here,
a remark which throws light upon my fundamental doctrine ex-
pounded in the second book. As the sexual impulse is the most
vehement of desires, the wish of wishes, the concentration of all
our volition, and accordingly the satisfaction of it which exactly
corresponds to the individual wish of any one, that is, the desire
fixed upon a definite individual, is the summit and crown of his
happiness, the ultimate goal of his natural endeavours, with the
attainment of which everything seems to him to have been at-[315]
tained, and with the frustrating of which everything seems to him
to have been lost:—so we find, as its physiological correlative,
in the objectified will, thus in the human organism, the sperm
or semen as the secretion of secretions, the quintessence of all
animal fluids, the last result of all organic functions, and have in
it a new proof of the fact that the body is only the objectivity of
the will, i.e., is the will itself under the form of the idea.
With reproduction is connected the maintenance of the off-
spring, and with the sexual impulse, parental love; and thus
through these the life of the species is carried on. Accordingly
the love of the brute for its young has, like the sexual impulse, a
strength which far surpasses that of the efforts which merely con-
cerns itself as an individual. This shows itself in the fact that even
the mildest animals are ready to undertake for the sake of their
Chapter XLII. The Life Of The Species. 307
young even the most unequal battle for life and death, and with
almost all species of animals the mother encounters any danger
for the protection of her young, nay, in many cases even faces
certain death. In the case of man this instinctive parental love
is guided and directed by reason, i.e., by reflection. Sometimes,
however, it is also in this way restricted, and with bad characters
this may extend to the complete repudiation of it. Therefore we
can observe its effects most purely in the lower animals. In itself,
however, it is not less strong in man; here also, in particular
cases, we see it entirely overcome self-love, and even extend to
the sacrifice of life. Thus, for example, the French newspapers
have just announced that at Cahors, in the department of Lot, a
father has taken his own life in order that his son, who had been
drawn for military service, should be the eldest son of a widow,
and therefore exempt (Galignani's Messenger of 22d June 1843).
Yet in the case of the lower animals, since they are capable
of no reflection, the instinctive maternal affection (the male is
generally ignorant of his paternity) shows itself directly and [316]
unsophisticated, and therefore with perfect distinctness and in its
whole strength. At bottom it is the expression of the conscious-
ness in the brute that its true being lies more immediately in the
species than in the individual, and therefore, when necessary, it
sacrifices its life that the species may be maintained in the young.
Thus here, as also in the sexual impulse, the will to live becomes
to a certain extent transcendent, for its consciousness extends
beyond the individual, in which it is inherent, to the species. In
order to avoid expressing this second manifestation of the life of
the species in a merely abstract manner, and to present it to the
reader in its magnitude and reality, I will give a few examples of
the extraordinary strength of instinctive maternal affection.
The sea-otter, when pursued, seizes its young one and dives
with it; when it comes up again to take breath, it covers the
young one with its body, and receives the harpoon of the hunter
while the young one is escaping. A young whale is killed merely
308 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
to attract the mother, who hurries to it and seldom forsakes it
so long as it still lives, even although she is struck with several
harpoons (Scoresby's “Journal of a Whaling Voyage;” from the
English of Kreis, p. 196). At Three Kings Island, near New
Zealand, there are colossal seals called sea-elephants (phoca pro-
boscidea). They swim round the island in regular herds and feed
upon fishes, but yet have certain terrible enemies below water
unknown to us, by whom they are often severely wounded; hence
their swimming together requires special tactics. The females
bring forth their young upon the shore; while they are suckling
them, which lasts from seven to eight weeks, all the males form
a circle round them in order to prevent them, driven by hunger,
from entering the sea, and if this is attempted they prevent it by
biting. Thus they all fast together for between seven and eight
weeks, and all become very thin, simply in order that the young
may not enter the sea before they are able to swim well and[317]
observe the necessary tactics which are then taught them with
blows and bites (Freycinet, Voy. aux terres Australes, 1826). We
also see here how parental affection, like every strong exertion
of the will (cf. chap. xix. 6), heightens the intelligence. Wild
ducks, white-throats, and many other birds, when the sportsman
comes near their nest, fly in front of him with loud cries and
flap about as if their wings were injured, in order to attract his
attention from their young to themselves. The lark tries to entice
the dog away from its nest by exposing itself. In the same way
hinds and does induce the hunter to pursue them in order that
their young may not be attacked. Swallows have flown into
burning houses to rescue their young or perish with them. At
Delft, in a great fire, a stork allowed itself to be burnt in its
nest rather than forsake its tender young, which could not yet
fly (Hadr. Junius, Descriptio Hollandiæ). Mountain-cocks and
woodcocks allow themselves to be taken upon the nest when
brooding. Muscicapa tyrannus protects its nest with remarkable
courage, and defends itself against eagles. An ant has been cut
Chapter XLII. The Life Of The Species. 309
in two, and the fore half been seen to bring the pupæ to a place
of safety. A bitch whose litter had been cut out of her belly crept
up to them dying, caressed them, and began to whine violently
only when they were taken from her (Burdach, Physiologie als
Erfahrungswissenschaft, vol. ii. and iii.).
[318]
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity.
The most ordinary experience teaches that in generation the com-
bined seed of the parents not only propagates the peculiarities
of the species, but also those of the individual, as far as bodily
(objective, external) qualities are concerned, and this has also
always been recognised—
“Naturæ sequitur semina quisque suæ.”
—CATULL.
Now whether this also holds good of mental (subjective, in-
ternal) qualities, so that these also are transmitted by the parents
to the children, is a question which has already often been raised,
and almost always answered in the affirmative. More difficult,
however, is the problem whether it is possible to distinguish what
belongs to the father and what to the mother, thus what is the
mental inheritance which we receive from each of our parents.
If now we cast upon this problem the light of our fundamental
knowledge that the will is the true being, the kernel, the radical
element in man, and the intellect, on the other hand, is what is
secondary, adventitious, the accident of that substance; before
questioning experience we will assume it as at least probable
that the father, as sexus potior and the procreative principle,
imparts the basis, the radical element, of the new life, thus the
will, and the mother, as sexus sequior and merely conceiving
principle, imparts the secondary element, the intellect; that thus
the man inherits his moral nature, his character, his inclinations,
his heart, from the father, and, on the other hand, the grade,[319]
quality, and tendency of his intelligence from the mother. Now
this assumption actually finds its confirmation in experience;
only this cannot be decided by a physical experiment upon the
table, but results partly from the careful and acute observation of
many years, and partly from history.
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity. 311
One's own experience has the advantage of complete certainty
and the greatest speciality, and this outweighs the disadvantage
that arises from it, that its sphere is limited and its examples not
generally known. Therefore, primarily, I refer every one to his
own experience. First of all let him consider himself, confess
to himself his inclinations and passions, his characteristic errors
and weaknesses, his vices, and also his excellences and virtues, if
he has any. Then let him think of his father, and he cannot fail to
recognise all these characteristic traits in him also. On the other
hand, he will often find his mother of an entirely different char-
acter, and a moral agreement with her will very seldom occur,
indeed only through the exceptional accident of a similarity of
the character of the two parents. Let him make this examination,
for example, with reference to quick temper or patience, avarice
or prodigality, inclination to sensuality, or to intemperance, or to
gambling, hard-heartedness or kindliness, honesty or hypocrisy,
pride or condescension, courage or cowardice, peaceableness
or quarrelsomeness, placability or resentfulness, &c. Then let
him make the same investigation with regard to all those whose
characters and whose parents he has accurately known. If he
proceeds attentively, with correct judgment, and candidly, the
confirmation of our principle will not be lacking. Thus, for
example, he will find the special tendency to lie, which belongs
to many men, equally present in two brothers, because they have
inherited it from the father; on this account also the comedy,
“The Liar and his Son,” is psychologically correct. However,
two inevitable limitations must here be borne in mind, which
only open injustice could interpret as evasions. First, pater [320]
semper incertus. Only a decided physical resemblance to the
father removes this limitation; a superficial resemblance, on the
other hand, is not sufficient to do so; for there is an after-effect
of earlier impregnation by virtue of which the children of the
second marriage have sometimes still a slight resemblance to the
first husband, and children begotten in adultery to the legitimate
312 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
father. Such an after-effect has been still more distinctly observed
in the case of brutes. The second limitation is, that in the son
the moral character of the father certainly appears, yet under the
modification which it has received through another and often
very different intellect (the inheritance from the mother), and
thus a correction of the observation becomes necessary. This
modification may be important or trifling in proportion to that
difference, but it can never be so great that the fundamental traits
of the paternal character do not always appear under it recog-
nisably enough, like a man who has disguised himself by an
entirely different kind of dress, wig, and beard. For example, if
by inheritance from the mother a man is pre-eminently endowed
with reason, thus with the power of reflection and deliberation,
the passions inherited from his father are partly bridled by this,
partly concealed, and accordingly only attain to a methodical,
systematic, or secret manifestation, and thus a very different
phenomenon from that of the father, who perhaps had only a
very limited mind, will then result; and in the same way the
converse case may occur. The inclinations and passions of the
mother, on the other hand, do not reappear at all in the children,
often indeed their opposite.
Historical examples have the advantage over those of private
life of being universally known; but, on the other hand, they are
of course impaired by the uncertainty and frequent falsification
of all tradition, and especially also by the fact that as a rule they
only contain the public, not the private life, and consequently
only the political actions, not the finer manifestations of char-[321]
acter. However, I wish to support the truth we are speaking of
by a few historical examples, to which those who have made a
special study of history can no doubt add a far larger number of
equally pertinent cases.
It is well known that P. Decius Mus sacrificed his life for
his country with heroic nobleness; for, solemnly committing
himself and the enemy to the infernal deities, with covered face
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity. 313
he plunged into the army of the Latins. About forty years later
his son, of the same name, did exactly the same thing in the war
against the Gauls (Liv. viii. 6; x. 28). Thus a thorough proof
of the Horatian fortes creantur fortibus et bonis: the converse of
which is thus given by Shakspeare—
“Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base.”
—CYMBELINE, iv. 2.
Early Roman history presents to us whole families whose
members in long succession distinguished themselves by devot-
ed patriotism and courage; such were the gens Fabia and the gens
Fabricia. Again, Alexander the Great was fond of power and
conquest, like his father Philip. The pedigree of Nero which, with
a moral intention, Suetonius (c. 4 et 5) gives at the beginning of
his sketch of this monster is very well worth considering. It is the
gens Claudia he describes, which flourished in Rome through six
centuries, and produced not only capable, but arrogant and cruel
men. From it sprang Tiberius, Caligula, and finally Nero. In his
grandfather, and still more strongly in his father, all those atro-
cious qualities show themselves, which could only attain their
perfect development in Nero, partly because his higher position
afforded them freer scope, partly because he had for his mother
the irrational Bacchante, Agrippina, who could impart to him
no intellect to bridle his passions. Quite in our sense, therefore,
Suetonius relates that at his birth præsagio fuit etiam Domitii,
patris, vox, inter gratulationes amicorum, negantis, quidquam
ex se et Agrippina, nisi detestabile et malo publico nasci po- [322]
tuisse. On the other hand, Cimon was the son of Miltiades, and
Hannibal of Hamilcar, and the Scipios make up a whole family
of heroes and noble defenders of their country. But the son of
Pope Alexander VI. was his hideous image, Cæsar Borgia. The
son of the notorious Duke of Alba was just as cruel and wicked a
man as his father. The malicious and unjust Philip IV. of France,
who is specially known by his cruel torture and execution of the
314 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
knights templars, had for his daughter Isabella, wife of Edward
II. of England, who rebelled against her husband, took him pris-
oner, and after he had signed his abdication, since the attempt
to kill him by ill-usage was unsuccessful, caused him to be put
to death in prison in a manner which is too horrible for me to
care to relate. The blood-thirsty tyrant and defensor fidei, Henry
VIII. of England had a daughter by his first marriage, Queen
Mary, equally distinguished for bigotry and cruelty, who from
her numerous burnings of heretics has won the name of Bloody
Mary. His daughter by his second marriage, Elizabeth, received
an excellent understanding from her mother, Anne Boleyn, which
prevented bigotry and curbed the parental character in her, yet
did not do away with it; so that it still always shone through on
occasions, and distinctly appeared in her cruel treatment of Mary
of Scotland. Van Geuns35 tells a story, after Marcus Donatus, of
a Scotch girl whose father had been burnt as a highway robber
and a cannibal when she was only one year old. Although she
was brought up among quite different people, there developed in
her the same craving for human flesh, and being caught in the act
of satisfying it, she was buried alive. In the Freimüthigen of the
13th July 1821 we read that in the department of Aube the police
pursued a girl because she had murdered two children, whom she
ought to have taken to the foundling hospital, in order to keep[323]
the little money given to the children. At last the police found
the girl on the road to Paris, near Romilly, drowned, and her own
father gave himself up as her murderer. Finally, let me mention a
couple of cases which have occurred recently, and have therefore
only the newspapers as their vouchers. In October 1836 a Count
Belecznai was condemned to death in Hungary because he had
murdered an official and severely wounded his own relations. His
elder brother was executed earlier as a patricide, and his father
also had been a murderer (Frankfurter Postzeitung of the 26th
35 “Disputatio de corporum habitudine, animæ, hujusque virium indice.”
Harderov., 1789, § 9.
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity. 315
October 1836). A year later the youngest brother of this Count,
in the same street where the latter had murdered the official, fired
a pistol at the steward of his estates, but missed him (Frankfurter
Journal, 16th September 1837). In the Frankfurter Postzeitung
of the 19th November 1857 a correspondent in Paris announces
the condemnation to death of a very dangerous highway robber,
Lemaire, and his companions, and adds: “The criminal tendency
seems hereditary in his family and in those of his confederates,
as several of their race have died on the scaffold.” It follows from
a passage in the Laws of Plato that similar cases were already
known in Greece (Stob. Flor., vol. ii. p. 213). The annals of
crime will certainly have many similar pedigrees to show. The
tendency to suicide is specially hereditary.
On the other hand, when we see the excellent Marcus Aurelius
have the wicked Commodus for a son, this does not not lead us
astray; for we know that the Diva Faustina was a uxor infamis.
On the contrary, we mark this case in order in analogous cases
to presume an analogous reason; for example, that Domitian was
the full brother of Titus I can never believe, but that Vespasian
also was a deceived husband.
Now, as regards the second part of the principle set up thus
the inheritance of the intellect from the mother, this enjoys a
far more general acceptance than the first part, which in itself [324]
appeals to the liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ, while its separate
apprehension is opposed by the doctrine of the simplicity and
indivisibility of the soul. Even the old and popular expression
“mother-wit” shows the early recognition of this second truth,
which depends upon the experience both with regard to small
and great intellectual endowments, that they are the possession of
those whose mothers proportionately distinguished themselves
by their intelligence. That, on the other hand, the intellectual
qualities of the father are not transmitted to the son is proved
both by the fathers and the sons of men distinguished by the
most eminent faculties, for, as a rule, they are quite ordinary
316 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
men, without a trace of the paternal mental gifts. But if now an
isolated exception to this experience, so often confirmed, should
appear; such, for example, as is presented by Pitt and his father,
Lord Chatham, we are warranted in ascribing it to accident, nay,
obliged to do so, although, on account of the exceptional rarity
of great talents, it is certainly an accident of a most extraordinary
kind. Here, however, the rule holds good: it is improbable that
the improbable never happens. Besides, great statesmen (as was
already mentioned in chapter 22) are so just as much through the
qualities of their character, thus through what is inherited from
the father, as through the superiority of their mind. On the other
hand, among artists, poets, and philosophers, to whose works
alone genius is properly ascribed, I know of no case analogous to
that. Raphael's father was certainly a painter, but not a great one;
Mozart's father, and also his son, were musicians, but not great
ones. However, it is indeed wonderful that the fate which had
destined a very short life to both of these men, each the greatest
in his own sphere, as it were by way of compensation, took care,
by letting them be born already in their workshop, that, without
suffering the loss of time in youth which for the most part occurs
in the case of other men of genius, they received even from child-
hood, through paternal example and instruction, the necessary[325]
introduction into the art to which they were exclusively destined.
This secret and mysterious power which seems to guide the
individual life I have made the subject of special investigations,
which I have communicated in the essay, “Ueber die scheinbare
Absichtlichkeit im Schicksale des Einzelnen” (Parerga, vol. i.).
It is further to be observed here that there are certain scientific
occupations which certainly presuppose good native faculties,
yet not those which are really rare and extraordinary; while the
principal requirements are zealous efforts, diligence, patience,
early instruction, sustained study, and much practice. From this,
and not from the inheritance of the intellect of the father, the fact
is to be explained that, since the son always willingly follows
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity. 317
the path that has been opened up by the father, and almost all
businesses are hereditary in certain families, in some sciences
also, which before everything demand diligence and persistence,
individual families can show a succession of men of merit; such
are the Scaligers, the Bernouillis, the Cassinis, the Herschels.
The number of proofs of the actual inheritance of the intellect
of the mother would be much greater than it appears if it were
not that the character and disposition of the female sex is such
that women rarely give public proof of their mental faculties;
and therefore these do not become historical, and thus known to
posterity. Besides, on account of the weaker nature in general
of the female sex, these faculties themselves can never reach
the grade in them to which they may afterwards rise in the son;
thus, with reference to themselves, we have to estimate their
achievements higher in this proportion. Accordingly, in the
first instance, only the following examples present themselves
as proofs of our truth. Joseph II. was the son of Maria Theresia.
Cardanus says in the third chapter, “De vita propria:” “Mater
mea fuit memoria et ingenio pollens.” J. J. Rousseau says in the
first book of the “Confessions:” “La beauté de ma mère, son [326]
esprit, ses talents,—elle en avait de trop brillans pour son état,”
&c., and then quotes some delightful lines of hers. D'Alembert
was the illegitimate son of Claudine de Tencin, a woman of
superior mind, and the author of several romances and similar
works, which met with great approbation in her day, and should
even still be enjoyable (see her biography in the “Blätter für
litterarische Unterhaltung,” March 1845, Nos. 71-73). That
Buffon's mother was a remarkable woman is shown by the fol-
lowing passage from the “Voyage à Montbar, par Hérault de
Sechelles,” which Flourens quotes in his “Histoire des travaux
de Buffon,” p. 288: “Buffon avait ce principe qu'en général
les enfants tenaient de leur mère leurs qualités intellectuelles et
morales: et lorsqu'il l'avait développé dans la conversation, il
en faisait sur-le-champ l'application à lui-même, en faisant un
318 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
éloge pompeux de sa mère, qui avait en effet, beaucoup d'esprit,
des connaissances étandues, et une tête très bien organisée.”
That he includes the moral qualities is an error which is either
committed by the reporter, or depends upon the fact that his
mother had accidentally the same character as himself and his
father. The contrary of this is shown in innumerable cases in
which the mother and the son have opposite characters. Hence
the greatest dramatists could present, in Orestes and Hamlet,
mother and son in hostile conflict, in which the son appears
as the moral representative and avenger of his father. On the
other hand, the converse case, that the son should appear as the
moral representative and avenger of the mother against the father,
would be revolting and, at the same time, almost absurd. This
depends upon the fact that between father and son there is actual
identity of nature, which is the will, but between mother and
son there is merely identity of intellect, and even this only in a
conditioned manner. Between mother and son the greatest moral
opposition can exist, between father and son only an intellectual
opposition. From this point of view, also, one should recognise
the necessity of the Salic law: the woman cannot carry on the[327]
race. Hume says in his short autobiography: “Our mother was a
woman of singular merit.” It is said of Kant's mother in the most
recent biography by F. W. Schubert: “According to the judgment
of her son himself, she was a woman of great natural understand-
ing. For that time, when there was so little opportunity for the
education of girls, she was exceptionally well instructed, and she
also continued later to care for her further education by herself.
In the course of walks she drew the attention of her son to all
kinds of natural phenomena, and tried to explain to him through
them the power of God.” What a remarkably able, clever, and
superior woman Goethe's mother was is now universally known.
How much she has been spoken of in literature! while his father
has not been spoken of at all; Goethe himself describes him as a
man of subordinate faculties. Schiller's mother was susceptible
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity. 319
to poetry, and made verses herself, a fragment of which will be
found in his biography by Schwab. Bürger, that genuine poetic
genius, to whom perhaps the first place after Goethe among
German poets belongs—for compared with his ballads those of
Schiller seem cold and laboured—has given an account of his
parents which for us is significant, and which his friend and
physician, Althof repeats in his biography which appeared in
1798, in these words: “Bürger's father was certainly provided
with a variety of knowledge after the manner of study prevalent
at the time, and was also a good, honourable man; but he loved
his quiet comfort and his pipe of tobacco so much, that, as my
friend used to say, he had always first to pull himself together if
he was going to apply himself for a quarter of an hour or so to the
instruction of his son. His wife was a woman of extraordinary
mental endowments, which, however, were so little cultivated
that she had scarcely learnt to write legibly. Bürger thought
that with proper culture his mother would have been the most
famous of her sex, although he several times expressed a strong
disapproval of different traits of her moral character. However, [328]
he believed that he inherited from his mother some mental gifts,
and from his father an agreement with his moral character.”
Walter Scott's mother was a poetess, and was in communication
with the wits of her time, as we learn from the obituary notice of
Walter Scott in the Globe of 24th September 1832. That poems
of hers appeared in print in 1789 I find from an article entitled
“Mother-wit,” in the Blätter für litterarische Unterhaltung of
4th October 1841, published by Brockhaus, which gives a long
list of clever mothers of distinguished men, from which I shall
only take two: “Bacon's mother was a distinguished linguist,
wrote and translated several works, and in all of them showed
learning, acuteness, and taste. Boerhave's mother distinguished
herself through medical knowledge.” On the other hand, Haller
has preserved for us a strong proof of the inheritance of the
mental weakness of the mother, for he says: “E duabus patriciis
320 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
sororibus, ob divitias maritos nactis, quum tamen fatuis essent
proximæ, novimus in nobilissimas gentes nunc a seculo retro ejus
morbi manasse semina, ut etiam in quarta generatione, quintave,
omnium posterorum aliqui fatui supersint” (Elementa physiol.,
Lib. xxix. § 8). Also, according to Esquirol, madness is more
frequently inherited from the mother than the father. If, however,
it is inherited from the father, I attribute this to the disposition of
the character whose influence occasions it.
It seems to follow from our principle that sons of the same
mother have equal mental capacity, and if one should be highly
gifted the other must be so also. Sometimes it is so. Examples
of this are the Carracci, Joseph and Michael Haydn, Bernard and
Andreas Romberg, George and Frederic Cuvier. I would also add
the brothers Schlegel, if it were not that the younger, Friedrich,
made himself unworthy of the honour of being named along
with his excellent, blameless, and highly distinguished brother,
August Wilhelm, by the disgraceful obscurantism which in the
last quarter of his life he pursued along with Adam Müller. For[329]
obscurantism is a sin, possibly not against the Holy Spirit, but
yet against the human spirit, which one ought therefore never
to forgive, but always and everywhere implacably to remember
against whoever has been guilty of it, and take every opportunity
of showing contempt for him so long as he lives, nay, after he is
dead. But just as often the above result does not take place; for
example, Kant's brother was quite an ordinary man. To explain
this I must remind the reader of what is said in the thirty-first
chapter on the physiological conditions of genius. Not only an
extraordinarily developed and absolutely correctly formed brain
(the share of the mother) is required, but also a very energetic
action of the heart to animate it, i.e., subjectively a passionate
will, a lively temperament: this is the inheritance from the father.
But this quality is at its height only during the father's strongest
years; and the mother ages still more quickly. Accordingly the
highly gifted sons will, as a rule, be the eldest, begotten in the
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity. 321
full strength of both parents; thus Kant's brother was eleven years
younger than him. Even in the case of two distinguished brothers,
as a rule, the elder will be the superior. But not only the age,
but every temporary ebb of the vital force or other disturbance of
health in the parents at the time when the child is begotten may
interfere with the part of one or other, and prevent the appearance
of a man of eminent talent, which is therefore so exceedingly
rare a phenomenon. It may be said, in passing, that in the case
of twins the absence of all the differences just mentioned is the
cause of the quasi-identity of their nature.
If single cases should be found in which a highly gifted son
had a mother who was not mentally distinguished at all, this
may be explained from the fact that this mother herself had a
phlegmatic father, and on this account her more than ordinarily
developed brain was not adequately excited by a corresponding
energy of the circulation—a necessary condition, as I have ex-
plained above in chapter 31. Nevertheless, her highly perfected [330]
nervous and cerebral system was transmitted to the son, in whose
case a father with a lively and passionate disposition and an en-
ergetic action of the heart was added, and thus the other physical
condition of great mental power first appeared here. Perhaps this
was Byron's case, since we nowhere find the mental advantages
of his mother mentioned. The same explanation is also to be
applied to the case in which the mother of a son of genius who
was herself distinguished for mental gifts had a mother who was
by no means clever, for the father of the latter has been a man of
a phlegmatic disposition.
The inharmonious, disproportionate, ambiguous element in
the character of most men might perhaps be referred to the fact
that the individual has not a simple origin, but derives the will
from the father and the intellect from the mother. The more het-
erogeneous and ill-adapted to each other the two parents were,
the greater will that want of harmony, that inner variance, be.
While some excel through their heart and others through their
322 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
head, there are still others whose excellence lies in a certain
harmony and unity of the whole nature, which arises from the
fact that in them heart and head are so thoroughly adapted that
they mutually support and advance each other; which leads us to
assume that the parents were peculiarly suited to each other, and
agreed in an exceptional measure.
With reference to the physiological side of the theory set
forth, I wish now to mention that Burdach, who erroneously
assumes that the same psychical qualities may be inherited now
from the father, now from the mother, yet adds (Physiologie als
Erfahrungswissenschaft, vol. i. § 306): “As a whole, the male
element has more influence in determining the irritable life, and
the female element, on the other hand, has more influence on the
sensibility.” What Linné says in the “Systema naturæ,” Tom. i.
p. 8, is also in point here: “Mater prolifera promit, ante gene-
rationem, vivum compendium medullare novi animalis suique[331]
simillimi, carinam Malpighianam dictum, tanquam plumulam
vegetabilium: hoc ex genitura Cor adsociat ramificandum in
corpus. Punctum emin saliens ovi incubantis avis ostendit pri-
mum cor micans, cerebrumque cum medulla: corculum hoc,
cessans a frigore, excitatur calido halitu, premitque bulla aërea,
sensim dilatata, liquores, secundum canales fluxiles. Punctum
vitalitatis itaque in viventibus est tanquam a prima creatione
continuata medullaris vitæ ramificatio, cum ovum sit gemma
medullaris matris a primordio viva, licet non sua ante proprium
cor paternum.”
If we now connect the conviction we have gained here of the
inheritance of the character from the father and the intellect from
the mother with our earlier investigation of the wide gulf which
nature has placed between man and man in a moral as in an
intellectual regard, and also with our knowledge of the absolute
unalterableness both of the character and of the mental faculties,
we shall be led to the view that a real and thorough improvement
of the human race might be attained to not so much from without
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity. 323
as from within, thus not so much by instruction and culture as
rather upon the path of generation. Plato had already something
of the kind in his mind when in the fifth book of his Republic
he set forth his wonderful plan for increasing and improving his
class of warriors. If we could castrate all scoundrels, and shut
up all stupid geese in monasteries, and give persons of noble
character a whole harem, and provide men, and indeed complete
men, for all maidens of mind and understanding, a generation
would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of
Pericles. But, without entering into such utopian plans, it might
be taken into consideration that if, as, if I am not mistaken, was
actually the case among certain ancient nations, castration was
the severest punishment after death, the world would be delivered
from whole races of scoundrels, all the more certainly as it is
well known that most crimes are committed between the age [332]
of twenty and thirty.36 In the same way, it might be considered
whether, as regards results, it would not be more advantageous
to give the public dowries which upon certain occasions have
to be distributed, not, as is now customary, to the girls who
are supposed to be the most virtuous, but to those who have
most understanding and are the cleverest; especially as it is very
difficult to judge as to virtue, for, as it is said, only God sees the
heart. The opportunities for displaying a noble character are rare,
and a matter of chance; besides, many a girl has a powerful sup-
port to her virtue in her plainness; on the other hand, as regards
understanding, those who themselves are gifted with it can judge
with great certainty after some examination. The following is
36 Lichtenberg says in his miscellaneous writings (Göttingen, 1801, vol. ii.
p. 447): “In England it was proposed to castrate thieves. The proposal is not
bad: the punishment is very severe; it makes persons contemptible, and yet
leaves them still fit for trades; and if stealing is hereditary, in this way it is
not propagated. Moreover, the courage ceases, and since the sexual passion
so frequently leads to thefts, this cause would also disappear. The remark that
women would so much the more eagerly restrain their husbands from stealing
is roguish, for as things are at present they risk losing them altogether.”
324 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
another practical application. In many countries, among others
in South Germany, the bad custom prevails of women carrying
burdens, often very considerable, upon the head. This must act
disadvantageously upon the brain, which must thereby gradually
deteriorate in the female sex of the nation; and since from that
sex the male sex receives its brain, the whole nation becomes
ever more stupid; which in many cases is by no means necessary.
Accordingly by the abolition of this custom the quantum of in-
telligence in the whole nation would be increased, which would
positively be the greatest increase of the national wealth.
But if now, leaving such practical applications to others, we
return to our special point of view, the ethico-metaphysical stand-
point—since we connect the content of chapter 41 with that of
the present chapter—the following result will present itself to[333]
us, which, with all its transcendence, has yet a direct empirical
support. It is the same character, thus the same individually
determined will, that lives in all the descendants of one stock,
from the remote ancestor to the present representative of the
family. But in each of these a different intellect is given with it,
thus a different degree and a different kind of knowledge. Thus
in each of these life presents itself to it from another side and
in a different light: it receives a new fundamental view of it, a
new instruction. It is true that, since the intellect is extinguished
with the individual, that will cannot supplement the insight of
one course of life with that of another. But in consequence of
each fundamentally new view of life, such as only a renewed
personality can impart to it, its willing itself receives a different
tendency, thus experiences a modification from it, and what is
the chief concern, the will, has, in this new direction, either to
assert life anew or deny it. In this way does the arrangement of
nature of an ever-changing connection of a will with an intellect,
which arises from the necessity of two sexes for reproduction,
become the basis of a method of salvation. For by virtue of
this arrangement life unceasingly presents new sides to the will
Chapter XLIII. On Heredity. 325
(whose image and mirror it is), turns itself about, as it were,
without intermission before its sight, allows different and ever
different modes of perception to try their effect upon it, so that
upon each of these it must decide for assertion or denial, both
of which constantly stand open to it, only that, if once denial is
chosen, the whole phenomenon ceases for it with death. Now
because, according to this, it is just the constant renewal and
complete alteration of the intellect for the same will which, as
imparting a new view of the world, holds open the path of
salvation, and because the intellect comes from the mother, the
profound reason may lie here on account of which all nations
(with very few and doubtful exceptions) abominate and forbid
the marriage of brothers and sisters, nay, even on account of
which sexual love does not arise at all between brothers and [334]
sisters, unless in very rare exceptions, which depend upon an
unnatural perversity of the instinct, if not upon the fact that one
of the two is illegitimate. For from a marriage of brothers and
sisters nothing could proceed but constantly ever the same will
with the same intellect, as both already exist united in both the
parents, thus the hopeless repetition of the phenomenon which
has already been.
But if now, in the particular case and close at hand, we
contemplate the incredibly great and yet manifest difference
of characters—find one so good and philanthropic, another so
wicked, nay, ferocious; again, behold one just, honest, and up-
right, and another completely false, as a sneak, a swindler, a
traitor, an incorrigible scoundrel—there discloses itself to us a
chasm in our investigation, for in vain we ponder, reflecting on
the origin of such a difference. Hindus and Buddhists solve the
problem by saying, “It is the consequence of the deeds of the
preceding courses of life.” This solution is certainly the oldest,
also the most comprehensible, and has come from the wisest of
mankind; but it only pushes the question further back. Yet a
more satisfactory answer will hardly be found. From the point of
326 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
view of my whole teaching, it remains for me to say that here,
where we are speaking of the will as thing in itself, the principle
of sufficient reason, as merely the form of the phenomenon,
is no longer applicable; with it, however, all why and whence
disappear. Absolute freedom just consists in this, that something
is not subject at all to the principle of sufficient reason, as the
principle of all necessity. Such freedom, therefore, only belongs
to the thing in itself. And this is just the will. Accordingly, in
its phenomenal manifestation, consequently in the Operari, it is
subject to necessity; but in the Esse, where it has determined
itself as thing in itself, it is free. Whenever, therefore, we come
to this, as happens here, all explanation by means of reasons and
consequents ceases, and nothing remains for us but to say that
here manifests itself the true freedom of the will, which belongs[335]
to it because it is the thing in itself, which, however, just as
such, is groundless, i.e., knows no why. But on this account all
understanding ceases for us here, because all our understanding
depends upon the principle of sufficient reason, for it consists in
the mere application of that principle.

Chapter XLIV. The Metaphysics Of The
Love Of The Sexes.
“Ye wise men, highly, deeply learned,
Who think it out and know,
How, when, and where do all things pair?
Why do they kiss and love?
Ye men of lofty wisdom, say
What happened to me then;
Search out and tell me where, how, when,
And why it happened thus.”
—BÜRGER.
This chapter is the last of four whose various reciprocal relations,
by virtue of which, to a certain extent, they constitute a subordi-
nate whole, the attentive reader will recognise without it being
needful for me to interrupt my exposition by recalling them or
referring to them.
We are accustomed to see poets principally occupied with
describing the love of the sexes. This is as a rule the chief theme
of all dramatic works, tragical as well as comical, romantic as
well as classical, Indian as well as European. Not less is it the
material of by far the largest part of lyrical and also of epic
poetry, especially if we class with the latter the enormous piles
of romances which for centuries every year has produced in all
the civilised countries of Europe as regularly as the fruits of the
earth. As regards their main contents, all these works are nothing
else than many-sided brief or lengthy descriptions of the passion
we are speaking of. Moreover, the most successful pictures
of it—such, for example, as Romeo and Juliet, La Nouvelle
Hélöise, and Werther—have gained immortal fame. Yet, when [337]
Rochefoucauld imagines that it is the same with passionate love
as with ghosts, of which every one speaks, but which no one
328 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
has seen; and Lichtenberg also in his essay, “Ueber die Macht
der Liebe,” disputes and denies the reality and naturalness of
that passion, they are greatly in error. For it is impossible that
something which is foreign and contrary to human nature, thus a
mere imaginary caricature, could be unweariedly represented by
poetic genius in all ages, and received by mankind with unaltered
interest; for nothing that is artistically beautiful can be without
truth:—
“Rien n'est beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable.”
—BOIL.
Certainly, however, it is also confirmed by experience, al-
though not by the experience of every day, that that which as
a rule only appears as a strong yet still controllable inclination
may rise under certain circumstances to a passion which exceeds
all others in vehemence, and which then sets aside all consid-
erations, overcomes all obstacles with incredible strength and
perseverance, so that for its satisfaction life is risked without
hesitation, nay, if that satisfaction is still withheld, is given as the
price of it. Werthers and Jacopo Ortis exist not only in romance,
but every year can show at least half a dozen of them in Europe:
Sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi; for their sorrows find no other
chroniclers than the writers of official registers or the reporters
of the newspapers. Yet the readers of the police news in English
and French journals will attest the correctness of my assertion.
Still greater, however, is the number of those whom the same
passion brings to the madhouse. Finally, every year can show
cases of the double suicide of a pair of lovers who are opposed by
outward circumstances. In such cases, however, it is inexplicable
to me how those who, certain of mutual love, expect to find
the supremest bliss in the enjoyment of this, do not withdraw
themselves from all connections by taking the extremest steps,[338]
and endure all hardships, rather than give up with life a pleasure
which is greater than any other they can conceive. As regards
329
the lower grades of that passion, and the mere approaches to it,
every one has them daily before his eyes, and, as long as he is
not old, for the most part also in his heart.
So then, after what has here been called to mind, no one
can doubt either the reality or the importance of the matter; and
therefore, instead of wondering that a philosophy should also
for once make its own this constant theme of all poets, one
ought rather to be surprised that a thing which plays throughout
so important a part in human life has hitherto practically been
disregarded by philosophers altogether, and lies before us as raw
material. The one who has most concerned himself with it is
Plato, especially in the “Symposium” and the “Phædrus.” Yet
what he says on the subject is confined to the sphere of myths,
fables, and jokes, and also for the most part concerns only the
Greek love of youths. The little that Rousseau says upon our
theme in the “Discours sur l'inégalité” (p. 96, ed. Bip.) is false
and insufficient. Kant's explanation of the subject in the third part
of the essay, “Ueber das Gefühl des Schönen und Erhabenen”
(p. 435 seq. of Rosenkranz's edition), is very superficial and
without practical knowledge, therefore it is also partly incorrect.
Lastly, Platner's treatment of the matter in his “Anthropology”
(§ 1347 seq.) every one will find dull and shallow. On the other
hand, Spinoza's definition, on account of its excessive naïveté,
deserves to be quoted for the sake of amusement: “Amor est
titillatio, concomitante idea causæ externæ” (Eth. iv., prop. 44,
dem.) Accordingly I have no predecessors either to make use of
or to refute. The subject has pressed itself upon me objectively,
and has entered of its own accord into the connection of my
consideration of the world. Moreover, least of all can I hope for
approbation from those who are themselves under the power of [339]
this passion, and who accordingly seek to express the excess of
their feelings in the sublimest and most ethereal images. To them
my view will appear too physical, too material, however meta-
physical and even transcendent it may be at bottom. Meanwhile
330 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
let them reflect that if the object which to-day inspires them to
write madrigals and sonnets had been born eighteen years earlier
it would scarcely have won a glance from them.
For all love, however ethereally it may bear itself, is rooted in
the sexual impulse alone, nay, it absolutely is only a more def-
initely determined, specialised, and indeed in the strictest sense
individualised sexual impulse. If now, keeping this in view, one
considers the important part which the sexual impulse in all its
degrees and nuances plays not only on the stage and in novels,
but also in the real world, where, next to the love of life, it shows
itself the strongest and most powerful of motives, constantly lays
claim to half the powers and thoughts of the younger portion of
mankind, is the ultimate goal of almost all human effort, exerts
an adverse influence on the most important events, interrupts the
most serious occupations every hour, sometimes embarrasses for
a while even the greatest minds, does not hesitate to intrude with
its trash interfering with the negotiations of statesmen and the in-
vestigations of men of learning, knows how to slip its love letters
and locks of hair even into ministerial portfolios and philosoph-
ical manuscripts, and no less devises daily the most entangled
and the worst actions, destroys the most valuable relationships,
breaks the firmest bonds, demands the sacrifice sometimes of
life or health, sometimes of wealth, rank, and happiness, nay,
robs those who are otherwise honest of all conscience, makes
those who have hitherto been faithful, traitors; accordingly, on
the whole, appears as a malevolent demon that strives to pervert,
confuse, and overthrow everything;—then one will be forced
to cry, Wherefore all this noise? Wherefore the straining and
storming, the anxiety and want? It is merely a question of[340]
every Hans finding his Grethe.37 Why should such a trifle play
so important a part, and constantly introduce disturbance and
confusion into the well-regulated life of man? But to the earnest
37 I have not ventured to express myself distinctly here: the courteous reader
must therefore translate the phrase into Aristophanic language.
331
investigator the spirit of truth gradually reveals the answer. It is
no trifle that is in question here; on the contrary, the importance
of the matter is quite proportionate to the seriousness and ardour
of the effort. The ultimate end of all love affairs, whether they
are played in sock or cothurnus, is really more important than
all other ends of human life, and is therefore quite worthy of
the profound seriousness with which every one pursues it. That
which is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the
next generation. The dramatis personæ who shall appear when
we are withdrawn are here determined, both as regards their
existence and their nature, by these frivolous love affairs. As the
being, the existentia, of these future persons is absolutely condi-
tioned by our sexual impulse generally, so their nature, essentia,
is determined by the individual selection in its satisfaction, i.e.,
by sexual love, and is in every respect irrevocably fixed by this.
This is the key of the problem: we shall arrive at a more accurate
knowledge of it in its application if we go through the degrees of
love, from the passing inclination to the vehement passion, when
we shall also recognise that the difference of these grades arises
from the degree of the individualisation of the choice.
The collective love affairs of the present generation taken
together are accordingly, of the whole human race, the serious
meditatio compositionis generationis futuræ, e qua iterum pen-
dent innumeræ generationes. This high importance of the matter,
in which it is not a question of individual weal or woe, as in all
other matters, but of the existence and special nature of the hu-
man race in future times, and therefore the will of the individual
appears at a higher power as the will of the species;—this it [341]
is on which the pathetic and sublime elements in affairs of love
depend, which for thousands of years poets have never wearied
of representing in innumerable examples; because no theme can
equal in interest this one, which stands to all others which only
concern the welfare of individuals as the solid body to the sur-
face, because it concerns the weal and woe of the species. Just on
332 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
this account, then, is it so difficult to impart interest to a drama
without the element of love, and, on the other hand, this theme is
never worn out even by daily use.
That which presents itself in the individual consciousness as
sexual impulse in general, without being directed towards a def-
inite individual of the other sex, is in itself, and apart from the
phenomenon, simply the will to live. But what appears in con-
sciousness as a sexual impulse directed to a definite individual
is in itself the will to live as a definitely determined individual.
Now in this case the sexual impulse, although in itself a subjec-
tive need, knows how to assume very skilfully the mask of an
objective admiration, and thus to deceive our consciousness; for
nature requires this stratagem to attain its ends. But yet that in
every case of falling in love, however objective and sublime this
admiration may appear, what alone is looked to is the production
of an individual of a definite nature is primarily confirmed by
the fact that the essential matter is not the reciprocation of love,
but possession, i.e., the physical enjoyment. The certainty of the
former can therefore by no means console us for the want of the
latter; on the contrary, in such a situation many a man has shot
himself. On the other hand, persons who are deeply in love, and
can obtain no return of it, are contented with possession, i.e., with
the physical enjoyment. This is proved by all forced marriages,
and also by the frequent purchase of the favour of a woman, in
spite of her dislike, by large presents or other sacrifices, nay,
even by cases of rape. That this particular child shall be begotten[342]
is, although unknown to the parties concerned, the true end of the
whole love story; the manner in which it is attained is a secondary
consideration. Now, however loudly persons of lofty and senti-
mental soul, and especially those who are in love, may cry out
here about the gross realism of my view, they are yet in error. For
is not the definite determination of the individualities of the next
generation a much higher and more worthy end than those exu-
berant feelings and super-sensible soap bubbles of theirs? Nay,
333
among earthly aims, can there be one which is greater or more
important? It alone corresponds to the profoundness with which
passionate love is felt, to the seriousness with which it appears,
and the importance which it attributes even to the trifling details
of its sphere and occasion. Only so far as this end is assumed as
the true one do the difficulties encountered, the infinite exertions
and annoyances made and endured for the attainment of the loved
object, appear proportionate to the matter. For it is the future
generation, in its whole individual determinateness, that presses
into existence by means of those efforts and toils. Nay, it is itself
already active in that careful, definite, and arbitrary choice for
the satisfaction of the sexual impulse which we call love. The
growing inclination of two lovers is really already the will to live
of the new individual which they can and desire to produce; nay,
even in the meeting of their longing glances its new life breaks
out, and announces itself as a future individuality harmoniously
and well composed. They feel the longing for an actual union
and fusing together into a single being, in order to live on only as
this; and this longing receives its fulfilment in the child which is
produced by them, as that in which the qualities transmitted by
them both, fused and united in one being, live on. Conversely,
the mutual, decided and persistent aversion between a man and
a maid is a sign that what they could produce would only be
a badly organised, in itself inharmonious and unhappy being. [343]
Hence there lies a deeper meaning in the fact that Calderon,
though he calls the atrocious Semiramis the daughter of the air,
yet introduces her as the daughter of rape followed by the murder
of the husband.
But, finally, what draws two individuals of different sex ex-
clusively to each other with such power is the will to live, which
exhibits itself in the whole species, and which here anticipates in
the individual which these two can produce an objectification of
its nature answering to its aims. This individual will have the will,
or character, from the father, the intellect from the mother, and
334 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the corporisation from both; yet, for the most part, the figure will
take more after the father, the size after the mother,—according
to the law which comes out in the breeding of hybrids among the
brutes, and principally depends upon the fact that the size of the
fœtus must conform to the size of the uterus. Just as inexplicable
as the quite special individuality of any man, which is exclusively
peculiar to him, is also the quite special and individual passion
of two lovers; indeed at bottom the two are one and the same:
the former is explicite what the latter was implicite. The moment
at which the parents begin to love each other—to fancy each
other, as the very happy English expression has it—is really to be
regarded as the first appearance of a new individual and the true
punctum saliens of its life, and, as has been said, in the meeting
and fixing of their longing glances there appears the first germ
of the new being, which certainly, like all germs, is generally
crushed out. This new individual is to a certain extent a new
(Platonic) Idea; and now, as all Ideas strive with the greatest ve-
hemence to enter the phenomenal world, eagerly seizing for this
end upon the matter which the law of causality divides among
them all, so also does this particular Idea of a human individual-
ity strive with the greatest eagerness and vehemence towards its
realisation in the phenomenon. This eagerness and vehemence[344]
is just the passion of the two future parents for each other. It has
innumerable degrees, the two extremes of which may at any rate
be described as ë∆¡ø¥πƒ∑ ¿±Ω¥∑ºø¬ and ø≈¡±Ωπ±; in its nature,
however, it is everywhere the same. On the other hand, it will
be in degree so much the more powerful the more individualised
it is; that is, the more the loved individual is exclusively suited,
by virtue of all his or her parts and qualities, to satisfy the
desire of the lover and the need established by his or her own
individuality. What is really in question here will become clear
in the further course of our exposition. Primarily and essentially
the inclination of love is directed to health, strength, and beauty,
consequently also to youth; because the will first of all seeks to
335
exhibit the specific character of the human species as the basis
of all individuality: ordinary amorousness (ë∆¡ø¥πƒ∑ ¿±Ω¥∑ºø¬)
does not go much further. To these, then, more special claims
link themselves on, which we shall investigate in detail further
on, and with which, when they see satisfaction before them, the
passion increases. But the highest degrees of this passion spring
from that suitableness of two individualities to each other on
account of which the will, i.e., the character, of the father and the
intellect of the mother, in their connection, make up precisely
that individual towards which the will to live in general which
exhibits itself in the whole species feels a longing proportionate
to this its magnitude, and which therefore exceeds the measure
of a mortal heart, and the motives of which, in the same way,
lie beyond the sphere of the individual intellect. This is thus
the soul of a true and great passion. Now the more perfect is
the mutual adaptation of two individuals to each other in each
of the many respects which have further to be considered, the
stronger will be their mutual passion. Since there do not exist
two individuals exactly alike, there must be for each particular
man a particular woman—always with reference to what is to be
produced—who corresponds most perfectly. A really passionate [345]
love is as rare as the accident of these two meeting. Since, how-
ever, the possibility of such a love is present in every one, the
representations of it in the works of the poets are comprehensible
to us. Just because the passion of love really turns about that
which is to be produced, and its qualities, and because its kernel
lies here, a friendship without any admixture of sexual love can
exist between two young and good-looking persons of different
sex, on account of the agreement of their disposition, character,
and mental tendencies; nay, as regards sexual love there may
even be a certain aversion between them. The reason of this is to
be sought in the fact that a child produced by them would have
physical or mental qualities which were inharmonious; in short,
its existence and nature would not answer the ends of the will to
336 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
live as it exhibits itself in the species. On the other hand, in the
case of difference of disposition, character, and mental tendency,
and the dislike, nay, enmity, proceeding from this, sexual love
may yet arise and exist; when it then blinds us to all that; and if
it here leads to marriage it will be a very unhappy one.
Let us now set about the more thorough investigation of the
matter. Egoism is so deeply rooted a quality of all individuals in
general, that in order to rouse the activity of an individual being
egoistical ends are the only ones upon which we can count with
certainty. Certainly the species has an earlier, closer, and greater
claim upon the individual than the perishable individuality itself.
Yet when the individual has to act, and even make sacrifices for
the continuance and quality of the species, the importance of the
matter cannot be made so comprehensible to his intellect, which
is calculated merely with regard to individual ends, as to have
its proportionate effect. Therefore in such a case nature can only
attain its ends by implanting a certain illusion in the individual,
on account of which that which is only a good for the species[346]
appears to him as a good for himself, so that when he serves
the species he imagines he is serving himself; in which process
a mere chimera, which vanishes immediately afterwards, floats
before him, and takes the place of a real thing as a motive. This
illusion is instinct. In the great majority of cases this is to be
regarded as the sense of the species, which presents what is of
benefit to it to the will. Since, however, the will has here become
individual, it must be so deluded that it apprehends through the
sense of the individual what the sense of the species presents to
it, thus imagines it is following individual ends while in truth it
is pursuing ends which are merely general (taking this word in
its strictest sense). The external phenomenon of instinct we can
best observe in the brutes where its rôle is most important; but it
is in ourselves alone that we arrive at a knowledge of its internal
process, as of everything internal. Now it is certainly supposed
that man has almost no instinct; at any rate only this, that the
337
new-born babe seeks for and seizes the breast of its mother. But,
in fact, we have a very definite, distinct, and complicated instinct,
that of the selection of another individual for the satisfaction of
the sexual impulse, a selection which is so fine, so serious, and
so arbitrary. With this satisfaction in itself, i.e., so far as it is a
sensual pleasure resting upon a pressing want of the individual,
the beauty or ugliness of the other individual has nothing to
do. Thus the regard for this which is yet pursued with such
ardour, together with the careful selection which springs from it,
is evidently connected, not with the chooser himself—although
he imagines it is so—but with the true end, that which is to be
produced, which is to receive the type of the species as purely
and correctly as possible. Through a thousand physical accidents
and moral aberrations there arise a great variety of deteriorations
of the human form; yet its true type, in all its parts, is always
again established: and this takes place under the guidance of the [347]
sense of beauty, which always directs the sexual impulse, and
without which this sinks to the level of a disgusting necessity.
Accordingly, in the first place, every one will decidedly prefer
and eagerly desire the most beautiful individuals, i.e., those in
whom the character of the species is most purely impressed; but,
secondly, each one will specially regard as beautiful in another
individual those perfections which he himself lacks, nay, even
those imperfections which are the opposite of his own. Hence,
for example, little men love big women, fair persons like dark,
&c. &c. The delusive ecstasy which seizes a man at the sight of
a woman whose beauty is suited to him, and pictures to him a
union with her as the highest good, is just the sense of the species,
which, recognising the distinctly expressed stamp of the same,
desires to perpetuate it with this individual. Upon this decided
inclination to beauty depends the maintenance of the type of the
species: hence it acts with such great power. We shall examine
specially further on the considerations which it follows. Thus
what guides man here is really an instinct which is directed to
338 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
doing the best for the species, while the man himself imagines
that he only seeks the heightening of his own pleasure. In fact,
we have in this an instructive lesson concerning the inner nature
of all instinct, which, as here, almost always sets the individual
in motion for the good of the species. For clearly the pains with
which an insect seeks out a particular flower, or fruit, or dung,
or flesh, or, as in the case of the ichneumonidæ, the larva of
another insect, in order to deposit its eggs there only, and to attain
this end shrinks neither from trouble nor danger, is thoroughly
analogous to the pains with which for his sexual satisfaction a
man carefully chooses a woman with definite qualities which
appeal to him individually, and strives so eagerly after her that in
order to attain this end he often sacrifices his own happiness in
life, contrary to all reason, by a foolish marriage, by love affairs
which cost him wealth, honour, and life, even by crimes such as
adultery or rape, all merely in order to serve the species in the[348]
most efficient way, although at the cost of the individual, in ac-
cordance with the will of nature which is everywhere sovereign.
Instinct, in fact, is always an act which seems to be in accordance
with the conception of an end, and yet is entirely without such
a conception. Nature implants it wherever the acting individual
is incapable of understanding the end, or would be unwilling to
pursue it. Therefore, as a rule, it is given only to the brutes, and
indeed especially to the lowest of them which have least under-
standing; but almost only in the case we are here considering it
is also given to man, who certainly could understand the end,
but would not pursue it with the necessary ardour, that is, even
at the expense of his individual welfare. Thus here, as in the
case of all instinct, the truth assumes the form of an illusion,
in order to act upon the will. It is a voluptuous illusion which
leads the man to believe he will find a greater pleasure in the
arms of a woman whose beauty appeals to him than in those
of any other; or which indeed, exclusively directed to a single
individual, firmly convinces him that the possession of her will
339
ensure him excessive happiness. Therefore he imagines he is
taking trouble and making sacrifices for his own pleasure, while
he does so merely for the maintenance of the regular type of
the species, or else a quite special individuality, which can only
come from these parents, is to attain to existence. The character
of instinct is here so perfectly present, thus an action which seems
to be in accordance with the conception of an end, and yet is
entirely without such a conception, that he who is drawn by that
illusion often abhors the end which alone guides it, procreation,
and would like to hinder it; thus it is in the case of almost all
illicit love affairs. In accordance with the character of the matter
which has been explained, every lover will experience a marvel-
lous disillusion after the pleasure he has at last attained, and will
wonder that what was so longingly desired accomplishes nothing [349]
more than every other sexual satisfaction; so that he does not see
himself much benefited by it. That wish was related to all his
other wishes as the species is related to the individual, thus as the
infinite to the finite. The satisfaction, on the other hand, is really
only for the benefit of the species, and thus does not come within
the consciousness of the individual, who, inspired by the will
of the species, here served an end with every kind of sacrifice,
which was not his own end at all. Hence, then, every lover,
after the ultimate consummation of the great work, finds himself
cheated; for the illusion has vanished by means of which the
individual was here the dupe of the species, Accordingly Plato
very happily says: “!¥øΩ∑ ¿±Ωƒ…Ω ±ª±∂øΩμ√ƒ±ƒøΩ” (voluptas
ommlum maxime vaniloqua), Phileb. 319.
But all this reflects light on the instincts and mechanical ten-
dencies of the brutes. They also are, without doubt, involved in a
kind of illusion, which deceives them with the prospect of their
own pleasure, while they work so laboriously and with so much
self-denial for the species, the bird builds its nest, the insect
seeks the only suitable place for its eggs, or even hunts for prey
which, unsuited for its own enjoyment, must be laid beside the
340 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
eggs as food for the future larvæ, the bees, the wasps, the ants
apply themselves to their skilful dwellings and highly complicat-
ed economy. They are all guided with certainty by an illusion,
which conceals the service of the species under the mask of an
egotistical end. This is probably the only way to comprehend
the inner or subjective process that lies at the foundation of the
manifestations of instinct. Outwardly, however, or objectively,
we find in those creatures which are to a large extent governed
by instinct, especially in insects, a preponderance of the ganglion
system, i.e., the subjective nervous system, over the objective
or cerebral system; from which we must conclude that they are
moved, not so much by objective, proper apprehension as by[350]
subjective ideas exciting desire, which arise from the influence of
the ganglion system upon the brain, and accordingly by a kind of
illusion; and this will be the physiological process in the case of
all instinct. For the sake of illustration I will mention as another
example of instinct in the human species, although a weak one,
the capricious appetite of women who are pregnant. It seems to
arise from the fact that the nourishment of the embryo sometimes
requires a special or definite modification of the blood which
flows to it, upon which the food which produces such a modifi-
cation at once presents itself to the pregnant woman as an object
of ardent longing, thus here also an illusion arises. Accordingly
woman has one instinct more than man; and the ganglion system
is also much more developed in the woman. That man has fewer
instincts than the brutes and that even these few can be easily
led astray, may be explained from the great preponderance of the
brain in his case. The sense of beauty which instinctively guides
the selection for the satisfaction of sexual passion is led astray
when it degenerates into the tendency to pederasty; analogous
to the fact that the blue-bottle (Musca vomitoria), instead of
depositing its eggs, according to instinct, in putrefying flesh, lays
them in the blossom of the Arum dracunculus, deceived by the
cadaverous smell of this plant.
341
Now that an instinct entirely directed to that which is to be
produced lies at the foundation of all sexual love will receive
complete confirmation from the fuller analysis of it, which we
cannot therefore avoid. First of all we have to remark here
that by nature man is inclined to inconstancy in love, woman
to constancy. The love of the man sinks perceptibly from the
moment it has obtained satisfaction; almost every other woman
charms him more than the one he already possesses; he longs for
variety. The love of the woman, on the other hand, increases just
from that moment. This is a consequence of the aim of nature [351]
which is directed to the maintenance, and therefore to the greatest
possible increase, of the species. The man can easily beget over
a hundred children a year; the woman, on the contrary, with
however many men, can yet only bring one child a year into the
world (leaving twin births out of account). Therefore the man
always looks about after other women; the woman, again, sticks
firmly to the one man; for nature moves her, instinctively and
without reflection, to retain the nourisher and protector of the
future offspring. Accordingly faithfulness in marriage is with the
man artificial, with the woman it is natural, and thus adultery on
the part of the woman is much less pardonable than on the part
of the man, both objectively on account of the consequences and
also subjectively on account of its unnaturalness.
But in order to be thorough and gain full conviction that the
pleasure in the other sex, however objective it may seem to us,
is yet merely disguised instinct, i.e., sense of the species, which
strives to maintain its type, we must investigate more fully the
considerations which guide us in this pleasure, and enter into
the details of this, rarely as these details which will have to
be mentioned here may have figured in a philosophical work
before. These considerations divide themselves into those which
directly concern the type of the species, i.e., beauty, those which
are concerned with physical qualities, and lastly, those which
are merely relative, which arise from the requisite correction or
342 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
neutralisation of the one-sided qualities and abnormities of the
two individuals by each other. We shall go through them one by
one.
The first consideration which guides our choice and incli-
nation is age. In general we accept the age from the years
when menstruation begins to those when it ceases, yet we give
the decided preference to the period from the eighteenth to the
twenty-eighth year. Outside of those years, on the other hand,
no woman can attract us: an old woman, i.e., one who no longer
menstruates, excites our aversion. Youth without beauty has[352]
still always attraction; beauty without youth has none. Clearly
the unconscious end which guides us here is the possibility of
reproduction in general: therefore every individual loses attrac-
tion for the opposite sex in proportion as he or she is removed
from the fittest period for begetting or conceiving. The second
consideration is that of health. Acute diseases only temporarily
disturb us, chronic diseases or cachexia repel us, because they are
transmitted to the child. The third consideration is the skeleton,
because it is the basis of the type of the species. Next to age
and disease nothing repels us so much as a deformed figure;
even the most beautiful face cannot atone for it; on the contrary,
even the ugliest face when accompanied by a straight figure is
unquestionably preferred. Further, we feel every disproportion
of the skeleton most strongly; for example, a stunted, dumpy,
short-boned figure, and many such; also a halting gait, where it
is not the result of an extraneous accident. On the other hand, a
strikingly beautiful figure can make up for all defects: it enchants
us. Here also comes in the great value which all attach to the
smallness of the feet: it depends upon the fact that they are an
essential characteristic of the species, for no animal has the tarsus
and the metatarsus taken together so small as man, which accords
with his upright walk; he is a plantigrade. Accordingly Jesus
Sirach also says (xxvi. 23, according to the revised translation
by Kraus): “A woman with a straight figure and beautiful feet
343
is like columns of gold in sockets of silver.” The teeth also
are important; because they are essential for nourishment and
quite specially hereditary. The fourth consideration is a certain
fulness of flesh; thus a predominance of the vegetative function,
of plasticity; because this promises abundant nourishment for
the fœtus; hence great leanness repels us in a striking degree. A
full female bosom exerts an exceptional charm upon the male
sex; because, standing in direct connection with the female [353]
functions of propagation, it promises abundant nourishment to
the new-born child. On the other hand, excessively fat women
excite our disgust: the cause is that this indicates atrophy of the
uterus, thus barrenness; which is not known by the head, but
by instinct. The last consideration of all is the beauty of the
face. Here also before everything else the bones are considered;
therefore we look principally for a beautiful nose, and a short
turned-up nose spoils everything. A slight inclination of the
nose downwards or upwards has decided the happiness in life of
innumerable maidens, and rightly so, for it concerns the type of
the species. A small mouth, by means of small maxillæ, is very
essential as specifically characteristic of the human countenance,
as distinguished from the muzzle of the brutes. A receding or,
as it were, cut-away chin is especially disagreeable, because
mentum prominulum is an exclusive characteristic of our species.
Finally comes the regard for beautiful eyes and forehead; it is
connected with the psychical qualities, especially the intellectual
which are inherited from the mother.
The unconscious considerations which, on the other hand,
the inclination of women follows naturally cannot be so exact-
ly assigned. In general the following may be asserted: They
give the preference to the age from thirty to thirty-five years,
especially over that of youths who yet really present the height
of human beauty. The reason is that they are not guided by
taste but by instinct, which recognises in the age named the
acme of reproductive power. In general they look less to beauty,
344 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
especially of the face. It is as if they took it upon themselves
alone to impart this to the child. They are principally won by the
strength of the man, and the courage which is connected with
this; for these promise the production of stronger children, and
also a brave protector for them. Every physical defect of the
man, every divergence from the type, may with regard to the
child be removed by the woman in reproduction, through the fact
that she herself is blameless in these respects, or even exceeds[354]
in the opposite direction. Only those qualities of the man have
to be excepted which are peculiar to his sex, and which therefore
the mother cannot give to the child: such are the manly structure
of the skeleton, broad shoulders, slender hips, straight bones,
muscular power, courage, beard, &c. Hence it arises that women
often love ugly men, but never an unmanly man, because they
cannot neutralise his defects.
The second class of the considerations which lie at the foun-
dation of sexual love are those which regard psychical qualities.
Here we shall find that the woman is throughout attracted by the
qualities of the heart or character in the man, as those which are
inherited from the father. The woman is won especially by firm-
ness of will, decision, and courage, and perhaps also by honesty
and good-heartedness. On the other hand, intellectual gifts exer-
cise no direct and instinctive power over her, just because they
are not inherited from the father. Want of understanding does a
man no harm with women; indeed extraordinary mental endow-
ment, or even genius, might sooner influence them unfavourably
as an abnormity. Hence one often sees an ugly, stupid, and coarse
fellow get the better of a cultured, able, and amiable man with
women. Also marriages from love are sometimes consummated
between natures which are mentally very different: for example,
the man is rough, powerful, and stupid; the woman tenderly
sensitive, delicately thoughtful, cultured, æsthetic, &c.; or the
man is a genius and learned, the woman a goose:
345
“Sic visum Veneri; cui placet impares
Formas atque animos sub juga aënea
Sævo mittere cum joco.”
The reason is, that here quite other considerations than the
intellectual predominate,—those of instinct. In marriage what is
looked to is not intellectual entertainment, but the production of
children: it is a bond of the heart, not of the head. It is a vain [355]
and absurd pretence when women assert that they have fallen
in love with the mind of a man, or else it is the over-straining
of a degenerate nature. Men, on the other hand, are not deter-
mined in their instinctive love by the qualities of character of the
woman; hence so many Socrateses have found their Xantippes;
for example, Shakspeare, Albrecht Dürer, Byron, &c. The in-
tellectual qualities, however, certainly influence here, because
they are inherited from the mother. Yet their influence is easily
outweighed by that of physical beauty, which acts directly, as
concerning a more essential point. However, it happens, either
from the feeling or the experience of that influence, that mothers
have their daughters taught the fine arts, languages, and so forth
in order to make them attractive to men, whereby they wish to
assist the intellect by artificial means, just as, in case of need,
they assist the hips and the bosom. Observe that here we are
speaking throughout only of that entirely immediate instinctive
attraction from which alone love properly so called grows. That
a woman of culture and understanding prizes understanding and
intellect in a man, that a man from rational reflection should test
and have regard to the character of his bride, has nothing to do
with the matter with which we are dealing here. Such things
lie at the bottom of a rational choice in marriage, but not of the
passionate love, which is our theme.
Hitherto I have only taken account of the absolute consider-
ations, i.e., those which hold good for every one: I come now
to the relative considerations, which are individual, because in
346 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
their case what is looked to is the rectification of the type of the
species, which is already defectively presented, the correction of
the divergences from it which the chooser's own person already
bears in itself, and thus the return to the pure presentation of
the type. Here, then, each one loves what he lacks. Starting
from the individual constitution, and directed to the individual
constitution, the choice which rests upon such relative con-[356]
siderations is much more definite, decided, and exclusive than
that which proceeds merely from the absolute considerations;
therefore the source of really passionate love will lie, as a rule,
in these relative considerations, and only that of the ordinary and
slighter inclination in the absolute considerations. Accordingly it
is not generally precisely correct and perfect beauties that kindle
great passions. For such a truly passionate inclination to arise
something is required which can only be expressed by a chemical
metaphor: two persons must neutralise each other, like acid and
alkali, to a neutral salt. The essential conditions demanded for this
are the following. First: all sex is one-sided. This one-sidedness
is more distinctly expressed in one individual than in another;
therefore in every individual it can be better supplemented and
neutralised by one than by another individual of the opposite sex,
for each one requires a one-sidedness which is the opposite of
his own to complete the type of humanity in the new individual
that is to be produced, the constitution of which is always the
goal towards which all tends. Physiologists know that manhood
and womanhood admit of innumerable degrees, through which
the former sinks to the repulsive gynander and hypospadæus,
and the latter rises to the graceful androgyne; from both sides
complete hermaphrodism can be reached, at which point stand
those individuals who, holding the exact mean between the two
sexes, can be attributed to neither, and consequently are unfit
to propagate the species. Accordingly, the neutralisation of two
individualities by each other, of which we are speaking, demands
that the definite degree of his manhood shall exactly correspond
347
to the definite degree of her womanhood; so that the one-sided-
ness of each exactly annuls that of the other. Accordingly, the
most manly man will seek the most womanly woman, and vice
versâ, and in the same way every individual will seek another
corresponding to him or her in degree of sex. Now how far the [357]
required relation exists between two individuals is instinctively
felt by them, and, together with the other relative considerations,
lies at the foundation of the higher degrees of love. While, there-
fore, the lovers speak pathetically of the harmony of their souls,
the heart of the matter is for the most part the agreement or suit-
ableness pointed out here with reference to the being which is to
be produced and its perfection, and which is also clearly of much
more importance than the harmony of their souls, which often,
not long after the marriage, resolves itself into a howling discord.
Now, here come in the further relative considerations, which
depend upon the fact that every one endeavours to neutralise by
means of the other his weaknesses, defects, and deviations from
the type, so that they will not perpetuate themselves, or even
develop into complete abnormities in the child which is to be
produced. The weaker a man is as regards muscular power the
more will he seek for strong women; and the woman on her side
will do the same. But since now a less degree of muscular power
is natural and regular in the woman, women as a rule will give
the preference to strong men. Further, the size is an important
consideration. Little men have a decided inclination for big
women, and vice versâ; and indeed in a little man the preference
for big women will be so much the more passionate if he himself
was begotten by a big father, and only remains little through the
influence of his mother; because he has inherited from his father
the vascular system and its energy, which was able to supply
a large body with blood. If, on the other hand, his father and
grandfather were both little, that inclination will make itself less
felt. At the foundation of the aversion of a big woman to big
men lies the intention of nature to avoid too big a race, if with
348 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the strength which this woman could impart to them they would
be too weak to live long. If, however, such a woman selects
a big husband, perhaps for the sake of being more presentable
in society, then, as a rule, her offspring will have to atone for[358]
her folly. Further, the consideration as to the complexion is
very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons, or brunettes; but the
latter seldom prefer the former. The reason is, that fair hair and
blue eyes are in themselves a variation from the type, almost an
abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at least to grey horses. In
no part of the world, not even in the vicinity of the pole, are they
indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian
origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the white
colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by nature he
has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the Hindus; that
consequently a white man has never originally sprung from the
womb of nature, and that thus there is no such thing as a white
race, much as this is talked of, but every white man is a faded
or bleached one. Forced into the strange world, where he only
exists like an exotic plant, and like this requires in winter the
hothouse, in the course of thousands of years man became white.
The gipsies, an Indian race which immigrated only about four
centuries ago, show the transition from the complexion of the
Hindu to our own.38 Therefore in sexual love nature strives to
return to dark hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the
white colour of the skin has become a second nature, though
not so that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one
also seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of
his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more decidedly
the more important the part is. Therefore snub-nosed individuals
have an inexpressible liking for hook-noses, parrot-faces; and it
is the same with regard to all other parts. Men with excessively
slim, long bodies and limbs can find beauty in a body which
38 The fuller discussion of this subject will be found in the “Parerga,” vol. ii.
§ 92 of the first edition (second edition, pp. 167-170).
349
is even beyond measure stumpy and short. The considerations
with regard to temperament act in an analogous manner. Each [359]
will prefer the temperament opposed to his own; yet only in
proportion as his one is decided. Whoever is himself in some
respect very perfect does not indeed seek and love imperfection
in this respect, but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others;
because he himself insures the children against great imperfec-
tion of this part. For example, whoever is himself very white will
not object to a yellow complexion; but whoever has the latter
will find dazzling whiteness divinely beautiful. The rare case in
which a man falls in love with a decidedly ugly woman occurs
when, besides the exact harmony of the degree of sex explained
above, the whole of her abnormities are precisely the opposite,
and thus the corrective, of his. The love is then wont to reach a
high degree.
The profound seriousness with which we consider and ponder
each bodily part of the woman, and she on her part does the same,
the critical scrupulosity with which we inspect a woman who
begins to please us, the capriciousness of our choice, the keen
attention with which the bridegroom observes his betrothed, his
carefulness not to be deceived in any part, and the great value
which he attaches to every excess or defect in the essential parts,
all this is quite in keeping with the importance of the end. For
the new being to be produced will have to bear through its whole
life a similar part. For example, if the woman is only a little
crooked, this may easily impart to her son a hump, and so in
all the rest. Consciousness of all this certainly does not exist.
On the contrary, every one imagines that he makes that careful
selection in the interest of his own pleasure (which at bottom
cannot be interested in it at all); but he makes it precisely as,
under the presupposition of his own corporisation, is most in
keeping with the interest of the species, to maintain the type
of which as pure as possible is the secret task. The individual
acts here, without knowing it, by order of something higher than
350 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
itself, the species; hence the importance which it attaches to[360]
things which may and indeed must be, indifferent to itself as
such. There is something quite peculiar in the profound uncon-
scious seriousness with which two young persons of opposite
sex who see each other for the first time regard each other, in the
searching and penetrating glance they cast at one another, in the
careful review which all the features and parts of their respective
persons have to endure. This investigating and examining is the
meditation of the genius of the species on the individual which is
possible through these two and the combination of its qualities.
According to the result of this meditation is the degree of their
pleasure in each other and their yearning for each other. This
yearning, even after it has attained a considerable degree, may
be suddenly extinguished again by the discovery of something
that had previously remained unobserved. In this way, then, the
genius of the species meditates concerning the coming race in all
who are capable of reproduction. The nature of this race is the
great work with which Cupid is occupied, unceasingly active,
speculating, and pondering. In comparison with the importance
of his great affair, which concerns the species and all coming
races, the affairs of individuals in their whole ephemeral totality
are very trifling; therefore he is always ready to sacrifice these
regardlessly. For he is related to them as an immortal to mortals,
and his interests to theirs as infinite to finite. Thus, in the
consciousness of managing affairs of a higher kind than all those
which only concern individual weal or woe, he carries them on
sublimely, undisturbed in the midst of the tumult of war, or in
the bustle of business life, or during the raging of a plague, and
pursues them even into the seclusion of the cloister.
We have seen in the above that the intensity of love increases
with its individualisation, because we have shown that the phys-
ical qualities of two individuals can be such that, for the purpose
of restoring as far as possible the type of the species, the one[361]
is quite specially and perfectly the completion or supplement of
351
the other, which therefore desires it exclusively. Already in this
case a considerable passion arises, which at once gains a nobler
and more sublime appearance from the fact that it is directed to
an individual object, and to it alone; thus, as it were, arises at the
special order of the species. For the opposite reason, the mere
sexual impulse is ignoble, because without individualisation it is
directed to all, and strives to maintain the species only as regards
quantity, with little respect to quality. But the individualising,
and with it the intensity of the love, can reach so high a degree
that without its satisfaction all the good things in the world, and
even life itself, lose their value. It is then a wish which attains a
vehemence that no other wish ever reaches, and therefore makes
one ready for any sacrifice, and in case its fulfilment remains
unalterably denied, may lead to madness or suicide. At the foun-
dation of such an excessive passion there must lie, besides the
considerations we have shown above, still others which we have
not thus before our eyes. We must therefore assume that here not
only the corporisation, but the will of the man and the intellect of
the woman are specially suitable to each other, in consequence
of which a perfectly definite individual can be produced by them
alone, whose existence the genius of the species has here in
view, for reasons which are inaccessible to us, since they lie in
the nature of the thing in itself. Or, to speak more exactly, the
will to live desires here to objectify itself in a perfectly definite
individual, which can only be produced by this father with this
mother. This metaphysical desire of the will in itself has primar-
ily no other sphere of action in the series of existences than the
hearts of the future parents, which accordingly are seized with
this ardent longing, and now imagine themselves to desire on
their own account what really for the present has only a purely
metaphysical end, i.e., an end which lies outside the series of
actually existing things. Thus it is the ardent longing to enter [362]
existence of the future individual which has first become possible
here, a longing which proceeds from the primary source of all
352 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
being, and exhibits itself in the phenomenal world as the lofty
passion of the future parents for each other, paying little regard
to all that is outside itself; in fact, as an unparalleled illusion, on
account of which such a lover would give up all the good things
of this world to enjoy the possession of this woman, who yet can
really give him nothing more than any other. That yet it is just
this possession that is kept in view here is seen from the fact that
even this lofty passion, like all others, is extinguished in its enjoy-
ment—to the great astonishment of those who are possessed by
it. It also becomes extinct when, through the woman turning out
barren (which, according to Hufeland, may arise from nineteen
accidental constitutional defects), the real metaphysical end is
frustrated; just as daily happens in millions of germs trampled
under foot, in which yet the same metaphysical life principle
strives for existence; for which there is no other consolation
than that an infinity of space, time, and matter, and consequently
inexhaustible opportunity for return, stands open to the will to
live.
The view which is here expounded must once have been
present to the mind of Theophrastus Paracelsus, even if only in
a fleeting form, though he has not handled this subject, and my
whole system of thought was foreign to him; for, in quite a differ-
ent context and in his desultory manner, he wrote the following
remarkable words: “Hi sunt, quos Deus copulavit, ut eam, quæ
fuit Uriæ et David; quamvis ex diametro (sic enim sibi humana
mens persuadebat) cum justo et legitimo matrimonio pugnaret
hoc.... sed propter Salomonem, QUI ALIUNDE NASCI NON POTUIT,
nisi ex Bathseba, conjuncto David semine, quamvis meretrice,
conjunxit eos Deus” (De vita longa, i. 5).
The longing of love, the 1ºμ¡ø¬, which the poets of all ages
are unceasingly occupied with expressing in innumerable forms,[363]
and do not exhaust the subject, nay, cannot do it justice, this
longing, which attaches the idea of endless happiness to the
possession of a particular woman, and unutterable pain to the
353
thought that this possession cannot be attained,—this longing
and this pain cannot obtain their material from the wants of an
ephemeral individual; but they are the sighs of the spirit of the
species, which sees here, to be won or lost, a means for the
attainment of its ends which cannot be replaced, and therefore
groans deeply. The species alone has infinite life, and therefore is
capable of infinite desires, infinite satisfaction, and infinite pain.
But these are here imprisoned in the narrow breast of a mortal.
No wonder, then, if such a breast seems like to burst, and can find
no expression for the intimations of infinite rapture or infinite
misery with which it is filled. This, then, affords the materials
for all erotic poetry of a sublime kind, which accordingly rises
into transcendent metaphors, soaring above all that is earthly.
This is the theme of Petrarch, the material for the St. Preuxs,
Werthers, and Jacopo Ortis, who apart from it could not be
understood nor explained. For that infinite esteem for the loved
one cannot rest upon some spiritual excellences, or in general
upon any objective, real qualities of hers; for one thing, because
she is often not sufficiently well known to the lover, as was the
case with Petrarch. The spirit of the species alone can see at one
glance what worth she has for it, for its ends. And great passions
also arise, as a rule, at the first glance:
“Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?”
—SHAKSPEARE, “As You Like it,” iii. 5.
In this regard a passage in the romance of “Guzman de Al-
farache,” by Mateo Aleman, which has been famous for 250
years, is remarkable: “No es necessario, para que uno ame, que
pase distancia de tiempo, que siga discurso, ni haga eleccion,
sino que con aquella primera y sola vista, concurran juntamente
cierta correspondencia ó consonancia, ó lo que acá solemos [364]
vulgarmente decir, una confrontacion de sangre, a que por par-
ticular influxo suelen mover las estrellas.” (For one to love it
is not necessary that much time should pass, that he should set
354 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
about reflecting and make a choice; but only that at that first and
only glance a certain correspondence and consonance should be
encountered on both sides, or that which in common life we are
wont to call a sympathy of the blood, and to which a special
influence of the stars generally impels), P. ii. lib. iii. c. 5.
Accordingly the loss of the loved one, through a rival, or through
death, is also for the passionate lover a pain that surpasses all
others, just because it is of a transcendental kind, since it affects
him not merely as an individual, but attacks him in his essentia
æterna, in the life of the species into whose special will and
service he was here called. Hence jealousy is such torment and
so grim, and the surrender of the loved one is the greatest of
all sacrifices. A hero is ashamed of all lamentations except the
lamentation of love, because in this it is not he but the species
that laments. In Calderon's “Zenobia the Great” there is in the
first act a scene between Zenobia and Decius in which the latter
says:
“Cielos, luego tu me quieres? Perdiera cien mil victorias,
Volviérame,” &c.
(Heaven! then thou lovest me? For this I would lose a
thousand victories, would turn about, &c.)
Here, honour, which hitherto outweighed every interest, is
beaten out of the field as soon as sexual love, i.e., the interest
of the species, comes into play, and sees before it a decided
advantage; for this is infinitely superior to every interest of mere
individuals, however important it may be. Therefore to this alone
honour, duty, and fidelity yield after they have withstood every
other temptation, including the threat of death. In the same way
we find in private life that conscientiousness is in no point so
rare as in this: it is here sometimes set aside even by persons[365]
who are otherwise honest and just, and adultery is recklessly
committed when passionate love, i.e., the interest of the species,
has mastered them. It even seems as if in this they believed
355
themselves to be conscious of a higher right than the interests of
individuals can ever confer; just because they act in the interest
of the species. In this reference Chamfort's remark is worth
noticing: “Quand un homme et une femme ont l'un pour l'autre
une passion violente, il me semble toujours que quelque soient
les obstacles qui les séparent, un mari, des parens, etc., les deux
amans sont l'un a l'autre, de par la Nature, qu'ils s'appartiennent
de droit divin, malgré les lois et les conventions humaines.”
Whoever is inclined to be incensed at this should be referred
to the remarkable indulgence which the Saviour shows in the
Gospel to the woman taken in adultery, in that He also assumes
the same guilt in the case of all present. From this point of view
the greater part of the “Decameron” appears as mere mocking
and jeering of the genius of the species at the rights and interests
of individuals which it tramples under foot. Differences of rank
and all similar circumstances, when they oppose the union of
passionate lovers, are set aside with the same ease and treated
as nothing by the genius of the species, which, pursuing its ends
that concern innumerable generations, blows off as spray such
human laws and scruples. From the same deep-lying grounds,
when the ends of passionate love are concerned, every danger
is willingly encountered, and those who are otherwise timorous
here become courageous. In plays and novels also we see, with
ready sympathy, the young persons who are fighting the battle
of their love, i.e., the interest of the species, gain the victory
over their elders, who are thinking only of the welfare of the
individuals. For the efforts of the lovers appear to us as much
more important, sublime, and therefore right, than anything that
can be opposed to them, as the species is more important than
the individual. Accordingly the fundamental theme of almost
all comedies is the appearance of the genius of the species [366]
with its aims, which are opposed to the personal interest of the
individuals presented, and therefore threaten to undermine their
happiness. As a rule it attains its end, which, as in accordance
356 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
with poetical justice, satisfies the spectator, because he feels
that the aims of the species are much to be preferred to those
of the individual. Therefore at the conclusion he leaves the
victorious lovers quite confidently, because he shares with them
the illusion that they have founded their own happiness, while
they have rather sacrificed it to the choice of the species, against
the will and foresight of their elders. It has been attempted in
single, abnormal comedies to reverse the matter and bring about
the happiness of the individuals at the cost of the aims of the
species; but then the spectator feels the pain which the genius of
the species suffers, and is not consoled by the advantages which
are thereby assured to the individuals. As examples of this kind
two very well-known little pieces occur to me: “La reine de 16
ans,” and “Le marriage de raison.” In tragedies containing love
affairs, since the aims of the species are frustrated, the lovers who
were its tools, generally perish also; for example, in “Romeo and
Juliet,” “Tancred,” “Don Carlos,” “Wallenstein,” “The Bride of
Messina,” and many others.
The love of a man often affords comical, and sometimes also
tragical phenomena; both because, taken possession of by the
spirit of the species, he is now ruled by this, and no longer
belongs to himself: his conduct thereby becomes unsuited to
the individual. That which in the higher grades of love imparts
such a tinge of poetry and sublimeness to his thoughts, which
gives them even a transcendental and hyperphysical tendency,
on account of which he seems to lose sight altogether of his real,
very physical aim, is at bottom this, that he is now inspired by the
spirit of the species whose affairs are infinitely more important
than all those which concern mere individuals, in order to find
under the special directions of this spirit the whole existence[367]
of an indefinitely long posterity with this individual and exactly
determined nature, which it can receive only from him as father
and the woman he loves as mother, and which otherwise could
never, as such, attain to existence, while the objectification of
357
the will to live expressly demands this existence. It is the feel-
ing that he is acting in affairs of such transcendent importance
which raises the lover so high above everything earthly, nay,
even above himself, and gives such a hyperphysical clothing to
his very physical desires, that love becomes a poetical episode
even in the life of the most prosaic man; in which last case the
matter sometimes assumes a comical aspect. That mandate of
the will which objectifies itself in the species exhibits itself in
the consciousness of the lover under the mask of the anticipation
of an infinite blessedness which is to be found for him in the
union with this female individual. Now, in the highest grades of
love this chimera becomes so radiant that if it cannot be attained
life itself loses all charm, and now appears so joyless, hollow,
and insupportable that the disgust at it even overcomes the fear
of death, so that it is then sometimes voluntarily cut short. The
will of such a man has been caught in the vortex of the will of
the species, or this has obtained such a great predominance over
the individual will that if such a man cannot be effective in the
first capacity, he disdains to be so in the last. The individual
is here too weak a vessel to be capable of enduring the infinite
longing of the will of the species concentrated upon a definite
object. In this case, therefore, the issue is suicide, sometimes
the double suicide of the two lovers; unless, to save life, nature
allows madness to intervene, which then covers with its veil the
consciousness of that hopeless state. No year passes without
proving the reality of what has been expounded by several cases
of all these kinds.
Not only, however, has the unsatisfied passion of love some- [368]
times a tragic issue, but the satisfied passion also leads oftener
to unhappiness than to happiness. For its demands often conflict
so much with the personal welfare of him who is concerned that
they undermine it, because they are incompatible with his other
circumstances, and disturb the plan of life built upon them. Nay,
not only with external circumstances is love often in contradic-
358 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
tion, but even with the lover's own individuality, for it flings
itself upon persons who, apart from the sexual relation, would
be hateful, contemptible, and even abhorrent to the lover. But
so much more powerful is the will of the species than that of
the individual that the lover shuts his eyes to all those qualities
which are repellent to him, overlooks all, ignores all, and binds
himself for ever to the object of his passion—so entirely is he
blinded by that illusion, which vanishes as soon as the will of
the species is satisfied, and leaves behind a detested companion
for life. Only from this can it be explained that we often see
very reasonable and excellent men bound to termagants and
she-devils, and cannot conceive how they could have made such
a choice. On this account the ancients represented love as blind.
Indeed, a lover may even know distinctly and feel bitterly the
faults of temperament and character of his bride, which promise
him a miserable life, and yet not be frightened away:—
“I ask not, I care not,
If guilt's in thy heart,
I know that I love thee
Whatever thou art.”
For ultimately he seeks not his own things, but those of a third
person, who has yet to come into being, although he is involved
in the illusion that what he seeks is his own affair. But it is
just this not seeking of one's own things which is everywhere
the stamp of greatness, that gives to passionate love also a touch
of sublimity, and makes it a worthy subject of poetry. Finally,
sexual love is compatible even with the extremest hatred towards
its object: therefore Plato has compared it to the love of the wolf[369]
for the sheep. This case appears when a passionate lover, in spite
of all efforts and entreaties, cannot obtain a favourable hearing
on any condition:—
“I love and hate her.”
359
—SHAKSPEARE, Cymb., iii. 5.
The hatred of the loved one which then is kindled sometimes
goes so far that the lover murders her, and then himself. One
or two examples of this generally happen every year; they will
be found in the newspapers. Therefore Goethe's lines are quite
correct:—
“By all despised love! By hellish element!
Would that I knew a worse, that I might swear by!”
It is really no hyperbole if a lover describes the coldness of
his beloved and the delight of her vanity, which feeds on his
sufferings, as cruelty; for he is under the influence of an impulse
which, akin to the instinct of insects, compels him, in spite of
all grounds of reason, to pursue his end unconditionally, and
to undervalue everything else: he cannot give it up. Not one
but many a Petrarch has there been who was compelled to drag
through life the unsatisfied ardour of love, like a fetter, an iron
weight at his foot, and breathe his sighs in lonely woods; but only
in the one Petrarch dwelt also the gift of poetry; so that Goethe's
beautiful lines hold good of him:—
“And when in misery the man was dumb
A god gave me the power to tell my sorrow.”
360 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
In fact, the genius of the species wages war throughout with
the guardian geniuses of individuals, is their pursuer and enemy,
always ready relentlessly to destroy personal happiness in order
to carry out its ends; nay, the welfare of whole nations has
sometimes been sacrificed to its humours. An example of this is
given us by Shakspeare in “Henry VI.,” pt. iii., act 3, sc. 2 and 3.
All this depends upon the fact that the species, as that in which [370]
the root of our being lies, has a closer and earlier right to us
than the individual; hence its affairs take precedence. From the
feeling of this the ancients personified the genius of the species
in Cupid, a malevolent, cruel, and therefore ill-reputed god, in
spite of his childish appearance; a capricious, despotic demon,
but yet lord of gods and men:
“£≈ ¥Ω… ∏μ…Ω ƒ≈¡±ΩΩμ ∫Ω±Ω∏¡…¿…Ω, ï¡…¬!”
(Tu, deorum hominumque tyranne, Amor!)
A deadly shot, blindness, and wings are his attributes. The
latter signify inconstancy; and this appears, as a rule, only with
the disillusion which is the consequence of satisfaction.
Because the passion depended upon an illusion, which rep-
resented that which has only value for the species as valuable
for the individual, the deception must vanish after the attainment
of the end of the species. The spirit of the species which took
possession of the individual sets it free again. Forsaken by this
spirit, the individual falls back into its original limitation and
narrowness, and sees with wonder that after such a high, heroic,
and infinite effort nothing has resulted for its pleasure but what
every sexual gratification affords. Contrary to expectation, it
finds itself no happier than before. It observes that it has been the
dupe of the will of the species. Therefore, as a rule, a Theseus
who has been made happy will forsake his Ariadne. If Petrarch's
passion had been satisfied, his song would have been silenced
from that time forth, like that of the bird as soon as the eggs are
laid.
361
Here let me remark in passing that however much my meta-
physics of love will displease the very persons who are entangled
in this passion, yet if rational considerations in general could
avail anything against it, the fundamental truth disclosed by me
would necessarily fit one more than anything else to subdue it.
But the saying of the old comedian will, no doubt, remain true:
“Quæ res in se neque consilium, neque modum habet ullum, eam [371]
consilio regere non potes.”
Marriages from love are made in the interest of the species,
not of the individuals. Certainly the persons concerned imagine
they are advancing their own happiness; but their real end is one
which is foreign to themselves, for it lies in the production of an
individual which is only possible through them. Brought togeth-
er by this aim, they ought henceforth to try to get on together
as well as possible. But very often the pair brought together
by that instinctive illusion, which is the essence of passionate
love, will, in other respects, be of very different natures. This
comes to light when the illusion vanishes, as it necessarily must.
Accordingly love marriages, as a rule, turn out unhappy; for
through them the coming generation is cared for at the expense
of the present. “Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con
dolores” (Who marries from love must live in sorrow), says
the Spanish proverb. The opposite is the case with marriages
contracted for purposes of convenience, generally in accordance
with the choice of the parents. The considerations prevailing
here, of whatever kind they may be, are at least real, and cannot
vanish of themselves. Through them, however, the happiness of
the present generation is certainly cared for, to the disadvantage
of the coming generation, and notwithstanding this it remains
problematical. The man who in his marriage looks to money
more than to the satisfaction of his inclination lives more in the
individual than in the species; which is directly opposed to the
truth; hence it appears unnatural, and excites a certain contempt.
A girl who, against the advice of her parents, rejects the offer of a
362 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
rich and not yet old man, in order, setting aside all considerations
of convenience, to choose according to her instinctive inclination
alone, sacrifices her individual welfare to the species. But just on
this account one cannot withhold from her a certain approbation;
for she has preferred what is of most importance, and has acted[372]
in the spirit of nature (more exactly, of the species), while the
parents advised in the spirit of individual egoism. In accordance
with all this, it appears as if in making a marriage either the indi-
vidual or the interests of the species must come off a loser. And
this is generally the case; for that convenience and passionate
love should go hand in hand is the rarest of lucky accidents. The
physical, moral, or intellectual deficiency of the nature of most
men may to some extent have its ground in the fact that marriages
are ordinarily entered into not from pure choice and inclination,
but from all kinds of external considerations, and on account
of accidental circumstances. If, however, besides convenience,
inclination is also to a certain extent regarded, this is, as it were,
an agreement with the genius of the species. Happy marriages
are well known to be rare; just because it lies in the nature of
marriage that its chief end is not the present but the coming
generation. However, let me add, for the consolation of tender,
loving natures, that sometimes passionate sexual love associates
itself with a feeling of an entirely different origin—real friend-
ship based upon agreement of disposition, which yet for the most
part only appears when sexual love proper is extinguished in its
satisfaction. This friendship will then generally spring from the
fact that the supplementing and corresponding physical, moral,
and intellectual qualities of the two individuals, from which
sexual love arose, with reference to the child to be produced,
are, with reference also to the individuals themselves, related to
each other in a supplementary manner as opposite qualities of
temperament and mental gifts, and thereby form the basis of a
harmony of disposition.
The whole metaphysics of love here dealt with stands in close
363
connection with my metaphysics in general, and the light which
it throws upon this may be summed up as follows.
We have seen that the careful selection for the satisfaction of
the sexual impulse, a selection which rises through innumerable [373]
degrees up to that of passionate love, depends upon the highly
serious interest which man takes in the special personal consti-
tution of the next generation. Now this exceedingly remarkable
interest confirms two truths which have been set forth in the
preceding chapters. (1.) The indestructibility of the true nature of
man, which lives on in that coming generation. For that interest
which is so lively and eager, and does not spring from reflection
and intention, but from the inmost characteristics and tendencies
of our nature, could not be so indelibly present and exercise such
great power over man if he were absolutely perishable, and were
merely followed in time by a race actually and entirely different
from him. (2.) That his true nature lies more in the species than
in the individual. For that interest in the special nature of the
species, which is the root of all love, from the passing inclination
to the serious passion, is for every one really the highest concern,
the success or failure of which touches him most sensibly; there-
fore it is called par excellence the affair of the heart. Moreover,
when this interest has expressed itself strongly and decidedly,
everything which merely concerns one's own person is postponed
and necessarily sacrificed to it. Through this, then, man shows
that the species lies closer to him than the individual, and he
lives more immediately in the former than in the latter. Why
does the lover hang with complete abandonment on the eyes of
his chosen one, and is ready to make every sacrifice for her?
Because it is his immortal part that longs after her; while it is
only his mortal part that desires everything else. That vehement
or intense longing directed to a particular woman is accordingly
an immediate pledge of the indestructibility of the kernel of our
being, and of its continued existence in the species. But to regard
this continued existence as something trifling and insufficient is
364 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
an error which arises from the fact that under the conception of
the continued life of the species one thinks nothing more than the[374]
future existence of beings similar to us, but in no regard identical
with us; and this again because, starting from knowledge directed
towards without, one takes into consideration only the external
form of the species as we apprehend it in perception, and not
its inner nature. But it is just this inner nature which lies at the
foundation of our own consciousness as its kernel, and hence
indeed is more immediate than this itself, and, as thing in itself,
free from the principium individuationis, is really the same and
identical in all individuals, whether they exist together or after
each other. Now this is the will to live, thus just that which
desires life and continuance so vehemently. This accordingly
is spared and unaffected by death. It can attain to no better
state than its present one; and consequently for it, with life, the
constant suffering and striving of the individuals is certain. To
free it from this is reserved for the denial of the will to live, as
the means by which the individual will breaks away from the
stem of the species, and surrenders that existence in it. We lack
conceptions for that which it now is; indeed all data for such
conceptions are wanting. We can only describe it as that which
is free to be will to live or not. Buddhism denotes the latter case
by the word Nirvana, the etymology of which was given in the
note at the end of chapter 41. It is the point which remains for
ever unattainable to all human knowledge, just as such.
If now, from the standpoint of this last consideration, we
contemplate the turmoil of life, we behold all occupied with its
want and misery, straining all their powers to satisfy its infinite
needs and to ward off its multifarious sorrows, yet without daring
to hope anything else than simply the preservation of this tor-
mented existence for a short span of time. In between, however,
in the midst of the tumult, we see the glances of two lovers meet
longingly: yet why so secretly, fearfully, and stealthily? Because
these lovers are the traitors who seek to perpetuate the whole[375]
365
want and drudgery, which would otherwise speedily reach an
end; this they wish to frustrate, as others like them have frustrated
it before. This consideration already passes over into the subject
of the following chapter.39
[376]
39 [The appendix to this chapter was added only in the third edition of the
German, and is meant to explain, in consistency with Schopenhauer's general
principles, the wide prevalence of the practice of pederasty, among different
nations and in different ages. It is omitted.—Trs.]
Chapter XLV.40 On The Assertion Of The
Will To Live.
If the will to live exhibited itself merely as an impulse to self-
preservation, this would only be an assertion of the individual
phenomenon for the span of time of its natural duration. The
cares and troubles of such a life would not be great, and con-
sequently existence would be easy and serene. Since, on the
contrary, the will wills life absolutely and for all time, it exhibits
itself also as sexual impulse, which has in view an endless series
of generations. This impulse does away with that carelessness,
serenity, and innocence which would accompany a merely in-
dividual existence, for it brings unrest and melancholy into the
consciousness; misfortunes, cares, and misery into the course
of life. If, on the other hand, it is voluntarily suppressed, as
we see in rare exceptions, then this is the turning of the will,
which changes its course. The will does not then transcend the
individual, but is abolished in it. Yet this can only take place
by means of the individual doing painful violence to itself. If,
however, it does take place, then the freedom from care and
the serenity of the purely individual existence is restored to the
consciousness, and indeed in a higher degree. On the other hand,
to the satisfaction of that most vehement of all impulses and
desires is linked the origin of a new existence, thus the carrying
out of life anew, with all its burdens, cares, wants, and pains;
certainly in another individual; yet if the two who are different
in the phenomenon were so absolutely and in themselves, where[377]
would then be eternal justice? Life presents itself as a problem, a
task to be worked out, and therefore, as a rule, as a constant con-
flict with necessity. Accordingly every one tries to get through
with it and come off as well as he can. He performs life as a
compulsory service which he owes. But who has contracted the
40 This chapter is connected with § 60 of the first volume.
Chapter XLV. On The Assertion Of The Will To Live. 367
debt?—His begetter, in the enjoyment of sensual pleasure. Thus,
because the one has enjoyed this, the other must live, suffer,
and die. However, we know and look back here to the fact that
the difference of the similar is conditioned by space and time,
which in this sense I have called the principium individuationis.
Otherwise eternal justice could not be vindicated. Paternal love,
on account of which the father is ready to do, to suffer, and to
risk more for his child than for himself, and at the same time
knows that he owes this, depends simply upon the fact that the
begetter recognises himself in the begotten.
The life of a man, with its endless care, want, and suffering,
is to be regarded as the explanation and paraphrase of the act
of procreation, i.e., the decided assertion of the will to live; and
further, it is also due to this that he owes to nature the debt of
death, and thinks with anxiety of this debt. Is this not evidence
of the fact that our existence involves guilt? At any rate, we
always exist, subject to the periodical payment of the toll, birth
and death, and successively partake of all the sorrows and joys
of life, so that none can escape us: this is just the fruit of the
assertion of the will to live. Thus the fear of death, which in spite
of all the miseries of life holds us firmly to it, is really illusory;
but just as illusory is the impulse which has enticed us into it.
This enticement itself may be seen objectively in the reciprocal
longing glances of two lovers; they are the purest expression of
the will to live, in its assertion. How soft and tender it is here! It
wills well-being, and quiet pleasure, and mild joys for itself, for
others, for all. It is the theme of Anacreon. Thus by allurements [378]
and flattery it makes its way into life. But when once it is there,
misery introduces crime, and crime misery; horror and desolation
fill the scene. It is the theme of Æschylus.
But now the act through which the will asserts itself and man
arises is one of which all are, in their inmost being, ashamed,
which they therefore carefully conceal; nay, if they are caught in
it, are terrified as if they had been taken in a crime. It is an action
368 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
of which in cold reflection one generally thinks with dislike, and
in a lofty mood with loathing. Reflections which in this regard
approach the matter more closely are offered by Montaigne in
the fifth chapter of the third book, under the marginal heading:
“Ce que c'est que l'amour.” A peculiar sadness and repentance
follows close upon it, is yet most perceptible after the first per-
formance of the act, and in general is the more distinct the nobler
is the character. Hence even Pliny, the pagan, says: “Homini tan-
tum primi coitus pœnitentia, augurium scilicet vitæ, a pœnitenda
origine” (Hist. Nat., x. 83). And, on the other hand, in Goethe's
“Faust,” what do devil and witches practise and sing of on their
Sabbath? Lewdness and obscenity. And in the same work (in the
admirable “Paralipomena” to “Faust”) what does incarnate Satan
preach before the assembled multitude? Lewdness and obscenity.
But simply and solely by means of the continual practice of such
an act as this does the human race subsist. If now optimism were
right, if our existence were to be thankfully recognised as the gift
of the highest goodness guided by wisdom, and accordingly in
itself praiseworthy, commendable, and agreeable, then certainly
the act which perpetuates it would necessarily have borne quite
another physiognomy. If, on the other hand, this existence is a
kind of false step or error; if it is the work of an originally blind
will, whose most fortunate development is that it comes to itself
in order to abolish itself; then the act which perpetuates that[379]
existence must appear precisely as it does appear.
With reference to the first fundamental truth of my doctrine,
the remark deserves a place here that the shame mentioned above
which attaches to the act of generation extends even to the parts
which are concerned in this, although, like all other parts, they
are given us by nature. This is again a striking proof that not
only the actions but even the body of man is to be regarded as
the manifestation, the objectification, of his will, and as its work.
For he could not be ashamed of a thing which existed without his
will.
Chapter XLV. On The Assertion Of The Will To Live. 369
The act of generation is further related to the world, as the
answer is related to the riddle. The world is wide in space and
old in time, and of an inexhaustible multiplicity of forms. Yet
all this is only the manifestation of the will to live; and the
concentration, the focus of this will is the act of generation. Thus
in this act the inner nature of the world expresses itself most
distinctly. In this regard it is indeed worth noticing that this act
itself is also distinctly called “the will” in the very significant
German phrase, “Er verlangte von ihr, sie sollte ihm zu Willen
sein” (He desired her to comply with his wishes). As the most
distinct expression of the will, then, this act is the kernel, the
compendium, the quintessence of the world. Therefore from it
we obtain light as to the nature and tendency of the world: it
is the answer to the riddle. Accordingly it is understood under
“the tree of knowledge,” for after acquaintance with it the eyes
of every one are opened as to life, as Byron also says:
“The tree of knowledge has been plucked,—all's known.”
—Don Juan, i. 128.
It is not less in keeping with this quality that it is the great
±¡¡∑ƒøΩ, the open secret, which must never and nowhere be
distinctly mentioned, but always and everywhere is understood
as the principal matter, and is therefore constantly present to [380]
the thoughts of all, wherefore also the slightest allusion to it is
instantly understood. The leading part which that act, and what is
connected with it, plays in the world, because love intrigues are
everywhere, on the one hand, pursued, and, on the other hand,
assumed, is quite in keeping with the importance of this punctum
saliens of the egg of the world. The source of the amusing is
simply the constant concealment of the chief concern.
But see now how the young, innocent, human intellect, when
that great secret of the world first becomes known to it, is startled
at the enormity! The reason of this is that in the long course
which the originally unconscious will had to traverse before it
370 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
rose to intellect, especially to human, rational intellect, it became
so strange to itself that it no longer knows its origin, that pœni-
tenda origo, and now, from the standpoint of pure, and therefore
innocent, knowing, is horrified at it.
Since now the focus of the will, i.e., its concentration and
highest expression, is the sexual impulse and its satisfaction,
this is very significantly and naïvely expressed in the symbolical
language of nature through the fact that the individualised will,
that is, the man and the brute, makes its entrance into the world
through the door of the sexual organs.
The assertion of the will to live, which accordingly has its
centre in the act of generation, is in the case of the brute infal-
lible. For the will, which is the natura naturans, first arrives
at reflection in man. To arrive at reflection means, not merely
to know the momentary necessity of the individual will, how to
serve it in the pressing present—as is the case with the brute, in
proportion to its completeness and its necessities, which go hand
in hand—but to have attained a greater breadth of knowledge,
by virtue of a distinct remembrance of the past, an approximate
anticipation of the future, and thereby a general survey of the
individual life, both one's own life and that of others, nay, of[381]
existence in general. Really the life of every species of brute,
through the thousands of years of its existence, is to a certain
extent like a single moment; for it is mere consciousness of the
present, without that of the past and the future, and consequently
without that of death. In this sense it is to be regarded as a
permanent moment, a Nunc stans. Here we see, in passing, most
distinctly that in general the form of life, or the manifestation of
the will with consciousness, is primarily and immediately merely
the present. Past and future are added only in the case of man,
and indeed merely in conception, are known in abstracto, and
perhaps illustrated by pictures of the imagination. Thus after the
will to live, i.e., the inner being of nature, in the ceaseless striving
towards complete objectification and complete enjoyment, has
Chapter XLV. On The Assertion Of The Will To Live. 371
run through the whole series of the brutes,—which often occurs
in the various periods of successive animal series each arising
anew on the same planet,—it arrives at last at reflection in the
being who is endowed with reason, man. Here now to him the
thing begins to be doubtful, the question forces itself upon him
whence and wherefore all this is, and chiefly whether the care
and misery of his life and effort is really repaid by the gain? “Le
jeu vaut-il bien la chandelle?” Accordingly here is the point at
which, in the light of distinct knowledge, he decides for the as-
sertion or denial of the will to live; although as a rule he can only
bring the latter to consciousness in a mythical form. We have
consequently no ground for assuming that a still more highly
developed objectification of the will is ever reached, anywhere;
for it has already reached its turning-point here.
[382]
Chapter XLVI.41 On The Vanity And
Suffering Of Life.
Awakened to life out of the night of unconsciousness, the will
finds itself an individual, in an endless and boundless world,
among innumerable individuals, all striving, suffering, erring;
and as if through a troubled dream it hurries back to its old
unconsciousness. Yet till then its desires are limitless, its claims
inexhaustible, and every satisfied desire gives rise to a new one.
No possible satisfaction in the world could suffice to still its
longings, set a goal to its infinite cravings, and fill the bottomless
abyss of its heart. Then let one consider what as a rule are the
satisfactions of any kind that a man obtains. For the most part
nothing more than the bare maintenance of this existence itself,
extorted day by day with unceasing trouble and constant care in
the conflict with want, and with death in prospect. Everything
in life shows that earthly happiness is destined to be frustrated
or recognised as an illusion. The grounds of this lie deep in the
nature of things. Accordingly the life of most men is troubled
and short. Those who are comparatively happy are so, for the
most part, only apparently, or else, like men of long life, they are
the rare exceptions, a possibility of which there had to be,—as
decoy-birds. Life presents itself as a continual deception in small
things as in great. If it has promised, it does not keep its word,
unless to show how little worth desiring were the things desired:[383]
thus we are deluded now by hope, now by what was hoped for.
If it has given, it did so in order to take. The enchantment of
distance shows us paradises which vanish like optical illusions
when we have allowed ourselves to be mocked by them. Hap-
piness accordingly always lies in the future, or else in the past,
41 This chapter is connected with §§ 56-59 of the first volume. Also chapters
11 and 12 of the second volume of the “Parerga and Paralipomena” should be
compared with it.
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 373
and the present may be compared to a small dark cloud which
the wind drives over the sunny plain: before and behind it all
is bright, only it itself always casts a shadow. The present is
therefore always insufficient; but the future is uncertain, and the
past irrevocable. Life with its hourly, daily, weekly, yearly, little,
greater, and great misfortunes, with its deluded hopes and its
accidents destroying all our calculations, bears so distinctly the
impression of something with which we must become disgusted,
that it is hard to conceive how one has been able to mistake this
and allow oneself to be persuaded that life is there in order to
be thankfully enjoyed, and that man exists in order to be happy.
Rather that continual illusion and disillusion, and also the nature
of life throughout, presents itself to us as intended and calculated
to awaken the conviction that nothing at all is worth our striving,
our efforts and struggles, that all good things are vanity, the
world in all its ends bankrupt, and life a business which does not
cover its expenses;—so that our will may turn away from it.
The way in which this vanity of all objects of the will makes
itself known and comprehensible to the intellect which is rooted
in the individual, is primarily time. It is the form by means of
which that vanity of things appears as their perishableness; for on
account of this all our pleasures and joys disappear in our hands,
and we afterwards ask astonished where they have remained.
That nothingness itself is therefore the only objective element
in time, i.e., that which corresponds to it in the inner nature of
things, thus that of which it is the expression. Just on this account [384]
time is the a priori necessary form of all our perceptions; in it
everything must present itself, even we ourselves. Accordingly,
first of all, our life is like a payment which one receives in
nothing but copper pence, and yet must then give a discharge for:
the copper pence are the days; the discharge is death. For at last
time makes known the judgment of nature concerning the work
of all the beings which appear in it, in that it destroys them:—
374 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
“And rightly so, for all that arises
Is worthy only of being destroyed.
Hence were it better that nothing arose.”
Thus old age and death, to which every life necessarily hurries
on, are the sentence of condemnation on the will to live, coming
from the hands of nature itself, and which declares that this will
is an effort which frustrates itself. “What thou hast wished,” it
says, “ends thus: desire something better.” Hence the instruction
which his life affords to every one consists, as a whole, in this,
that the objects of his desires continually delude, waver, and fall,
and accordingly bring more misery than joy, till at last the whole
foundation upon which they all stand gives way, in that his life
itself is destroyed and so he receives the last proof that all his
striving and wishing was a perversity, a false path:—
“Then old age and experience, hand in hand,
Lead him to death, and make him understand,
After a search so painful and so long,
That all his life he has been in the wrong.”
We shall, however, enter into the details of the matter, for it is
in these views that I have met with most contradiction. First of
all, I have to confirm by the following remarks the proof given
in the text of the negative nature of all satisfaction, thus of all
pleasure and all happiness, in opposition to the positive nature of
pain.
We feel pain, but not painlessness; we feel care, but not the[385]
absence of care; fear, but not security. We feel the wish as we
feel hunger and thirst; but as soon as it has been fulfilled, it is like
the mouthful that has been taken, which ceases to exist for our
feeling the moment it is swallowed. Pleasures and joys we miss
painfully whenever they are wanting; but pains, even when they
cease after having long been present, are not directly missed, but
at the most are intentionally thought of by means of reflection.
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 375
For only pain and want can be felt positively, and therefore
announce themselves; well-being, on the other hand, is merely
negative. Therefore we do not become conscious of the three
greatest blessings of life, health, youth, and freedom, so long as
we possess them, but only after we have lost them; for they also
are negations. We only observe that days of our life were happy
after they have given place to unhappy ones. In proportion as
pleasures increase, the susceptibility for them decreases: what
is customary is no longer felt as a pleasure. Just in this way,
however, is the susceptibility for suffering increased, for the loss
of what we are accustomed to is painfully felt. Thus the measure
of what is necessary increases through possession, and thereby
the capacity for feeling pain. The hours pass the quicker the more
agreeably they are spent, and the slower the more painfully they
are spent; because pain, not pleasure, is the positive, the presence
of which makes itself felt. In the same way we become conscious
of time when we are bored, not when we are diverted. Both these
cases prove that our existence is most happy when we perceive it
least, from which it follows that it would be better not to have it.
Great and lively joy can only be conceived as the consequence
of great misery, which has preceded it; for nothing can be added
to a state of permanent satisfaction but some amusement, or the
satisfaction of vanity. Hence all poets are obliged to bring their
heroes into anxious and painful situations, so that they may be
able to free them from them. Dramas and Epics accordingly
always describe only fighting, suffering, tormented men; and [386]
every romance is a rareeshow in which we observe the spasms
and convulsions of the agonised human heart. Walter Scott has
naïvely expressed this æsthetic necessity in the conclusion to his
novel, “Old Mortality.” Voltaire, who was so highly favoured
both by nature and fortune, says, in entire agreement with the
truth proved by me: “Le bonheur n'est qu'un rève, et la dou-
leur est réelle.” And he adds: “Il y a quatre-vingts ans que je
l'éprouve. Je n'y sais autre chose que me résigner, et me dire
376 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
que les mouches sont nées pour être mangées par les araignées,
et les hommes pour être dévorés par les chagrins.”
Before so confidently affirming that life is a blessing worth
desiring or giving thanks for, let one compare calmly the sum
of the possible pleasures which a man can enjoy in his life with
the sum of the possible sorrows which may come to him in his
life. I believe the balance will not be hard to strike. At bottom,
however, it is quite superfluous to dispute whether there is more
good or evil in the world: for the mere existence of evil decides
the matter. For the evil can never be annulled, and consequently
can never be balanced by the good which may exist along with it
or after it.
“Mille piacer' non vagliono un tormento.”—Petr.
(A thousand pleasures are not worth one torment.)
For that a thousand had lived in happiness and pleasure would
never do away with the anguish and death-agony of a single one;
and just as little does my present well-being undo my past suf-
fering. If, therefore, the evils in the world were a hundred times
less than is the case, yet their mere existence would be sufficient
to establish a truth which may be expressed in different ways,
though always somewhat indirectly, the truth that we have not to
rejoice but rather to mourn at the existence of the world;—that
its non-existence would be preferable to its existence;—that it[387]
is something which at bottom ought not to be, &c., &c. Very
beautiful is Byron's expression of this truth:—
“Our life is a false nature,—'tis not in
The harmony of things, this hard decree,
This uneradicable taint of sin,
This boundless Upas, this all-blasting tree
Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be
The skies, which rain their plagues on men like dew—
Disease, death, bondage—all the woes we see—
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 377
And worse, the woes we see not—which throb through
The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.”
If the world and life were an end in themselves, and accord-
ingly required theoretically no justification and practically no
indemnification or compensation, but existed, for instance, as
Spinoza and the Spinozists of the present day represent it, as the
single manifestation of a God, who, animi causa, or else in order
to mirror himself, undertook such an evolution of himself; and
hence its existence neither required to be justified by reasons nor
redeemed by results;—then the sufferings and miseries of life
would not indeed have to be fully equalled by the pleasures and
well-being in it; for this, as has been said, is impossible, because
my present pain is never abolished by future joys, for the latter
fill their time as the former fills its time: but there would have to
be absolutely no suffering, and death also would either have not
to be, or else to have no terrors for us. Only thus would life pay
for itself.
But since now our state is rather something which had better
not be, everything about us bears the trace of this,—just as in hell
everything smells of sulphur—for everything is always imper-
fect and illusory, everything agreeable is displaced by something
disagreeable, every enjoyment is only a half one, every pleasure
introduces its own disturbance, every relief new difficulties, ev-
ery aid of our daily and hourly need leaves us each moment in
the lurch and denies its service, the step upon which we place
our foot so often gives way under us, nay, misfortunes great [388]
and small are the element of our life; and, in a word, we are
like Phineus, whose food was all tainted and made uneatable by
the harpies.42 Two remedies for this are tried: first, μ≈ª±≤μπ±,
i.e., prudence, foresight, cunning; it does not fully instruct us, is
insufficient, and leads to defeat. Secondly, the stoical equanimity
42 All that we lay hold of resists us because it has its own will, which must be
overcome.
378 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
which seeks to arm us against all misfortunes by preparedness
for everything and contempt of all: practically it becomes cynical
renunciation, which prefers once for all to reject all means of
relief and all alleviations—it reduces us to the position of dogs,
like Diogenes in his tub. The truth is, we ought to be wretched,
and we are so. The chief source of the serious evils which affect
men is man himself: homo homini lupus. Whoever keeps this last
fact clearly in view beholds the world as a hell, which surpasses
that of Dante in this respect, that one man must be the devil of
another. For this, one is certainly more fitted than another; an
arch-fiend, indeed, more fitted than all others, appearing in the
form of a conqueror, who places several hundred thousand men
opposite each other, and says to them: “To suffer and die is your
destiny; now shoot each other with guns and cannons,” and they
do so.
In general, however, the conduct of men towards each other is
characterised as a rule by injustice, extreme unfairness, hardness,
nay, cruelty: an opposite course of conduct appears only as an
exception. Upon this depends the necessity of the State and leg-
islation, and upon none of your false pretences. But in all cases
which do not lie within the reach of the law, that regardlessness
of his like, peculiar to man, shows itself at once; a regardlessness
which springs from his boundless egoism, and sometimes also
from wickedness. How man deals with man is shown, for exam-
ple, by negro slavery, the final end of which is sugar and coffee.
But we do not need to go so far: at the age of five years to enter[389]
a cotton-spinning or other factory, and from that time forth to sit
there daily, first ten, then twelve, and ultimately fourteen hours,
performing the same mechanical labour, is to purchase dearly
the satisfaction of drawing breath. But this is the fate of millions,
and that of millions more is analogous to it.
We others, however, can be made perfectly miserable by tri-
fling misfortunes; perfectly happy, not by the world. Whatever
one may say, the happiest moment of the happy man is the
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 379
moment of his falling asleep, and the unhappiest moment of the
unhappy that of his awaking. An indirect but certain proof of the
fact that men feel themselves unhappy, and consequently are so,
is also abundantly afforded by the fearful envy which dwells in
us all, and which in all relations of life, on the occasion of any
superiority, of whatever kind it may be, is excited, and cannot
contain its poison. Because they feel themselves unhappy, men
cannot endure the sight of one whom they imagine happy; he
who for the moment feels himself happy would like to make all
around him happy also, and says:
“Que tout le monde ici soit heureux de ma joie.”
If life were in itself a blessing to be prized, and decidedly to
be preferred to non-existence, the exit from it would not need to
be guarded by such fearful sentinels as death and its terrors. But
who would continue in life as it is if death were less terrible?
And again, who could even endure the thought of death if life
were a pleasure! But thus the former has still always this good,
that it is the end of life, and we console ourselves with regard to
the suffering of life with death, and with regard to death with the
suffering of life. The truth is, that the two inseparably belong to
each other, for together they constitute a deviation from the right
path, to return to which is as difficult as it is desirable.
If the world were not something which, expressed practically,
ought not to be, it would also not be theoretically a problem; [390]
but its existence would either require no explanation, inasmuch
as it would be so entirely self-evident that wonder concerning it
or a question about it could arise in no mind, or its end would
present itself unmistakably. Instead of this, however, it is indeed
an insoluble problem; for even the most perfect philosophy will
yet always contain an unexplained element, like an insoluble
deposit or the remainder which the irrational relation of two
quantities always leaves over. Therefore if one ventures to raise
the question why there is not rather nothing than this world,
380 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the world cannot be justified from itself, no ground, no final
cause of its existence can be found in itself, it cannot be shown
that it exists for its own sake, i.e., for its own advantage. In
accordance with my teaching, this can certainly be explained
from the fact that the principle of its existence is expressly one
which is without ground, a blind will to live, which as thing in
itself cannot be made subject to the principle of sufficient reason,
which is merely the form of the phenomenon, and through which
alone every why is justified. But this also agrees with the nature
of the world, for only a blind will, no seeing will, could place
itself in the position in which we behold ourselves. A seeing will
would rather have soon made the calculation that the business
did not cover the cost, for such a mighty effort and struggle
with the straining of all the powers, under constant care, anxiety,
and want, and with the inevitable destruction of every individual
life, finds no compensation in the ephemeral existence itself,
which is so obtained, and which passes into nothing in our hands.
Hence, then, the explanation of the world from the Anaxagorean
Ωø≈¬, i.e., from a will accompanied by knowledge, necessarily
demands optimism to excuse it, which accordingly is set up and
maintained in spite of the loudly crying evidence of a whole
world full of misery. Life is there given out to be a gift, while it is
evident that every one would have declined such a gift if he could
have seen it and tested it beforehand; just as Lessing admired[391]
the understanding of his son, who, because he had absolutely
declined to enter life, had to be forcibly brought into it with the
forceps, but was scarcely there when he hurried away from it
again. On the other hand, it is then well said that life should be,
from one end to the other, only a lesson; to which, however, any
one might reply: “For this very reason I wish I had been left in
the peace of the all-sufficient nothing, where I would have had
no need of lessons or of anything else.” If indeed it should now
be added that he must one day give an account of every hour
of his life, he would be more justified in himself demanding an
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 381
account of why he had been transferred from that rest into such a
questionable, dark, anxious, and painful situation. To this, then,
we are led by false views. For human existence, far from bearing
the character of a gift, has entirely the character of a debt that has
been contracted. The calling in of this debt appears in the form
of the pressing wants, tormenting desires, and endless misery
established through this existence. As a rule, the whole lifetime
is devoted to the paying off of this debt; but this only meets the
interest. The payment of the capital takes place through death.
And when was this debt contracted? At the begetting.
Accordingly, if we regard man as a being whose existence
is a punishment and an expiation, we then view him in a right
light. The myth of the fall (although probably, like the whole
of Judaism, borrowed from the Zend-Avesta: Bundahish, 15),
is the only point in the Old Testament to which I can ascribe
metaphysical, although only allegorical, truth; indeed it is this
alone that reconciles me to the Old Testament. Our existence
resembles nothing so much as the consequence of a false step
and a guilty desire. New Testament Christianity, the ethical
spirit of which is that of Brahmanism and Buddhism, and is
therefore very foreign to the otherwise optimistic spirit of the
Old Testament, has also, very wisely, linked itself on precisely [392]
to that myth: indeed, without this it would have found no point
of connection with Judaism at all. If any one desires to measure
the degree of guilt with which our existence is tainted, then let
him look at the suffering that is connected with it. Every great
pain, whether bodily or mental, declares what we deserve: for it
could not come to us if we did not deserve it. That Christianity
also regards our existence in this light is shown by a passage
in Luther's Commentary on Galatians, chap. 3, which I only
have beside me in Latin: “Sumus autem nos omnes corporibus et
rebus subjecti Diabolo, et hospites sumus in mundo, cujus ipse
princeps et Deus est. Ideo panis, quem edimus, potus, quem
bibimus, vestes, quibus utimur, imo aër et totum quo vivimus in
382 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
carne, sub ipsius imperio est.” An outcry has been made about
the melancholy and disconsolate nature of my philosophy; yet it
lies merely in the fact that instead of inventing a future hell as the
equivalent of sin, I show that where guilt lies in the world there
is also already something akin to hell; but whoever is inclined to
deny this can easily experience it.
And to this world, to this scene of tormented and agonised
beings, who only continue to exist by devouring each other, in
which, therefore, every ravenous beast is the living grave of
thousands of others, and its self-maintenance is a chain of painful
deaths; and in which the capacity for feeling pain increases with
knowledge, and therefore reaches its highest degree in man, a
degree which is the higher the more intelligent the man is; to this
world it has been sought to apply the system of optimism, and
demonstrate to us that it is the best of all possible worlds. The
absurdity is glaring. But an optimist bids me open my eyes and
look at the world, how beautiful it is in the sunshine, with its
mountains and valleys, streams, plants, animals, &c. &c. Is the
world, then, a rareeshow? These things are certainly beautiful to
look at, but to be them is something quite different. Then comes
a teleologist, and praises to me the wise arrangement by virtue[393]
of which it is taken care that the planets do not run their heads
together, that land and sea do not get mixed into a pulp, but
are held so beautifully apart, also that everything is neither rigid
with continual frost nor roasted with heat; in the same way, that
in consequence of the obliquity of the ecliptic there is no eternal
spring, in which nothing could attain to ripeness, &c. &c. But
this and all like it are mere conditiones sine quibus non. If in
general there is to be a world at all, if its planets are to exist at
least as long as the light of a distant fixed star requires to reach
them, and are not, like Lessing's son, to depart again immediately
after birth, then certainly it must not be so clumsily constructed
that its very framework threatens to fall to pieces. But if one goes
on to the results of this applauded work, considers the players
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 383
who act upon the stage which is so durably constructed, and
now sees how with sensibility pain appears, and increases in
proportion as the sensibility develops to intelligence, and then
how, keeping pace with this, desire and suffering come out ever
more strongly, and increase till at last human life affords no other
material than this for tragedies and comedies, then whoever is
honest will scarcely be disposed to set up hallelujahs. David
Hume, in his “Natural History of Religion,” §§ 6, 7, 8, and 13,
has also exposed, mercilessly but with convincing truth, the real
though concealed source of these last. He also explains clearly
in the tenth and eleventh books of his “Dialogues on Natural
Religion,” with very pertinent arguments, which are yet of quite
a different kind from mine, the miserable nature of this world and
the untenableness of all optimism; in doing which he attacks this
in its origin. Both works of Hume's are as well worth reading as
they are unknown at the present day in Germany, where, on the
other hand, incredible pleasure is found, patriotically, in the most
disgusting nonsense of home-bred boastful mediocrities, who are
proclaimed great men. Hamann, however, translated these dia- [394]
logues; Kant went through the translation, and late in life wished
to induce Hamann's son to publish them because the translation
of Platner did not satisfy him (see Kant's biography by F. W.
Schubert, pp. 81 and 165). From every page of David Hume
there is more to be learned than from the collected philosophical
works of Hegel, Herbart, and Schleiermacher together.
The founder of systematic optimism, again, is Leibnitz whose
philosophical merit I have no intention of denying although I
have never succeeded in thinking myself into the monadology,
pre-established harmony, and identitas indiscernibilium. His
“Nouveaux essays sur l'entendement” are, however, merely an
excerpt, with a full yet weak criticism, with a view to correction,
of Locke's work which is justly of world-wide reputation. He here
opposes Locke with just as little success as he opposes Newton
in the “Tentamen de motuum cœlestium causis,” directed against
384 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the system of gravitation. The “Critique of Pure Reason” is spe-
cially directed against this Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy, and has
a polemical, nay, a destructive relation to it, just as it is related to
Locke and Hume as a continuation and further construction. That
at the present day the professors of philosophy are on all sides en-
gaged in setting Leibnitz, with his juggling, upon his legs again,
nay, in glorifying him, and, on the other hand, in depreciating and
setting aside Kant as much as possible, has its sufficient reason in
the primum vivere; the “Critique of Pure Reason” does not admit
of one giving out Judaistic mythology as philosophy, nor of one
speaking, without ceremony, of the “soul” as a given reality, a
well-known and well-accredited person, without giving account
of how one arrived at this conception, and what justification one
has for using it scientifically. But primum vivere, deinde philo-
sophari! Down with Kant, vivat our Leibnitz! To return, then,
to Leibnitz, I cannot ascribe to the Théodicée, as a methodical
and broad unfolding of optimism, any other merit than this, that
it gave occasion later for the immortal “Candide” of the great[395]
Voltaire; whereby certainly Leibnitz's often-repeated and lame
excuse for the evil of the world, that the bad sometimes brings
about the good, received a confirmation which was unexpected
by him. Even by the name of his hero Voltaire indicates that
it only requires sincerity to recognise the opposite of optimism.
Really upon this scene of sin, suffering, and death optimism
makes such an extraordinary figure that one would be forced to
regard it as irony if one had not a sufficient explanation of its
origin in the secret source of it (insincere flattery, with insulting
confidence in its success), which, as was mentioned above, is so
delightfully disclosed by Hume.
But indeed to the palpably sophistical proofs of Leibnitz that
this is the best of all possible worlds, we may seriously and
honestly oppose the proof that it is the worst of all possible
worlds. For possible means, not what one may construct in
imagination, but what can actually exist and continue. Now this
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 385
world is so arranged as to be able to maintain itself with great
difficulty; but if it were a little worse, it could no longer maintain
itself. Consequently a worse world, since it could not continue
to exist, is absolutely impossible: thus this world itself is the
worst of all possible worlds. For not only if the planets were
to run their heads together, but even if any one of the actually
appearing perturbations of their course, instead of being gradu-
ally balanced by others, continued to increase, the world would
soon reach its end. Astronomers know upon what accidental
circumstances—principally the irrational relation to each other
of the periods of revolution—this depends, and have carefully
calculated that it will always go on well; consequently the world
also can continue and go on. We will hope that, although Newton
was of an opposite opinion, they have not miscalculated, and
consequently that the mechanical perpetual motion realised in
such a planetary system will not also, like the rest, ultimately
come to a standstill. Again, under the firm crust of the planet [396]
dwell the powerful forces of nature which, as soon as some
accident affords them free play, must necessarily destroy that
crust, with everything living upon it, as has already taken place
at least three times upon our planet, and will probably take place
oftener still. The earthquake of Lisbon, the earthquake of Haiti,
the destruction of Pompeii, are only small, playful hints of what
is possible. A small alteration of the atmosphere, which cannot
even be chemically proved, causes cholera, yellow fever, black
death, &c., which carry off millions of men; a somewhat greater
alteration would extinguish all life. A very moderate increase of
heat would dry up all the rivers and springs. The brutes have
received just barely so much in the way of organs and powers as
enables them to procure with the greatest exertion sustenance for
their own lives and food for their offspring; therefore if a brute
loses a limb, or even the full use of one, it must generally perish.
Even of the human race, powerful as are the weapons it pos-
sesses in understanding and reason, nine-tenths live in constant
386 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
conflict with want, always balancing themselves with difficulty
and effort upon the brink of destruction. Thus throughout, as for
the continuance of the whole, so also for that of each individual
being the conditions are barely and scantily given, but nothing
over. The individual life is a ceaseless battle for existence itself;
while at every step destruction threatens it. Just because this
threat is so often fulfilled provision had to be made, by means
of the enormous excess of the germs, that the destruction of
the individuals should not involve that of the species, for which
alone nature really cares. The world is therefore as bad as it
possibly can be if it is to continue to be at all. Q. E. D. The fossils
of the entirely different kinds of animal species which formerly
inhabited the planet afford us, as a proof of our calculation,
the records of worlds the continuance of which was no longer
possible, and which consequently were somewhat worse than[397]
the worst of possible worlds.
Optimism is at bottom the unmerited self-praise of the real
originator of the world, the will to live, which views itself com-
placently in its works; and accordingly it is not only a false,
but also a pernicious doctrine. For it presents life to us as a
desirable condition, and the happiness of man as the end of it.
Starting from this, every one then believes that he has the most
just claim to happiness and pleasure; and if, as is wont to happen,
these do not fall to his lot, then he believes that he is wronged,
nay, that he loses the end of his existence; while it is far more
correct to regard work, privation, misery, and suffering, crowned
by death, as the end of our life (as Brahmanism and Buddhism,
and also genuine Christianity do); for it is these which lead to
the denial of the will to live. In the New Testament the world
is represented as a valley of tears, life as a process of purifying
or refining, and the symbol of Christianity is an instrument of
torture. Therefore, when Leibnitz, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke,
and Pope brought forward optimism, the general offence which
it gave depended principally upon the fact that optimism is ir-
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 387
reconcilable with Christianity; as Voltaire states and explains in
the preface to his excellent poem, “Le désastre de Lisbonne,”
which is also expressly directed against optimism. This great
man, whom I so gladly praise, in opposition to the abuse of venal
German ink-slingers, is placed decidedly higher than Rousseau
by the insight to which he attained in three respects, and which
prove the greater depth of his thinking: (1) the recognition of
the preponderating magnitude of the evil and misery of existence
with which he is deeply penetrated; (2) that of the strict necessity
of the acts of will; (3) that of the truth of Locke's principle,
that what thinks may also be material: while Rousseau opposes
all this with declamations in his “Profession de foi du vicaire
Savoyard,” a superficial Protestant pastor's philosophy; as he
also in the same spirit attacks the beautiful poem of Voltaire [398]
which has just been referred to with ill-founded, shallow, and
logically false reasoning, in the interests of optimism, in his long
letter to Voltaire of 18th August 1756, which is devoted simply
to this purpose. Indeed, the fundamental characteristic and the
¿¡…ƒøΩ »μ≈¥ø¬ of Rousseau's whole philosophy is this, that in
the place of the Christian doctrine of original sin, and the original
depravity of the human race, he puts an original goodness and
unlimited perfectibility of it, which has only been led astray by
civilisation and its consequences, and then founds upon this his
optimism and humanism.
As in “Candide” Voltaire wages war in his facetious manner
against optimism, Byron has also done so in his serious and tragic
style, in his immortal masterpiece, “Cain,” on account of which
he also has been honoured with the invectives of the obscurantist,
Friedrich Schlegel. If now, in conclusion, to confirm my view, I
were to give what has been said by great men of all ages in this
anti-optimistic spirit, there would be no end to the quotations, for
almost every one of them has expressed in strong language his
knowledge of the misery of this world. Thus, not to confirm, but
merely to embellish this chapter, a few quotations of this kind
388 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
may be given at the end of it.
First of all, let me mention here that the Greeks, far as they
were from the Christian and lofty Asiatic conception of the world,
and although they decidedly stood at the point of view of the as-
sertion of the will, were yet deeply affected by the wretchedness
of existence. This is shown even by the invention of tragedy,
which belongs to them. Another proof of it is afforded us by the
custom of the Thracians, which is first mentioned by Herodotus,
though often referred to afterwards—the custom of welcoming
the new-born child with lamentations, and recounting all the evils
which now lie before it; and, on the other hand, burying the dead
with mirth and jesting, because they are no longer exposed to so
many and great sufferings. In a beautiful poem preserved for us[399]
by Plutarch (De audiend. poët. in fine) this runs thus:—
“§øΩ ∆≈Ωƒ± ∏¡∑ΩμπΩ, μπ¬ A√Ω μ¡«μƒ±π ∫±∫±
§øΩ ¥Ω±≈ ∏±ΩøΩƒ± ∫±π ¿øΩ…Ω ¿μ¿±≈ºμΩøΩ

(Lugere genitum, tanta qui intrarit mala:
At morte si quis finiisset miserias,
Hunc laude amicos atque lætitia exsequi.)
It is not to be attributed to historical relationship, but to the
moral identity of the matter, that the Mexicans welcomed the
new-born child with the words, “My child, thou art born to en-
dure; therefore endure, suffer, and keep silence.” And, following
the same feeling, Swift (as Walter Scott relates in his Life of
Swift) early adopted the custom of keeping his birthday not as a
time of joy but of sadness, and of reading on that day the passage
of the Bible in which Job laments and curses the day on which it
was said in the house of his father a man-child is born.
Well known and too long for quotation is the passage in
the “Apology of Socrates,” in which Plato makes this wisest of
mortals say that death, even if it deprives us of consciousness
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 389
for ever, would be a wonderful gain, for a deep, dreamless sleep
every day is to be preferred even to the happiest life.
A saying of Heraclitus runs: “§Û ø≈Ω ≤πÛ øΩøº± ºμΩ ≤πø¬,
μ¡≥øΩ ¥μ ∏±Ω±ƒø¬.” (Vitæ nomen quidem est vita, opus autem
mors. Etymologicum magnum, voce íπø¬; also Eustath. ad Iliad.,

The beautiful lines of the “Theogony” are famous:—

Sophocles, in “Œdipus Colonus” (1225), has the following

Even Pliny says: “Quapropter hoc primum quisque in remediis
animi sui habeat, ex omnibus bonis, quæ homini natura tribuit,
nullum melius esse tempestiva morte” (Hist. Nat. 28, 2).
Shakspeare puts the words in the mouth of the old king Henry
IV.:—
“O heaven! that one might read the book of fate,
And see the revolution of the times,
... how chances mock,
And changes fill the cup of alteration
With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
The happiest youth,—viewing his progress through,
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,—
Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.”
Finally, Byron:—
“Count o'er the joys thine hours have seen,
Count o'er thy days from anguish free,
And know, whatever thou hast been,
'Tis something better not to be.”

Baltazar Gracian also brings the misery of our existence before
our eyes in the darkest colours in the “Criticon,” Parte i., Crisi 5,
just at the beginning, and Crisi 7 at the end, where he explicitly
represents life as a tragic farce.
Yet no one has so thoroughly and exhaustively handled this
subject as, in our own day, Leopardi. He is entirely filled
and penetrated by it: his theme is everywhere the mockery and
wretchedness of this existence; he presents it upon every page of
his works, yet in such a multiplicity of forms and applications,
with such wealth of imagery that he never wearies us, but, on the
contrary, is throughout entertaining and exciting.
[402]
Chapter XLVII.43 On Ethics.
Here is the great gap which occurs in these supplements, on
account of the circumstance that I have already dealt with moral
philosophy in the narrower sense in the two prize essays published
under the title, “Die Grundprobleme der Ethik,” an acquaintance
with which is assumed, as I have said, in order to avoid useless
repetition. Therefore there only remains for me here a small
gleaning of isolated reflections which could not be discussed in
that work, the contents of which were, in the main, prescribed
by the Academies; least of all those reflections which demand a
higher point of view than that which is common to all, and which
I was there obliged to adhere to. Accordingly it will not surprise
the reader to find these reflections here in a very fragmentary
collection. This collection again has been continued in the eighth
and ninth chapters of the second volume of the Parerga.
That moral investigations are incomparably more difficult
than physical, and in general than any others, results from the
fact that they are almost immediately concerned with the thing
in itself, namely, with that manifestation of it in which, directly
discovered by the light of knowledge, it reveals its nature as will.
Physical truths, on the other hand, remain entirely in the province
of the idea, i.e., of the phenomenon, and merely show how the
lowest manifestations of the will present themselves in the idea
in conformity to law. Further, the consideration of the world[403]
from the physical side, however far and successfully it may be
pursued, is in its results without any consolation for us: on the
moral side alone is consolation to be found; for here the depths
of our own inner nature disclose themselves to the consideration.
But my philosophy is the only one which confers upon ethics
its complete and whole rights; for only if the true nature of man
is his own will, and consequently he is, in the strictest sense, his
43 This chapter is connected with §§ 55, 62, 67 of the first volume.
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 393
own work, are his deeds really entirely his and to be ascribed to
him. On the other hand, whenever he has another origin, or is
the work of a being different from himself, all his guilt falls back
upon this origin, or originator. For operari sequitur esse.
To connect the force which produces the phenomenon of the
world, and consequently determines its nature, with the morality
of the disposition or character, and thus to establish a moral
order of the world as the foundation of the physical,—this has
been since Socrates the problem of philosophy. Theism solved it
in a childish manner, which could not satisfy mature humanity.
Therefore pantheism opposed itself to it whenever it ventured to
do so, and showed that nature bears in itself the power by virtue
of which it appears. With this, however, ethics had necessarily
to be given up. Spinoza, indeed, attempts here and there to
preserve it by means of sophistry, but for the most part gives it up
altogether, and, with a boldness which excites astonishment and
repugnance, explains the distinction between right and wrong,
and in general between good and evil, as merely conventional,
thus in itself empty (for example, Eth. iv., prop. 37, schol. 2).
After having met with unmerited neglect for more than a hundred
years, Spinoza has, in general, become too much esteemed in this
century through the reaction caused by the swing of the pendulum
of opinion. All pantheism must ultimately be overthrown by the
inevitable demands of ethics, and then by the evil and suffering
of the world. If the world is a theophany, then all that man, or
even the brute, does is equally divine and excellent; nothing [404]
can be censurable, and nothing more praiseworthy than the rest:
thus there is no ethics. Hence, in consequence of the revived
Spinozism of our own day, thus of pantheism, the treatment of
ethics has sunk so low and become so shallow that it has been
made a mere instruction as to the proper life of a citizen and a
member of a family, in which the ultimate end of human existence
is supposed to consist: thus in methodical, complete, smug, and
comfortable philistinism. Pantheism, indeed, has only led to such
394 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
shallow vulgarisms through the fact that (by a shameful misuse of
the e quovis ligno fit Mercurius) a common mind, Hegel, has, by
the well-known means, been falsely stamped as a great philoso-
pher, and a herd of his disciples, at first suborned, afterwards
only stupid, received his weighty words. Such outrages on the
human mind do not remain unpunished: the seed has sprouted.
In the same spirit it was then asserted that ethics should have for
its material not the conduct of individuals, but that of nations,
that this alone was a theme worthy of it. Nothing can be more
perverse than this view, which rests on the most vulgar realism.
For in every individual appears the whole undivided will to live,
the thing in itself, and the microcosm is like the macrocosm.
The masses have no more content than each individual. Ethics is
concerned not with actions and their results, but with willing, and
willing itself takes place only in the individual. Not the fate of
nations, which exists only in the phenomenon, but that of the in-
dividual is decided morally. Nations are really mere abstractions;
individuals alone actually exist. Thus, then, is pantheism related
to ethics. But the evil and misery of the world are not in accord
even with theism; hence it sought assistance from all kinds of
evasions, theodicies, which yet were irretrievably overthrown
by the arguments of Hume and Voltaire. Pantheism, however,
is completely untenable in the presence of that bad side of the
world. Only when the world is regarded entirely from without[405]
and from the physical side alone, and nothing else is kept in view
but the constant restorative order, and the comparative imperish-
ableness of the whole which is thereby introduced, is it perhaps
possible to explain it as a god, yet always only symbolically. But
if one enters within, thus considers also the subjective and moral
side, with its preponderance of want, suffering, and misery, of
dissension, wickedness, madness, and perversity, then one soon
becomes conscious with horror that the last thing imaginable one
has before one is a theophany. I, however, have shown, and
especially in my work “Ueber den Willen in der Natur” have
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 395
proved, that the force which works and acts in nature is identical
with the will in us. Thereby the moral order of the world is
brought into direct connection with the force which produces
the phenomenon of the world. For the phenomenon of the will
must exactly correspond to its nature. Upon this depends the
exposition of eternal justice given in §§ 63 and 64 of the first
volume, and the world, although subsisting by its own power,
receives throughout a moral tendency. Accordingly the problem
which has been discussed from the time of Socrates is now for
the first time really solved, and the demand of thinking reason
directed to morality is satisfied. Yet I have never professed to
propound a philosophy which leaves no questions unanswered.
In this sense philosophy is really impossible: it would be the
science of omniscience. But est quadam prodire tenus, si non
datur ultra: there is a limit to which reflection can penetrate and
can so far lighten the night of our existence, although the horizon
always remains dark. My doctrine reaches this limit in the will to
live, which in its own manifestation asserts or denies itself. To
wish, however, to go beyond this is, in my eyes, like wishing to
fly beyond the atmosphere. We must stop there; even although
new problems arise out of those which have been solved. Besides
this, however, we must refer to the fact that the validity of the [406]
principle of sufficient reason is limited to the phenomenon; this
was the theme of my first essay on that principle, which was
published as early as 1813.
I now go on to supplement particular points, and shall begin
by supporting, with two passages from classical poetry, my ex-
planation of weeping given in § 67 of the first volume, that it
springs from sympathy the object of which is one's own self.
At the end of the eighth book of the “Odyssey,” Ulysses, who
in all his many sorrows is never represented as weeping, bursts
into tears, when, still unknown, he hears his early heroic life
and deeds sung by the bard Demodocus in the palace of the
Phæacian king, for this remembrance of the brilliant period of
396 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
his life contrasts with his present wretchedness. Thus not this
itself directly, but the objective consideration of it, the picture
of his present summoned up by his past, calls forth his tears;
he feels sympathy with himself. Euripides makes the innocently
condemned Hypolytus, bemoaning his own fate, express the
same feeling:
“¶μ≈ μπ∏Ω ∑Ω μº±≈ƒøΩ ¿¡ø√≤ªμ¿μπΩ μΩ±ΩƒπøΩ
√ƒ±Ω∏Ω, a¬ μ¥±∫¡≈¬Ω, Aπ± ¿±√«øºμΩ ∫±∫±” (1084).
(Heu, si liceret mihi, me ipsum extrinsecus spectare, quanto-
pere deflerem mala, quæ patior.)
Finally, as a proof of my explanation, an anecdote may be
given here which I take from the English journal The Herald of
the 16th July 1836. A client, when he had heard his case set forth
by his counsel in court, burst into a flood of tears, and cried,
“I never knew I had suffered half so much till I heard it here
to-day.”
I have shown in § 55 of the first volume how, notwithstanding
the unalterable nature of the character, i.e., of the special funda-
mental will of a man, a real moral repentance is yet possible. I
wish, however, to add the following explanation, which I must
preface by a few definitions. Inclination is every strong suscep-
tibility of the will for motives of a certain kind. Passion is an
inclination so strong that the motives which excite it exercise a[407]
power over the will, which is stronger than that of every possible
motive that can oppose them; thus its mastery over the will
becomes absolute, and consequently with reference to it the will
is passive or suffering. It must, however, be remarked here that
passions seldom reach the degree at which they fully answer to
the definition, but rather bear their name as mere approximations
to it: therefore there are then still counter-motives which are able
at least to restrict their effect, if only they appear distinctly in
consciousness. The emotion is just as irresistible, but yet only
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 397
a passing excitement of the will, by a motive which receives its
power, not from a deeply rooted inclination, but merely from
the fact that, appearing suddenly, it excludes for the moment
the counter-effect of all other motives, for it consists of an idea,
which completely obscures all others by its excessive vividness,
or, as it were, conceals them entirely by its too close proximity,
so that they cannot enter consciousness and act on the will,
whereby, therefore, the capacity for reflection, and with it intel-
lectual freedom, is to a certain extent abolished. Accordingly the
emotion is related to the passion as delirium to madness.
Moral repentance is now conditioned by the fact that before
the act the inclination to it did not leave the intellect free scope,
because it did not allow it to contemplate clearly and fully the
counter-motives, but rather turned it ever anew to the motives
in its own favour. But now, after the act has been performed,
these motives are, by this itself, neutralised, and consequently
have become ineffective. Now reality brings before the intellect
the counter-motives as the consequences of the act which have
already appeared; and the intellect now knows that they would
have been the stronger if it had only adequately contemplated and
weighed them. Thus the man becomes conscious that he has done
what was really not in accordance with his will. This knowledge
is repentance, for he has not acted with full intellectual freedom;
for all the motives did not attain to efficiency. What excluded [408]
the motives opposed to the action was in the case of the hasty
action the emotion, and in the case of the deliberate action the
passion. It has also often depended upon the circumstance that
his reason certainly presented to him the counter-motives in the
abstract, but was not supported by a sufficiently strong imagina-
tion to present to him their whole content and true significance
in images. Examples of what has been said are the cases in
which revenge, jealousy, or avarice have led to murder. After it
is committed they are extinguished, and now justice, sympathy,
the remembrance of former friendship, raise their voices and say
398 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
all that they would have said before if they had been allowed
to speak. Then enters the bitter repentance, which says, “If it
were not done it would never happen.” An incomparable rep-
resentation of this is afforded by the old Scottish ballad, which
has also been translated by Herder, “Edward, Edward.” In an
analogous manner, the neglect of one's own good may occasion
an egotistical repentance. For example, when an otherwise unad-
visable marriage is concluded in consequence of passionate love,
which now is extinguished just by the marriage, and for the first
time the counter-motives of personal interest, lost independence,
&c., &c., come into consciousness, and speak as they would
have spoken before if they had been allowed utterance. All such
actions accordingly spring from a relative weakness of intellect,
because it lets itself be mastered by the will, just where its func-
tion as the presenter of motives ought to have been inexorably
fulfilled, without allowing itself to be disturbed by the will. The
vehemence of the will is here only indirectly the cause, in that
it interferes with the intellect, and thereby prepares for itself
repentance. The reasonableness of the character √…∆¡ø√≈Ω∑,
which is opposed to passionateness, really consists in this, that
the will never overpowers the intellect to such an extent as to
prevent it from correctly exercising its function of the distinct,
full, and clear exposition of the motives in the abstract for the[409]
reason, in the concrete for the imagination. Now this may just
as well depend upon the moderation and mildness of the will
as upon the strength of the intellect. All that is required is that
the latter should be relatively strong enough for the will that is
present, thus that the two should stand in a suitable relation to
each other.
The following explanations have still to be added to the fun-
damental characteristics of the philosophy of law expounded in
§ 62 of the first volume, and also in my prize essay on the
foundation of morals, § 17.
Those who, with Spinoza, deny that there is a right apart from
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 399
the State, confound the means for enforcing the right with the
right itself. Certainly the right is insured protection only in the
State. But it itself exists independently of the State. For by force
it can only be suppressed, never abolished. Accordingly the State
is nothing more than an institution for protection, which has
become necessary through the manifold attacks to which man is
exposed, and which he would not be able to ward off alone, but
only in union with others. So, then, the aims of the State are—
(1.) First of all, outward protection, which may just as well
become needful against lifeless forces of nature or wild beasts
as against men, consequently against other nations; although this
case is the most frequent and important, for the worst enemy
of man is man: homo homini lupus. Since, in consequence of
this aim, nations always set up the principle, in words if not
with deeds, that they wish to stand to each other in a purely
defensive, never in an aggressive relation, they recognise the law
of nations. This is at bottom nothing but natural law, in the only
sphere of its practical activity that remains to it, between nation
and nation, where it alone must reign, because its stronger son,
positive law, cannot assert itself, since it requires a judge and an
executive. Accordingly the law of nations consists of a certain
degree of morality in the dealings of nations with each other, the
maintenance of which is a question of honour for mankind. The [410]
bar at which cases based on this law are tried is that of public
opinion.
(2.) Protection within, thus protection of the members of a
State against each other, consequently security of private right,
by means of the maintenance of an honest state of things, which
consists in this, that the concentrated forces of all protect each
individual, from which arises an appearance as if all were honest,
i.e., just, thus as if no one wished to injure the others.
But, as is always the way in human affairs, the removal of one
evil generally opens the way for a new one; thus the granting
of that double protection introduces the need of a third, namely:
400 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
(3.) Protection against the protector, i.e., against him or those
to whom the society has transferred the management of the pro-
tection, thus the guarantee of public right. This appears most
completely attainable by dividing and separating from each other
the threefold unity of the protective power, thus the legislature,
the judicature, and the executive, so that each is managed by
others, and independently of the rest. The great value, indeed
the fundamental idea of the monarchy appears to me to lie in the
fact that because men remain men one must be placed so high,
and so much power, wealth, security, and absolute inviolability
given him that there remains nothing for him to desire, to hope,
and to fear for himself; whereby the egoism which dwells in
him, as in every one, is annihilated, as it were, by neutralisation,
and he is now able, as if he were no longer a man, to practise
justice, and to keep in view no longer his own but only the
public good. This is the source of the seemingly superhuman
nature that everywhere accompanies royalty, and distinguishes it
so infinitely from the mere presidency. Therefore it must also be
hereditary, not elective; partly in order that no one may see his
equal in the king; partly that the king himself may only be able to
provide for his successors by caring for the welfare of the State,
which is absolutely one with that of his family.[411]
If other ends besides that of protection, here explained, are
ascribed to the State, this may easily endanger the true end.
According to my explanation, the right of property arises only
through the expenditure of labour upon things. This truth, which
has already often been expressed, finds a noteworthy confirma-
tion in the fact that it is asserted, even in a practical regard,
in a declaration of the American ex-president, Quincey Adams,
which is to be found in the Quarterly Review of 1840, No. 130;
and also in French, in the “Bibliothèque universelle de Genêve,”
July 1840, No. 55. I will give it here in German (English of
Quarterly Review): “There are moralists who have questioned
the right of the Europeans to intrude upon the possessions of the
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 401
aboriginals in any case, and under any limitations whatsoever;
but have they maturely considered the whole subject? The Indian
right of possession itself stands, with regard to the greatest part
of the country, upon a questionable foundation. Their cultivated
fields, their constructed habitations, a space of ample sufficiency
for their subsistence, and whatever they had annexed of them-
selves by personal labour, was undoubtedly by the laws of nature
theirs. But what is the right of a huntsman to the forest of a
thousand miles over which he has accidentally ranged in quest
of prey?” &c. In the same way, those who in our own day
have seen occasion to combat communism with reasons (for
example, the Archbishop of Paris, in his pastoral of June 1851)
have always brought forward the argument that property is the
result of work, as it were only embodied work. This is further
evidence that the right of property can only be established by the
application of work to things, for only in this respect does it find
free recognition and make itself morally valid.
An entirely different kind of proof of the same truth is afforded
by the moral fact that while the law punishes poaching just as
severely as theft, and in many countries more severely, yet civil
honour, which is irrevocably lost by the latter, is really not [412]
affected by the former; but the poacher, if he has been guilty
of nothing else, is certainly tainted with a fault, but yet is not
regarded, like the thief, as dishonourable and shunned by all.
For the principles of civil honour rest upon moral and not upon
mere positive law; but game is not an object upon which labour
is bestowed, and thus also is not an object of a morally valid
possession: the right to it is therefore entirely a positive one, and
is not morally recognised.
According to my view, the principle ought to lie at the basis
of criminal law that it is not really the man but only the deed
which is punished, in order that it may not recur. The criminal is
merely the subject in whom the deed is punished, in order that
the law in consequence of which the punishment is inflicted may
402 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
retain its deterrent power. This is the meaning of the expression,
“He is forfeited to the law.” According to Kant's explanation,
which amounts to a jus talionis, it is not the deed but the man
that is punished. The penitentiary system also seeks not so much
to punish the deed as the man, in order to reform him. It thereby
sets aside the real aim of punishment, determent from the deed,
in order to attain the very problematic end of reformation. But it
is always a doubtful thing to attempt to attain two different ends
by one means: how much more so if the two are in any sense
opposite ends. Education is a benefit, punishment ought to be
an evil; the penitentiary prison is supposed to accomplish both
at once. Moreover, however large a share untutored ignorance,
combined with outward distress, may have in many crimes, yet
we dare not regard these as their principal cause, for innumer-
able persons living in the same ignorance and under absolutely
similar circumstances commit no crimes. Thus the substance of
the matter falls back upon the personal, moral character; but this,
as I have shown in my prize essay on the freedom of the will, is
absolutely unalterable. Therefore moral reformation is really not
possible, but only determent from the deed through fear. At the[413]
same time, the correction of knowledge and the awakening of
the desire to work can certainly be attained; it will appear what
effect this can produce. Besides this, it appears to me, from the
aim of punishment set forth in the text, that, when possible, the
apparent severity of the punishment should exceed the actual: but
solitary confinement achieves the reverse. Its great severity has
no witnesses, and is by no means anticipated by any one who has
not experienced it; thus it does not deter. It threatens him who is
tempted to crime by want and misery with the opposite pole of
human suffering, ennui: but, as Goethe rightly observes—
“When real affliction is our lot,
Then do we long for ennui.”
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 403
The contemplation of it will deter him just as little as the sight
of the palatial prisons which are built by honest men for rogues.
If, however, it is desired that these penitentiary prisons should
be regarded as educational institutions, then it is to be regretted
that the entrance to them is only obtained by crimes, instead of
which it ought to have preceded them.
That punishment, as Beccaria has taught, ought to bear a
proper proportion to the crime does not depend upon the fact that
it would be an expiation of it, but rather on the fact that the pledge
ought to be proportionate to the value of that for which it answers.
Therefore every one is justified in demanding the pledge of the
life of another as a guarantee for the security of his own life, but
not for the security of his property, for which the freedom, and so
forth, of another is sufficient pledge. For the security of the life of
the citizens capital punishment is therefore absolutely necessary.
Those who wish to abolish it should be answered, “First remove
murder from the world, and then capital punishment ought to
follow.” It ought also to be inflicted for the clear attempt to
murder just as for murder itself; for the law desires to punish the [414]
deed, not to revenge its consequences. In general the injury to
be guarded against affords the right measure for the punishment
which is to be threatened, but it does not give the moral baseness
of the forbidden action. Therefore the law may rightly impose
the punishment of imprisonment for allowing a flower-pot to fall
from a window, or impose hard labour for smoking in the woods
during the summer, and yet permit it in the winter. But to impose
the punishment of death, as in Poland, for shooting an ure-ox is
too much, for the maintenance of the species of ure-oxen may
not be purchased with human life. In determining the measure
of the punishment, along with the magnitude of the injury to be
guarded against, we have to consider the strength of the motives
which impel to the forbidden action. Quite a different standard
of punishment would be established if expiation, retribution, jus
talionis, were its true ground. But the criminal code ought to be
404 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
nothing but a register of counter-motives for possible criminal
actions: therefore each of these motives must decidedly outweigh
the motives which lead to these actions, and indeed so much the
more the greater the evil is which would arise from the action
to be guarded against, the stronger the temptation to it, and the
more difficult the conviction of the criminal;—always under the
correct assumption that the will is not free, but determinable by
motives;—apart from this it could not be got at at all. So much
for the philosophy of law.
In my prize essay on the freedom of the will (p. 50 seq.)
I have proved the originality and unalterableness of the inborn
character, from which the moral content of the course of life
proceeds. It is established as a fact. But in order to understand
problems in their full extent it is sometimes necessary to oppose
opposites sharply to each other. In this case, then, let one recall
how incredibly great is the inborn difference between man and
man, in a moral and in an intellectual regard. Here nobleness and
wisdom; there wickedness and stupidity. In one the goodness[415]
of the heart shines out of the eyes, or the stamp of genius is
enthroned in his countenance. The base physiognomy of another
is the impression of moral worthlessness and intellectual dulness,
imprinted by the hands of nature itself, unmistakable and inerad-
icable; he looks as if he must be ashamed of existence. But to
this outward appearance the inner being really corresponds. We
cannot possibly assume that such differences, which transform
the whole being of the man, and which nothing can abolish,
which, further, in conflict with his circumstances, determine his
course of life, could exist without guilt or merit on the part of
those affected by them, and be merely the work of chance. Even
from this it is evident that the man must be in a certain sense his
own work. But now, on the other hand, we can show the source
of these differences empirically in the nature of the parents; and
besides this, the meeting and connection of these parents has
clearly been the work of the most accidental circumstances. By
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 405
such considerations, then, we are forcibly directed to the distinc-
tion between the phenomenon and the true being of things, which
alone can contain the solution of that problem. The thing in itself
only reveals itself by means of the forms of the phenomenon;
therefore what proceeds from the thing in itself must yet appear
in those forms, thus also in the bonds of causality. Accordingly it
will present itself to us here as a mysterious and incomprehensible
guidance of things, of which the external empirical connection
would be the mere tool. Yet all that happens appears in this
empirical connection introduced by causes, thus necessarily and
determined from without, while its true ground lies in the inner
nature of what thus manifests itself. Certainly we can here see
the solution of the problem only from afar, and when we reflect
upon it we fall into an abyss of thought—as Hamlet very truly
says, “thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls.” In my essay in
the first volume of the Parerga “On the Appearance of Intention [416]
in the Fate of Individuals” I have set forth my thoughts upon this
mysterious guidance of things, a guidance which indeed can only
be conceived symbolically.
In § 14 of my prize essay on the foundation of morals there
will be found an exposition of egoism, as regards its nature; and
the following attempt to discover its root may be looked upon
as supplementary to that paragraph. Nature itself contradicts
itself directly, according as it speaks from the individual or the
universal, from within or from without, from the centre or the
periphery. It has its centre in every individual; for each individual
is the whole will to live. Therefore, even if this individual is only
an insect or a worm, nature itself speaks out of it thus: “I alone am
all in all: in my maintenance everything is involved; the rest may
perish, it is really nothing.” So speaks nature from the particular
standpoint, thus from the point of view of self-consciousness,
and upon this depends the egoism of every living thing. On the
other hand, from the universal point of view,—which is that of
the consciousness of other things, that of objective knowledge,
406 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
which for the moment looks away from the individual with
whom the knowledge is connected,—from without then, from
the periphery nature speaks thus: “The individual is nothing, and
less than nothing. I destroy millions of individuals every day, for
sport and pastime: I abandon their fate to the most capricious and
wilful of my children, chance, who harasses them at pleasure.
I produce millions of new individuals every day, without any
diminution of my productive power; just as little as the power of a
mirror is exhausted by the number of reflections of the sun, which
it casts on the wall one after another. The individual is nothing.”
Only he who knows how to really reconcile and eliminate this
patent contradiction of nature has a true answer to the question
as to the perishableness and imperishableness of his own self. I
believe I have given, in the first four chapters of this fourth book[417]
of the supplements, an adequate introduction to such knowledge.
What is said above may further be illustrated in the following
manner. Every individual, when he looks within, recognises
in his nature, which is his will, the thing in itself, therefore
that which everywhere alone is real. Accordingly he conceives
himself as the kernel and centre of the world, and regards himself
as of infinite importance. If, on the other hand, he looks without,
then he is in the province of the idea the mere phenomenon,
where he sees himself as an individual among an infinite number
of other individuals, accordingly as something very insignificant,
nay, vanishing altogether. Consequently every individual, even
the most insignificant, every I, when regarded from within, is all
in all; regarded from without, on the other hand, he is nothing,
or at least as good as nothing. Hence upon this depends the great
difference between what each one necessarily is in his own eyes
and what he is in the eyes of others, consequently the egoism
with which every one reproaches every one else.
In consequence of this egoism our fundamental error of all is
this, that with reference to each other we are reciprocally not I.
On the other hand, to be just, noble, and benevolent is nothing
Chapter XLVII. On Ethics. 407
else than to translate my metaphysics into actions. To say that
time and space are mere forms of our knowledge, not conditions
of things in themselves, is the same as to say that the doctrine of
metempsychosis, “Thou shalt one day be born as him whom thou
now injurest, and in thy turn shalt suffer like injury,” is identical
with the formula of the Brahmans, which has frequently been
mentioned, Tat twam asi, “This thou art.” All true virtue proceeds
from the immediate and intuitive knowledge of the metaphysical
identity of all beings, which I have frequently shown, especially
in § 22 of my prize essay on the foundation of morals. But just
on this account it is not the result of a special pre-eminence of
intellect; on the contrary, even the weakest intellect is sufficient
to see through the principium individuationis, which is what is [418]
required in this matter. Accordingly we may find the most ex-
cellent character even in the case of a very weak understanding.
And further, the excitement of our sympathy is accompanied by
no exertion of our intellect. It rather appears that the requisite
penetration of the principium individuationis would be present
in every one if it were not that the will opposes this, and by
virtue of its immediate mysterious and despotic influence upon
the intellect generally prevents it from arising; so that ultimately
all guilt falls back upon the will, as indeed is in conformity with
the fact.
The doctrine of metempsychosis, touched on above, deviates
from the truth merely through the circumstance that it transfers
to the future what already is now. It makes my true inner nature
exist in others only after my death, while, according to the truth,
it already lives in them now, and death merely removes the
illusion on account of which I am not aware of this; just as an
innumerable host of stars constantly shine above our heads, but
only become visible to us when the one sun near the earth has set.
From this point of view my individual existence, however much,
like that sun, it may outshine everything, appears ultimately only
as a hindrance which stands between me and the knowledge of
408 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
the true extent of my being. And because every individual, in his
knowledge, is subject to this hindrance, it is just individuation
that keeps the will to live in error as to its own nature; it is the
Mâyâ of Brahmanism. Death is a refutation of this error, and
abolishes it. I believe that at the moment of death we become
conscious that it is a mere illusion that has limited our existence
to our person. Indeed empirical traces of this may be found in
several states which are related to death by the abolition of the
concentration of consciousness in the brain, among which the
magnetic sleep is the most prominent; for in it, if it reaches a high
degree, our existence shows itself through various symptoms,
beyond our persons and in other beings, most strikingly by direct[419]
participation in the thoughts of another individual, and ultimately
even by the power of knowing the absent, the distant, and even
the future, thus by a kind of omnipresence.
Upon this metaphysical identity of the will, as the thing in
itself, in the infinite multiplicity of its phenomena, three principal
phenomena depend, which may be included under the common
name of sympathies: (1) sympathy proper, which, as I have
shown, is the basis of justice and benevolence, caritas; (2) sexual
love, with capricious selection, amor, which is the life of the
species, that asserts its precedence over that of the individual; (3)
magic, to which animal magnetism and sympathetic cures also
belong. Accordingly sympathy may be defined as the empirical
appearance of the metaphysical identity of the will, through the
physical multiplicity of its phenomena, whereby a connection
shows itself which is entirely different from that brought about
by means of the forms of the phenomenon which we comprehend
under the principle of sufficient reason.
