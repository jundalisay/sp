40 This chapter is connected with § 60 of the first volume.

If the will to live exhibited itself merely as an impulse to self-preservation, this would only be an assertion of the individual
phenomenon for the span of time of its natural duration. 

The cares and troubles of such a life would not be great, and consequently existence would be easy and serene. Since, on the
contrary, the will wills life absolutely and for all time, it exhibits
itself also as sexual impulse, which has in view an endless series
of generations. This impulse does away with that carelessness,
serenity, and innocence which would accompany a merely in-
dividual existence, for it brings unrest and melancholy into the
consciousness; misfortunes, cares, and misery into the course
of life. If, on the other hand, it is voluntarily suppressed, as
we see in rare exceptions, then this is the turning of the will,
which changes its course. The will does not then transcend the
individual, but is abolished in it. Yet this can only take place
by means of the individual doing painful violence to itself. 

If,
however, it does take place, then the freedom from care and
the serenity of the purely individual existence is restored to the
consciousness, and indeed in a higher degree. On the other hand,
to the satisfaction of that most vehement of all impulses and
desires is linked the origin of a new existence, thus the carrying
out of life anew, with all its burdens, cares, wants, and pains;
certainly in another individual; yet if the two who are different
in the phenomenon were so absolutely and in themselves, where[377]
would then be eternal justice? Life presents itself as a problem, a
task to be worked out, and therefore, as a rule, as a constant conflict with necessity. Accordingly every one tries to get through with it and come off as well as he can. He performs life as a
compulsory service which he owes. 

But who has contracted the debt?—His begetter, in the enjoyment of sensual pleasure. Thus,
because the one has enjoyed this, the other must live, suffer,
and die. However, we know and look back here to the fact that
the difference of the similar is conditioned by space and time,
which in this sense I have called the principium individuationis.
Otherwise eternal justice could not be vindicated. Paternal love,
on account of which the father is ready to do, to suffer, and to
risk more for his child than for himself, and at the same time
knows that he owes this, depends simply upon the fact that the
begetter recognises himself in the begotten.

The life of a man, with its endless care, want, and suffering,
is to be regarded as the explanation and paraphrase of the act
of procreation, i.e., the decided assertion of the will to live; and
further, it is also due to this that he owes to nature the debt of
death, and thinks with anxiety of this debt. Is this not evidence
of the fact that our existence involves guilt? At any rate, we
always exist, subject to the periodical payment of the toll, birth
and death, and successively partake of all the sorrows and joys
of life, so that none can escape us: this is just the fruit of the
assertion of the will to live. Thus the fear of death, which in spite
of all the miseries of life holds us firmly to it, is really illusory;
but just as illusory is the impulse which has enticed us into it.
This enticement itself may be seen objectively in the reciprocal
longing glances of two lovers; they are the purest expression of
the will to live, in its assertion. How soft and tender it is here! It
wills well-being, and quiet pleasure, and mild joys for itself, for
others, for all. It is the theme of Anacreon. Thus by allurements [378]
and flattery it makes its way into life. But when once it is there,
misery introduces crime, and crime misery; horror and desolation
fill the scene. It is the theme of Æschylus.

But now the act through which the will asserts itself and man
arises is one of which all are, in their inmost being, ashamed,
which they therefore carefully conceal; nay, if they are caught in
it, are terrified as if they had been taken in a crime. It is an action of which in cold reflection one generally thinks with dislike, and
in a lofty mood with loathing. Reflections which in this regard
approach the matter more closely are offered by Montaigne in
the fifth chapter of the third book, under the marginal heading:
“Ce que c'est que l'amour.” A peculiar sadness and repentance
follows close upon it, is yet most perceptible after the first per-
formance of the act, and in general is the more distinct the nobler
is the character. Hence even Pliny, the pagan, says: “Homini tan-
tum primi coitus pœnitentia, augurium scilicet vitæ, a pœnitenda
origine” (Hist. Nat., x. 83). And, on the other hand, in Goethe's
“Faust,” what do devil and witches practise and sing of on their
Sabbath? Lewdness and obscenity. And in the same work (in the
admirable “Paralipomena” to “Faust”) what does incarnate Satan
preach before the assembled multitude? Lewdness and obscenity.
But simply and solely by means of the continual practice of such
an act as this does the human race subsist. If now optimism were
right, if our existence were to be thankfully recognised as the gift
of the highest goodness guided by wisdom, and accordingly in
itself praiseworthy, commendable, and agreeable, then certainly
the act which perpetuates it would necessarily have borne quite
another physiognomy. If, on the other hand, this existence is a
kind of false step or error; if it is the work of an originally blind
will, whose most fortunate development is that it comes to itself
in order to abolish itself; then the act which perpetuates that[379]
existence must appear precisely as it does appear.

With reference to the first fundamental truth of my doctrine,
the remark deserves a place here that the shame mentioned above
which attaches to the act of generation extends even to the parts
which are concerned in this, although, like all other parts, they
are given us by nature. This is again a striking proof that not
only the actions but even the body of man is to be regarded as
the manifestation, the objectification, of his will, and as its work.
For he could not be ashamed of a thing which existed without his
will.

The act of generation is further related to the world, as the
answer is related to the riddle. The world is wide in space and
old in time, and of an inexhaustible multiplicity of forms. Yet
all this is only the manifestation of the will to live; and the
concentration, the focus of this will is the act of generation. Thus
in this act the inner nature of the world expresses itself most
distinctly. In this regard it is indeed worth noticing that this act
itself is also distinctly called “the will” in the very significant
German phrase, “Er verlangte von ihr, sie sollte ihm zu Willen
sein” (He desired her to comply with his wishes). As the most
distinct expression of the will, then, this act is the kernel, the
compendium, the quintessence of the world. Therefore from it
we obtain light as to the nature and tendency of the world: it
is the answer to the riddle. Accordingly it is understood under
“the tree of knowledge,” for after acquaintance with it the eyes
of every one are opened as to life, as Byron also says:
“The tree of knowledge has been plucked,—all's known.”
—Don Juan, i. 128.
It is not less in keeping with this quality that it is the great
±¡¡∑ƒøΩ, the open secret, which must never and nowhere be
distinctly mentioned, but always and everywhere is understood
as the principal matter, and is therefore constantly present to [380]
the thoughts of all, wherefore also the slightest allusion to it is
instantly understood. The leading part which that act, and what is
connected with it, plays in the world, because love intrigues are
everywhere, on the one hand, pursued, and, on the other hand,
assumed, is quite in keeping with the importance of this punctum
saliens of the egg of the world. The source of the amusing is
simply the constant concealment of the chief concern.
But see now how the young, innocent, human intellect, when
that great secret of the world first becomes known to it, is startled
at the enormity! The reason of this is that in the long course
which the originally unconscious will had to traverse before it rose to intellect, especially to human, rational intellect, it became
so strange to itself that it no longer knows its origin, that pœni-
tenda origo, and now, from the standpoint of pure, and therefore
innocent, knowing, is horrified at it.

Since now the focus of the will, i.e., its concentration and
highest expression, is the sexual impulse and its satisfaction,
this is very significantly and naïvely expressed in the symbolical
language of nature through the fact that the individualised will,
that is, the man and the brute, makes its entrance into the world
through the door of the sexual organs.

The assertion of the will to live, which accordingly has its
centre in the act of generation, is in the case of the brute infal-
lible. For the will, which is the natura naturans, first arrives
at reflection in man. To arrive at reflection means, not merely
to know the momentary necessity of the individual will, how to
serve it in the pressing present—as is the case with the brute, in
proportion to its completeness and its necessities, which go hand
in hand—but to have attained a greater breadth of knowledge,
by virtue of a distinct remembrance of the past, an approximate
anticipation of the future, and thereby a general survey of the
individual life, both one's own life and that of others, nay, of[381]
existence in general. Really the life of every species of brute,
through the thousands of years of its existence, is to a certain
extent like a single moment; for it is mere consciousness of the
present, without that of the past and the future, and consequently
without that of death. In this sense it is to be regarded as a
permanent moment, a Nunc stans. Here we see, in passing, most
distinctly that in general the form of life, or the manifestation of
the will with consciousness, is primarily and immediately merely
the present. Past and future are added only in the case of man,
and indeed merely in conception, are known in abstracto, and
perhaps illustrated by pictures of the imagination. Thus after the
will to live, i.e., the inner being of nature, in the ceaseless striving
towards complete objectification and complete enjoyment, has run through the whole series of the brutes,—which often occurs
in the various periods of successive animal series each arising
anew on the same planet,—it arrives at last at reflection in the
being who is endowed with reason, man. Here now to him the
thing begins to be doubtful, the question forces itself upon him
whence and wherefore all this is, and chiefly whether the care
and misery of his life and effort is really repaid by the gain? “Le
jeu vaut-il bien la chandelle?” Accordingly here is the point at
which, in the light of distinct knowledge, he decides for the as-
sertion or denial of the will to live; although as a rule he can only
bring the latter to consciousness in a mythical form. We have
consequently no ground for assuming that a still more highly
developed objectification of the will is ever reached, anywhere;
for it has already reached its turning-point here.
