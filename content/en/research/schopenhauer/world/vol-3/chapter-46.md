Awakened to life out of the night of unconsciousness, the will
finds itself an individual, in an endless and boundless world,
among innumerable individuals, all striving, suffering, erring;
and as if through a troubled dream it hurries back to its old
unconsciousness. Yet till then its desires are limitless, its claims
inexhaustible, and every satisfied desire gives rise to a new one.
No possible satisfaction in the world could suffice to still its
longings, set a goal to its infinite cravings, and fill the bottomless
abyss of its heart. Then let one consider what as a rule are the
satisfactions of any kind that a man obtains. For the most part
nothing more than the bare maintenance of this existence itself,
extorted day by day with unceasing trouble and constant care in
the conflict with want, and with death in prospect. Everything
in life shows that earthly happiness is destined to be frustrated
or recognised as an illusion. The grounds of this lie deep in the
nature of things.

Accordingly the life of most men is troubled
and short. Those who are comparatively happy are so, for the
most part, only apparently, or else, like men of long life, they are
the rare exceptions, a possibility of which there had to be,—as
decoy-birds. Life presents itself as a continual deception in small
things as in great. If it has promised, it does not keep its word,
unless to show how little worth desiring were the things desired:[383]
thus we are deluded now by hope, now by what was hoped for.
If it has given, it did so in order to take. The enchantment of
distance shows us paradises which vanish like optical illusions
when we have allowed ourselves to be mocked by them. Happiness accordingly always lies in the future, or else in the past, and the present may be compared to a small dark cloud which
the wind drives over the sunny plain: before and behind it all
is bright, only it itself always casts a shadow. The present is
therefore always insufficient; but the future is uncertain, and the
past irrevocable. Life with its hourly, daily, weekly, yearly, little,
greater, and great misfortunes, with its deluded hopes and its
accidents destroying all our calculations, bears so distinctly the
impression of something with which we must become disgusted,
that it is hard to conceive how one has been able to mistake this
and allow oneself to be persuaded that life is there in order to
be thankfully enjoyed, and that man exists in order to be happy.
Rather that continual illusion and disillusion, and also the nature
of life throughout, presents itself to us as intended and calculated
to awaken the conviction that nothing at all is worth our striving,
our efforts and struggles, that all good things are vanity, the
world in all its ends bankrupt, and life a business which does not
cover its expenses;—so that our will may turn away from it.
The way in which this vanity of all objects of the will makes
itself known and comprehensible to the intellect which is rooted
in the individual, is primarily time. It is the form by means of
which that vanity of things appears as their perishableness; for on
account of this all our pleasures and joys disappear in our hands,
and we afterwards ask astonished where they have remained.
That nothingness itself is therefore the only objective element
in time, i.e., that which corresponds to it in the inner nature of
things, thus that of which it is the expression. Just on this account [384]
time is the a priori necessary form of all our perceptions; in it
everything must present itself, even we ourselves. Accordingly,
first of all, our life is like a payment which one receives in
nothing but copper pence, and yet must then give a discharge for:
the copper pence are the days; the discharge is death. For at last
time makes known the judgment of nature concerning the work
of all the beings which appear in it, in that it destroys them:—

“And rightly so, for all that arises
Is worthy only of being destroyed.
Hence were it better that nothing arose.”

Thus old age and death, to which every life necessarily hurries
on, are the sentence of condemnation on the will to live, coming
from the hands of nature itself, and which declares that this will
is an effort which frustrates itself. “What thou hast wished,” it
says, “ends thus: desire something better.” Hence the instruction
which his life affords to every one consists, as a whole, in this,
that the objects of his desires continually delude, waver, and fall,
and accordingly bring more misery than joy, till at last the whole
foundation upon which they all stand gives way, in that his life
itself is destroyed and so he receives the last proof that all his
striving and wishing was a perversity, a false path:—
“Then old age and experience, hand in hand,
Lead him to death, and make him understand,
After a search so painful and so long,
That all his life he has been in the wrong.”
We shall, however, enter into the details of the matter, for it is
in these views that I have met with most contradiction. First of
all, I have to confirm by the following remarks the proof given
in the text of the negative nature of all satisfaction, thus of all
pleasure and all happiness, in opposition to the positive nature of
pain.
We feel pain, but not painlessness; we feel care, but not the[385]
absence of care; fear, but not security. We feel the wish as we
feel hunger and thirst; but as soon as it has been fulfilled, it is like
the mouthful that has been taken, which ceases to exist for our
feeling the moment it is swallowed. Pleasures and joys we miss
painfully whenever they are wanting; but pains, even when they
cease after having long been present, are not directly missed, but
at the most are intentionally thought of by means of reflection.

For only pain and want can be felt positively, and therefore
announce themselves; well-being, on the other hand, is merely
negative. Therefore we do not become conscious of the three
greatest blessings of life, health, youth, and freedom, so long as
we possess them, but only after we have lost them; for they also
are negations. We only observe that days of our life were happy
after they have given place to unhappy ones. In proportion as
pleasures increase, the susceptibility for them decreases: what
is customary is no longer felt as a pleasure. Just in this way,
however, is the susceptibility for suffering increased, for the loss
of what we are accustomed to is painfully felt. Thus the measure
of what is necessary increases through possession, and thereby
the capacity for feeling pain. The hours pass the quicker the more
agreeably they are spent, and the slower the more painfully they
are spent; because pain, not pleasure, is the positive, the presence
of which makes itself felt. In the same way we become conscious
of time when we are bored, not when we are diverted. Both these
cases prove that our existence is most happy when we perceive it
least, from which it follows that it would be better not to have it.
Great and lively joy can only be conceived as the consequence
of great misery, which has preceded it; for nothing can be added
to a state of permanent satisfaction but some amusement, or the
satisfaction of vanity. Hence all poets are obliged to bring their
heroes into anxious and painful situations, so that they may be
able to free them from them. Dramas and Epics accordingly
always describe only fighting, suffering, tormented men; and [386]
every romance is a rareeshow in which we observe the spasms
and convulsions of the agonised human heart. Walter Scott has
naïvely expressed this æsthetic necessity in the conclusion to his
novel, “Old Mortality.” Voltaire, who was so highly favoured
both by nature and fortune, says, in entire agreement with the
truth proved by me: “Le bonheur n'est qu'un rève, et la dou-
leur est réelle.” And he adds: “Il y a quatre-vingts ans que je
l'éprouve. Je n'y sais autre chose que me résigner, et me dire
376 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
que les mouches sont nées pour être mangées par les araignées,
et les hommes pour être dévorés par les chagrins.”
Before so confidently affirming that life is a blessing worth
desiring or giving thanks for, let one compare calmly the sum
of the possible pleasures which a man can enjoy in his life with
the sum of the possible sorrows which may come to him in his
life. I believe the balance will not be hard to strike. At bottom,
however, it is quite superfluous to dispute whether there is more
good or evil in the world: for the mere existence of evil decides
the matter. For the evil can never be annulled, and consequently
can never be balanced by the good which may exist along with it
or after it.

“Mille piacer' non vagliono un tormento.”—Petr.
(A thousand pleasures are not worth one torment.)
For that a thousand had lived in happiness and pleasure would
never do away with the anguish and death-agony of a single one;
and just as little does my present well-being undo my past suf-
fering. If, therefore, the evils in the world were a hundred times
less than is the case, yet their mere existence would be sufficient
to establish a truth which may be expressed in different ways,
though always somewhat indirectly, the truth that we have not to
rejoice but rather to mourn at the existence of the world;—that
its non-existence would be preferable to its existence;—that it[387]
is something which at bottom ought not to be, &c., &c. Very
beautiful is Byron's expression of this truth:—
“Our life is a false nature,—'tis not in
The harmony of things, this hard decree,
This uneradicable taint of sin,
This boundless Upas, this all-blasting tree

Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be
The skies, which rain their plagues on men like dew—
Disease, death, bondage—all the woes we see—
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 377
And worse, the woes we see not—which throb through
The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.”
If the world and life were an end in themselves, and accord-
ingly required theoretically no justification and practically no
indemnification or compensation, but existed, for instance, as
Spinoza and the Spinozists of the present day represent it, as the
single manifestation of a God, who, animi causa, or else in order
to mirror himself, undertook such an evolution of himself; and
hence its existence neither required to be justified by reasons nor
redeemed by results;—then the sufferings and miseries of life
would not indeed have to be fully equalled by the pleasures and
well-being in it; for this, as has been said, is impossible, because
my present pain is never abolished by future joys, for the latter
fill their time as the former fills its time: but there would have to
be absolutely no suffering, and death also would either have not
to be, or else to have no terrors for us. Only thus would life pay
for itself.
But since now our state is rather something which had better
not be, everything about us bears the trace of this,—just as in hell
everything smells of sulphur—for everything is always imper-
fect and illusory, everything agreeable is displaced by something
disagreeable, every enjoyment is only a half one, every pleasure
introduces its own disturbance, every relief new difficulties, ev-
ery aid of our daily and hourly need leaves us each moment in
the lurch and denies its service, the step upon which we place
our foot so often gives way under us, nay, misfortunes great [388]
and small are the element of our life; and, in a word, we are
like Phineus, whose food was all tainted and made uneatable by
the harpies.42 Two remedies for this are tried: first, μ≈ª±≤μπ±,
i.e., prudence, foresight, cunning; it does not fully instruct us, is
insufficient, and leads to defeat. Secondly, the stoical equanimity

42 All that we lay hold of resists us because it has its own will, which must be
overcome.

which seeks to arm us against all misfortunes by preparedness
for everything and contempt of all: practically it becomes cynical
renunciation, which prefers once for all to reject all means of
relief and all alleviations—it reduces us to the position of dogs,
like Diogenes in his tub. The truth is, we ought to be wretched,
and we are so. The chief source of the serious evils which affect
men is man himself: homo homini lupus. Whoever keeps this last
fact clearly in view beholds the world as a hell, which surpasses
that of Dante in this respect, that one man must be the devil of
another. For this, one is certainly more fitted than another; an
arch-fiend, indeed, more fitted than all others, appearing in the
form of a conqueror, who places several hundred thousand men
opposite each other, and says to them: “To suffer and die is your
destiny; now shoot each other with guns and cannons,” and they
do so.
In general, however, the conduct of men towards each other is
characterised as a rule by injustice, extreme unfairness, hardness,
nay, cruelty: an opposite course of conduct appears only as an
exception. Upon this depends the necessity of the State and leg-
islation, and upon none of your false pretences. But in all cases
which do not lie within the reach of the law, that regardlessness
of his like, peculiar to man, shows itself at once; a regardlessness
which springs from his boundless egoism, and sometimes also
from wickedness. How man deals with man is shown, for exam-
ple, by negro slavery, the final end of which is sugar and coffee.
But we do not need to go so far: at the age of five years to enter[389]
a cotton-spinning or other factory, and from that time forth to sit
there daily, first ten, then twelve, and ultimately fourteen hours,
performing the same mechanical labour, is to purchase dearly
the satisfaction of drawing breath. But this is the fate of millions,
and that of millions more is analogous to it.
We others, however, can be made perfectly miserable by tri-
fling misfortunes; perfectly happy, not by the world. Whatever
one may say, the happiest moment of the happy man is the
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 379
moment of his falling asleep, and the unhappiest moment of the
unhappy that of his awaking. An indirect but certain proof of the
fact that men feel themselves unhappy, and consequently are so,
is also abundantly afforded by the fearful envy which dwells in
us all, and which in all relations of life, on the occasion of any
superiority, of whatever kind it may be, is excited, and cannot
contain its poison. Because they feel themselves unhappy, men
cannot endure the sight of one whom they imagine happy; he
who for the moment feels himself happy would like to make all
around him happy also, and says:

“Que tout le monde ici soit heureux de ma joie.”

If life were in itself a blessing to be prized, and decidedly to
be preferred to non-existence, the exit from it would not need to
be guarded by such fearful sentinels as death and its terrors. But
who would continue in life as it is if death were less terrible?
And again, who could even endure the thought of death if life
were a pleasure! But thus the former has still always this good,
that it is the end of life, and we console ourselves with regard to
the suffering of life with death, and with regard to death with the
suffering of life. The truth is, that the two inseparably belong to
each other, for together they constitute a deviation from the right
path, to return to which is as difficult as it is desirable.
If the world were not something which, expressed practically,
ought not to be, it would also not be theoretically a problem; [390]
but its existence would either require no explanation, inasmuch
as it would be so entirely self-evident that wonder concerning it
or a question about it could arise in no mind, or its end would
present itself unmistakably. Instead of this, however, it is indeed
an insoluble problem; for even the most perfect philosophy will
yet always contain an unexplained element, like an insoluble
deposit or the remainder which the irrational relation of two
quantities always leaves over. Therefore if one ventures to raise
the question why there is not rather nothing than this world, the world cannot be justified from itself, no ground, no final
cause of its existence can be found in itself, it cannot be shown
that it exists for its own sake, i.e., for its own advantage. In
accordance with my teaching, this can certainly be explained
from the fact that the principle of its existence is expressly one
which is without ground, a blind will to live, which as thing in
itself cannot be made subject to the principle of sufficient reason,
which is merely the form of the phenomenon, and through which
alone every why is justified. But this also agrees with the nature
of the world, for only a blind will, no seeing will, could place
itself in the position in which we behold ourselves. A seeing will
would rather have soon made the calculation that the business
did not cover the cost, for such a mighty effort and struggle
with the straining of all the powers, under constant care, anxiety,
and want, and with the inevitable destruction of every individual
life, finds no compensation in the ephemeral existence itself,
which is so obtained, and which passes into nothing in our hands.
Hence, then, the explanation of the world from the Anaxagorean
Ωø≈¬, i.e., from a will accompanied by knowledge, necessarily
demands optimism to excuse it, which accordingly is set up and
maintained in spite of the loudly crying evidence of a whole
world full of misery. Life is there given out to be a gift, while it is
evident that every one would have declined such a gift if he could
have seen it and tested it beforehand; just as Lessing admired[391]
the understanding of his son, who, because he had absolutely
declined to enter life, had to be forcibly brought into it with the
forceps, but was scarcely there when he hurried away from it
again. On the other hand, it is then well said that life should be,
from one end to the other, only a lesson; to which, however, any
one might reply: “For this very reason I wish I had been left in
the peace of the all-sufficient nothing, where I would have had
no need of lessons or of anything else.” If indeed it should now
be added that he must one day give an account of every hour
of his life, he would be more justified in himself demanding an
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 381
account of why he had been transferred from that rest into such a
questionable, dark, anxious, and painful situation. To this, then,
we are led by false views. For human existence, far from bearing
the character of a gift, has entirely the character of a debt that has
been contracted. The calling in of this debt appears in the form
of the pressing wants, tormenting desires, and endless misery
established through this existence. As a rule, the whole lifetime
is devoted to the paying off of this debt; but this only meets the
interest. The payment of the capital takes place through death.

And when was this debt contracted? At the begetting.
Accordingly, if we regard man as a being whose existence
is a punishment and an expiation, we then view him in a right
light. The myth of the fall (although probably, like the whole
of Judaism, borrowed from the Zend-Avesta: Bundahish, 15),
is the only point in the Old Testament to which I can ascribe
metaphysical, although only allegorical, truth; indeed it is this
alone that reconciles me to the Old Testament. Our existence
resembles nothing so much as the consequence of a false step
and a guilty desire. New Testament Christianity, the ethical
spirit of which is that of Brahmanism and Buddhism, and is
therefore very foreign to the otherwise optimistic spirit of the
Old Testament, has also, very wisely, linked itself on precisely [392]
to that myth: indeed, without this it would have found no point
of connection with Judaism at all. If any one desires to measure
the degree of guilt with which our existence is tainted, then let
him look at the suffering that is connected with it. Every great
pain, whether bodily or mental, declares what we deserve: for it
could not come to us if we did not deserve it. That Christianity
also regards our existence in this light is shown by a passage
in Luther's Commentary on Galatians, chap. 3, which I only
have beside me in Latin: “Sumus autem nos omnes corporibus et
rebus subjecti Diabolo, et hospites sumus in mundo, cujus ipse
princeps et Deus est. Ideo panis, quem edimus, potus, quem
bibimus, vestes, quibus utimur, imo aër et totum quo vivimus in
382 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
carne, sub ipsius imperio est.” An outcry has been made about
the melancholy and disconsolate nature of my philosophy; yet it
lies merely in the fact that instead of inventing a future hell as the
equivalent of sin, I show that where guilt lies in the world there
is also already something akin to hell; but whoever is inclined to
deny this can easily experience it.

And to this world, to this scene of tormented and agonised
beings, who only continue to exist by devouring each other, in
which, therefore, every ravenous beast is the living grave of
thousands of others, and its self-maintenance is a chain of painful
deaths; and in which the capacity for feeling pain increases with
knowledge, and therefore reaches its highest degree in man, a
degree which is the higher the more intelligent the man is; to this
world it has been sought to apply the system of optimism, and
demonstrate to us that it is the best of all possible worlds. The
absurdity is glaring. But an optimist bids me open my eyes and
look at the world, how beautiful it is in the sunshine, with its
mountains and valleys, streams, plants, animals, &c. &c. Is the
world, then, a rareeshow? These things are certainly beautiful to
look at, but to be them is something quite different. Then comes
a teleologist, and praises to me the wise arrangement by virtue[393]
of which it is taken care that the planets do not run their heads
together, that land and sea do not get mixed into a pulp, but
are held so beautifully apart, also that everything is neither rigid
with continual frost nor roasted with heat; in the same way, that
in consequence of the obliquity of the ecliptic there is no eternal
spring, in which nothing could attain to ripeness, &c. &c. But
this and all like it are mere conditiones sine quibus non. If in
general there is to be a world at all, if its planets are to exist at
least as long as the light of a distant fixed star requires to reach
them, and are not, like Lessing's son, to depart again immediately
after birth, then certainly it must not be so clumsily constructed
that its very framework threatens to fall to pieces. But if one goes
on to the results of this applauded work, considers the players
Chapter XLVI. On The Vanity And Suffering Of Life. 383
who act upon the stage which is so durably constructed, and
now sees how with sensibility pain appears, and increases in
proportion as the sensibility develops to intelligence, and then
how, keeping pace with this, desire and suffering come out ever
more strongly, and increase till at last human life affords no other
material than this for tragedies and comedies, then whoever is
honest will scarcely be disposed to set up hallelujahs. David
Hume, in his “Natural History of Religion,” §§ 6, 7, 8, and 13,
has also exposed, mercilessly but with convincing truth, the real
though concealed source of these last. He also explains clearly
in the tenth and eleventh books of his “Dialogues on Natural
Religion,” with very pertinent arguments, which are yet of quite
a different kind from mine, the miserable nature of this world and
the untenableness of all optimism; in doing which he attacks this
in its origin. Both works of Hume's are as well worth reading as
they are unknown at the present day in Germany, where, on the
other hand, incredible pleasure is found, patriotically, in the most
disgusting nonsense of home-bred boastful mediocrities, who are
proclaimed great men. Hamann, however, translated these dia- [394]
logues; Kant went through the translation, and late in life wished
to induce Hamann's son to publish them because the translation
of Platner did not satisfy him (see Kant's biography by F. W.
Schubert, pp. 81 and 165). From every page of David Hume
there is more to be learned than from the collected philosophical
works of Hegel, Herbart, and Schleiermacher together.
The founder of systematic optimism, again, is Leibnitz whose
philosophical merit I have no intention of denying although I
have never succeeded in thinking myself into the monadology,
pre-established harmony, and identitas indiscernibilium. His
“Nouveaux essays sur l'entendement” are, however, merely an
excerpt, with a full yet weak criticism, with a view to correction,
of Locke's work which is justly of world-wide reputation. He here
opposes Locke with just as little success as he opposes Newton
in the “Tentamen de motuum cœlestium causis,” directed against the system of gravitation. The “Critique of Pure Reason” is specially directed against this Leibnitz-Wolfian philosophy, and has
a polemical, nay, a destructive relation to it, just as it is related to
Locke and Hume as a continuation and further construction. That
at the present day the professors of philosophy are on all sides en-
gaged in setting Leibnitz, with his juggling, upon his legs again,
nay, in glorifying him, and, on the other hand, in depreciating and
setting aside Kant as much as possible, has its sufficient reason in
the primum vivere; the “Critique of Pure Reason” does not admit
of one giving out Judaistic mythology as philosophy, nor of one
speaking, without ceremony, of the “soul” as a given reality, a
well-known and well-accredited person, without giving account
of how one arrived at this conception, and what justification one
has for using it scientifically. But primum vivere, deinde philo-
sophari! Down with Kant, vivat our Leibnitz! To return, then,
to Leibnitz, I cannot ascribe to the Théodicée, as a methodical
and broad unfolding of optimism, any other merit than this, that
it gave occasion later for the immortal “Candide” of the great[395]
Voltaire; whereby certainly Leibnitz's often-repeated and lame
excuse for the evil of the world, that the bad sometimes brings
about the good, received a confirmation which was unexpected
by him. Even by the name of his hero Voltaire indicates that
it only requires sincerity to recognise the opposite of optimism.
Really upon this scene of sin, suffering, and death optimism
makes such an extraordinary figure that one would be forced to
regard it as irony if one had not a sufficient explanation of its
origin in the secret source of it (insincere flattery, with insulting
confidence in its success), which, as was mentioned above, is so
delightfully disclosed by Hume.
But indeed to the palpably sophistical proofs of Leibnitz that
this is the best of all possible worlds, we may seriously and
honestly oppose the proof that it is the worst of all possible
worlds. For possible means, not what one may construct in
imagination, but what can actually exist and continue. 

This world is so arranged as to be able to maintain itself with great
difficulty; but if it were a little worse, it could no longer maintain
itself. Consequently a worse world, since it could not continue
to exist, is absolutely impossible: thus this world itself is the
worst of all possible worlds. For not only if the planets were
to run their heads together, but even if any one of the actually
appearing perturbations of their course, instead of being gradu-
ally balanced by others, continued to increase, the world would
soon reach its end. Astronomers know upon what accidental
circumstances—principally the irrational relation to each other
of the periods of revolution—this depends, and have carefully
calculated that it will always go on well; consequently the world
also can continue and go on. We will hope that, although Newton
was of an opposite opinion, they have not miscalculated, and
consequently that the mechanical perpetual motion realised in
such a planetary system will not also, like the rest, ultimately
come to a standstill. Again, under the firm crust of the planet dwell the powerful forces of nature which, as soon as some
accident affords them free play, must necessarily destroy that
crust, with everything living upon it, as has already taken place
at least three times upon our planet, and will probably take place
oftener still. The earthquake of Lisbon, the earthquake of Haiti,
the destruction of Pompeii, are only small, playful hints of what
is possible. A small alteration of the atmosphere, which cannot
even be chemically proved, causes cholera, yellow fever, black
death, &c., which carry off millions of men; a somewhat greater
alteration would extinguish all life. A very moderate increase of
heat would dry up all the rivers and springs. The brutes have
received just barely so much in the way of organs and powers as
enables them to procure with the greatest exertion sustenance for
their own lives and food for their offspring; therefore if a brute
loses a limb, or even the full use of one, it must generally perish.
Even of the human race, powerful as are the weapons it pos-
sesses in understanding and reason, nine-tenths live in constant
386 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
conflict with want, always balancing themselves with difficulty
and effort upon the brink of destruction. Thus throughout, as for
the continuance of the whole, so also for that of each individual
being the conditions are barely and scantily given, but nothing
over. The individual life is a ceaseless battle for existence itself;
while at every step destruction threatens it. Just because this
threat is so often fulfilled provision had to be made, by means
of the enormous excess of the germs, that the destruction of
the individuals should not involve that of the species, for which
alone nature really cares. The world is therefore as bad as it
possibly can be if it is to continue to be at all. Q. E. D. The fossils
of the entirely different kinds of animal species which formerly
inhabited the planet afford us, as a proof of our calculation,
the records of worlds the continuance of which was no longer
possible, and which consequently were somewhat worse than[397]
the worst of possible worlds.

Optimism is at bottom the unmerited self-praise of the real
originator of the world, the will to live, which views itself complacently in its works; and accordingly it is not only a false,
but also a pernicious doctrine. For it presents life to us as a
desirable condition, and the happiness of man as the end of it.
Starting from this, every one then believes that he has the most
just claim to happiness and pleasure; and if, as is wont to happen,
these do not fall to his lot, then he believes that he is wronged,
nay, that he loses the end of his existence; while it is far more
correct to regard work, privation, misery, and suffering, crowned
by death, as the end of our life (as Brahmanism and Buddhism,
and also genuine Christianity do); for it is these which lead to
the denial of the will to live. In the New Testament the world
is represented as a valley of tears, life as a process of purifying
or refining, and the symbol of Christianity is an instrument of
torture. Therefore, when Leibnitz, Shaftesbury, Bolingbroke,
and Pope brought forward optimism, the general offence which
it gave depended principally upon the fact that optimism is irreconcilable with Christianity; as Voltaire states and explains in
the preface to his excellent poem, “Le désastre de Lisbonne,” which is also expressly directed against optimism. This great
man, whom I so gladly praise, in opposition to the abuse of venal
German ink-slingers, is placed decidedly higher than Rousseau
by the insight to which he attained in three respects, and which
prove the greater depth of his thinking: (1) the recognition of
the preponderating magnitude of the evil and misery of existence
with which he is deeply penetrated; (2) that of the strict necessity
of the acts of will; (3) that of the truth of Locke's principle,
that what thinks may also be material: while Rousseau opposes
all this with declamations in his “Profession de foi du vicaire
Savoyard,” a superficial Protestant pastor's philosophy; as he
also in the same spirit attacks the beautiful poem of Voltaire [398]
which has just been referred to with ill-founded, shallow, and
logically false reasoning, in the interests of optimism, in his long
letter to Voltaire of 18th August 1756, which is devoted simply
to this purpose. Indeed, the fundamental characteristic and the
¿¡…ƒøΩ »μ≈¥ø¬ of Rousseau's whole philosophy is this, that in
the place of the Christian doctrine of original sin, and the original
depravity of the human race, he puts an original goodness and
unlimited perfectibility of it, which has only been led astray by
civilisation and its consequences, and then founds upon this his
optimism and humanism.
As in “Candide” Voltaire wages war in his facetious manner
against optimism, Byron has also done so in his serious and tragic
style, in his immortal masterpiece, “Cain,” on account of which
he also has been honoured with the invectives of the obscurantist,
Friedrich Schlegel. If now, in conclusion, to confirm my view, I
were to give what has been said by great men of all ages in this
anti-optimistic spirit, there would be no end to the quotations, for
almost every one of them has expressed in strong language his
knowledge of the misery of this world. 

Thus, not to confirm, but
merely to embellish this chapter, a few quotations of this kind may be given at the end of it.
First of all, let me mention here that the Greeks, far as they
were from the Christian and lofty Asiatic conception of the world,
and although they decidedly stood at the point of view of the as-
sertion of the will, were yet deeply affected by the wretchedness
of existence. This is shown even by the invention of tragedy,
which belongs to them. Another proof of it is afforded us by the
custom of the Thracians, which is first mentioned by Herodotus,
though often referred to afterwards—the custom of welcoming
the new-born child with lamentations, and recounting all the evils
which now lie before it; and, on the other hand, burying the dead
with mirth and jesting, because they are no longer exposed to so
many and great sufferings. In a beautiful poem preserved for us[399]
by Plutarch (De audiend. poët. in fine) this runs thus:—
“§øΩ ∆≈Ωƒ± ∏¡∑ΩμπΩ, μπ¬ A√Ω μ¡«μƒ±π ∫±∫±
§øΩ ¥Ω±≈ ∏±ΩøΩƒ± ∫±π ¿øΩ…Ω ¿μ¿±≈ºμΩøΩ
ß±π¡øΩƒ±¬ μ≈∆∑ºø≈Ωƒ±¬ μ∫¿μº¿μπΩ ¥øº…Ω.”
(Lugere genitum, tanta qui intrarit mala:
At morte si quis finiisset miserias,
Hunc laude amicos atque lætitia exsequi.)
It is not to be attributed to historical relationship, but to the
moral identity of the matter, that the Mexicans welcomed the
new-born child with the words, “My child, thou art born to en-
dure; therefore endure, suffer, and keep silence.” And, following
the same feeling, Swift (as Walter Scott relates in his Life of
Swift) early adopted the custom of keeping his birthday not as a
time of joy but of sadness, and of reading on that day the passage
of the Bible in which Job laments and curses the day on which it
was said in the house of his father a man-child is born.
Well known and too long for quotation is the passage in
the “Apology of Socrates,” in which Plato makes this wisest of
mortals say that death, even if it deprives us of consciousness for ever, would be a wonderful gain, for a deep, dreamless sleep
every day is to be preferred even to the happiest life.
A saying of Heraclitus runs: “§Û ø≈Ω ≤πÛ øΩøº± ºμΩ ≤πø¬,
μ¡≥øΩ ¥μ ∏±Ω±ƒø¬.” (Vitæ nomen quidem est vita, opus autem
mors. Etymologicum magnum, voce íπø¬; also Eustath. ad Iliad.,
i. p. 31.)

The beautiful lines of the “Theogony” are famous:—
“ë¡«∑Ω ºμΩ º∑ ∆≈Ω±π μ¿π«∏øΩπøπ√πΩ ±¡π√ƒøΩ,
ú∑¥Ω μπ√π¥μπΩ ±≈≥±¬ øæμø¬ !μªπø≈;
¶≈Ωƒ± ¥Ω A¿…¬ …∫π√ƒ± ¿≈ª±¬ ë ¥±ø ¿μ¡∑√±π,
ö±π ∫μπ√∏±π ¿øªª∑Ω ≥∑Ω μ¿±º∑√±ºμΩøΩ.”
(Optima sors homini natum non esse, nec unquam.
Adspexisse diem, flammiferumque jubar.
Altera jam genitum demitti protinus Orco,
Et pressum multa mergere corpus humo.)
[400]
Sophocles, in “Œdipus Colonus” (1225), has the following
abbreviation of the same:—
“ú∑ ∆≈Ω±π ƒøΩ ¿±Ωƒ± Ωπ∫±
ªø≥øΩ; ƒø ¥Ω μ¿μπ ∆±Ω√,
≤∑Ω±π ∫μπ∏μΩ, A∏μΩ ¿μ¡ !∫μπ,
¿øª≈ ¥μ≈ƒμ¡øΩ, a¬ ƒ±«π√ƒ±.”
(Natum non esse sortes vincit alias omnes: proxima autem
est, ubi quis in lucem editus fuerit, eodem redire, unde venit,
quam ocissime.)
Euripides says:—
“†±¬ ¥Ωø¥≈Ω∑¡ø¬ ≤πø¬ ±Ω∏¡…¿…Ω,
öΩø≈∫ μ√ƒπ ¿øΩ…Ω ±Ω±¿±≈√π¬.”
(Omnis hominum vita est plena dolore,
Nec datur laborum remissio.)
390 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
—HIPPOL, 189.
And Homer already said:—
“ü≈ ºμΩ ≥±¡ ƒπ μ√ƒπΩ ø ∂≈¡…ƒμ¡øΩ ±Ω¥¡ø¬
†±Ωƒ…Ω, A√√± ¥μ ≥±π±Ω μ¿π ¿Ωμμπ ƒμ ∫±π ¡¿μπ.”
(Non enim quidquam alicubi est calamitosius homine
Omnium, quotquot super terram spirantque et moventur.)
—II. xvii. 446.
Even Pliny says: “Quapropter hoc primum quisque in remediis
animi sui habeat, ex omnibus bonis, quæ homini natura tribuit,
nullum melius esse tempestiva morte” (Hist. Nat. 28, 2).
Shakspeare puts the words in the mouth of the old king Henry
IV.:—
“O heaven! that one might read the book of fate,
And see the revolution of the times,
... how chances mock,
And changes fill the cup of alteration
With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
The happiest youth,—viewing his progress through,
What perils past, what crosses to ensue,—
Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.”

Finally, Byron:—
“Count o'er the joys thine hours have seen,
Count o'er thy days from anguish free,
And know, whatever thou hast been,
'Tis something better not to be.”

Baltazar Gracian also brings the misery of our existence before
our eyes in the darkest colours in the “Criticon,” Parte i., Crisi 5,
just at the beginning, and Crisi 7 at the end, where he explicitly
represents life as a tragic farce.

Yet no one has so thoroughly and exhaustively handled this
subject as, in our own day, Leopardi. He is entirely filled
and penetrated by it: his theme is everywhere the mockery and
wretchedness of this existence; he presents it upon every page of
his works, yet in such a multiplicity of forms and applications,
with such wealth of imagery that he never wearies us, but, on the
contrary, is throughout entertaining and exciting.
