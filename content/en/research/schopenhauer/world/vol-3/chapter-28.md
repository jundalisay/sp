<!-- 6 This chapter is connected with § 29 of the first volume. -->

Book 2 closed with the question as to the goal and aim of that will which had shown itself to be the inner nature of all things in the world. The following remarks may serve to supplement the answer to this question given there in general terms, for they lay down the character of the will as a whole.

Such a characterisation is possible because we have recognised as the inner nature of the world something thoroughly real and empirically given. On the other hand, the very name “world-soul,” by which many have denoted that inner being, gives instead of this a mere ens rationis; for “soul” signifies an individual unity of consciousness which clearly does not be- long to that nature, and in general, since the conception “soul” supposes knowing and willing in inseparable connection and yet independent of the animal organism, it is not to be justified, and therefore not to be used. The word should never be applied except in a metaphorical sense, for it is much more insidious than »≈«∑ or anima, which signify breath.

Much more unsuitable, however, is the way in which so-called pantheists express themselves, whose whole philosophy consists chiefly in this, that they call the inner nature of the world, which is unknown to them, “God;” by which indeed they imagine they have achieved much. According to this, then, the world would be a theophany. But let one only look at it: this world of constantly needy creatures, who continue for a time only by [106] devouring one another, fulfil their existence in anxiety and want, and often suffer terrible miseries, till at last they fall into the arms of death; whoever distinctly looks upon this will allow that Aristotle was right in saying: “! ∆≈√π¬ ¥±πøºøΩπ±, ±ªªΩ ø≈ ∏μπ± μ√ƒπ” (Natura dæmonia est, non divina), De divinat., c. 2, p. 463;

nay, he will be obliged to confess that a God who could think of
changing Himself into such a world as this must certainly have
been tormented by the devil. I know well that the pretended
philosophers of this century follow Spinoza in this, and think
themselves thereby justified. But Spinoza had special reasons
for thus naming his one substance, in order, namely, to preserve
at least the word, although not the thing. The stake of Giordano
Bruno and of Vanini was still fresh in the memory; they also
had been sacrificed to that God for whose honour incomparably
more human sacrifices have bled than on the altars of all heathen
gods of both hemispheres together. If, then, Spinoza calls the
world God, it is exactly the same thing as when Rousseau in the
“Contrat social,” constantly and throughout denotes the people
by the word le souverain; we might also compare it with this, that
once a prince who intended to abolish the nobility in his land, in
order to rob no one of his own, hit upon the idea of ennobling
all his subjects. Those philosophers of our day have certainly
one other ground for the nomenclature we are speaking of, but
it is no more substantial. In their philosophising they all start,
not from the world or our consciousness of it, but from God, as
something given and known; He is not their quæsitum, but their
datum. If they were boys I would then explain to them that this
is a petitio principii, but they know this as well as I do. But since
Kant has shown that the path of the earlier dogmatism, which
proceeded honestly, the path from the world to a God, does not
lead there, these gentlemen now imagine they have found a fine
way of escape and made it cunningly. Will the reader of a later[107]
age pardon me for detaining him with persons of whom he has
never heard.

Every glance at the world, to explain which is the task of
the philosopher, confirms and proves that will to live, far from
being an arbitrary hypostasis or an empty word, is the only
true expression of its inmost nature. Everything presses and
strives towards existence, if possible organised existence, i.e., life, and after that to the highest possible grade of it. 

In animal nature it then becomes apparent that will to live is the keynote of its being, its one unchangeable and unconditioned quality. Let any one consider this universal desire for life, let him see the infinite willingness, facility, and exuberance with which the will to live presses impetuously into existence under a million forms everywhere and at every moment, by means of fructifi- cation and of germs, nay, when these are wanting, by means of generatio æquivoca, seizing every opportunity, eagerly grasping for itself every material capable of life: and then again let him cast a glance at its fearful alarm and wild rebellion when in any particular phenomenon it must pass out of existence; especially when this takes place with distinct consciousness. Then it is precisely the same as if in this single phenomenon the whole world would be annihilated for ever, and the whole being of this threatened living thing is at once transformed into the most desperate struggle against death and resistance to it. Look, for example, at the incredible anxiety of a man in danger of his life, the rapid and serious participation in this of every witness of it, and the boundless rejoicing at his deliverance. Look at the rigid terror with which a sentence of death is heard, the profound awe with which we regard the preparations for carrying it out, and the heartrending compassion which seizes us at the execution itself.

We would then suppose there was something quite different in question than a few less years of an empty, sad existence, embittered by troubles of every kind, and always uncertain: we [108] would rather be amazed that it was a matter of any consequence whether one attained a few years earlier to the place where after an ephemeral existence he has billions of years to be. In such phenomena, then, it becomes visible that I am right in declaring that the will to live is that which cannot be further explained, but lies at the foundation of all explanations, and that this, far from being an empty word, like the absolute, the infinite, the idea, and similar expressions, is the most real thing we know, nay, the kernel of reality itself.

But if now, abstracting for a while from this interpretation drawn from our inner being, we place ourselves as strangers over against nature, in order to comprehend it objectively, we find that from the grade of organised life upwards it has only one intention—that of the maintenance of the species. To this end it works, through the immense superfluity of germs, through the urgent vehemence of the sexual instinct, through its willingness to adapt itself to all circumstances and opportunities, even to the production of bastards, and through the instinctive maternal affection, the strength of which is so great that in many kinds of animals it even outweighs self-love, so that the mother sacrifices her life in order to preserve that of the young. The individual, on the contrary, has for nature only an indirect value, only so far as it is the means of maintaining the species. Apart from this its existence is to nature a matter of indifference; indeed nature even leads it to destruction as soon as it has ceased to be useful for this end. Why the individual exists would thus be clear; but why does the species itself exist? That is a question which nature when considered merely objectively cannot answer. For in vain do we seek by contemplating her for an end of this restless striving, this ceaseless pressing into existence, this anxious care for the main- tenance of the species.

The strength and time of the individuals are consumed in the effort to procure sustenance for themselves and their young, and are only just sufficient, sometimes even not[109] sufficient, for this. Even if here and there a surplus of strength, and therefore of comfort—in the case of the one rational species also of knowledge—remains, this is much too insignificant to pass for the end of that whole process of nature. The whole thing, when regarded thus purely objectively, and indeed as extraneous to us, looks as if nature was only concerned that of all her (Platonic) Ideas, i.e., permanent forms, none should be lost. Accordingly, as if she had so thoroughly satisfied herself with the fortunate discovery and combination of these Ideas (for which the three preceding occasions on which she stocked the earth's surface with animals were only the preparation), that now her only fear is lest any one of these beautiful fancies should be lost, i.e., lest any one of these forms should disappear from time and the causal series. For the individuals are fleeting as the water in the brook; the Ideas, on the contrary, are permanent, like its eddies: but the exhaustion of the water would also do away with the eddies. We would have to stop at this unintelligible view if nature were known to us only from without, thus were given us merely objectively, and we accepted it as it is comprehended by knowledge, and also as sprung from knowledge, i.e., in the sphere of the idea, and were therefore obliged to confine ourselves to this province in solving it. But the case is otherwise, and a glance at any rate is afforded us into the interior of nature; inasmuch as this is nothing else than our own inner being, which is precisely where nature, arrived at the highest grade to which its striving could work itself up, is now by the light of knowledge found directly in self-consciousness. Here the will shows itself to us as something toto genere different from the idea, in which nature appears unfolded in all her (Platonic) Ideas; and it now gives us, at one stroke, the explanation which could never be found upon the objective path of the idea. Thus the subjective here gives the key for the exposition of the objective. In order to recognise, as something original and unconditioned, that exceedingly strong tendency of all animals and men to retain life and carry it on [110] as long as possible—a tendency which was set forth above as characteristic of the subjective, or of the will—it is necessary to make clear to ourselves that this is by no means the result of any objective knowledge of the worth of life, but is independent of all knowledge; or, in other words, that those beings exhibit themselves, not as drawn from in front, but as impelled from behind.

If with this intention we first of all review the interminable series of animals, consider the infinite variety of their forms, as they exhibit themselves always differently modified according to their element and manner of life, and also ponder the inimitable ingenuity of their structure and mechanism, which is carried out with equal perfection in every individual; and finally, if we take into consideration the incredible expenditure of strength, dexterity, prudence, and activity which every animal has cease- lessly to make through its whole life; if, approaching the matter more closely, we contemplate the untiring diligence of wretched little ants, the marvellous and ingenious industry of the bees, or observe how a single burying-beetle (Necrophorus vespillo) buries a mole of forty times its own size in two days in order to deposit its eggs in it and insure nourishment for the future brood (Gleditsch, Physik. Bot. Œkon. Abhandl., iii. 220), at the same time calling to mind how the life of most insects is nothing but ceaseless labour to prepare food and an abode for the future brood which will arise from their eggs, and which then, after they have consumed the food and passed through the chrysalis state, enter upon life merely to begin again from the beginning the same labour; then also how, like this, the life of the birds is for the most part taken up with their distant and laborious migrations, then with the building of their nests and the collecting of food for the brood, which itself has to play the same rôle the following year; and so all work constantly for the future, which afterwards makes bankrupt;—then we cannot avoid looking round for the reward[111] of all this skill and trouble, for the end which these animals have before their eyes, which strive so ceaselessly—in short, we are driven to ask: What is the result? what is attained by the animal existence which demands such infinite preparation? And there is nothing to point to but the satisfaction of hunger and the sexual instinct, or in any case a little momentary comfort, as it falls to the lot of each animal individual, now and then in the intervals of its endless need and struggle. If we place the two together, the indescribable ingenuity of the preparations, the enormous abundance of the means, and the insufficiency of what is thereby aimed at and attained, the insight presses itself upon us that life is a business, the proceeds of which are very far from covering the cost of it. This becomes most evident in some animals of a specially simple manner of life. Take, for example, the mole, that unwearied worker.

To dig with all its might with its enormous
shovel claws is the occupation of its whole life; constant night
surrounds it; its embryo eyes only make it avoid the light. It alone
is truly an animal nocturnum; not cats, owls, and bats, who see
by night. But what, now, does it attain by this life, full of trouble
and devoid of pleasure? Food and the begetting of its kind; thus
only the means of carrying on and beginning anew the same
doleful course in new individuals. In such examples it becomes
clear that there is no proportion between the cares and troubles of
life and the results or gain of it. The consciousness of the world
of perception gives a certain appearance of objective worth of
existence to the life of those animals which can see, although in
their case this consciousness is entirely subjective and limited
to the influence of motives upon them. But the blind mole,
with its perfect organisation and ceaseless activity, limited to the
alternation of insect larvæ and hunger, makes the disproportion
of the means to the end apparent. In this respect the consideration
of the animal world left to itself in lands uninhabited by men
is also specially instructive. A beautiful picture of this, and [112]
of the suffering which nature prepares for herself without the
interference of man, is given by Humboldt in his “Ansichten der
Natur” (second edition, p. 30 et seq.); nor does he neglect to cast
a glance (p. 44) at the analogous suffering of the human race,
always and everywhere at variance with itself. Yet in the simple
and easily surveyed life of the brutes the emptiness and vanity
of the struggle of the whole phenomenon is more easily grasped.
The variety of the organisations, the ingenuity of the means,
whereby each is adapted to its element and its prey contrasts here
distinctly with the want of any lasting final aim; instead of which
there presents itself only momentary comfort, fleeting pleasure
112 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
conditioned by wants, much and long suffering, constant strife,
bellum omnium, each one both a hunter and hunted, pressure,
want, need, and anxiety, shrieking and howling; and this goes
on in secula seculorum, or till once again the crust of the planet
breaks. Yunghahn relates that he saw in Java a plain far as the
eye could reach entirely covered with skeletons, and took it for
a battlefield; they were, however, merely the skeletons of large
turtles, five feet long and three feet broad, and the same height,
which come this way out of the sea in order to lay their eggs,
and are then attacked by wild dogs (Canis rutilans), who with
their united strength lay them on their backs, strip off their lower
armour, that is, the small shell of the stomach, and so devour
them alive. But often then a tiger pounces upon the dogs. Now
all this misery repeats itself thousands and thousands of times,
year out, year in. For this, then, these turtles are born. For
whose guilt must they suffer this torment? Wherefore the whole
scene of horror? To this the only answer is: it is thus that the
la présence d'un homme. Notre voyageur, qui était armé, aurait donc prevenir
en aide à l'infortuné rongeur en tuant le serpent. Mais la science l'emporta
sur la pitié, et il voulut voir quelle issue aurait le drame. Le dénoûment fut
tragique. L'écureuil ne tarda point à pousser un cri plaintif qui, pour tous
ceux qui le connaissent, dénote le voisinage d'un serpent. Il avança un peu,
essaya de reculer, revint encore en avant, tâche de retourner en arrière. Mais
s'approcha toujours plus du reptile. La couleuvre, roulée en spirale, la tête au
dessus des anneaux, et immobile comme un morceau de bois, ne le quittait pas
du regard. L'écureuil, de branche en branche, et descendant toujours plus bas,
arriva jusqu'à la partie nue du tronc. Alors le pauvre animal ne tenta même
plus de fuir le danger. Attiré par une puissance invincible, et comme poussé
par le vertige, il se précipita dans la gueule du serpent, qui s'ouvrit tout à coup
démesurément pour le recevoir. Autant la couleuvre avait été inerte jusque là
autant elle devint active dès qu'elle fut en possession de sa proie. Déroulant ses
anneaux et prenant sa course de bas en haut avec une agilité inconcevable, sa
reptation la porta en un clin d'œil au sommet de l'arbre, où elle alla sans doute
digérer et dormir.”
In this example we see what spirit animates nature, for it reveals itself in
it, and how very true is the saying of Aristotle quoted above (p. 106). This
story is not only important with regard to fascination, but also as an argument
for pessimism. 

That an animal is surprised and attacked by another is bad; still will to live objectifies itself.7 Let one consider it well and comprehend it in all its objectifications; and then one will arrive
at an understanding of its nature and of the world; but not if one
frames general conceptions and builds card houses out of them.
The comprehension of the great drama of the objectification of
the will to live, and the characterisation of its nature, certain- [114]
ly demands somewhat more accurate consideration and greater
thoroughness than the dismissal of the world by attributing to
it the title of God, or, with a silliness which only the German
fatherland offers and knows how to enjoy, explaining it as the
“Idea in its other being,” in which for twenty years the simple-
tons of my time have found their unutterable delight. Certainly,
according to pantheism or Spinozism, of which the systems of
our century are mere travesties, all that sort of thing reels itself
off actually without end, straight on through all eternity. For then
the world is a God, ens perfectissimum, i.e., nothing better can
be or be conceived. Thus there is no need of deliverance from it;
il ne pouvait deviner lequel. Il approcha, et un examen attentif lui fit découvrir
dans un creux du tronc une couleuvre lieu, dardant ses yeux fixes dans la
direction de l'écureuil. Notre voyageur trembla pour le pauvre écureuil. La
couleuvre était si attentive à sa proie qu'elle ne semblait nullement remarquer
we can console ourselves for that; but that such a poor innocent squirrel sitting
beside its nest with its young is compelled, step by step, reluctantly, battling
with itself and lamenting, to approach the wide, open jaws of the serpent and
consciously throw itself into them is revolting and atrocious. What monstrous
kind of nature is this to which we belong!

<!-- 7 In the Siècle, 10th April 1859, there appears, very beautifully written, the
story of a squirrel that was magically drawn by a serpent into its very jaws:
“Un voyageur qui vient de parcourir plusieurs provinces de l'ile de Java cite
un exemple remarqueable du pouvoir facinateur des serpens. Le voyageur
dont il est question commençait à gravir Junjind, un des monts appelés par
les Hollandais Pepergebergte. Après avoir pénétré dans une épaisse forêt,
il aperçut sur les branches d'un kijatile un écureuil de Java à tête blanche,
folâtrant avec la grâce et l'agilité qui distinguent cette charmante espèce de
rongeurs. Un nid sphérique, formé de brins flexible et de mousse, placé dans
les parties les plus élevées de l'arbre, a l'enfourchure de deux branches, et une
cavité dans le tronc, semblaient les points de mire de ses jeux. A peine s'en
était-il éloigné qu'il y revenait avec une ardeur extrême. On était dans le mois  -->

and consequently there is none. But why the whole tragi-comedy
exists cannot in the least be seen; for it has no spectators, and the
actors themselves undergo infinite trouble, with little and merely
negative pleasure.

Life presents itself by no means as a gift for enjoyment, but as a task, a drudgery to be performed; and in accordance with this we see, in great and small, universal need, ceaseless cares, constant pressure, endless strife, compulsory activity, with extreme exertion of all the powers of body and mind. Many millions, united into nations, strive for the common good, each individual on account of his own; but many thousands fall as a sacrifice for it. Now senseless delusions, now intriguing politics, incite them to wars with each other; then the sweat and the blood of the great multitude must flow, to carry out the ideas of individuals, or to expiate their faults.

In peace industry and trade are active, inventions work miracles, seas are navigated, delicacies are collected from all ends of the world, the waves engulf thousands. All strive, some planning, others acting; the[115] tumult is indescribable. But the ultimate aim of it all, what is it? To sustain ephemeral and tormented individuals through a short span of time in the most fortunate case with endurable want and comparative freedom from pain, which, however, is at once attended with ennui; then the reproduction of this race and its striving.

In this evident disproportion between the trouble and the reward, the will to live appears to us from this point of view, if taken objectively, as a fool, or subjectively, as a delusion, seized de Juillet, et probablement l'écureuil avait en haut ses petits, et dans le bas le magasin à fruits.

Bientôt il fut comme saisi d'effroi, ces mouvemens devinrent
désordonnés, on eut dit qu'il cherchait toujours à mettre un obstacle entre lui
et certaines parties de l'arbre: puis il se tapit et resta immobile entre deux
branches. Le voyageur eut le sentiment d'un danger pour l'innocente bête, mais  by which everything living works with the utmost exertion of its strength for something that is of no value. 

But when we consider it more closely, we shall find here also that it is rather a blind pressure, a tendency entirely without ground or motive. The law of motivation, as was shown in § 29 of the first volume, only extends to the particular actions, not to willing as a whole and in general. It depends upon this, that if we conceive of the human race and its action as a whole and universally, it does not present itself to us, as when we contemplate the particular actions, as a play of puppets who are pulled after the ordinary manner by threads outside them; but from this point of view, as puppets which are set in motion by internal clockwork. For if, as we have done above, one compares the ceaseless, serious, and laborious striving of men with what they gain by it, nay, even with what they ever can gain, the disproportion we have pointed out becomes apparent, for one recognises that that which is to be gained, taken as the motive-power, is entirely insufficient for the explanation of that movement and that ceaseless striving. What, then, is a short postponement of death, a slight easing of misery or deferment of pain, a momentary stilling of desire, compared with such an abundant and certain victory over them all as death? What could such advantages accomplish taken as actual moving causes of a human race, innumerable because constantly renewed, which unceasingly moves, strives, struggles, grieves, writhes, and performs the whole tragi-comedy of the [116] history of the world, nay, what says more than all, perseveres in such a mock-existence as long as each one possibly can? Clearly this is all inexplicable if we seek the moving causes outside the figures and conceive the human race as striving, in consequence of rational reflection, or something analogous to this (as moving threads), after those good things held out to it, the attainment of which would be a sufficient reward for its ceaseless cares and troubles. The matter being taken thus, every one would rather have long ago said, “Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle,” and have gone out. But, on the contrary, every one guards and defends his life, like a precious pledge intrusted to him under heavy responsibility, under infinite cares and abundant misery, even under which life is tolerable. The wherefore and the why, the reward for this, certainly he does not see; but he has accepted the worth of that pledge without seeing it, upon trust and faith, and does not know what it consists in. Hence I have said that these puppets are not pulled from without, but each bears in itself the clockwork from which its movements result. This is the will to live, manifesting itself as an untiring machine, an irrational tendency, which has not its sufficient reason in the external world. It holds the individuals firmly upon the scene, and is the primum mobile of their movements; while the external objects, the motives, only determine their direction in the particular case; otherwise the cause would not be at all suitable to the effect. For, as every manifestation of a force of nature has a cause, but the force of nature itself none, so every particular act of will has a motive, but the will in general has none: indeed at bottom these two are one and the same. The will, as that which is metaphysical, is everywhere the boundary-stone of every investigation, beyond which it cannot go. From the original and unconditioned nature of the will, which has been proved, it is explicable that man loves beyond everything else an existence full of misery, trouble, pain,[117] and anxiety, and, again, full of ennui, which, if he considered and weighed it purely objectively, he would certainly abhor, and fears above all things the end of it, which is yet for him the one thing certain.8 Accordingly we often see a miserable figure, deformed and shrunk with age, want, and disease, implore our help from the bottom of his heart for the prolongation of an existence, the end of which would necessarily appear altogether desirable if it were an objective judgment that determined here.

Thus instead of this it is the blind will, appearing as the tendency to life, the love of life, and the sense of life; it is the same which makes the plants grow. This sense of life may be compared to a rope which is stretched above the puppet-show of the world of men, and on which the puppets hang by invisible threads, while apparently they are supported only by the ground beneath them (the objective value of life). But if the rope becomes weak the puppet sinks; if it breaks the puppet must fall, for the ground beneath it only seemed to support it: i.e., the weakening of that love of life shows itself as hypochondria, spleen, melancholy: its entire exhaustion as the inclination to suicide, which now takes place on the slightest occasion, nay, for a merely imaginary reason, for now, as it were, the man seeks a quarrel with himself, in order to shoot himself dead, as many do with others for a like purpose;—indeed, upon necessity, suicide is resorted to without any special occasion. (Evidence of this will be found in Esquirol, Des maladies mentales, 1838.) And as with the persistence in life, so is it also with its action and movement. This is not something freely chosen; but while every one would really gladly rest, want and ennui are the whips that keep the top spinning. Therefore the whole and every individual bears the stamp of a forced condition; and every one, in that, inwardly weary, he longs for rest, but yet [118] must press forward, is like his planet, which does not fall into the sun only because a force driving it forward prevents it. Therefore everything is in continual strain and forced movement, and the course of the world goes on, to use an expression of Aristotle's (De cœlo, ii. 13), “ø≈ ∆≈√μπ, ±ªª± ≤π≥” (Motu, non naturali sed violento). Men are only apparently drawn from in front; really they are pushed from behind; it is not life that tempts them on, but necessity that drives them forward. The law of motivation is, like all causality, merely the form of the phenomenon.

We may remark in passing that this is the source of the comical, the burlesque, the grotesque, the ridiculous side of life; for, urged forward against his will, every one bears himself as best he can, and the straits that thus arise often look comical enough, serious as is the misery which underlies them. In all these considerations, then, it becomes clear to us that the will to live is not a consequence of the knowledge of life, is in no way a conclusio ex præmissis, and in general is nothing secondary. Rather, it is that which is first and unconditioned, the premiss of all premisses, and just on that account that from which philosophy must start, for the will to live does not appear in consequence of the world, but the world in consequence of the will to live. I scarcely need to draw attention to the fact that the considera- tions with which we now conclude the second book already point forcibly to the serious theme of the fourth book, indeed would pass over into it directly if it were not that my architectonic symmetry makes it necessary that the third book, with its fair contents, should come between, as a second consideration of the world as idea, the conclusion of which, however, again points in the same direction.
