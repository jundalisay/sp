<!-- 3 This chapter is connected with § 23 of the first volume. -->

That the will which we find within us does not proceed, as
philosophy has hitherto assumed, first from knowledge, and
indeed is a mere modification of it, thus something secondary,
derived, and, like knowledge itself, conditioned by the brain;
but that it is the prius of knowledge, the kernel of our nature,
and that original force itself which forms and sustains the animal
body, in that it carries out both its unconscious and its conscious
functions;—this is the first step in the fundamental knowledge
of my metaphysics. Paradoxical as it even now seems to many
that the will in itself is without knowledge, yet the scholastics
in some way already recognised and confessed it; for Jul. Cæs.
Vaninus (that well-known sacrifice to fanaticism and priestly
fury), who was thoroughly versed in their philosophy, says in his
“Amphitheatro,” p. 181: “Voluntas potentia cœca est, ex scho-
lasticorum opinione.” 

That, further, it is that same will which
in the plant forms the bud in order to develop the leaf and the
flower out of it; nay, that the regular form of the crystal is only
the trace which its momentary effort has left behind, and that in
general, as the true and only ±≈ƒøº±ƒøΩ, in the proper sense of
the word, it lies at the foundation of all the forces of unorganised
nature, plays, acts, in all their multifarious phenomena, imparts
power to their laws, and even in the crudest mass manifests itself
as gravity;—this insight is the second step in that fundamental
knowledge, and is brought about by further reflection. But[033]
it would be the grossest misunderstanding to suppose that this
is a mere question of a word to denote an unknown quantity.
It is rather the most real of all real knowledge which is here
expressed in language. For it is the tracing back of that which
is quite inaccessible to our immediate knowledge, and therefore in its essence foreign and unknown to us, which we denote by
the words force of nature, to that which is known to us most
accurately and intimately, but which is yet only accessible to
us in our own being and directly, and must therefore be carried
over from this to other phenomena. It is the insight that what is
inward and original in all the changes and movements of bodies,
however various they may be, is in its nature identical; that yet
we have only one opportunity of getting to know it more closely
and directly, and that is in the movements of our own body. In
consequence of this knowledge we must call it will. It is the
insight that that which acts and strives in nature, and exhibits
itself in ever more perfect phenomena, when it has worked itself
up so far that the light of knowledge falls directly upon it, i.e.,
when it has attained to the state of self-consciousness—exists
as that will, which is what is most intimately known to us, and
therefore cannot be further explained by anything else, but rather
affords the explanation of all other things. It is accordingly the
thing in itself so far as this can ever be reached by knowledge.
Consequently it is that which must express itself in some way in
everything in the world, for it is the inner nature of the world and
the kernel of all phenomena.
As my essay, “Ueber den Willen in der Natur,” specially refers
to the subject of this chapter, and also adduces the evidence of
unprejudiced empiricists in favour of this important point of my
doctrine, I have only to add now to what is said there a few
supplementary remarks, which are therefore strung together in a
somewhat fragmentary manner.

First, then, with reference to plant life, I draw attention to the
remarkable first two chapters of Aristotle's work upon plants.
What is most interesting in them, as is so often the case with Aris-
totle, are the opinions of earlier profound philosophers quoted by
him. We see there that Anaxagoras and Empedocles quite rightly
taught that plants have the motion of their growth by virtue of
their indwelling desires (μ¿π∏≈ºπ±); nay, that they also attributed to them pleasure and pain, therefore sensation. But Plato only ascribed to them desires, and that on account of their strong
appetite for nutrition (cf. Plato in the “Timœus,” p. 403, Bip.)
Aristotle, on the other hand, true to his customary method, glides
on the surface of things, confines himself to single characteristics
and conceptions fixed by current expressions, and asserts that
without sensation there can be no desires, and that plants have
not sensation. He is, however, in considerable embarrassment,
as his confused language shows, till here also, “where fails the
comprehension, a word steps promptly in as deputy,” namely, ƒø
∏¡μ¿ƒπ∫øΩ, the faculty of nourishing. Plants have this, and thus
a part of the so-called soul, according to his favourite division
into anima vegetativa, sensitiva, and intellectiva. This, however,
is just a scholastic Quidditas, and signifies plantœ nutriuntur
quia habent facultatem nutritivam. It is therefore a bad substitute
for the more profound research of his predecessors, whom he is
criticising. We also see, in the second chapter, that Empedocles
even recognised the sexuality of plants; which Aristotle then
also finds fault with, and conceals his want of special knowledge
behind general propositions, such as this, that plants could not
have both sexes combined, for if so they would be more complete
than animals. By quite an analogous procedure he displaces the
correct astronomical system of the world of the Pythagoreans,
and by his absurd fundamental principles, which he specially
explains in the books de Cœlo, introduces the system of Ptolemy,
whereby mankind was again deprived of an already discovered[035]
truth of the greatest importance for almost two thousand years.
I cannot refrain from giving here the saying of an excellent
biologist of our own time who fully agrees with my teaching. It
is G. R. Treviranus, who, in his work, “Ueber die Erscheinun-
gen und Gesetze des organischen Lebens,” 1832, Bd. 2, Abth.
1, § 49, has said what follows: “A form of life is, however,
conceivable in which the effect of the external upon the internal
produces merely feelings of desire or dislike. Such is the life of plants. 

In the higher forms of animal life the external is felt as
something objective.” Treviranus speaks here from pure unprej-
udiced comprehension of nature, and is as little conscious of the
metaphysical importance of his words as of the contradictio in
adjecto which lies in the conception of something “felt as objec-
tive,” a conception which indeed he works out at great length.
He does not know that all feeling is essentially subjective, and all
that is objective is, on the other hand, perception, and therefore
a product of the understanding. Yet this does not detract at all
from the truth and importance of what he says.
In fact, in the life of plants the truth that will can exist without
knowledge is apparent—one might say palpably recognisable.
For here we see a decided effort, determined by wants, modified
in various ways, and adapting itself to the difference of the
circumstances, yet clearly without knowledge. And just because
the plant is without knowledge it bears its organs of generation
ostentatiously in view, in perfect innocence; it knows nothing
about it. As soon, on the other hand, as in the series of existences
knowledge appears the organs of generation are transferred to
a hidden part. Man, however, with whom this is again less the
case, conceals them intentionally: he is ashamed of them.
Primarily, then, the vital force is identical with the will, but
so also are all other forces of nature; though this is less apparent.
If, therefore, we find the recognition of a desire, i.e., of a will, [036]
as the basis of plant life, expressed at all times, with more or less
distinctness of conception, on the other hand, the reference of
the forces of unorganised nature to the same foundation is rarer
in proportion as their remoteness from our own nature is greater.
In fact, the boundary between the organised and the unorganised
is the most sharply drawn in the whole of nature, and perhaps
the only one that admits of no transgressions; so that natura
non facit saltus seems to suffer an exception here. Although
certain crystallisations display an external form resembling the
vegetable, yet even between the smallest lichen, the lowest fungus, and everything unorganised there remains a fundamental
and essential difference. 

In the unorganised body that which is
essential and permanent, thus that upon which its identity and
integrity rests, is the material, the matter; what is unessential and
changing is, on the other hand, the form. With the organised
body the case is exactly reversed; for its life, i.e., its existence
as an organised being, simply consists in the constant change of
the material, while the form remains permanent. Its being and
its identity thus lies in the form alone. Therefore the continuance
of the unorganised body depends upon repose and exclusion
from external influences: thus alone does it retain its existence;
and if this condition is perfect, such a body lasts for ever.
