Even the merely empirical consideration of nature recognises a constant transition from the simplest and most necessary manifestation of a universal force of nature up to the life and consciousness of man himself, through gentle gradations, and with only relative, and for the most part fluctuating, limits. Reflection, following this view, and penetrating somewhat more deeply into it, will soon be led to the conviction that in all these phenomena, the inner nature, that which manifests itself, that which appears, is one and the same, which comes forth ever more distinctly; and accordingly that what exhibits itself in a million forms of infinite diversity, and so carries on the most varied and the strangest play without beginning or end, this is one being which is so closely disguised behind all these masks that it does not even recognise itself, and therefore often treats itself roughly. Thus the great doctrine of the Ω ∫±π ¿±Ω early appeared both in the east and in the west, and, in spite of all contradiction, has asserted itself, or at least constantly revived. We, however, have now entered even deeper into the secret, since by what has already been said we have been led to the insight that when in any phenomenon a knowing consciousness is added to that inner being which lies at the foundation of all phenomena, a consciousness which when directed inwardly becomes self-consciousness, then that inner being presents itself to this self-consciousness as that which is so familiar and so mysterious, and is denoted by the word will. [066] Accordingly we have called that universal fundamental nature of all phenomena the will, after that manifestation in which it unveils itself to us most fully; and by this word nothing is further from our intention than to denote an unknown x; but, on the contrary, we denote that which at least on one side is infinitely better known and more intimate than anything else.

Let us now call to mind a truth, the fullest and most thorough
proof of which will be found in my prize essay on the freedom
of the will—the truth that on account of the absolutely universal
validity of the law of causality, the conduct or the action of all
existences in this world is always strictly necessitated by the
causes which in each case call it forth. And in this respect it
makes no difference whether such an action has been occasioned
by causes in the strictest sense of the word, or by stimuli, or
finally by motives, for these differences refer only to the grade
of the susceptibility of the different kinds of existences. On this
point we must entertain no illusion: the law of causality knows
no exception; but everything, from the movement of a mote in a
sunbeam to the most deeply considered action of man, is subject
to it with equal strictness. Therefore, in the whole course of
the world, neither could a mote in a sunbeam describe any other
line in its flight than it has described, nor a man act any other
way than he has acted; and no truth is more certain than this,
that all that happens, be it small or great, happens with absolute
necessity. Consequently, at every given moment of time, the
whole condition of all things is firmly and accurately determined
by the condition which has just preceded it, and so is it with
the stream of time back to infinity and on to infinity. Thus the
course of the world is like that of a clock after it has been put
together and wound up; thus from this incontestable point of
view it is a mere machine, the aim of which we cannot see.
Even if, quite without justification, nay, at bottom, in spite of
all conceivability and its conformity to law, one should assume[067]
a first beginning, nothing would thereby be essentially changed.
For the arbitrarily assumed first condition of things would at its
origin have irrevocably determined and fixed, both as a whole
and down to the smallest detail, the state immediately following
it; this state, again, would have determined the one succeeding
it, and so on per secula seculorum, for the chain of causality,
with its absolute strictness—this brazen bond of necessity and fate—introduces every phenomenon irrevocably and unalterably,
just as it is. The difference merely amounts to this, that in the
case of the one assumption we would have before us a piece of
clockwork which had once been wound up, but in the case of the
other a perpetual motion; the necessity of the course, on the other
hand, would remain the same. In the prize essay already referred
to I have irrefutably proved that the action of man can make no
exception here, for I showed how it constantly proceeds with
strict necessity from two factors—his character and the motives
which come to him. The character is inborn and unalterable;
the motives are introduced with necessity under the guidance of
causality by the strictly determined course of the world.
Accordingly then, from one point of view, which we certainly
cannot abandon, because it is established by the objective laws
of the world, which are a priori valid, the world, with all that is
in it, appears as an aimless, and therefore incomprehensible, play
of an eternal necessity, an inscrutable and inexorable ëΩ±≥∫∑.
Now, what is objectionable, nay, revolting, in this inevitable and
irrefutable view of the world cannot be thoroughly done away
with by any assumption except this, that as in one aspect every
being in the world is a phenomenon, and necessarily determined
by the laws of the phenomenon, in another aspect it is in itself
will, and indeed absolutely free will, for necessity only arises
through the forms which belong entirely to the phenomenon,
through the principle of sufficient reason in its different modes. [068]
Such a will, then, must be self-dependent, for, as free, i.e., as
a thing in itself, and therefore not subject to the principle of
sufficient reason, it cannot depend upon another in its being and
nature any more than in its conduct and action. By this assump-
tion alone will as much freedom be supposed as is needed to
counterbalance the inevitable strict necessity which governs the
course of the world. Accordingly one has really only the choice
either of seeing that the world is a mere machine which runs on
of necessity, or of recognising a free will as its inner being whose manifestation is not directly the action but primarily the existence and nature of things. 

This freedom is therefore transcendental,
and consists with empirical necessity, in the same way as the
transcendental ideality of phenomena consists with their empiri-
cal reality. That only under this assumption the action of a man,
in spite of the necessity with which it proceeds from his character
and the motives, is yet his own I have shown in my prize essay
on the freedom of the will; with this, however, self-dependency
is attributed to his nature. The same relation holds good of all
things in the world. The strictest necessity, carried out honestly
with rigid consistency, and the most perfect freedom, rising to
omnipotence, had to appear at once and together in philosophy;
but, without doing violence to truth, this could only take place by
placing the whole necessity in the acting and doing (Operari),
and the whole freedom in the being and nature (Esse). Thereby
a riddle is solved which is as old as the world, simply because
it has hitherto always been held upside down and the freedom
persistently sought in the Operari, the necessity in the Esse. I, on
the contrary, say: Every being without exception acts with strict
necessity, but it exists and is what it is by virtue of its freedom.
Thus with me freedom and necessity are to be met with neither
more nor less than in any earlier system; although now one and
now the other must be conspicuous according as one takes of-
fence that will is attributed to processes of nature which hitherto[069]
were explained from necessity, or that the same strict necessity
is recognised in motivation as in mechanical causality. The two
have merely changed places: freedom has been transferred to the
Esse, and necessity limited to the Operari.

In short, Determinism stands firm. For fifteen hundred years
men have wearied themselves in vain to shake it, influenced by
certain crotchets, which are well known, but dare scarcely yet
be called by their name. Yet in accordance with it the world
becomes a mere puppet-show, drawn by wires (motives), without
it being even possible to understand for whose amusement. 

If the piece has a plan, then fate is the director; if it has none, then
blind necessity. There is no other deliverance from this absurdity
than the knowledge that the being and nature of all things is the
manifestation of a really free will, which knows itself in them;
for their doing and acting cannot be delivered from necessity. To
save freedom from fate and chance, it had to be transferred from
the action to the existence.

As now necessity only affects the phenomenon, not the thing
in itself, i.e., the true nature of the world, so also does multiplicity.
This is sufficiently explained in § 25 of the first volume. I have
only to add here one remark in confirmation and illustration of
this truth.

Every one knows only one being quite immediately—his own
will in self-consciousness. Everything else he knows only indi-
rectly, and then judges it by analogy with this; a process which he
carries further in proportion to the grade of his reflective powers.
Even this ultimately springs from the fact that there really is only
one being; the illusion of multiplicity (Maja), which proceeds
from the forms of external, objective comprehension, could not
penetrate to inner, simple consciousness; therefore this always
finds before it only one being.

If we consider the perfection of the works of nature, which
can never be sufficiently admired, and which even in the lowest [070]
and smallest organisms, for example, in the fertilising parts of
plants or in
