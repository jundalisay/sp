Chapter 38 History

In the passage of the first volume referred to below I have fully
shown that more is achieved for our knowledge of mankind by
poetry than by history, and why this is so; inasmuch as more
real instruction was to be expected from the former than from
the latter. Aristotle has also confessed this, for he says: “∫±π
∆πªø√ø∆…ƒμ¡øΩ ∫±π √¿ø≈¥±πøƒμ¡øΩ ¿øπ∑√π¬ 1√ƒø¡π±¬ μ√ƒπΩ” (et
res magis philosophica, et melior poësis est quam historia24), De
poët., c. 9. Yet, in order to cause no misunderstanding as to the
value of history, I wish here to express my thoughts about it.
In every class and species of things the facts are innumerable,
the individuals infinite in number, the variety of their differences
unapproachable. At the first glance at them the curious mind
becomes giddy; however much it investigates, it sees itself con-
demned to ignorance. But then comes science: it separates the
innumerable multitude, arranges it under generic conceptions,
these again under conceptions of species, whereby it opens the
path to a knowledge of the general and the particular, which also
comprehends the innumerable individuals, for it holds good of all
without one being obliged to consider each particular for itself.
Thus it promises satisfaction to the investigating mind. Then all[221]
sciences place themselves together, and above the real world of
individual things, as that which they have divided among them.
Over them all, however, moves philosophy, as the most general,
and therefore important, rational knowledge, which promises the
conclusions for which the others have only prepared the way.
History alone cannot properly enter into that series, since it
cannot boast of the same advantage as the others, for it lacks the

more than ordinary distinctness; it signifies that which is made, invented, in
opposition to what is discovered.

fundamental characteristic of science, the subordination of what
is known, instead of which it can only present its co-ordination.
Therefore there is no system of history, as there is of every other
science. It is therefore certainly rational knowledge, but it is
not a science. For it never knows the particular by means of
the general, but must comprehend the particular directly, and
so, as it were, creeps along the ground of experience; while
the true sciences move above it, because they have obtained
comprehensive conceptions by means of which they command
the particular, and, at least within certain limits, anticipate the
possibility of things within their sphere, so that they can be at
ease even about what may yet have to come. The sciences,
since they are systems of conceptions, speak always of species;
history speaks of individuals. It would accordingly be a science
of individuals, which is a contradiction. It also follows that the
sciences all speak of that which always is as history, on the other
hand, of that which is once, and then no more. Since, further,
history has to do with the absolutely particular and individuals,
which from its nature is inexhaustible, it knows everything only
imperfectly and half. Besides, it must also let itself be taught by
every new day in its trivial commonplaceness what as yet it did
not know at all. If it should be objected that in history also there
is subordination of the particular under the general, because the
periods, the governments, and other general changes, or political
revolutions, in short, all that is given in historical tables, is the
general, to which the special subordinates itself, this would rest [222]
upon a false comprehension of the conception of the general. For
the general in history here referred to is merely subjective, i.e., its
generality springs merely from the inadequacy of the individual
knowledge of the things, but not objective, i.e., a conception
in which the things would actually already be thought together.

Even the most general in history is in itself only a particular and
individual, a long period of time, or an important event; therefore
the special is related to this as the part to the whole, but not as the case to the rule; which, on the contrary, takes place in all the sciences proper because they afford conceptions and not mere
facts. On this account in these sciences by a correct knowledge
of the general we can determine with certainty the particular that
arises. If, for example, I know the laws of the triangle in general,
I can then also tell what must be the properties of the triangle laid
before me; and what holds good of all mammals, for example,
that they have double ventricles of the heart, exactly seven cer-
vical vertebræ, lungs, diaphragm, bladder, five senses, &c., I can
also assert of the strange bat which has just been caught, before
dissecting it. But not so in history, where the general is no objec-
tive general of the conception, but merely a subjective general
of my knowledge, which can only be called general inasmuch
as it is superficial. Therefore I may always know in general of
the Thirty Years' War that it was a religious war, waged in the
seventeenth century; but this general knowledge does not make
me capable of telling anything more definite about its course.
The same opposition is also confirmed by the fact that in the real
sciences the special and individual is that which is most certain,
because it rests upon immediate apprehension; the general truths,
again, are only abstracted from it; therefore something false may
be more easily assumed in the latter. But in history, conversely,
the most general is the most certain; for example, the periods,
the succession of the kings, the revolutions, wars, and treaties of[223]
peace; the particulars, again, of the events and their connection
is uncertain, and becomes always more so the further one goes
into details. Therefore history is the more interesting the more
special it is, but the less to be trusted, and approaches then in
every respect to the romance. For the rest, what importance is to
be attached to the boasted pragmatic teaching of history he will
best be able to judge who remembers that sometimes it was only
after twenty years that he understood the events of his own life in
their true connection, although the data for this were fully before
him, so difficult is the combination of the action of the motives under the constant interferences of chance and the concealment of the intentions. 

Since now history really always has for its
object only the particular, the individual fact, and regards this as
the exclusively real, it is the direct opposite and counterpart of
philosophy, which considers things from the most general point
of view, and has intentionally the general as its object, which
remains identical in every particular; therefore in the particular
philosophy sees only the general, and recognises the change in
its manifestation as unessential: ∆πªø∫±∏øªø≈ ≥±¡ A ∆πªø√ø∆ø¬
(generalium amator philosophus). While history teaches us that
at every time something else has been, philosophy tries to assist
us to the insight that at all times exactly the same was, is, and
shall be. In truth, the essence of human life, as of nature in
general, is given complete in every present time, and therefore
only requires depth of comprehension in order to be exhaustively
known. But history hopes to make up for depth by length and
breadth; for it every present time is only a fragment which must
be supplemented by the past, the length of which is, however,
infinite, and to which again an infinite future is joined. Upon this
rests the opposition between philosophical and historical minds;
the former want to go to the bottom, the latter want to go through
the whole series. History shows on every side only the same
under different forms; but whoever does not come to know this [224]
in one or a few will hardly attain to a knowledge of it by going
through all the forms. The chapters of the history of nations are
at bottom only distinguished by the names and dates; the really
essential content is everywhere the same.

The material of art is the Idea, and the material
of science the concept, we see both occupied with that which
always exists and constantly in the same manner, not something
which now is and now is not, now is thus and now otherwise;
therefore both have to do with that which Plato set up as the
exclusive object of real rational knowledge. 

The material of
history, on the other hand, is the particular in its particularity and contingency, which at one time is, and then for ever is no more,
the transient complexities of a human world moved like clouds
in the wind, a world which is often entirely transformed by the
most trifling accident. From this point of view the material of
history appears to us as scarcely a worthy object of the serious
and painful consideration of the human mind, the human mind
which, just because it is so transitory, ought to choose for its
consideration that which passes not away.

Finally, as regards the endeavour—specially introduced by
the Hegelian pseudo-philosophy, everywhere so pernicious and
stupefying to the mind—to comprehend the history of the world
as a planned whole, or, as they call it, “to construe it organically,”
a crude and positive realism lies at its foundation, which takes
the phenomenon for the inner being of the world, and imagines
that this phenomenon, its forms and events, are the chief concern;
in which it is secretly supported by certain mythological notions
which it tacitly assumes: otherwise one might ask for what spec-
tators such a comedy was really produced. 

For, since only the
individual, and not the human race, has actual, immediate unity
of consciousness, the unity of the course of life of the race is a
mere fiction. Besides, as in nature only the species are real, and
the genera are mere abstractions, so in the human race only the[225]
individuals and their course of life are real, the peoples and their
lives mere abstractions. Finally, constructive histories, guided
by a positive optimism, always ultimately end in a comfortable,
rich, fat State, with a well-regulated constitution, good justice
and police, useful arts and industries, and, at the most, in intellectual perfection; for this, in fact, is alone possible, since what is moral remains essentially unaltered. But it is the moral element
which, according to the testimony of our inmost consciousness,
is the whole concern: and this lies only in the individual as the
tendency of his will. In truth, only the life of each individual
has unity, connection, and true significance: it is to be regarded
as an instruction, and the meaning of it is moral. 

Only the incidents of our inner life, since they concern the will, have true
reality, and are actual events; because the will alone is the thing
in itself. 

In every microcosm lies the whole macrocosm, and
the latter contains nothing more than the former. Multiplicity is
phenomenal, and external events are mere configurations of the
phenomenal world, and have therefore directly neither reality nor
significance, but only indirectly through their relation to the wills
of the individuals. The endeavour to explain and interpret them
directly is accordingly like the endeavour to see in the forms of
the clouds groups of men and animals. What history narrates is
in fact only the long, heavy, and confused dream of humanity.
The Hegelians, who regard the philosophy of history as indeed
the chief end of all philosophy, are to be referred to Plato, who
unweariedly repeats that the object of philosophy is that which
is unchangeable and always remains, not that which now is thus
and now otherwise. All those who set up such constructions of
the course of the world, or, as they call it, of history, have failed
to grasp the principal truth of all philosophy, that what is is at all
times the same, all becoming and arising are only seeming; the
Ideas alone are permanent; time ideal. This is what Plato holds, [226]
this is what Kant holds. One ought therefore to seek to understand
what exists, what really is, to-day and always, i.e., to know the
Ideas (in Plato's sense). Fools, on the contrary, imagine that
something must first become and happen. 

Therefore they concede to history the chief place in their philosophy, and construct
it according to a preconceived plan of the world, according to
which everything is ordered for the best, which is then supposed
finaliter to appear, and will be a glorious thing. Accordingly they
take the world as perfectly real, and place the end of it in the poor
earthly happiness, which, however much it may be fostered by
men and favoured by fate, is a hollow, deceptive, decaying, and
sad thing, out of which neither constitutions and legal systems
nor steam-engines and telegraphs can ever make anything that
is essentially better. 

The said philosophers and glorifiers of history are accordingly simple realists, and also optimists and eudæmonists, consequently dull fellows and incarnate philistines;
and besides are really bad Christians, for the true spirit and
kernel of Christianity, as also of Brahmanism and Buddhism, is
the knowledge of the vanity of earthly happiness, the complete
contempt for it, and the turning away from it to an existence of
another, nay, an opposite, kind. This, I say, is the spirit and end
of Christianity, the true “humour of the matter;” and not, as they
imagine, monotheism; therefore even atheistic Buddhism is far
more closely related to Christianity than optimistic Judaism or
its variety Islamism.

A true philosophy of history ought not therefore to consider,
as all these do, what (to use Plato's language) always becomes
and never is, and hold this to be the true nature of things; but
it ought to fix its attention upon that which always is and never
becomes nor passes away. Thus it does not consist in raising
the temporal ends of men to eternal and absolute ends, and then
with art and imagination constructing their progress through all
complications; but in the insight that not only in its development,
but in its very nature, history is mendacious; for, speaking[227]
of mere individuals and particular events, it pretends always to
relate something different, while from beginning to end it repeats
always the same thing under different names and in a different
dress. The true philosophy of history consists in the insight
that in all these endless changes and their confusion we have
always before us only the same, even, unchanging nature, which
to-day acts in the same way as yesterday and always; thus it
ought to recognise the identical in all events, of ancient as of
modern times, of the east as of the west; and, in spite of all
difference of the special circumstances, of the costume and the
customs, to see everywhere the same humanity. This identical
element which is permanent through all change consists in the
fundamental qualities of the human heart and head—many bad,
few good. The motto of history in general should run: Eadem,
Chapter XXXVIII. On History. 223
sed aliter. If one has read Herodotus, then in a philosophical
regard one has already studied history enough. For everything is
already there that makes up the subsequent history of the world:
the efforts, action, sufferings, and fate of the human race as it
proceeds from the qualities we have referred to, and the physical
earthly lot.
If in what has been said we have recognised that history,
regarded as a means for the knowledge of the nature of man,
is inferior to poetry; then, that it is not in the proper sense a
science; finally, that the endeavour to construct it as a whole
with beginning, middle, and end, together with a significant
connection, is vain, and based upon misunderstanding: it would
look as if we wished to deny it all value if we did not show in
what its value consists. Really, however, there remains for it,
after this conquest by art and rejection by science, a quite special
province, different from both, in which it exists most honourably.
What reason is to the individual that is history to the human
race. By virtue of reason, man is not, like the brute, limited to [228]
the narrow, perceptible present, but also knows the incomparably
more extended past, with which it is linked, and out of which
it has proceeded; and only thus has he a proper understanding
of the present itself, and can even draw inferences as to the
future. The brute, on the other hand, whose knowledge, devoid
of reflection, is on this account limited to the present, even
when it is tamed, moves about among men ignorant, dull, stupid,
helpless, and dependent. Analogous to this is the nation that
does not know its own history, is limited to the present of the
now living generation, and therefore does not understand itself
and its own present, because it cannot connect it with a past,
and explain it from this; still less can it anticipate the future.
Only through history does a nation become completely conscious
of itself. Accordingly history is to be regarded as the rational
consciousness of the human race, and is to the race what the
reflected and connected consciousness is to the individual who
224 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
is conditioned by reason, a consciousness through the want of
which the brute is confined to the narrow, perceptible present.
Therefore every gap in history is like a gap in the recollective
self-consciousness of a man; and in the presence of a monument
of ancient times which has outlived the knowledge of itself, as,
for example, the Pyramids, or temples and palaces in Yucatan,
we stand as senseless and stupid as the brute in the presence of
the action of man, in which it is implicated in his service; or as
a man before something written in an old cipher of his own, the
key to which he has forgotten; nay, like a somnambulist who
finds before him in the morning what he has done in his sleep.
In this sense, then, history is to be regarded as the reason, or the
reflected consciousness, of the human race, and takes the place
of an immediate self-consciousness common to the whole race,
so that only by virtue of it does the human race come to be a
whole, come to be a humanity. This is the true value of history,
and accordingly the universal and predominating interest in it[229]
depends principally upon the fact that it is a personal concern
of the human race. Now, what language is for the reason of
individuals, as an indispensable condition of its use, writing is
for the reason of the whole race here pointed out; for only with
this does its real existence begin, as that of the individual reason
begins first with language. Writing serves to restore unity to the
consciousness of the human race, which is constantly interrupted
by death, and therefore fragmentary; so that the thought which
has arisen in the ancestor is thought out by his remote descen-
dant; it finds a remedy for the breaking up of the human race
and its consciousness into an innumerable number of ephemeral
individuals, and so bids defiance to the ever hurrying time, in
whose hand goes forgetfulness. As an attempt to accomplish
this we must regard not only written, but also stone monuments,
which in part are older than the former. For who will believe that
those who, at incalculable cost, set in action the human powers
of many thousands for many years in order to construct the
Chapter XXXVIII. On History. 225
pyramids, monoliths, rock tombs, obelisks, temples, and palaces
which have already existed for thousands of years, could have
had in view the short span of their own life, too short to let
them see the finishing of the construction, or even the ostensible
end which the ignorance of the many required them to allege?
Clearly their real end was to speak to their latest descendants,
to put themselves in connection with these, and so to establish
the unity of the consciousness of humanity. The buildings of
the Hindus, the Egyptians, even the Greeks and Romans, were
calculated to last several thousand years, because through higher
culture their horizon was a wider one; while the buildings of the
Middle Ages and of modern times have only been intended, at
the most, to last a few centuries; which, however, is also due
to the fact that men trusted more to writing after its use had
become general, and still more since from its womb was born
the art of printing. Yet even in the buildings of more recent [230]
times we see the desire to speak to posterity; and, therefore, it is
shameful if they are destroyed or disfigured in order to serve low
utilitarian ends. Written monuments have less to fear from the
elements, but more to fear from barbarians, than stone ones; they
accomplish far more. The Egyptians wished to combine the two,
for they covered their stone monuments with hieroglyphics, nay,
they added paintings in case the hieroglyphics should no longer
be understood.

Chapter XXXIX.25 On The Metaphysics Of
Music.
The outcome, or result, of my exposition of the peculiar signifi-
cance of this wonderful art, which is given in the passage of the
first volume referred to below, and which will here be present to
the mind of the reader, was, that there is indeed no resemblance
between its productions and the world as idea, i.e., the world of
nature, but yet there must be a distinct parallelism, which was
then also proved. I have yet to add some fuller particulars with
regard to this parallelism, which are worthy of attention.
The four voices, or parts, of all harmony, the bass, the tenor,
the alto, and the soprana, or the fundamental note, the third, the
fifth, and the octave, correspond to the four grades in the series
of existences, the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the
brute kingdom, and man. This receives an additional and striking
confirmation in the fundamental rule of music, that the bass must
be at a much greater distance below the three upper parts than
they have between themselves; so that it must never approach
nearer to them than at the most within an octave of them, and
generally remains still further below them. Hence, then, the cor-
rect triad has its place in the third octave from the fundamental
note. Accordingly the effect of extended harmony, in which
the bass is widely separated from the other parts, is much more
powerful and beautiful than that of close harmony, in which it
is moved up nearer to them, and which is only introduced on
account of the limited compass of the instruments. This whole[232]
rule, however, is by no means arbitrary, but has its root in the
natural source of the tonal system; for the nearest consonant
intervals that sound along with the fundamental note by means
of its vibrations are the octave and its fifth. Now, in this rule
we recognise the analogue of the fundamental characteristic of
25 This chapter is connected with § 52 of the first volume.
Chapter XXXIX. On The Metaphysics Of Music. 227
nature on account of which organised beings are much more
nearly related to each other than to the inanimate, unorganised
mass of the mineral kingdom, between which and them exists
the most definite boundary and the widest gulf in the whole of
nature. The fact that the high voice which sings the melody is
yet also an integral part of the harmony, and therein accords
even with the deepest fundamental bass, may be regarded as
the analogue of the fact that the same matter which in a human
organism is the supporter of the Idea of man must yet also exhibit
and support the Ideas of gravitation and chemical qualities, that
is, of the lowest grades of the objectification of will.
That music acts directly upon the will, i.e., the feelings, pas-
sions, and emotions of the hearer, so that it quickly raises them
or changes them, may be explained from the fact that, unlike
all the other arts, it does not express the Ideas, or grades of the
objectification of the will, but directly the will itself.
As surely as music, far from being a mere accessory of poetry,
is an independent art, nay, the most powerful of all the arts, and
therefore attains its ends entirely with means of its own, so surely
does it not stand in need of the words of the song or the action
of an opera. Music as such knows the tones or notes alone, but
not the causes which produce these. Accordingly, for it even
the human voice is originally and essentially nothing else than a
modified tone, just like that of an instrument; and, like every other
tone, it has the special advantages and disadvantages which are a
consequence of the instrument that produces it. Now, in this case,
that this same instrument, as the organ of speech, also serves to [233]
communicate conceptions is an accidental circumstance, which
music can certainly also make use of, in order to enter into a
connection with poetry; but it must never make this the principal
matter, and concern itself entirely with the expression of what
for the most part, nay (as Diderot gives us to understand in Le
Neveu de Rameau), essentially are insipid verses. The words
are and remain for the music a foreign addition, of subordinate
228 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
value, for the effect of the tones is incomparably more powerful,
more infallible, and quicker than that of the words. Therefore, if
words become incorporated in music, they must yet assume an
entirely subordinate position, and adapt themselves completely
to it. But the relation appears reversed in the case of the given
poetry, thus the song or the libretto of an opera to which music
is adapted. For the art of music at once shows in these its power
and higher fitness, disclosing the most profound ultimate and
secret significance of the feeling expressed in the words or the
action presented in the opera, giving utterance to their peculiar
and true nature, and teaching us the inmost soul of the actions
and events whose mere clothing and body is set before us on
the stage. With regard to this superiority of the music, and also
because it stands to the libretto and the action in the relation
of the universal to the particular, of the rule to the example,
it might perhaps appear more fitting that the libretto should be
written for the music than that the music should be composed for
the libretto. However, in the customary method, the words and
actions of the libretto lead the composer to the affections of the
will which lie at their foundation, and call up in him the feelings
to be expressed; they act, therefore, as a means of exciting his
musical imagination. Moreover, that the addition of poetry to
music is so welcome to us, and a song with intelligible words
gives us such deep satisfaction, depends upon the fact that in
this way our most direct and most indirect ways of knowing are
called into play at once and in connection. The most direct is[234]
that for which music expresses the emotions of the will itself, and
the most indirect that of conceptions denoted by words. When
the language of the feelings is in question the reason does not
willingly sit entirely idle. Music is certainly able with the means
at its own disposal to express every movement of the will, every
feeling; but by the addition of words we receive besides this the
objects of these feelings, the motives which occasion them. The
music of an opera, as it is presented in the score, has a com-
Chapter XXXIX. On The Metaphysics Of Music. 229
pletely independent, separate, and, as it were, abstract existence
for itself, to which the incidents and persons of the piece are
foreign, and which follows its own unchanging rules; therefore
it can produce its full effect without the libretto. But this music,
since it was composed with reference to the drama, is, as it were,
the soul of the latter; for, in its connection with the incidents,
persons, and words, it becomes the expression of the inner sig-
nificance of all those incidents, and of their ultimate and secret
necessity which depends upon this significance. The pleasure of
the spectator, unless he is a mere gaper, really depends upon an
indistinct feeling of this. Yet in the opera music also shows its
heterogeneous nature and higher reality by its entire indifference
to the whole material of the incidents; in consequence of which it
everywhere expresses the storm of the passions and the pathos of
the feelings in the same way, and its tones accompany the piece
with the same pomp, whether Agamemnon and Achilles or the
dissensions of a bourgeois family form its material. For only the
passions, the movements of the will, exist for it, and, like God, it
sees only the hearts. It never assimilates itself to the natural; and
therefore, even when it accompanies the most ludicrous and ex-
travagant farces of the comic opera, it still preserves its essential
beauty, purity, and sublimity; and its fusion with these incidents
is unable to draw it down from its height, to which all absurdity
is really foreign. Thus the profound and serious significance of [235]
our existence hangs over the farce and the endless miseries of
human life, and never leaves it for a moment.
If we now cast a glance at purely instrumental music, a
symphony of Beethoven presents to us the greatest confusion,
which yet has the most perfect order at its foundation, the most
vehement conflict, which is transformed the next moment into
the most beautiful concord. It is rerum concordia discors, a
true and perfect picture of the nature of the world which rolls
on in the boundless maze of innumerable forms, and through
constant destruction supports itself. But in this symphony all
230 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
human passions and emotions also find utterance; joy, sorrow,
love, hatred, terror, hope, &c., in innumerable degrees, yet all, as
it were, only in abstracto, and without any particularisation; it is
their mere form without the substance, like a spirit world without
matter. Certainly we have a tendency to realise them while we
listen, to clothe them in imagination with flesh and bones, and to
see in them scenes of life and nature on every hand. Yet, taken
generally, this is not required for their comprehension or enjoy-
ment, but rather imparts to them a foreign and arbitrary addition:
therefore it is better to apprehend them in their immediacy and
purity.

Since now, in the foregoing remarks, and also in the text,
I have considered music only from the metaphysical side, that
is, with reference to the inner significance of its performances,
it is right that I should now also subject to a general consid-
eration the means by which, acting upon our mind, it brings
these about; therefore that I should show the connection of that
metaphysical side of music, and the physical side, which has
been fully investigated, and is well known, I start from the theory
which is generally known, and has by no means been shaken by
recent objections, that all harmony of the notes depends upon
the coincidence of their vibrations, which when two notes sound
together occurs perhaps at every second, or at every third, or[236]
at every fourth vibration, according to which, then, they are the
octave, the fifth, or the fourth of each other, and so on. So long as
the vibrations of two notes have a rational relation to each other,
which can be expressed in small numbers, they can be connected
together in our apprehension through their constantly recurring
coincidence: the notes become blended, and are thereby in consonance. 

If, on the other hand, that relation is an irrational one,
or one which can only be expressed in larger numbers, then no
coincidence of the vibrations which can be apprehended occurs,
but obstrepunt sibi perpetuo, whereby they resist being joined
together in our apprehension, and accordingly are called a dissonance. Now, according to this theory, music is a means of making rational and irrational relations of numbers comprehensible, not
like arithmetic by the help of the concept, but by bringing them
to a knowledge which is perfectly directly and simultaneously
sensible. Now the connection of the metaphysical significance
of music with this its physical and arithmetical basis depends
upon the fact that what resists our apprehension, the irrational
relation, or the dissonance, becomes the natural type of what
resists our will; and, conversely, the consonance, or the rational
relation, which easily adapts itself to our apprehension, becomes
the type of the satisfaction of the will. And further, since that
rational and irrational element in the numerical relations of the
vibrations admits of innumerable degrees, shades of difference,
sequences, and variations, by means of it music becomes the
material in which all the movements of the human heart, i.e., of
the will, movements whose essential nature is always satisfac-
tion and dissatisfaction, although in innumerable degrees, can be
faithfully portrayed and rendered in all their finest shades and
modifications, which takes place by means of the invention of the
melody. 

Thus we see here the movements of the will transferred
to the province of the mere idea, which is the exclusive scene of
the achievements of the fine arts, for they absolutely demand [237]
that the will itself shall not interfere, and that we shall conduct
ourselves as pure knowing subjects. Therefore the affections of
the will itself, thus actual pain and actual pleasure, must not be
excited, but only their substitutes, that which is agreeable to the
intellect, as a picture of the satisfaction of the will, and that which
is more or less repugnant to it, as a picture of greater or less pain.
Only thus does music never cause us actual sorrow, but even in
its most melancholy strains is still pleasing, and we gladly hear
in its language the secret history of our will, and all its emotions
and strivings, with their manifold protractions, hindrances, and
griefs, even in the saddest melodies. When, on the other hand,
in reality and its terrors, it is our will itself that is roused and tormented, we have not then to do with tones and their numerical
relations, but are rather now ourselves the trembling string that
is stretched and twanged.

But, further, because, in consequence of the physical theory
which lies at its foundation, the musical quality of the notes is in
the proportion of the rapidity of their vibrations, but not in their
relative strength, the musical ear always follows by preference, in
harmony, the highest note, not the loudest. Therefore, even in the
case of the most powerful orchestral accompaniment, the soprano
comes out clearly, and thus receives a natural right to deliver the
melody. And this is also supported by its great flexibility, which
depends upon the same rapidity of the vibrations, and shows
itself in the ornate passages, whereby the soprano becomes the
suitable representative of the heightened sensibility, susceptible
to the slightest impression, and determinable by it, consequently
of the most highly developed consciousness standing on the up-
permost stage of the scale of being. Its opposite, from converse
causes, is the bass, inflexible, rising and falling only in great
intervals, thirds, fourths, and fifths, and also at every step guided
by rigid rules. It is therefore the natural representative of the[238]
inorganic kingdom of nature, which is insensible, insusceptible
to fine impressions, and only determinable according to general
laws. It must indeed never rise by one tone, for example, from a
fourth to a fifth, for this produces in the upper parts the incorrect
consecutive fifths and octaves; therefore, originally and in its
own nature, it can never present the melody. If, however, the
melody is assigned to it, this happens by means of counterpoint,
i.e., it is an inverted bass—one of the upper parts is lowered and
disguised as a bass; properly speaking, it then requires a second
fundamental bass as its accompaniment. 

This unnaturalness of
a melody lying in the bass is the reason why bass airs, with full
accompaniment, never afford us pure, undisturbed pleasure, like
the soprano air, which, in the connection of harmony, is alone
natural. We may remark in passing that such a melodious bass, forcibly obtained by inversion, might, in keeping with our metaphysic of music, be compared to a block of marble to which the
human form has been imparted: and therefore it is wonderfully
suitable to the stone guest in “Don Juan.”
But now we shall try to get somewhat nearer the foundation of
the genesis of melody, which can be accomplished by analysing
it into its constituent parts, and in any case will afford us the
pleasure which arises from bringing to abstract and distinct con-
sciousness what every one knows in the concrete, so that it gains
the appearance of novelty.

Melody consists of two elements, the one rhythmical, the
other harmonious. The former may also be described as the
quantitative, the latter as the qualitative element, since the first
is concerned with the duration, and the second with the pitch of
the notes. In the writing of music the former depends upon the
perpendicular, and the latter upon the horizontal lines. Purely
arithmetical relations, thus relations of time, lie at the foundation
of both; in the one case the relative duration of the notes, in the
other the relative rapidity of their vibrations. The rhythmical [239]
element is the essential; for it can produce a kind of melody
of itself alone, and without the other, as, for example, on the
drum; yet complete melody requires both elements. It consists
in an alternating disunion and reconciliation of them, as I shall
show immediately; but first, since I have already spoken of the
harmonious element in what has been said, I wish to consider the
rhythmical element somewhat more closely.
Rhythm is in time what symmetry is in space, division into
equal parts corresponding to each other. First, into larger parts,
which again fall into smaller parts, subordinate to the former.
In the series of the arts given by me architecture and music are
the two extreme ends. Moreover, according to their inner nature,
their power, the extent of their spheres, and their significance,
they are the most heterogeneous, indeed true antipodes. This
opposition extends even to the form of their appearance, for
234 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
architecture is in space alone, without any connection with time;
and music is in time alone, without any connection with space.26
Now hence springs their one point of analogy, that as in architec-
ture that which orders and holds together is symmetry, in music it
is rhythm, and thus here also it holds true that extremes meet. As
the ultimate constituent parts of a building are the exactly similar
stones, so the ultimate constituent parts of a musical composition
are the exactly similar beats; yet by being weak or strong, or
in general by the measure, which denotes the species of time,
these are divided into equal parts, which may be compared to the
dimensions of the stone. The musical period consists of several
bars, and it has also two equal parts, one rising, aspiring, gener-
ally going to the dominant, and one sinking, quieting, returning[240]
to the fundamental note. Two or several periods constitute a
part, which in general is also symmetrically doubled by the sign
of repetition; two parts make a small piece of music, or only
a movement of a larger piece; and thus a concerto or sonata
usually consists of three movements, a symphony of four, and
a mass of five. Thus we see the musical composition bound
together and rounded off as a whole, by symmetrical distribution
and repeated division, down to the beats and their fractions, with
thorough subordination, superordination, and co-ordination of its
members, just as a building is connected and rounded off by its
symmetry. Only in the latter that is exclusively in space which
in the former is exclusively in time. The mere feeling of this
analogy has in the last thirty years called forth the oft-repeated,
daring witticism, that architecture is frozen music. The origin
of this can be traced to Goethe; for, according to Eckermann's
“Conversations,” vol. ii. p. 88, he said: “I have found among
26 It would be a false objection that sculpture and painting are also merely in
space; for their works are connected, not directly, but yet indirectly, with time,
for they represent life, movement, action. And it would be just as false to say
that poetry, as speech, belongs to time alone: this is also true only indirectly of
the words; its matter is all existent, thus spatial.

my papers a page on which I call architecture a rigidified music;
and really there is something in it; the mood which is produced
by architecture approaches the effect of music.” Probably he
let fall this witticism much earlier in conversation, and in that
case it is well known that there were never wanting persons to
pick up what he so let fall that they might afterwards go about
decked with it. For the rest, whatever Goethe may have said, the
analogy of music and architecture, which is here referred by me
to its sole ground, the analogy of rhythm with symmetry, extends
accordingly only to the outward form, and by no means to the
inner nature of the two arts, which is entirely different. Indeed
it would be absurd to wish to put on the same level in essential
respects the most limited and the weakest of all the arts, and
the most far-reaching and powerful. As an amplification of the
analogy pointed out, we might add further, that when music, as
it were in a fit of desire for independence, seizes the opportunity
of a pause to free itself from the control of rhythm, to launch [241]
out into the free imagination of an ornate cadenza, such a piece
of music divested of all rhythm is analogous to the ruin which is
divested of symmetry, and which accordingly may be called, in
the bold language of the witticism, a frozen cadenza.
After this exposition of rhythm, I have now to show how the
nature of melody consists in the constantly renewed disunion
and reconciliation of the rhythmical, and the harmonious ele-
ments of it. Its harmonious element has as its assumption the
fundamental note, as the rhythmical element has the species of
time, and consists in a wandering from it through all the notes
of the scale, until by shorter or longer digressions it reaches a
harmonious interval, generally the dominant or sub-dominant,
which affords it an incomplete satisfaction; and then follows, by
a similarly long path, its return to the fundamental note, with
which complete satisfaction appears. But both must so take place
that the attainment of the interval referred to and the return to
the fundamental note correspond with certain favourite points of the rhythm, otherwise it will not work. Thus, as the harmonious
succession of sounds requires certain notes, first of all the tonic,
next to it the dominant, and so on, so rhythm, on its part, requires
certain points of time, certain numbered bars, and certain parts
of these bars, which are called strong or good beats, or the
accented parts of the bar, in opposition to the weak or bad beats,
or unaccented parts of the bar. Now the disunion of these two
fundamental elements consists in this, that because the demand
of one is satisfied that of the other is not; and their reconciliation
consists in this, that both are satisfied at once and together. That
wandering of the notes until they find a more or less harmonious
interval must so take place that this interval is attained only after
a definite number of bars, and also at an accented part of the
bar, and in this way becomes for it a kind of resting-point; and
similarly the return to the keynote must take place after a like[242]
number of bars, and also at an accented part of the bar, and thus
complete satisfaction is then attained. So long as this required
coincidence of the satisfaction of both elements is not attained,
the rhythm, on the one hand, may follow its regular course, and,
on the other hand, the required notes may occur often enough, but
yet they will remain entirely without that effect through which
melody arises. The following very simple example may serve to
illustrate this:—

Here the harmonious sequence of notes finds the keynote just
at the end of the first bar; but it does not receive any satisfaction
from this, because the rhythm is caught at the least accented
part of the bar. Immediately afterwards, in the second bar, the
rhythm has the accented part of the bar, but the sequence of
notes has arrived at the seventh. Thus here the two elements
of melody are entirely disunited; and we feel disquieted. In the
second half of the period everything is reversed, and in the last
Chapter XXXIX. On The Metaphysics Of Music. 237
note they are reconciled. This kind of thing can be shown in
every melody, although generally in a much more extended form.
Now the constant disunion and reconciliation of its two elements
which there takes place is, when metaphysically considered, the
copy of the origination of new wishes, and then of their satis-
faction. Thus, by flattery, music penetrates into our hearts, for
it presents the image of the complete satisfaction of its wishes.
More closely considered, we see in this procedure of melody a
condition which, to a certain extent, is inward (the harmonious)
meet with an outward condition (the rhythmical), as if by an
accident,—which is certainly brought about by the composer,
and which may, so far, be compared to rhyme in poetry. But this
is just the copy of the meeting of our wishes with the favourable [243]
outward circumstances which are independent of them, and is
thus the picture of happiness. The effect of the suspension also
deserves to be considered here. It is a dissonance which delays
the final consonance, which is awaited with certainty; and thus
the longing for it is strengthened, and its appearance satisfies
all the more. Clearly an analogue of the heightened satisfaction
of the will through delay. The complete cadence requires the
preceding chord of the seventh on the dominant; because the
most deeply felt satisfaction and the most entire relief can only
follow the most earnest longing. Thus, in general, music consists
of a constant succession of more or less disquieting chords,
i.e., chords which excite longing, and more or less quieting and
satisfying chords; just as the life of the heart (the will) is a
constant succession of greater or less disquietude through desire
and aversion, and just as various degrees of relief. Accordingly
the harmonious sequence of chords consists of the correct alter-
nation of dissonance and consonance. 

A succession of merely
consonant chords would be satiating, wearisome, and empty, like
the languor produced by the satisfaction of all wishes. Therefore
dissonances must be introduced, although they disquiet us and
affect us almost painfully, but only in order to be resolved again in consonances with proper preparation. Indeed, in the whole
of music there are really only two fundamental chords, the dis-
sonant chord of the seventh and the consonant triad, to which
all chords that occur can be referred. This just corresponds to
the fact, that for the will there are at bottom only dissatisfaction
and satisfaction, under however many forms they may present
themselves. And as there are two general fundamental moods of
the mind, serenity, or at least healthiness, and sadness, or even
oppression, so music has two general keys, the major and the
minor, which correspond to these, and it must always be in one
of the two. But it is, in fact, very wonderful that there is a sign
of pain which is neither physically painful nor yet conventional,[244]
but which nevertheless is suitable and unmistakable: the minor.
From this we may measure how deeply music is founded in the
nature of things and of man. With northern nations, whose life
is subject to hard conditions, especially with the Russians, the
minor prevails, even in the church music. Allegro in the minor is
very common in French music, and is characteristic of it; it is as
if one danced while one's shoe pinched.
I add further a few subsidiary remarks. When the key-note is
changed, and with it the value of all the intervals, in consequence
of which the same note figures as the second, the third, the
fourth, and so on, the notes of the scale are analogous to actors,
who must assume now one rôle, now another, while their person
remains the same. That the actors are often not precisely suited
to these rôles may be compared to the unavoidable impurity of
every harmonic system (referred to at the end of § 52 of the first
volume) which the equal temperament has introduced.
Perhaps some may be offended, that, according to this meta-
physic of it, music, which so often exalts our minds, which seems
to us to speak of other and better worlds than ours, yet really
only flatters the will to live, because it exhibits to it its nature,
deludes it with the image of its success, and at the end expresses
its satisfaction and contentment. The following passage from the

Chapter XXXIX. On The Metaphysics Of Music. 239

“Vedas” may serve to quiet such doubts: “Etanand sroup, quod
forma gaudii est, ƒøΩ pram Atma ex hoc dicunt, quod quocunque
loco gaudium est, particula e gaudio ejus est” (Oupnekhat, vol.
i. p. 405; et iterum, vol. ii. p. 215).
