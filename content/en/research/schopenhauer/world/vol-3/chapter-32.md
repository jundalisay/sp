Chapter XXXII.14 On Madness.

The health of the mind properly consists in perfect recollection.
Of course this is not to be understood as meaning that our mem-
ory preserves everything. For the past course of our life shrinks
up in time, as the path of the wanderer looking back shrinks up in
space: sometimes it is difficult for us to distinguish the particular
years; the days have for the most part become unrecognisable.
Really, however, only the exactly similar events, recurring an
innumerable number of times, so that their images, as it were,
conceal each other, ought so to run together in the memory that
they are individually unrecognisable; on the other hand, every
event in any way peculiar or significant we must be able to find
again in memory, if the intellect is normal, vigorous, and quite
healthy. In the text I have explained madness as the broken
thread of this memory, which still runs on regularly, although
in constantly decreasing fulness and distinctness. The following
considerations may serve to confirm this.
The memory of a healthy man affords a certainty as to an event
he has witnessed, which is regarded as just as firm and sure as his
present apprehension of things; therefore, if sworn to by him, this
event is thereby established in a court of law. On the other hand,
the mere suspicion of madness will at once weaken the testimony
of a witness. Here, then, lies the criterion between the healthy [168]
mind and insanity. Whenever I doubt whether an event which I
remember really took place, I throw upon myself the suspicion
of madness: unless it is that I am uncertain whether it was not a
mere dream. If another doubts the reality of an event, related by
me as an eye-witness, without mistrusting my honesty, then he
regards me as insane. Whoever comes at last, through constantly
recounting an event which originally was fabricated by him, to
believe in it himself is, in this one point, really insane. We may
14 This chapter is connected with the second half of § 36 of the first volume.
166 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
ascribe to an insane person flashes of wit, single clever thoughts,
even correct judgments, but his testimony as to past events no
man will consider valid. In the Lalita-vistara, well known to
be the history of Buddha Sakya-Muni, it is related that at the
moment of his birth all the sick became well, all the blind saw,
all the deaf heard, and all mad people “recovered their memory.”
This last is mentioned in two passages.15
My own experience of many years has led me to the opinion
that madness occurs proportionally most frequently among ac-
tors. But what a misuse they make of their memory! Daily they
have to learn a new part or refresh an old one; but these parts
are entirely without connection, nay, are in contradiction and
contrast with each other, and every evening the actor strives to
forget himself entirely and be some quite different person. This
kind of thing paves the way for madness.
The exposition of the origin of madness given in the text will
become more comprehensible if it is remembered how unwill-
ingly we think of things which powerfully injure our interests,
wound our pride, or interfere with our wishes; with what difficul-
ty do we determine to lay such things before our own intellect for
careful and serious investigation; how easily, on the other hand,
we unconsciously break away or sneak off from them again;[169]
how, on the contrary, agreeable events come into our minds of
their own accord, and, if driven away, constantly creep in again,
so that we dwell on them for hours together. In that resistance
of the will to allowing what is contrary to it to come under the
examination of the intellect lies the place at which madness can
break in upon the mind. Each new adverse event must be assim-
ilated by the intellect, i.e., it must receive a place in the system
of the truths connected with our will and its interests, whatever
it may have to displace that is more satisfactory. Whenever this
has taken place, it already pains us much less; but this operation itself is often very painful, and also, in general, only takes place slowly and with resistance. However, the health of the mind can
only continue so long as this is in each case properly carried out.
If, on the contrary, in some particular case, the resistance and
struggles of the will against the apprehension of some knowledge
reaches such a degree that that operation is not performed in its
integrity, then certain events or circumstances become for the in-
tellect completely suppressed, because the will cannot endure the
sight of them, and then, for the sake of the necessary connection,
the gaps that thus arise are filled up at pleasure; thus madness
appears. For the intellect has given up its nature to please the
will: the man now imagines what does not exist. Yet the madness
which has thus arisen is now the lethe of unendurable suffering;
it was the last remedy of harassed nature, i.e., of the will.
Let me mention here in passing a proof of my view which is
worth noticing. Carlo Gozzi, in the “Monstro turchino,” act i.
scene 2, presents to us a person who has drunk a magic potion
which produces forgetfulness, and this person appears exactly
like a madman.
In accordance with the above exposition one may thus regard
the origin of madness as a violent “casting out of the mind” of
anything, which, however, is only possible by “taking into the [170]
head” something else. The converse process is more rare, that
the “taking into the head” comes first, and the “casting out of
the mind” second. It takes place, however, in those cases in
which the occasion of insanity is kept constantly present to the
mind and cannot be escaped from; thus, for example, in the case
of many who have gone mad from love, erotomaniacs, where
the occasion of their madness is constantly longed after; also
in the case of madness which has resulted from the fright of
some sudden horrible occurrence. Such patients cling, as it were,
convulsively to the thought they have grasped, so that no other, or
at least none opposed to it, can arise. In both processes, however,
what is essential to madness remains the same, the impossibility
168 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
of a uniformly connected recollection, such as is the basis of
our healthy and rational reflection. Perhaps the contrast of the
ways in which they arise, set forth here, might, if applied with
judgment, afford a sharp and profound principle of division of
delusions proper.
For the rest, I have only considered the physical origin of mad-
ness, thus what is introduced by external, objective occasions.
More frequently, however, it depends upon purely physical caus-
es, upon malformations or partial disorganisation of the brain
or its membranes, also upon the influence which other parts
affected with disease exercise upon the brain. Principally in the
latter kind of madness false sense-perceptions, hallucinations,
may arise. Yet the two causes of madness will generally partake
of each other, particularly the psychical of the physical. It is
the same as with suicide, which is rarely brought about by an
external occasion alone, but a certain physical discomfort lies at
its foundation; and according to the degree which this attains to
a greater or less external occasion is required; only in the case
of the very highest degree is no external occasion at all required.
Therefore there is no misfortune so great that it would influence
every one to suicide, and none so small that one like it has not
already led to it. I have shown the psychical origin of madness[171]
as, at least according to all appearance, it is brought about in the
healthy mind by a great misfortune. In the case of those who
are already strongly disposed to madness physically a very small
disappointment will be sufficient to induce it. For example, I
remember a man in a madhouse who had been a soldier, and
had gone out of his mind because his officer had addressed him
as Er.16 In the case of decided physical disposition no occasion
at all is required when this has come to maturity. The madness
which has sprung from purely psychical causes may, perhaps,
by the violent perversion of the course of thought which has

produced it, also introduce a kind of paralysis or other depravity
of some part of the brain, which, if not soon done away with,
becomes permanent. Therefore madness is only curable at first,
and not after a longer time.
Pinel taught that there is a mania sine delirio, frenzy without
insanity. This was controverted by Esquirol, and since then much
has been said for and against it. The question can only be decided
empirically. But if such a state really does occur, then it is to
be explained from the fact that here the will periodically entirely
withdraws itself from the government and guidance of the intel-
lect, and consequently of motives, and thus it then appears as
a blind, impetuous, destructive force of nature, and accordingly
manifests itself as the desire to annihilate everything that comes
in its way. The will thus let loose is like the stream which has
broken through the dam, the horse that has thrown his rider,
or a clock out of which the regulating screws have been taken.
Yet only the reason, thus reflective knowledge, is included in
that suspension, not intuitive knowledge also; otherwise the will
would remain entirely without guidance, and consequently the
man would be immovable. But, on the contrary, the man in [172]
a frenzy apprehends objects, for he breaks out upon them; thus
he has also consciousness of his present action, and afterwards
remembrance of it. But he is entirely without reflection, thus
without any guidance of the reason, consequently quite incapable
of any consideration or regard for the present, the past, or the
future. When the attack is over, and the reason has regained its
command, its function is correct, because here its proper activity
has not been perverted or destroyed, but only the will has found
the means to withdraw itself from it entirely for a while.
