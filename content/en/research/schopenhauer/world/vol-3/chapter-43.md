One's own experience has the advantage of complete certainty
and the greatest speciality, and this outweighs the disadvantage
that arises from it, that its sphere is limited and its examples not
generally known. Therefore, primarily, I refer every one to his
own experience. 

First of all let him consider himself, confess
to himself his inclinations and passions, his characteristic errors
and weaknesses, his vices, and also his excellences and virtues, if
he has any. Then let him think of his father, and he cannot fail to
recognise all these characteristic traits in him also. On the other
hand, he will often find his mother of an entirely different char-
acter, and a moral agreement with her will very seldom occur,
indeed only through the exceptional accident of a similarity of
the character of the two parents. Let him make this examination,
for example, with reference to quick temper or patience, avarice
or prodigality, inclination to sensuality, or to intemperance, or to
gambling, hard-heartedness or kindliness, honesty or hypocrisy,
pride or condescension, courage or cowardice, peaceableness
or quarrelsomeness, placability or resentfulness, &c. Then let
him make the same investigation with regard to all those whose
characters and whose parents he has accurately known. If he
proceeds attentively, with correct judgment, and candidly, the
confirmation of our principle will not be lacking. 

Thus, for
example, he will find the special tendency to lie, which belongs
to many men, equally present in two brothers, because they have
inherited it from the father; on this account also the comedy,
“The Liar and his Son,” is psychologically correct. However,
two inevitable limitations must here be borne in mind, which
only open injustice could interpret as evasions. First, pater [320]
semper incertus. Only a decided physical resemblance to the
father removes this limitation; a superficial resemblance, on the
other hand, is not sufficient to do so; for there is an after-effect
of earlier impregnation by virtue of which the children of the
second marriage have sometimes still a slight resemblance to the
first husband, and children begotten in adultery to the legitimate
312 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
father. Such an after-effect has been still more distinctly observed
in the case of brutes. The second limitation is, that in the son
the moral character of the father certainly appears, yet under the
modification which it has received through another and often
very different intellect (the inheritance from the mother), and
thus a correction of the observation becomes necessary. This
modification may be important or trifling in proportion to that
difference, but it can never be so great that the fundamental traits
of the paternal character do not always appear under it recog-
nisably enough, like a man who has disguised himself by an
entirely different kind of dress, wig, and beard. For example, if
by inheritance from the mother a man is pre-eminently endowed
with reason, thus with the power of reflection and deliberation,
the passions inherited from his father are partly bridled by this,
partly concealed, and accordingly only attain to a methodical,
systematic, or secret manifestation, and thus a very different
phenomenon from that of the father, who perhaps had only a
very limited mind, will then result; and in the same way the
converse case may occur. The inclinations and passions of the
mother, on the other hand, do not reappear at all in the children,
often indeed their opposite.

Historical examples have the advantage over those of private
life of being universally known; but, on the other hand, they are
of course impaired by the uncertainty and frequent falsification
of all tradition, and especially also by the fact that as a rule they
only contain the public, not the private life, and consequently
only the political actions, not the finer manifestations of char-[321]
acter. However, I wish to support the truth we are speaking of
by a few historical examples, to which those who have made a
special study of history can no doubt add a far larger number of
equally pertinent cases.

P. Decius Mus sacrificed his life for his country with heroic nobleness; for, solemnly committing
himself and the enemy to the infernal deities, with covered face he plunged into the army of the Latins. About forty years later his son, of the same name, did exactly the same thing in the war
against the Gauls (Liv. viii. 6; x. 28). Thus a thorough proof
of the Horatian fortes creantur fortibus et bonis: the converse of
which is thus given by Shakspeare—
“Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base.”
—CYMBELINE, iv. 2.

Early Roman history presents to us whole families whose
members in long succession distinguished themselves by devot-
ed patriotism and courage; such were the gens Fabia and the gens
Fabricia. Again, Alexander the Great was fond of power and
conquest, like his father Philip. The pedigree of Nero which, with
a moral intention, Suetonius (c. 4 et 5) gives at the beginning of
his sketch of this monster is very well worth considering. It is the
gens Claudia he describes, which flourished in Rome through six
centuries, and produced not only capable, but arrogant and cruel
men. From it sprang Tiberius, Caligula, and finally Nero. 

In his
grandfather, and still more strongly in his father, all those atrocious qualities show themselves, which could only attain their
perfect development in Nero, partly because his higher position
afforded them freer scope, partly because he had for his mother
the irrational Bacchante, Agrippina, who could impart to him
no intellect to bridle his passions. Quite in our sense, therefore,
Suetonius relates that at his birth præsagio fuit etiam Domitii,
patris, vox, inter gratulationes amicorum, negantis, quidquam
ex se et Agrippina, nisi detestabile et malo publico nasci po- [322]
tuisse. On the other hand, Cimon was the son of Miltiades, and
Hannibal of Hamilcar, and the Scipios make up a whole family
of heroes and noble defenders of their country. But the son of
Pope Alexander VI. was his hideous image, Cæsar Borgia. The
son of the notorious Duke of Alba was just as cruel and wicked a
man as his father. The malicious and unjust Philip IV. of France,
who is specially known by his cruel torture and execution of the knights templars, had for his daughter Isabella, wife of Edward II. of England, who rebelled against her husband, took him prisoner, and after he had signed his abdication, since the attempt to kill him by ill-usage was unsuccessful, caused him to be put
to death in prison in a manner which is too horrible for me to
care to relate. The blood-thirsty tyrant and defensor fidei, Henry
VIII. of England had a daughter by his first marriage, Queen
Mary, equally distinguished for bigotry and cruelty, who from
her numerous burnings of heretics has won the name of Bloody
Mary. His daughter by his second marriage, Elizabeth, received
an excellent understanding from her mother, Anne Boleyn, which
prevented bigotry and curbed the parental character in her, yet
did not do away with it; so that it still always shone through on
occasions, and distinctly appeared in her cruel treatment of Mary
of Scotland. Van Geuns35 tells a story, after Marcus Donatus, of
a Scotch girl whose father had been burnt as a highway robber
and a cannibal when she was only one year old. Although she
was brought up among quite different people, there developed in
her the same craving for human flesh, and being caught in the act
of satisfying it, she was buried alive. In the Freimüthigen of the
13th July 1821 we read that in the department of Aube the police
pursued a girl because she had murdered two children, whom she
ought to have taken to the foundling hospital, in order to keep[323]
the little money given to the children. At last the police found
the girl on the road to Paris, near Romilly, drowned, and her own
father gave himself up as her murderer. Finally, let me mention a
couple of cases which have occurred recently, and have therefore
only the newspapers as their vouchers. In October 1836 a Count
Belecznai was condemned to death in Hungary because he had
murdered an official and severely wounded his own relations. His
elder brother was executed earlier as a patricide, and his father
also had been a murderer (Frankfurter Postzeitung of the 26th
35 “Disputatio de corporum habitudine, animæ, hujusque virium indice.”
Harderov., 1789, § 9. October 1836). 

A year later the youngest brother of this Count,
in the same street where the latter had murdered the official, fired
a pistol at the steward of his estates, but missed him (Frankfurter
Journal, 16th September 1837). In the Frankfurter Postzeitung
of the 19th November 1857 a correspondent in Paris announces
the condemnation to death of a very dangerous highway robber,
Lemaire, and his companions, and adds: “The criminal tendency
seems hereditary in his family and in those of his confederates,
as several of their race have died on the scaffold.” It follows from
a passage in the Laws of Plato that similar cases were already
known in Greece (Stob. Flor., vol. ii. p. 213). The annals of
crime will certainly have many similar pedigrees to show. The
tendency to suicide is specially hereditary.

On the other hand, when we see the excellent Marcus Aurelius
have the wicked Commodus for a son, this does not not lead us
astray; for we know that the Diva Faustina was a uxor infamis.
On the contrary, we mark this case in order in analogous cases
to presume an analogous reason; for example, that Domitian was
the full brother of Titus I can never believe, but that Vespasian
also was a deceived husband.

Now, as regards the second part of the principle set up thus
the inheritance of the intellect from the mother, this enjoys a
far more general acceptance than the first part, which in itself [324]
appeals to the liberum arbitrium indifferentiæ, while its separate
apprehension is opposed by the doctrine of the simplicity and
indivisibility of the soul. Even the old and popular expression
“mother-wit” shows the early recognition of this second truth,
which depends upon the experience both with regard to small
and great intellectual endowments, that they are the possession of
those whose mothers proportionately distinguished themselves
by their intelligence. That, on the other hand, the intellectual
qualities of the father are not transmitted to the son is proved
both by the fathers and the sons of men distinguished by the
most eminent faculties, for, as a rule, they are quite ordinary
316 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
men, without a trace of the paternal mental gifts. But if now an
isolated exception to this experience, so often confirmed, should
appear; such, for example, as is presented by Pitt and his father,
Lord Chatham, we are warranted in ascribing it to accident, nay,
obliged to do so, although, on account of the exceptional rarity
of great talents, it is certainly an accident of a most extraordinary
kind. Here, however, the rule holds good: it is improbable that
the improbable never happens. Besides, great statesmen (as was
already mentioned in chapter 22) are so just as much through the
qualities of their character, thus through what is inherited from
the father, as through the superiority of their mind. On the other
hand, among artists, poets, and philosophers, to whose works
alone genius is properly ascribed, I know of no case analogous to
that. Raphael's father was certainly a painter, but not a great one;
Mozart's father, and also his son, were musicians, but not great
ones. However, it is indeed wonderful that the fate which had
destined a very short life to both of these men, each the greatest
in his own sphere, as it were by way of compensation, took care,
by letting them be born already in their workshop, that, without
suffering the loss of time in youth which for the most part occurs
in the case of other men of genius, they received even from child-
hood, through paternal example and instruction, the necessary[325]
introduction into the art to which they were exclusively destined.
This secret and mysterious power which seems to guide the
individual life I have made the subject of special investigations,
which I have communicated in the essay, “Ueber die scheinbare
Absichtlichkeit im Schicksale des Einzelnen” (Parerga, vol. i.).
It is further to be observed here that there are certain scientific
occupations which certainly presuppose good native faculties,
yet not those which are really rare and extraordinary; while the
principal requirements are zealous efforts, diligence, patience,
early instruction, sustained study, and much practice. From this,
and not from the inheritance of the intellect of the father, the fact
is to be explained that, since the son always willingly follows the path that has been opened up by the father, and almost all
businesses are hereditary in certain families, in some sciences
also, which before everything demand diligence and persistence,
individual families can show a succession of men of merit; such
are the Scaligers, the Bernouillis, the Cassinis, the Herschels.

The number of proofs of the actual inheritance of the intellect
of the mother would be much greater than it appears if it were
not that the character and disposition of the female sex is such
that women rarely give public proof of their mental faculties;
and therefore these do not become historical, and thus known to
posterity. Besides, on account of the weaker nature in general
of the female sex, these faculties themselves can never reach
the grade in them to which they may afterwards rise in the son;
thus, with reference to themselves, we have to estimate their
achievements higher in this proportion. Accordingly, in the
first instance, only the following examples present themselves
as proofs of our truth. Joseph II. was the son of Maria Theresia.
Cardanus says in the third chapter, “De vita propria:” “Mater
mea fuit memoria et ingenio pollens.” J. J. Rousseau says in the
first book of the “Confessions:” “La beauté de ma mère, son [326]
esprit, ses talents,—elle en avait de trop brillans pour son état,”
&c., and then quotes some delightful lines of hers. D'Alembert
was the illegitimate son of Claudine de Tencin, a woman of
superior mind, and the author of several romances and similar
works, which met with great approbation in her day, and should
even still be enjoyable (see her biography in the “Blätter für
litterarische Unterhaltung,” March 1845, Nos. 71-73). That
Buffon's mother was a remarkable woman is shown by the fol-
lowing passage from the “Voyage à Montbar, par Hérault de
Sechelles,” which Flourens quotes in his “Histoire des travaux
de Buffon,” p. 288: “Buffon avait ce principe qu'en général
les enfants tenaient de leur mère leurs qualités intellectuelles et
morales: et lorsqu'il l'avait développé dans la conversation, il
en faisait sur-le-champ l'application à lui-même, en faisant un éloge pompeux de sa mère, qui avait en effet, beaucoup d'esprit,
des connaissances étandues, et une tête très bien organisée.”

That he includes the moral qualities is an error which is either
committed by the reporter, or depends upon the fact that his
mother had accidentally the same character as himself and his
father. The contrary of this is shown in innumerable cases in
which the mother and the son have opposite characters. Hence
the greatest dramatists could present, in Orestes and Hamlet,
mother and son in hostile conflict, in which the son appears
as the moral representative and avenger of his father. On the
other hand, the converse case, that the son should appear as the
moral representative and avenger of the mother against the father,
would be revolting and, at the same time, almost absurd. This
depends upon the fact that between father and son there is actual
identity of nature, which is the will, but between mother and
son there is merely identity of intellect, and even this only in a
conditioned manner. Between mother and son the greatest moral
opposition can exist, between father and son only an intellectual
opposition. From this point of view, also, one should recognise
the necessity of the Salic law: the woman cannot carry on the[327]
race. Hume says in his short autobiography: “Our mother was a
woman of singular merit.” It is said of Kant's mother in the most
recent biography by F. W. Schubert: “According to the judgment
of her son himself, she was a woman of great natural understand-
ing. For that time, when there was so little opportunity for the
education of girls, she was exceptionally well instructed, and she
also continued later to care for her further education by herself.
In the course of walks she drew the attention of her son to all
kinds of natural phenomena, and tried to explain to him through
them the power of God.” What a remarkably able, clever, and
superior woman Goethe's mother was is now universally known.
How much she has been spoken of in literature! while his father
has not been spoken of at all; Goethe himself describes him as a
man of subordinate faculties. Schiller's mother was susceptible to poetry, and made verses herself, a fragment of which will be
found in his biography by Schwab. Bürger, that genuine poetic
genius, to whom perhaps the first place after Goethe among
German poets belongs—for compared with his ballads those of
Schiller seem cold and laboured—has given an account of his
parents which for us is significant, and which his friend and
physician, Althof repeats in his biography which appeared in
1798, in these words: “Bürger's father was certainly provided
with a variety of knowledge after the manner of study prevalent
at the time, and was also a good, honourable man; but he loved
his quiet comfort and his pipe of tobacco so much, that, as my
friend used to say, he had always first to pull himself together if
he was going to apply himself for a quarter of an hour or so to the
instruction of his son. His wife was a woman of extraordinary
mental endowments, which, however, were so little cultivated
that she had scarcely learnt to write legibly. Bürger thought
that with proper culture his mother would have been the most
famous of her sex, although he several times expressed a strong
disapproval of different traits of her moral character. However, [328]
he believed that he inherited from his mother some mental gifts,
and from his father an agreement with his moral character.”

Walter Scott's mother was a poetess, and was in communication
with the wits of her time, as we learn from the obituary notice of
Walter Scott in the Globe of 24th September 1832. That poems
of hers appeared in print in 1789 I find from an article entitled
“Mother-wit,” in the Blätter für litterarische Unterhaltung of
4th October 1841, published by Brockhaus, which gives a long
list of clever mothers of distinguished men, from which I shall
only take two: “Bacon's mother was a distinguished linguist,
wrote and translated several works, and in all of them showed
learning, acuteness, and taste. Boerhave's mother distinguished
herself through medical knowledge.” On the other hand, Haller
has preserved for us a strong proof of the inheritance of the
mental weakness of the mother, for he says: “E duabus patriciis sororibus, ob divitias maritos nactis, quum tamen fatuis essent
proximæ, novimus in nobilissimas gentes nunc a seculo retro ejus
morbi manasse semina, ut etiam in quarta generatione, quintave,
omnium posterorum aliqui fatui supersint” (Elementa physiol.,
Lib. xxix. § 8). Also, according to Esquirol, madness is more
frequently inherited from the mother than the father. If, however,
it is inherited from the father, I attribute this to the disposition of
the character whose influence occasions it.

It seems to follow from our principle that sons of the same
mother have equal mental capacity, and if one should be highly
gifted the other must be so also. Sometimes it is so. Examples
of this are the Carracci, Joseph and Michael Haydn, Bernard and
Andreas Romberg, George and Frederic Cuvier. I would also add
the brothers Schlegel, if it were not that the younger, Friedrich,
made himself unworthy of the honour of being named along
with his excellent, blameless, and highly distinguished brother,
August Wilhelm, by the disgraceful obscurantism which in the
last quarter of his life he pursued along with Adam Müller. For[329]
obscurantism is a sin, possibly not against the Holy Spirit, but
yet against the human spirit, which one ought therefore never
to forgive, but always and everywhere implacably to remember
against whoever has been guilty of it, and take every opportunity
of showing contempt for him so long as he lives, nay, after he is
dead. But just as often the above result does not take place; for
example, Kant's brother was quite an ordinary man. To explain
this I must remind the reader of what is said in the thirty-first
chapter on the physiological conditions of genius. Not only an
extraordinarily developed and absolutely correctly formed brain
(the share of the mother) is required, but also a very energetic
action of the heart to animate it, i.e., subjectively a passionate
will, a lively temperament: this is the inheritance from the father.
But this quality is at its height only during the father's strongest
years; and the mother ages still more quickly. 

Accordingly the
highly gifted sons will, as a rule, be the eldest, begotten in the full strength of both parents; thus Kant's brother was 11 years younger than him. Even in the case of two distinguished brothers,
as a rule, the elder will be the superior. But not only the age,
but every temporary ebb of the vital force or other disturbance of
health in the parents at the time when the child is begotten may
interfere with the part of one or other, and prevent the appearance
of a man of eminent talent, which is therefore so exceedingly
rare a phenomenon. It may be said, in passing, that in the case
of twins the absence of all the differences just mentioned is the
cause of the quasi-identity of their nature.

If single cases should be found in which a highly gifted son
had a mother who was not mentally distinguished at all, this
may be explained from the fact that this mother herself had a
phlegmatic father, and on this account her more than ordinarily
developed brain was not adequately excited by a corresponding
energy of the circulation—a necessary condition, as I have ex-
plained above in chapter 31. Nevertheless, her highly perfected [330]
nervous and cerebral system was transmitted to the son, in whose
case a father with a lively and passionate disposition and an en-
ergetic action of the heart was added, and thus the other physical
condition of great mental power first appeared here. Perhaps this
was Byron's case, since we nowhere find the mental advantages
of his mother mentioned. The same explanation is also to be
applied to the case in which the mother of a son of genius who
was herself distinguished for mental gifts had a mother who was
by no means clever, for the father of the latter has been a man of
a phlegmatic disposition.

The inharmonious, disproportionate, ambiguous element in
the character of most men might perhaps be referred to the fact
that the individual has not a simple origin, but derives the will
from the father and the intellect from the mother. The more het-
erogeneous and ill-adapted to each other the two parents were,
the greater will that want of harmony, that inner variance, be.

While some excel through their heart and others through their head, there are still others whose excellence lies in a certain
harmony and unity of the whole nature, which arises from the
fact that in them heart and head are so thoroughly adapted that
they mutually support and advance each other; which leads us to
assume that the parents were peculiarly suited to each other, and
agreed in an exceptional measure.

With reference to the physiological side of the theory set
forth, I wish now to mention that Burdach, who erroneously
assumes that the same psychical qualities may be inherited now
from the father, now from the mother, yet adds (Physiologie als
Erfahrungswissenschaft, vol. i. § 306): “As a whole, the male
element has more influence in determining the irritable life, and
the female element, on the other hand, has more influence on the
sensibility.” What Linné says in the “Systema naturæ,” Tom. i.
p. 8, is also in point here: “Mater prolifera promit, ante gene-
rationem, vivum compendium medullare novi animalis suique[331]
simillimi, carinam Malpighianam dictum, tanquam plumulam
vegetabilium: hoc ex genitura Cor adsociat ramificandum in
corpus. Punctum emin saliens ovi incubantis avis ostendit pri-
mum cor micans, cerebrumque cum medulla: corculum hoc,
cessans a frigore, excitatur calido halitu, premitque bulla aërea,
sensim dilatata, liquores, secundum canales fluxiles. Punctum
vitalitatis itaque in viventibus est tanquam a prima creatione
continuata medullaris vitæ ramificatio, cum ovum sit gemma
medullaris matris a primordio viva, licet non sua ante proprium
cor paternum.”
If we now connect the conviction we have gained here of the
inheritance of the character from the father and the intellect from
the mother with our earlier investigation of the wide gulf which
nature has placed between man and man in a moral as in an
intellectual regard, and also with our knowledge of the absolute
unalterableness both of the character and of the mental faculties,
we shall be led to the view that a real and thorough improvement
of the human race might be attained to not so much from without as from within, thus not so much by instruction and culture as
rather upon the path of generation. Plato had already something
of the kind in his mind when in the fifth book of his Republic
he set forth his wonderful plan for increasing and improving his
class of warriors. If we could castrate all scoundrels, and shut
up all stupid geese in monasteries, and give persons of noble
character a whole harem, and provide men, and indeed complete
men, for all maidens of mind and understanding, a generation
would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of
Pericles. But, without entering into such utopian plans, it might
be taken into consideration that if, as, if I am not mistaken, was
actually the case among certain ancient nations, castration was
the severest punishment after death, the world would be delivered
from whole races of scoundrels, all the more certainly as it is
well known that most crimes are committed between the age [332]
of twenty and thirty.36 In the same way, it might be considered
whether, as regards results, it would not be more advantageous
to give the public dowries which upon certain occasions have
to be distributed, not, as is now customary, to the girls who
are supposed to be the most virtuous, but to those who have
most understanding and are the cleverest; especially as it is very
difficult to judge as to virtue, for, as it is said, only God sees the
heart. The opportunities for displaying a noble character are rare,
and a matter of chance; besides, many a girl has a powerful sup-
port to her virtue in her plainness; on the other hand, as regards
understanding, those who themselves are gifted with it can judge
with great certainty after some examination. The following is

<!-- 36 Lichtenberg says in his miscellaneous writings (Göttingen, 1801, vol. ii.
p. 447): “In England it was proposed to castrate thieves. The proposal is not
bad: the punishment is very severe; it makes persons contemptible, and yet
leaves them still fit for trades; and if stealing is hereditary, in this way it is
not propagated. Moreover, the courage ceases, and since the sexual passion
so frequently leads to thefts, this cause would also disappear. The remark that
women would so much the more eagerly restrain their husbands from stealing
is roguish, for as things are at present they risk losing them altogether.”  -->

another practical application. In many countries, among others
in South Germany, the bad custom prevails of women carrying
burdens, often very considerable, upon the head. This must act
disadvantageously upon the brain, which must thereby gradually
deteriorate in the female sex of the nation; and since from that
sex the male sex receives its brain, the whole nation becomes
ever more stupid; which in many cases is by no means necessary.
Accordingly by the abolition of this custom the quantum of in-
telligence in the whole nation would be increased, which would
positively be the greatest increase of the national wealth.
But if now, leaving such practical applications to others, we
return to our special point of view, the ethico-metaphysical stand-
point—since we connect the content of chapter 41 with that of
the present chapter—the following result will present itself to[333]
us, which, with all its transcendence, has yet a direct empirical
support. It is the same character, thus the same individually
determined will, that lives in all the descendants of one stock,
from the remote ancestor to the present representative of the
family. But in each of these a different intellect is given with it,
thus a different degree and a different kind of knowledge. Thus
in each of these life presents itself to it from another side and
in a different light: it receives a new fundamental view of it, a
new instruction. It is true that, since the intellect is extinguished
with the individual, that will cannot supplement the insight of
one course of life with that of another. But in consequence of
each fundamentally new view of life, such as only a renewed
personality can impart to it, its willing itself receives a different
tendency, thus experiences a modification from it, and what is
the chief concern, the will, has, in this new direction, either to
assert life anew or deny it. In this way does the arrangement of
nature of an ever-changing connection of a will with an intellect,
which arises from the necessity of two sexes for reproduction,
become the basis of a method of salvation. 

For by virtue of
this arrangement life unceasingly presents new sides to the will (whose image and mirror it is), turns itself about, as it were,
without intermission before its sight, allows different and ever
different modes of perception to try their effect upon it, so that
upon each of these it must decide for assertion or denial, both
of which constantly stand open to it, only that, if once denial is
chosen, the whole phenomenon ceases for it with death. Now
because, according to this, it is just the constant renewal and
complete alteration of the intellect for the same will which, as
imparting a new view of the world, holds open the path of
salvation, and because the intellect comes from the mother, the
profound reason may lie here on account of which all nations
(with very few and doubtful exceptions) abominate and forbid
the marriage of brothers and sisters, nay, even on account of
which sexual love does not arise at all between brothers and [334]
sisters, unless in very rare exceptions, which depend upon an
unnatural perversity of the instinct, if not upon the fact that one
of the two is illegitimate. For from a marriage of brothers and
sisters nothing could proceed but constantly ever the same will
with the same intellect, as both already exist united in both the
parents, thus the hopeless repetition of the phenomenon which
has already been.

But if now, in the particular case and close at hand, we
contemplate the incredibly great and yet manifest difference
of characters—find one so good and philanthropic, another so
wicked, nay, ferocious; again, behold one just, honest, and up-
right, and another completely false, as a sneak, a swindler, a
traitor, an incorrigible scoundrel—there discloses itself to us a
chasm in our investigation, for in vain we ponder, reflecting on
the origin of such a difference. Hindus and Buddhists solve the
problem by saying, “It is the consequence of the deeds of the
preceding courses of life.” This solution is certainly the oldest,
also the most comprehensible, and has come from the wisest of
mankind; but it only pushes the question further back. Yet a
more satisfactory answer will hardly be found. 

Where we are speaking of the will as thing in itself, the principle
of sufficient reason, as merely the form of the phenomenon,
is no longer applicable; with it, however, all why and whence
disappear. 

Absolute freedom just consists in this, that something
is not subject at all to the principle of sufficient reason, as the
principle of all necessity. Such freedom, therefore, only belongs
to the thing in itself. And this is just the will. Accordingly, in
its phenomenal manifestation, consequently in the Operari, it is
subject to necessity; but in the Esse, where it has determined
itself as thing in itself, it is free. Whenever, therefore, we come
to this, as happens here, all explanation by means of reasons and
consequents ceases, and nothing remains for us but to say that
here manifests itself the true freedom of the will, which belongs[335]
to it because it is the thing in itself, which, however, just as
such, is groundless, i.e., knows no why. But on this account all
understanding ceases for us here, because all our understanding
