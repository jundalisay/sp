Volume 1 showed that the forces of nature lie outside the chain of causes and effects, because they constitute their accompanying condition, their metaphysical foundation, and therefore prove themselves to be eternal and omnipresent, i.e., independent of time and space. Even in the uncontested truth that what is essential to a cause as such consists in this, that it will produce the same effect at any future time as it does now, it is already involved that something lies in the cause which is independent of the course of time, i.e., is outside of all time; this is the force of nature which manifests itself in it. 

One can even convince oneself to a certain extent empirically and as a matter of fact of the ideality of this form of our perception by[043] fixing one's eyes upon the powerlessness of time as opposed to natural forces. If, for example, a rotatory motion is imparted to a planet by some external cause, if no new cause enters to stop it, this motion will endure for ever. This could not be so if time were something in itself and had an objective, real existence; for then it would necessarily also produce some effect. Thus we see here, on the one hand, the forces of nature, which manifest themselves in that rotation, and, if it is once begun, carry it on for ever without becoming weary or dying out, prove themselves to be eternal or timeless, and consequently absolutely real and existing in themselves; and, on the other hand, time as something which consists only in the manner in which we apprehend that phenomenon, since it exerts no power and no influence upon the phenomenon itself; for what does not act is not.

We have a natural inclination whenever it is possible to
explain every natural phenomenon mechanically; doubtless because mechanics calls in the assistance of the fewest original, and hence inexplicable, forces, and, on the other hand, contains
much that can be known a priori, and therefore depends upon
the forms of our own intellect, which as such carries with it the
highest degree of comprehensibility and clearness. However,
in the “Metaphysical First Principles of Natural Science” Kant
has referred mechanical activity itself to a dynamical activity.
On the other hand, the application of mechanical explanatory
hypotheses, beyond what is demonstrably mechanical, to which,
for example, Acoustics also belongs, is entirely unjustified, and
I will never believe that even the simplest chemical combination
or the difference of the three states of aggregation will ever
admit of mechanical explanation, much less the properties of
light, of heat, and electricity. These will always admit only of a
dynamical explanation, i.e., one which explains the phenomenon
from original forces which are entirely different from those of
impact, pressure, weight, &c., and are therefore of a higher [044]
kind, i.e., are more distinct objectifications of that will which
obtains visible form in all things. I am of opinion that light
is neither an emanation nor a vibration; both views are akin
to that which explains transparency from pores and the evident
falseness of which is proved by the fact that light is subject to
no mechanical laws. In order to obtain direct conviction of this
one only requires to watch the effects of a storm of wind, which
bends, upsets, and scatters everything, but during which a ray
of light shooting down from a break in the clouds is entirely
undisturbed and steadier than a rock, so that with great directness
it imparts to us the knowledge that it belongs to another order of
things than the mechanical: it stands there unmoved like a ghost.
Those constructions of light from molecules and atoms which
have originated with the French are indeed a revolting absurdity.
An article by Ampère, who is otherwise so acute, upon light and
heat, which is to be found in the April number of the “Annales
de chimie et physique,” of 1835, may be considered as a flagrant
expression of this, and indeed of the whole of atomism in general.

There the solid, the fluid, and the elastic consist of the same
atoms, and all differences arise solely from their aggregation;
nay, it is said that space indeed is infinitely divisible, but not
matter; because, if the division has been carried as far as the
atoms, the further division must fall in the spaces between the
atoms! Light and heat, then, are here vibrations of the atoms;
and sound, on the other hand, is a vibration of the molecules
composed of the atoms. In truth, however, these atoms are a
fixed idea of the French savants, and therefore they just speak of
them as if they had seen them. Otherwise one would necessarily
marvel that such a matter-of-fact nation as the French can hold
so firmly to a completely transcendent hypothesis, which is quite
beyond the possibility of experience, and confidently build upon
it up to the sky. This is just a consequence of the backward
state of the metaphysics they shun so much, which is poorly[045]
represented by M. Cousin, who, with all good will, is shallow and
very scantily endowed with judgment. At bottom they are still
Lockeians, owing to the earlier influence of Condillac. Therefore
for them the thing in itself is really matter, from the fundamental
properties of which, such as impenetrability, form, hardness, and
the other primary qualities, everything in the world must be ulti-
mately explicable. They will not let themselves be talked out of
this, and their tacit assumption is that matter can only be moved
by mechanical forces. In Germany Kant's teaching has prevented
the continuance of the absurdities of the atomistic and purely
mechanical physics for any length of time; although at the present
moment these views prevail here also, which is a consequence
of the shallowness, crudeness, and folly introduced by Hegel.
However, it cannot be denied that not only the evidently porous
nature of natural bodies, but also two special doctrines of modern
physics, apparently render assistance to the atomic nuisance.
These are, Hauz's Crystallography, which traces every crystal
back to its kernel form, which is an ultimate form, though only
relatively indivisible; and Berzelius's doctrine of chemical atoms,
45
which are yet mere expressions for combining proportions, thus
only arithmetical quantities, and at bottom nothing more than
counters. On the other hand, Kant's thesis in the second antinomy
in defence of atoms, which is certainly only set up for dialectical
purposes, is a mere sophism, as I have proved in my criticism of
his philosophy, and our understanding itself by no means leads
us necessarily to the assumption of atoms. For just as little as
I am obliged to think that the slow but constant and uniform
motion of a body before my eyes is composed of innumerable
motions which are absolutely quick, but broken and interrupted
by just as many absolutely short moments of rest, but, on the
contrary, know very well that the stone that has been thrown flies
more slowly than the projected bullet, yet never pauses for an [046]
instant on the way, so little am I obliged to think of the mass of
a body as consisting of atoms and the spaces between them, i.e.,
of absolute density and absolute vacuity; but I comprehend those
two phenomena without difficulty as constant continua, one of
which uniformly fills time and the other space. But just as the
one motion may yet be quicker than another, i.e., in an equal
time can pass through more space, so also one body may have
a greater specific gravity than another, i.e., in equal space may
contain more matter: in both cases the difference depends upon
the intensity of the acting force; for Kant (following Priestley)
has quite correctly reduced matter to forces. But even if the
analogy here set up should not be admitted as valid, and it should
be insisted upon that the difference of specific gravity can only
have its ground in porosity, even this assumption would always
lead, not to atoms, but only to a perfectly dense matter, unequally
distributed among different bodies; a matter which would cer-
tainly be no longer compressible, when no pores ran through
it, but yet, like the space which it fills, would always remain
infinitely divisible. For the fact that it would have no pores by
no means involves that no possible force could do away with the
continuity of its spatial parts. For to say that everywhere this is only possible by extending the already existing intervals is a
purely arbitrary assertion.

The assumption of atoms rests upon the two phenomena which
have been touched upon, the difference of the specific gravity of
bodies and that of their compressibility, for both are conveniently
explained by the assumption of atoms. But then both must also
always be present in like measure, which is by no means the
case. For, for example, water has a far lower specific gravity
than all metals properly so called. It must thus have fewer atoms
and greater interstices between them, and consequently be very
compressible: but it is almost entirely incompressible.[047]
The defence of atoms might be conducted in this way. One
may start from porosity and say something of this sort: All
bodies have pores, and therefore so also have all parts of a body:
now if this were carried out to infinity, there would ultimately
be nothing left of a body but pores. The refutation would be
that what remained over would certainly have to be assumed as
without pores, and so far as absolutely dense, yet not on that
account as consisting of absolutely indivisible particles, atoms;
accordingly it would certainly be absolutely incompressible, but
not absolutely indivisible. It would therefore be necessary that it
should be asserted that the division of a body is only possible by
penetrating into its pores; which, however, is entirely unproved.
If, however, this is assumed, then we certainly have atoms, i.e.,
absolutely indivisible bodies, thus bodies of such strong cohesion
of their spatial parts that no possible power can separate them:
but then one may just as well assume such bodies to be large as
small, and an atom might be as big as an ox, if it only would
resist all possible attacks upon it.
Imagine two bodies of very different kinds, entirely freed
from all pores by compression, as by means of hammering, or by
pulverisation;—would their specific gravity then be the same?

This would be the criterion of dynamics.
