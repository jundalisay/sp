In the preceding chapter it was called to mind that the (Platonic)
Ideas of the different grades of beings, which are the adequate
objectification of the will to live, exhibit themselves in the knowl-
edge of the individual, which is bound to the form of time, as the
species, i.e., as the successive individuals of one kind connected
by the bond of generation, and that therefore the species is the
Idea (μ0¥ø¬, species) broken up in time. 

Accordingly the true nature of every living thing lies primarily in its species: yet
the species again has its existence only in the individuals. Now,
although the will only attains to self-consciousness in the individ-
ual, thus knows itself immediately only as the individual, yet the
deep-seated consciousness that it is really the species in which
his true nature objectifies itself appears in the fact that for the
individual the concerns of the species as such, thus the relations
of the sexes, the production and nourishment of the offspring,
are of incomparably greater importance and consequence than
everything else. Hence, then, arises in the case of the brutes, heat
or rut (an excellent description of the vehemence of which will
be found in Burdach's “Physiology,” vol. i. §§ 247, 257), and, in
the case of man, the careful and capricious selection of the other
individual for the satisfaction of the sexual impulse, which can
rise to the height of passionate love, to the fuller investigation
of which I shall devote a special chapter: hence also, finally the
excessive love of parents for their offspring.

In the supplements to the second book the will was compared
to the root and the intellect to the crown of the tree; and this is
the case inwardly or psychologically. But outwardly or physio-
logically the genitals are the root and the head the crown. The
nourishing part is certainly not the genitals, but the villi of the
intestines: yet not the latter but the former are the root; because
through them the individual is connected with the species in
which it is rooted. For physically the individual is a production
302 The World as Will and Idea (Vol. 3 of 3)
of the species, metaphysically a more or less perfect picture of
the Idea, which, in the form of time, exhibits itself as species. In
agreement with the relation expressed here, the greatest vitality,
and also the decrepitude of the brain and the genital organs, is
simultaneous and stands in connection. The sexual impulse is to
be regarded as the inner life of the tree (the species) upon which
the life of the individual grows, like a leaf that is nourished
by the tree, and assists in nourishing the tree; this is why that
impulse is so strong, and springs from the depths of our nature.
To castrate an individual means to cut him off from the tree of
the species upon which he grows, and thus severed, leave him to
wither: hence the degradation of his mental and physical powers.
That the service of the species, i.e., fecundation, is followed in
the case of every animal individual by momentary exhaustion
and debility of all the powers, and in the case of most insects
indeed by speedy death, on account of which Celsus said, “Se-
minis emissio est partis animæ jactura;” that in the case of man
the extinction of the generative power shows that the individual
approaches death; that excessive use of this power at every age
shortens life, while, on the other hand, temperance in this respect
increases all the powers, and especially the muscular powers, on
which account it was part of the training of the Greek athletes;
that the same restraint lengthens the life of the insect even to the
following spring; all this points to the fact that the life of the
individual is at bottom only borrowed from the species, and that[311]
all vital force is, as it were, force of the species restricted by
being dammed up. But this is to be explained from the fact that
the metaphysical substratum of life reveals itself directly in the
species and only by means of this in the individual. Accordingly
the Lingam with the Yoni, as the symbol of the species and its
immortality, is worshipped in India, and, as the counterpoise of
death, is ascribed as an attribute to the very divinity who presides
over death, Siva.

But without myth or symbol, the vehemence of the sexual impulse, the keen intentness and profound seriousness with which
every animal, including man, pursues its concerns, shows that it
is through the function which serves it that the animal belongs
to that in which really and principally its true being lies, the
species; while all other functions and organs directly serve only
the individual, whose existence is at bottom merely secondary.
In the vehemence of that impulse, which is the concentration
of the whole animal nature, the consciousness further expresses
itself that the individual does not endure, and therefore all must
be staked on the maintenance of the species, in which its true
existence lies.
To illustrate what has been said, let us now imagine a brute
in rut, and in the act of generation. We see a seriousness and
intentness never known in it at any other time. Now what goes on
in it? Does it know that it must die, and that through its present
occupation a new individual, which yet entirely resembles itself,
will arise in order to take its place? Of all this it knows nothing,
for it does not think. But it is as intently careful for the continu-
ance of the species in time as if it knew all that. For it is conscious
that it desires to live and exist, and it expresses the highest degree
of this volition in the act of generation; this is all that then takes
place in its consciousness. This is also quite sufficient for the
permanence of the kind; just because the will is the radical and [312]
knowledge the adventitious. On this account the will does not
require to be guided by knowledge throughout; but whenever in
its primitive originality it has resolved, this volition will objectify
itself of its own accord in the world of the idea. If now in this
way it is that definite animal form which we have thought of
that wills life and existence, it does not will life and existence in
general, but in this particular form. 

Therefore it is the sight of its
form in the female of its species that stimulates the will of the
brute to the act of generation. This volition of the brute, when
regarded from without and under the form of time, presents itself
as such an animal form maintained through an infinite time by the constantly repeated replacement of one individual by anoth-
er, thus by the alternation of death and reproduction, which so
regarded appear only as the pulse-beats of that form (π¥μ±, μ0¥ø¬,
species) which endures through all time. They may be compared
to the forces of attraction and repulsion in which matter consists.
That which is shown here in the brute holds good also of man;
for although in him the act of generation is accompanied by
complete knowledge of its final cause, yet it is not guided by
this knowledge, but proceeds directly from the will to live as its
concentration. It is accordingly to be reckoned among instinctive
actions. For in reproduction the brute is just as little guided by
knowledge of the end as in mechanical instincts; in these also
the will manifests itself, in the main, without the mediation of
knowledge, which here, as there, is only concerned with details.
Reproduction is, to a certain extent, the most marvellous of all
instincts, and its work the most astonishing.
These considerations explain why the sexual desire has a very
different character from every other; it is not only the strongest,
but even specifically of a more powerful kind than any other. It
is everywhere tacitly assumed as necessary and inevitable, and
is not, like other desires, a matter of taste and disposition. For
it is the desire which even constitutes the nature of man. 

In conflict with it no motive is so strong that it would be certain
of victory. It is so pre-eminently the chief concern that no other
pleasures make up for the deprivation of its satisfaction; and,
moreover, for its sake both brute and man undertake every danger
and every conflict. A very naïve expression of this disposition is
the well-known inscription on the door of the fornix at Pompeii,
decorated with the phallus: “Heic habitat felicitas:” this was for
those going in naïve, for those coming out ironical, and in itself
humorous. On the other hand, the excessive power of the sexual
passion is seriously and worthily expressed in the inscription
which (according to Theon of Smyrna, De Musica, c. 47), Osiris
had placed upon the column he erected to the eternal gods: “To Eros, the spirit, the heaven, the sun, the moon, the earth, the
night, the day, and the father of all that is and that shall be;”
also in the beautiful apostrophe with which Lucretius begins his
work:

“Æneadum genetrix, hominum divomque voluptas,
Alma Venus cet.”

To all this corresponds the important rôle which the relation
of the sexes plays in the world of men, where it is really the
invisible central point of all action and conduct, and peeps out
everywhere in spite of all veils thrown over it. It is the cause of
war and the end of peace, the basis of what is serious, and the aim
of the jest, the inexhaustible source of wit, the key to all allusions,
and the meaning of all mysterious hints, of all unspoken offers
and all stolen glances, the daily meditation of the young, and
often also of the old, the hourly thought of the unchaste, and
even against their will the constantly recurring imagination of
the chaste, the ever ready material of a joke, just because the
profoundest seriousness lies at its foundation. It is, however, the
piquant element and the joke of life that the chief concern of
all men is secretly pursued and ostensibly ignored as much as [314]
possible. But, in fact, we see it every moment seat itself, as the
true and hereditary lord of the world, out of the fulness of its
own strength, upon the ancestral throne, and looking down from
thence with scornful glances, laugh at the preparations which
have been made to bind it, imprison it, or at least to limit it
and wherever it is possible to keep it concealed, or even so to
master it that it shall only appear as a subordinate, secondary
concern of life. But all this agrees with the fact that the sexual
passion is the kernel of the will to live, and consequently the
concentration of all desire; therefore in the text I have called the
genital organs the focus of the will. Indeed, one may say man is
concrete sexual desire; for his origin is an act of copulation and his wish of wishes is an act of copulation, and this tendency alone
perpetuates and holds together his whole phenomenal existence.

The will to live manifests itself indeed primarily as an effort
to sustain the individual; yet this is only a step to the effort
to sustain the species, and the latter endeavour must be more
powerful in proportion as the life of the species surpasses that of
the individual in duration, extension, and value. Therefore sexual
passion is the most perfect manifestation of the will to live, its
most distinctly expressed type; and the origin of the individual
in it, and its primacy over all other desires of the natural man,
are both in complete agreement with this.

One other remark of a physiological nature is in place here,
a remark which throws light upon my fundamental doctrine ex-
pounded in the second book. As the sexual impulse is the most
vehement of desires, the wish of wishes, the concentration of all
our volition, and accordingly the satisfaction of it which exactly
corresponds to the individual wish of any one, that is, the desire
fixed upon a definite individual, is the summit and crown of his
happiness, the ultimate goal of his natural endeavours, with the
attainment of which everything seems to him to have been at-[315]
tained, and with the frustrating of which everything seems to him
to have been lost:—so we find, as its physiological correlative,
in the objectified will, thus in the human organism, the sperm
or semen as the secretion of secretions, the quintessence of all
animal fluids, the last result of all organic functions, and have in
it a new proof of the fact that the body is only the objectivity of
the will, i.e., is the will itself under the form of the idea.

With reproduction is connected the maintenance of the offspring, and with the sexual impulse, parental love; and thus
through these the life of the species is carried on. Accordingly
the love of the brute for its young has, like the sexual impulse, a
strength which far surpasses that of the efforts which merely con-
cerns itself as an individual. This shows itself in the fact that even
the mildest animals are ready to undertake for the sake of their
Chapter XLII. The Life Of The Species. 307
young even the most unequal battle for life and death, and with
almost all species of animals the mother encounters any danger
for the protection of her young, nay, in many cases even faces
certain death. In the case of man this instinctive parental love
is guided and directed by reason, i.e., by reflection. Sometimes,
however, it is also in this way restricted, and with bad characters
this may extend to the complete repudiation of it. Therefore we
can observe its effects most purely in the lower animals. In itself,
however, it is not less strong in man; here also, in particular
cases, we see it entirely overcome self-love, and even extend to
the sacrifice of life. Thus, for example, the French newspapers
have just announced that at Cahors, in the department of Lot, a
father has taken his own life in order that his son, who had been
drawn for military service, should be the eldest son of a widow,
and therefore exempt (Galignani's Messenger of 22d June 1843).

Yet in the case of the lower animals, since they are capable
of no reflection, the instinctive maternal affection (the male is
generally ignorant of his paternity) shows itself directly and [316]
unsophisticated, and therefore with perfect distinctness and in its
whole strength. At bottom it is the expression of the conscious-
ness in the brute that its true being lies more immediately in the
species than in the individual, and therefore, when necessary, it
sacrifices its life that the species may be maintained in the young.
Thus here, as also in the sexual impulse, the will to live becomes
to a certain extent transcendent, for its consciousness extends
beyond the individual, in which it is inherent, to the species. In
order to avoid expressing this second manifestation of the life of
the species in a merely abstract manner, and to present it to the
reader in its magnitude and reality, I will give a few examples of
the extraordinary strength of instinctive maternal affection.
The sea-otter, when pursued, seizes its young one and dives
with it; when it comes up again to take breath, it covers the
young one with its body, and receives the harpoon of the hunter
while the young one is escaping. A young whale is killed merely to attract the mother, who hurries to it and seldom forsakes it
so long as it still lives, even although she is struck with several
harpoons (Scoresby's “Journal of a Whaling Voyage;” from the
English of Kreis, p. 196). At Three Kings Island, near New
Zealand, there are colossal seals called sea-elephants (phoca pro-
boscidea). They swim round the island in regular herds and feed
upon fishes, but yet have certain terrible enemies below water
unknown to us, by whom they are often severely wounded; hence
their swimming together requires special tactics. The females
bring forth their young upon the shore; while they are suckling
them, which lasts from seven to eight weeks, all the males form
a circle round them in order to prevent them, driven by hunger,
from entering the sea, and if this is attempted they prevent it by
biting. Thus they all fast together for between seven and eight
weeks, and all become very thin, simply in order that the young
may not enter the sea before they are able to swim well and[317]
observe the necessary tactics which are then taught them with
blows and bites (Freycinet, Voy. aux terres Australes, 1826). We
also see here how parental affection, like every strong exertion
of the will (cf. chap. xix. 6), heightens the intelligence. Wild
ducks, white-throats, and many other birds, when the sportsman
comes near their nest, fly in front of him with loud cries and
flap about as if their wings were injured, in order to attract his
attention from their young to themselves. The lark tries to entice
the dog away from its nest by exposing itself. In the same way
hinds and does induce the hunter to pursue them in order that
their young may not be attacked. Swallows have flown into
burning houses to rescue their young or perish with them. At
Delft, in a great fire, a stork allowed itself to be burnt in its
nest rather than forsake its tender young, which could not yet
fly (Hadr. Junius, Descriptio Hollandiæ). Mountain-cocks and
woodcocks allow themselves to be taken upon the nest when
brooding. Muscicapa tyrannus protects its nest with remarkable
courage, and defends itself against eagles. An ant has been cut in 2, and the fore half been seen to bring the pupæ to a place
of safety. A bitch whose litter had been cut out of her belly crept
up to them dying, caressed them, and began to whine violently
only when they were taken from her (Burdach, Physiologie als
Erfahrungswissenschaft, vol. ii. and iii.).

The most ordinary experience teaches that in generation the combined seed of the parents not only propagates the peculiarities
of the species, but also those of the individual, as far as bodily
(objective, external) qualities are concerned, and this has also
always been recognised—

“Naturæ sequitur semina quisque suæ.”
—CATULL.

Now whether this also holds good of mental (subjective, in-
ternal) qualities, so that these also are transmitted by the parents
to the children, is a question which has already often been raised,
and almost always answered in the affirmative. More difficult,
however, is the problem whether it is possible to distinguish what
belongs to the father and what to the mother, thus what is the
mental inheritance which we receive from each of our parents.
If now we cast upon this problem the light of our fundamental
knowledge that the will is the true being, the kernel, the radical
element in man, and the intellect, on the other hand, is what is
secondary, adventitious, the accident of that substance; before
questioning experience we will assume it as at least probable
that the father, as sexus potior and the procreative principle,
imparts the basis, the radical element, of the new life, thus the
will, and the mother, as sexus sequior and merely conceiving
principle, imparts the secondary element, the intellect; that thus
the man inherits his moral nature, his character, his inclinations,
his heart, from the father, and, on the other hand, the grade,[319]
quality, and tendency of his intelligence from the mother. Now
this assumption actually finds its confirmation in experience;
only this cannot be decided by a physical experiment upon the
table, but results partly from the careful and acute observation of
many years, and partly from history.
