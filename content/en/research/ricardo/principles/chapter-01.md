Adam Smith observed that "the word Value has 2 different meanings:
- Use-value
- Exchangeable value

 <!-- and sometimes expresses the utility of some particular object, and sometimes the power of purchasing other goods which the possession of that object conveys. The one may be called value in use; the other, value in exchange.  -->

The things which have the greatest use-value have frequently little exchangeable value and vice versa.

<!-- ; and, on the contrary, those which have the greatest value in exchange, have little or no value in use."  -->

Water and air are abundantly useful yet ordinarily, nothing can be obtained in exchange for them..

Gold, on the contrary, is of little use compared with air or water, but will exchange for more goods.

Utility then is not the measure of exchangeable value, although it is absolutely essential to it.

<!-- If a commodity were in no way useful,—in other words, if it could in no way contribute to our gratification,—it would be destitute of exchangeable value, however scarce it might be, or whatever quantity of labour might be necessary to procure it. -->

Useful commodities derive their exchangeable value from 2 sources:

1. Scarcity
2. Quantity of labour required to obtain them

There are some commodities, the value of which is determined by their scarcity alone. No labour can increase the quantity of such goods, and therefore their value cannot be lowered by an increased supply.

Some rare statues and pictures, scarce books and coins, wines of a peculiar quality, which can be made only from grapes grown on a particular soil, of which there is a very limited3 quantity, are all of this description.

Their value is wholly independent of the quantity of labour originally necessary to produce them, and varies with the varying wealth and inclinations of those who are desirous to possess them.

These commodities, however, form a very small part of the mass of commodities daily exchanged in the market. By far the greatest part of those goods which are the objects of desire, are procured by labour; and they may be multiplied, not in one country alone, but in many, almost without any assignable limit, if we are disposed to bestow the labour necessary to obtain them.

In speaking then of commodities, of their exchangeable value, and of the laws which regulate their relative prices, we mean always such commodities only as can be increased in quantity by the exertion of human industry, and on the production of which competition operates without restraint.

In the early stages of society, the exchangeable value of these commodities, or4 the rule which determines how much of one shall be given in exchange for another, depends solely on the comparative quantity of labour expended on each.

{{< l a="Adam Smith" >}}
The real price of every thing, what every thing really costs to the man who wants to acquire it, is the toil and trouble of acquiring it. What every thing is really worth to the man who has acquired it, and who wants to dispose of it, or exchange it for something else, is the toil and trouble which it can save to himself, and which it can impose upon other people.

Labour was the first price—the original purchase-money that was paid for all things.

..in that early and rude state of society, which precedes both the accumulation of stock and the appropriation of land, the proportion between the quantities of labour necessary for acquiring different objects, seems to be the only circumstance which can afford any rule for exchanging them for one another. If among a nation of hunters, for example, it usually cost twice the labour to kill a beaver which it does to kill a deer, one beaver should naturally exchange for, or5 be worth two deer. It is natural that what is usually the produce of two days', or two hours' labour, should be worth double of what is usually the produce of one day's, or one hour's labour.

That this is really the foundation of the exchangeable value of all things, excepting those which cannot be increased by human industry, is a doctrine of the utmost importance in political economy

for from no source do so many errors, and so much difference of opinion in that science proceed, as from the vague ideas, which are attached to the word value.

If the quantity of labour realized in commodities, regulate their exchangeable value, every increase of the quantity of labour must augment the value of that commodity on which it is exercised, as every diminution must lower it.

Adam Smith:
- accurately defined the original source of exchangeable value.
- said that all things became valuable as labour was bestowed on their production.

He also created another standard measure of value.

<!-- , and speaks of things being more or less valuable, in proportion as they will exchange for more or less of this standard measure. -->

Sometimes he speaks of corn, at other times of labour, as a standard measure, as if labour and corn were equivalent expressions.

He does not mean the labor used for production, but the wages that labor represents.*

{{< n n="Right away, Ricardo misunderstands Smith by thinking of objective, physical wages instead of subjective, metaphysical toil and trouble" >}}


<!-- not the quantity of labour bestowed on the production of any object, but the quantity which it can command in the market: as if these were two equivalent expressions, and as if because -->

He assumes that when a man's labour becomes doubly efficient, he could produce twice the quantity of a commodity.
- He would then receive twice in exchange as before. 

 <!-- he would necessarily receive twice the former quantity in exchange for it. -->



I agree that labour or corn can accurately be the measure as long as:
- the labourer's reward were always proportional to what he produced, and
- his commodity would purchase the equal amount of corn


<!-- the quantity of labour bestowed on a commodity, and the quantity of labour which that commodity would purchase, would be equal, and either :  -->

**But they are not equal.**

Labour is an invariable standard correctly indicating the variations of other things.

Corn is subject to as many fluctuations as the commodities compared with it.*

{{< n n="Ricardo fails to understand that corn is just shorthand or a symbol for life. Life is still life while the person is alive." >}}


Smith showed the insufficiency of a variable medium, such as gold and silver, for determining the varying value of other things.

He chose corn or labour which are also variable.*


{{< n n="The labor really represents psychological and emotional stress and hardship. The corn represents life. So life and the struggle in life are equal. Both Ricardo and Malthus shallowly interpret corn and labour in physical terms, which is not what Smith was intending at all. A poor person might seem to struggle more just to live than a rich person. But in reality, the rich person has a lot of people contributing to his life, while the poor person just has himself. It follows that if everyone became selfish cavemen then everyone would be poor. But if everyone became civilized and more and helped each other, then everyone will be rich." >}}


Gold and silver are subject to fluctuations, from the discovery of new and more abundant mines.

But such discoveries are rare.

They are subject to:
- fluctuation from improvements in the skill and machinery which increase production
- fluctuation from the decreasing produce of the mines 

But from which of these sources of fluctuation is corn exempted?

Corn also varies from:
- improvements in agriculture
- improved machinery and implements used in husbandry
- the discovery of new fertile land

Corn is enhanced in value from:
- prohibitions of importation
- increasing population and wealth
- the greater difficulty of obtaining the increased supplies because of the labour needed to cultivate the inferior lands

The value of labour is equally variable.

It is affected, as all other things are, by supply and demand.

{{< n n="Ricardo does not understand that corn represents life, and labour represents a person's need to earn a livelihood, as opposed to stealing or doing crime to live" >}}


<!-- , which uniformly varies with every change in the condition of the community, but also by the varying price of food and other necessaries, on which the wages of labour are expended? -->
