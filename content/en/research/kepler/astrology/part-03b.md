{{< s v="26" >}}  How do we distinguish the forces of the planets – the excess, adequacy or insufficiency?

If they are from reflected light, we have to take into consideration various ways of reflection.
- This is caused by various surfaces.

<!-- I do not want to speak of special reflections, which come from the surface of the mirror and which are reflected from any point to any different point.  -->

I speak of such a reflection which we can see on a wall with uneven or rough surface. This adds the colour of its own to the light it reflects back to any point of the hemisphere.

Reflected light of the Moon comes to us through the second way, not through the first way. 

The crescent of the Moon changes as days pass by.

It is only a part of the always round reflection of the Sun. 

Therefore it may be the geometrical layout of the surface of the Moon which produces the spots on the Moon´s surface.


{{< s v="27" >}} **Reflections have the colour of the reflected surface.**

I ask chemists, what causes the colours of earthly bodies?

We divide the colours of the rainbow into 2 classes:

1. This gives rise to the colour from darkening or lack of own light
2. From refraction of the light and its effect

The principle of both is white light, analogously related to the centre of rainbow, which we divide in 2 parts.

From one side, the light is reduced, from the other side the light is refracted.

On both sides, it turns to black or fades in darkness.

<!-- First in this sorting (from that side where the light is „reduced“)  -->

1. First is gold yellow
2. Red
3. The dark
4. finally, black.

The same appears in the clouds during sunrise or sunset.

The same is valid for the stars, which are near to the horizon.

The same occurs during the eclipses of the Sun, when our eyes which see this illusion are suddenly freed of sunlight. 

As the first from the side of reflected light, we see the green, then blue, violet and at the end the black or dark.

This is the layout of the colours of the rainbow.

It is probable that the same is valid for the reflection.

White surface reflects the rays in the best way, then the green surface follows, then gold yellow, then the sky-blue and red, then purple and dark grey.

The black surface gives minimum reflects.


{{< s v="28" >}} Black surface, when strongly illuminated, diffuses the red ray. 

This can be seen on steel mirror. When the white colour of the face and black colour of the mirror blends, it causes that the face seems slightly red. 

**We can conclude from this that the surface of Mars is black, because it shines red.** *

{{< n n="The error of Kepler is due to him dividing colors into 2. In Cartesian Physics, color is from photon spin. The 7 colors are from the 4 Elements as 4 colors, with 3 colors coming from the 5th Element as aether (blue, indigo, violet)." >}}


Thus, its reflected light is weak, and therefore it has an insufficiency of wet. 

On the same assumption of colour and wet we could conclude that:
- the surface of Saturn is white and uneven because it has a colour of lead
- the surface of Jupiter is red or purple, as it occurs as gold yellow to red
- the surface of Venus should be gold yellow or white and homogeneous because it is the brightest one
- the surface of Mercury should be dark sky-blue or green, as it is coloured silver
  - It is brighter rather for its sparking and dim shine then for its colour.


{{< s v="29" >}} Reflected light also differs according to the surface of the body from which it comes, and as it was shown, according to this or that colour.

But heat comes from inner disposition of the body. 

But even when the surface itself indicates the disposition of the body, the wet to some extent depends on quantity of warmth.

If the colour can be transformed and spread from one body to another by means of effect of light, it is probable that other qualities can be transmitted as well.

The warmth is transmitted this way for sure. 

It shows to be correct that the nature of the body of each planet will be alike to the strength of the effect of this planet. 

This can lead to awesome theories. 

It means it is unhealthy to stay in summer in front of the wall illuminated by the sun, because:
- the plaster contains calcite whích corrodes and binds
- the rays which the wall reflects then act in the same way.

It seems that some kind of shine comes from the light itself. 

If the thing has its own light, surely it does not stick on the surface, but it has its roots in the deep, as we see on jewels. 

Therefore, if the thing is transparent, it has to be shiny. 

Actually, many things shine thanks to their own warmth, which is embodied in their disposition.
