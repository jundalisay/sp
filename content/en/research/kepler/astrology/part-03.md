{{< s v="22" >}} The 2 forces – warm and wet – have 3 varieties: 

1. Excess (Excesus)
2. Adequate (Mediocritas)
3. Insufficient (Defectus)


At first, there are independent qualities:

1. Warmth in Excess
2. Warmth in Adequate (M)
3. Warmth in Insufficient (D)
4. Wet in Excess
5. Wet in Adequate (M)
6. Wet in Insufficient (D)

This creates 6 varieties. 

From the combination of both qualities, 9 varieties arise, as seen in the table. 

Thus, we have 15 varieties in total. 

<!-- Which of those can we choose and which are to be refused? -->


{{< s v="23" >}} **1. A solitary insufficiency or excess cannot exist without compensation**. 

Hence, of the 6 independent qualities, 4 are eliminated. 

I consider the adequacy in proportions of the world, not of quantity

And so what remains is the adequacy of the warm force which resides in solar body and uses merely its own light.

Then the adequacy of wet force, which resides in lunar body and uses merely the light borrowed from the Sun and stars.


{{< s v="24" >}} **2. Neither the accumulation of excess nor that of insufficiency can bring about a satisfactory development.**

Such a development can occur, if we temper by mixture that (slightly different) excess and insufficiency of warmth and wet. 

Thus, no planet has an excess or insufficiency. Therefore, 7 varieties remain, aside of combinations mentioned above.

Apart from that, 2 other couples drop out. 

The proportion of excess of warmth to adequacy of wet is the same as the proportion of adequacy of warmth to insufficiency of wet, and the proportion of insufficiency of warmth to adequacy of wet is the same as the proportion of adequacy of warmth to the excess of wet – this can be shown by parallel lines in the table. 

The same is valid regarding the connection between excess or insufficiency.

Therefore we have 5 correct variations:
- 3 simple 
- 2 double

More likely – 2 names and 1 variation with 3 names. 

This is why there are 3 outer planets and 2 inner ones*.


{{< n n="In Superphysics the reason for the inner and outer planets are the gravitational territories having an inner, middle, and outer regions. Kepler was too obsessed with the 5 Platonic solids being the 5 Planets and so he makes this wrong analogy. " >}}

<!-- , for this reason (although other reasons are obvious) it is surely correct that the planets have been created in such a number. -->

Nothing can be more apt than matching those combinations one to another, which I would like to present by means of the following table.

<!-- W A R M Solis F O R C E Exc S J mer A U T VE J mer Med U R M Def A VE J U P I cu N U P S cu N I P I T E U ri M T R U ri E T E R S R Exc W E T Med Lunae F O R C E S A us R S N U us R S Def Recapitulation of table : Warmth Wet M M E M M E D E E E E D Warmth Wet M D D M M M Warmth Wet D D assignment forces to the planets Sun Moon Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter Saturn -->


{{< s v="25" >}} This means that 5 planets:
- use the borrowed sunlight
- also add something from themselves

If many of our physical bodies on Earth have its own natural light, what impedes to other celestial bodies besides the Sun to have the same light?

The planets lack their own light. But they change their face in the same way as the Moon does. 

The shine and sparking are the proof of their own light.

But if místy and bland, the light is reflected (somebody else´s).
