{{< s v="35" >}} The causes for future events include a lot of speculation.
- But these are much closer to the nature of the topic than those which I will mention later.

The way of their effect lays in a **certain outflow of light**, which is heading to sublunar bodies. 

Its flow lacks substance and time. 
- But it does have a limitation. 

It expands in direct course.

It changes intensity of its influence depending on:

 <!-- from the start, then according to -->
1. The distance
2. The changing intensity of shining surface of the planets
3. Contact with non-transparent obstacles on its way

This flow of light is continuous.
- Its influence corresponds with the importance of the star.

This applies relatively between various stars. 

<!-- not only to one and only star, but also to the comparison of various stars. -->

The Sun and Moon have the biggest visible diameters. 
- This is why these powers are also most evident in them. 

In other planets with smaller diameter, those powers are hardly visible. 

Still, such variations of the qualities are disregarded by most astrologers, who usually divine in a way which will be described later.


{{< s v="36" >}} Another cause concerns all planets equally.
- It is known much longer than the former one, and much more admired. 

It is of purely mental form which has psychic power, based on intellect and of geometrical knowledge.

<!-- There is nothing material in it, but it has mental form, not of simple, but of psychic power, of   -->

The effect is not caused only by the straight lines of rays from single stars, but by any rays of any 2 stars which meet on Earth, be it in geometrical or in harmonious way.

The ray always occurs as descending. Nothing can hinder it, not even if the whole Earth is in its way as a shadow-casting element between us and the stars.

It gives effect either from hidden stars below the Earth, or from visible stars above.

Finally, its effect is almost instantaneous during the change from geometrical to harmonic angle.

It occurs immediately or with just a slight delay, no matter if the light of the stars is changing. 

This is confirmed by reliable and rich experience.

{{< f f="The harmonic angle in Kepler´s interpretation means an angle, which can be described by the ratio of integers related to the circumference, that is, any of the aspects. By geometrical angle, Kepler means any arbitrary angle." >}}



{{< s v="37" >}}  God's' material universe is of bodily, quantitative form.

This body does not have to help further on. This is because every single place, every space, which is filled by material body, changes according to given proportions.*

{{< n n="This is consistent with Descartes' virtual space particles" >}}

These proportions are based on fixed shapes of the order of creation. I demonstrated this in my Mysterium Cosmographicum. 

The movements of the bodies are the life of the universe. 

They may either harmonize pleasantly, or operate together very harshly.

This resuts in proportions determined by regular polygons. 

<!-- The idea is, that given planar forms – -->

**The movement of the body resonates with the shape of the planar form.** 

Only 5 fixed orders (platonic bodies) are possible in geometry. So also the number of harmonic originators from regular planar patterns derived from those 5 cannot be more than 8.

I will explain it in "Harmonia Mundi".

The 5 platonic bodies are: 

1. Tetrahedron
2. Cube or regular hexahedron
3. Octahedron
4. Dodecahedron
5. Icosahedron


{{< s v="38" >}}  There are 8 kinds of exactly given relationships.

The effect of heaven on Earth is executed through stellar rays, which meet on Earth and form angles. 

Therefore, the 8 harmonic relationships will depend on size of those angles.

The classical authors did not consider more than 5 aspects, which are commonly known as conjunction, opposition, square, trine and sextile. 

Yet, my idea is to add 3:

1. Quintile (72 grades)
2. Biquintile (144 grades)
3. Sesquiquartile (90+45 = 135 grades, i.e. trioctile). 

Those have subsequently been confirmed by manifold experience.

<!-- n n="This means that Kepler is really refering to the 8 chakras which are circular energy-plates known to reflect light -->

The classical aspects hereby mentioned correspond with: 
- a point
- a line segment
- a triangle
- a square
- a hexagon. 

{{< f f="Kepler here adds to those aspects the angles found in pentagon and in octagon." >}}
