{{< s v="56" >}} I should write about the summer and also whether the year itself or the Earth will be in good condition this year.

The universal cause of energetic disposition of years is not known

Astrological estimations for certain year are not exact due to a great lack of knowledge of causes.

I think that my forecast deserves some forbearance. 

These astrological estimations are not useless, because they deal with the subject which is very important.

We hope that those hitherto unknown causes will be gradually clarified in time.

I think that the beginning of June will be warm and clear, without clouds. 

After Full Moon, dangerous disturbances, floods and frequent lightning will occur. 

Should the overall disposition of Earth incline to dryness, then there will be no danger. 

On the contrary, should it incline to humidity, then there will be continuous cold rains.

Towards the end of the month, stable period continues regarding the aspects. 
- Thunderstorms will occur. 

I guess that June will be slightly colder due to bigger humidity, unless the whole year 1602 would be like this. 

Should the whole year incline to dryness, it will be much more evident during this month.

{{< s v="57" >}} For July, as this month has 18 aspects, the forecast is similar and equally uncertain. 

Each year has approximately 150 aspects and this year most of it culminates in summer half of the year. On July 1, 2, 5 and 6, the weather will be of average character, windy with precipitations. 

July 8 will be rainy and cold, July 9-11 windy. Days of July 12, 13 and 14 will be adversely afflicted by the conjunction Venus/Mercury, which occurs repeatedly four times this year, and it can cause severe storms. 

Heavy rains and thunderbolt will alternate on July 18, 19 and 21. Then, clear sky and very hot weather will follow, because on the beginning of August Jupiter conjuncts Mars.

{{< s v="59" >}}  The beginning of September will be regular. Rain and fog on September 11, sultry on September 15 and 17. 

September 20 will be very adversely afflicted by the conjunction of Mars and Saturn. 

If there had been hot weather before, tremendous storms will occur. If the year had been overall wet, there will be hard cold rains and fogs in these days. 

Fog will occur also on September 27. Other days will be regular.

{{< s v="60" >}}  Cold rains will occur on October 5, otherwise the weather will be influenced by preceeding month of September.

As I have often stated, the kind of basic disposition of Earth in any month is very important.

October 3, 9 and 27 will be rainy and stormy, on 28 and 29 there will be gusty winds and rains, but I think the
warmth will prevail, although the nature of certain winds can be very cold with regard to the region.

{{< s v="61" >}}  In November, there will be usual number of rainy days, on November 5, strong and sharp wind. 

On November 15, the weather will be changeable and warm for this time, caused by Venus/Jupiter sextile. 

It will rain on November 18, but if the sky will be clear, first frosts will occur, although it seems to me that due to the position of Jupiter, Mars and Venus probably there will not be cold yet, but several warm, rainy and windy days at the end of the month. Occasionally, those aspects will bring about cold weather to some regions.

{{< s v="62" >}} The winter will start on December 3, with snow and fog, although not very cold. 

Then, the aspects will be calm, which will bring about clear and slightly cold weather. 

It will snow on December 15. The cold will not persist, but on December 19 there will be strong wind and heavy rain. 

On Christmas, Saturn and Mars will be in sextile, therefore it will get colder, and then the sextile between Venus and Mercury will bring about a lot of snow.
