The principle of selection is so potent in the hands of man.

Does it apply in nature? How will the struggle for existence act in regard to variation? 


Our domestic productions have a lot more variety than wild organisms.


### How Strong is the Hereditary Tendency?

Under domestication, the whole organisation becomes plastic.

The mutual relations of all organic beings to each other and to their living conditions are infinitely complex and close-fitting.

<!-- Can it, then, be thought improbable, seeing that variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred, that other variations useful in some way to each being in the great and complex battle of life, should sometimes occur  -->

In the course of thousands of generations, useful variations also occur in the wild.

<!-- If such do occur, can we doubt (remembering that many more individuals are born than can possibly survive) that -->

The individuals which have any advantage over others, however slight, would have the best chance of surviving and of procreating.

Any injurious variation would be rigidly destroyed.

Natural Selection is this:
- preservation of favourable variations 
- rejection of injurious variations

Variations neither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection.

They would be left a fluctuating element, as we see in the "polymorphic" species.

We best understand the probable course of natural selection by looking into physical changes in the country, such as climate change. 

 <!-- taking the case of a country undergoing some , for instance, of climate.  -->

The proportional numbers of its inhabitants would almost immediately undergo a change. Some might become extinct. 

<!-- We may conclude, from what we have seen of the intimate and complex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are bound together, that  -->

Any change in population, independent of climage change itself, would most seriously affect many of the others. 

If the country were open on its borders, new forms would immigrate.

This also would seriously disturb the relations of some of the natives.

This is proven by the influence of a single introduced tree or mammal.


<!-- In the case of an island, or of a country partly surrounded by barriers, into which  -->

<!-- New and better adapted forms could not freely enter an island. 

 we should then have places in the economy of nature which would assuredly be better filled up, if some of the original inhabitants were in some manner modified; for, had the -->

If an area is open to immigration, these same places would be seized on by intruders. 

The course of time would lead to slight modifications.

<!-- , which in the course of ages chanced to arise, and which in any way favoured the individuals of any of the species, by better adapting them to their altered conditions, would tend to be preserved. -->

Natural selection would thus have free scope for the work of improvement.

A change in the conditions of life, by specially acting on the reproductive system, causes or increases variability.

 <!-- and in the foregoing case the conditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change, and this would manifestly be favourable to natural selection.  -->

It gives a better chance of profitable variations occurring.

Unless profitable variations do occur, natural selection can do nothing.

An extreme amount of variability is not necessary.

Man can produce great results by adding up individual differences. Nature could do this far more easily as she has longer time at her disposal. 

Any great physical change, such as of climate or unusual isolation, is not necessary for natural selection.

 <!-- produce new and unoccupied places for  to fill up by modifying and improving some of the varying inhabitants.  -->

This is because all are struggling together with nicely balanced forces. Extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of one inhabitant would often give it an advantage over others.

 <!-- and still further modifications of the same kind would often still further increase the advantage.  -->

<!-- No country can be named in which all the native inhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to the physical conditions under which they live, that none of them could anyhow be improved; for in all countries, the natives have been so far conquered by naturalised productions, that they have allowed foreigners to take firm possession of the land. And as foreigners have thus everywhere beaten some of the natives, we may safely conclude that the natives might have been modified with advantage, so as to have better resisted such intruders.

As man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by his methodical and unconscious means of selection, what may not nature effect? Man can act only on external and visible characters: nature cares nothing for appearances, except in so far as they may be useful to any being.  -->

Nature can act on every internal organ, on every shade of constitutional difference, on the whole machinery of life.

Man selects only for his own good; 

Nature only for that of the being which she tends. Every selected character is fully exercised by her; and the being is placed under well-suited conditions of life. 

Man keeps the natives of many climates in the same country.

<!-- he seldom exercises each selected character in some peculiar and fitting manner; he feeds a long and a short beaked pigeon on the same food; he does not exercise a long-backed or long-legged quadruped in any peculiar manner; he exposes sheep with long and short wool to the same climate. He does not allow the most vigorous males to struggle for the females. 

He does not rigidly destroy all inferior animals, but protects during each varying season, as far as lies in his power, all his productions. He often begins his selection by some half-monstrous form; or at least by somemodification prominent enough to catch his eye, or to be plainly useful to him. -->

In the wild, the slightest difference of structure or constitution may turn the balanced scale in the struggle for life.

 <!-- and so be preserved. How fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man! how short his time! and consequently how poor will his products be, compared with those accumulated by nature during whole geological periods.  -->

This is why nature's productions are far 'truer' in character than man's productions.

They are infinitely better adapted to the most complex conditions of life. 

<!-- , and should plainly bear the stamp of far higher workmanship?  -->
