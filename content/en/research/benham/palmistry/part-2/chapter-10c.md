All defects in the Saturn line are important, for they show:
- how many and what kind of impediments will occur in the subject's life
- how serious they will be

It is possible to remedy or avoid a good many of the defects. 

All defects found in the beginning of the Saturn line refer to the childhood of the subject.
- During this period, the child is too young to do much by himself, either toward improving or hindering his condition. 

Consequently, all defects or impediments to childhood are either the result of:
- ill-health, or
- from paternal influences

The death of parents, their financial difficulty occurring at this time, or estrangements which may occur between the parents, are all possibilities and are all causes which will check the prosperous career of a child.

<!-- , whose start in life may thus be impeded by these conditions.  -->

A defective Saturn line at the start that grows deep and well cut (358) shows that the trouble at the beginning has been overcome.

<!-- Such a line shows either that the improved condition arises from the removal of the causes which were operating against the subject, or that he has himself risen superior to the obstacles. 

It makes no difference as to the character of the defect which appears in the beginning of a Saturn line, the general rule is the same. It indicates an impediment to the early years of the subject.  -->

If a short Influence line on the Mount of Venus ends in a star, and the Saturn line is chained at the start, the death of a parent has clouded the early career of the subject (359).
- The age at which this parent died can be read from the distance the star reaches on the Life line.
- The date at which the improvement in the affairs of the subject occurred can be read from the line of Saturn.

If a short line of Influence ends in a star and a Worry line run from it and cut a rising branch on the Life line ending in an island on the line of Head (360), the death of a parent has brought on a check to the upward course of the subject's life which has affected his mental strength, and thus checked and retarded his career.

Islands in the Saturn line (361) were thought to be a check to the career, arising from the marital infidelity or moral depravity of the subject.

<!-- It was recognized by older palmists that islands always indicated trouble, and as the above reading of immorality originated in lands where virtue among women was rarer than in this country, it was seen on the hands of many women who had bad reputations and ruined and checkered careers. 

These women being known to be profligate, this interpretation of immorality was given the island in the line of Saturn. This indication has caused much discussion among palmists, and much confusion and error among practitioners.  -->

I have found that an island in the Saturn line indicates a period of financial difficulty, lasting the length of the island.

Sometimes, infidelity caused the financial trouble.

<!-- , and that the marking is not per se an indication of infidelity. 

This conclusion has been reached after the examination of hundreds of hands having such a marking, in which financial trouble or losses have been completely verified, and in which only a few cases of infidelity were found accompanying it. In these latter cases I am sure that the infidelity caused the financial trouble.  -->

<!-- The Line Of Saturn Part 4 512 No. 361.  -->

An island at the start of the Saturn line means financial difficulty through a difficulty of his parents.
- If such be the case, Worry lines will often be seen running from Influence lines on the Mount of Venus, to the island in Saturn line (362).

The prolonged delicacy of the subject's health will cause difficulty in early life, and will last until the Saturn line grows better (363) if:
- the Life line is defective at the start (broad and shallow, chained, islanded, split or broken), and
- this continues past childhood  
- an island is at the start of the Saturn line

<!-- ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/363.png) -->


If the Head line is defective early in its course, with an island at the beginning of the line of Saturn (364), poor mentality will  check to the career of the subject. In these cases of ill health the Life line and other parts of the hand will be weak in sympathy. 

<!-- ![Saturn](/graphics/palm/364.png) -->


If a short Influence line on the Mount of Venus end with a star, with an island in the line of Saturn at its beginning, the death of a parent will cause financial difficulty during early life (365). This indication is intensified if Worry lines run to the island from this star.

If Worry lines run from Influence lines on Mount of Venus to an island at the beginning of the Saturn line, constant annoyances in the early life of the subject bring about a check to his career (366). 

These Worry lines cut the Life line and produce the island on the Saturn line.

Islands at the start of the Saturn line can be explained by a cause somewhere else in the hand. These can only be caused by:
- health
- heredity

Go over every line in the hand and hunt for defects. 

Go over the Influence lines on Mount of Venus to discover what part relatives may play.

Look to the Mounts for health defects of all the types, and for chance lines pointing from these defects to the island. In this way the cause of trouble can be found.
