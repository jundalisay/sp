Sometimes they only divide it, and the line continues a double line with the splits running close together (244).

This reduces the strength of the constitution during the period of the split, and while it may not result in positive delicacy, it will diminish the vitality. 

Sometimes such a split will extend for only a short space. Often it will go the entire length of the line. 

In any case, the divided strength operates during the continuance of the split. 

Sometimes, the splits are fine and hair-like (245), and do not diminish the size of the Main line. 

These are generally seen accompanying a deep line, and show the excess of strength of the line. 

There is, as it were, a running over of vitality, and these fine, hair-like splits must be read as confirming the strength of a deep, strong line. 

When fine, hair-like lines are seen rising from the line (246), it generally occurs in the early part of the line. This shows the upward course of the subject's life. He is filled with ambition, pride, and a desire to achieve success. The fine rising lines show that the Current which overflows from the line is drawn upward by the force of attraction of the Mounts under the fingers. 

The exit of the Current, you remember, is through the fingers of Saturn, Apollo, Mercury, and these rising hair-like lines from the Life line show that the Current is being impelled in its proper direction, with a force strong enough to pull these fine lines upward. The period covered by these rising lines on the Life line is that of the years of greatest power in the life of the subject. 

He will have his greatest earning capacity and command of his best brain power and strength. During this time he should accomplish the most important part of his life's work.

A time will come when the little lines do not rise from the Life line, but fall downward (247). At this time there is no such strength as during the period covered by the rising lines. 

The Current is not forced upward by the great power of enthusiasm and vital energy, and the life forces, ambition, and the capacity to do, begin to wane from the time of life when these hair lines begin to fall downward. 


[Tuning point in life](/graphics/palm/248.png)

The turning-point in the life of the subject is where the rising lines cease to rise and the drooping lines begin (248). This point marks the pinnacle of his capabilities.
- He will never be able to do afterwards what is possible before this point is reached. 

This turning-point in the life was placed before us for our guidance. 

I have studied this a lot. I have verified it in the lives of hundreds of people. 

From it, you can tell your client when he must have his house in order and be ready to begin the descent of the hill of life. 

In some hands, it is seen early in life. In others later.

<!-- But whenever it occurs, that year marks the point of greatest power in the subject's life.  -->

When seen early in life, it is sometimes formed around an island (249). It shows that a delicacy occurring at that time will dissipate the powers so that they will never fully recover.

When the turning-point shows at near 50, it is the natural decline of physical power coming on with age. 

When rising lines or a single line from the Life line rises to Jupiter (250), it shows the great ambition which leads its possessor constantly to struggle to win. You can tell in which world by the phalanx of the finger which rules. 

If a rising line runs to Saturn (251), it will indicate a great desire of the subject to succeed along Saturnian lines. In which world will be indicated by the phalanx of the finger which rules. If a line rises to Apollo (252), the subject will have great desires in Apollonian directions, the particular world being read from the phalanx of the finger. If a line rises to Mercury (253), the subject will have great desire to succeed in some Mercurian direction, indicated in more detail by the ruling phalanx of finger. This line must not be confused with the line of Mercury.

If a line runs from the Life line to Upper Mars (254), the subject will be strongly ambitious in Martian directions ; and Lunar qualities will strongly influence the life if a split line is seen running to the Moon (255). All of these lines must be fine lines rising off of the Life line, and not chance lines crossing or cutting the line. 

In an estimate of the Life line the termination is most important, for it shows how the life ends. In all of the changes on the line we find that they have shown the strength of the constitution during life, various states of health, strength, delicacy, and numerous diseases. When we come to the termination of the line, we learn the outcome of these various conditions. 

The Life line will be found ending in different hands at all periods of life. It will be found ending in different manners, and that is what we consider under the general heading of "Termination of the line." If a line is deep and strong it may end as strong as is its course through the hand. This line simply stops short, ending in no sign or special marking (256). 

This indicates that the subject will remain strong till the end of life, will die of no lingering or wasting disease. With such a termination examine the Head line, the Heart line, and study the type of the subject carefully. If a Jupiterian or Martian, it will make his quick ending more certain. While no sign is seen on the Life line, a deep cut or cross, a dot or a star, may be discerned on the Head line corresponding to the age at which the Life line ends, and this will be the sign of the demise (257). 

In this case the abrupt termination of the Life line will give the clue to a quick end, and the sign on the Head line will tell that some affection of the head will be the cause. In the same manner an impairment of the Heart line by some individual sign, such as a cut, a cross, dot, or star, will show that heart failure will be the end (258). With sudden terminations of the Life line you should not look for chronic diseases but for acute attacks, and these are indicated by individual signs like the dot, cross, cross-bar, and star. 

Sometimes breaks indicate the same thing. With the sudden ending to the Life line, and a dot, cross, cross-bar on a wavy line of Mercury, a sudden attack of bilious fever will be the trouble, the wavy line of Mercury showing a chronic tendency, the individual sign indicating the acute attack (259). If a line should run from the end of the Life line to these signs it will make the reading more certain. 

In the same manner a dot on any Mount and the sudden termination of the Life line will show the end to be from an acute attack (shown by dot) of the health defect of the Mount. If a line runs from the end of Life line to the dot, it will make the indication unmistakable.

Thus while the termination of the life may not always be read from the Life line, it is read from the other lines and Mounts. If the Life line end suddenly and a dot is seen on Jupiter (260), apoplexy will be the trouble ; if a dot is seen on Saturn, paralysis, and if in this case a star, cross, or dot is seen on the Head line under Saturn, the reading is absolute (261). 

All of the other Mounts must be handled in the same way when searching for a sudden termination to life. With each Mount disease the one which would kill quickly is the probable one, and a chronic trouble will not be the cause. When a deep Life line ends abruptly there is always a chance that it may continue. Even though the line be short, it is not as serious as if it ended in a cross, star, tassel. 

Life lines which are deep and strong but short, and sometimes even short thin ones, often cut their way through the hand, forming new channels; for a strong will and determination to live, often prolong the life of many persons with such markings. When the line ends clear, without a defect or tassel, it shows that there is no great impediment at the time, and that care and determination can keep the life going. 

If a line which begins deep and strong begins to taper as it cuts through the hand, gradually growing thinner as the line advances until it fades away and disappears in the capillary lines (262), it shows that the vitality grows less powerful as age comes on until it almost disappears, leaving the subject weak, nerveless, and feeble. 

These subjects will not die from sudden diseases, but death will come from exhaustion. They are liable to develop some chronic ailment as the line decreases, and any defect of their type will be almost certain to develop. 

By making a thorough examination, you can discover the difficulty. This fading Life line does not stand so good a chance to continue the life past the age indicated by its length. 

If it be a short line, the subject will begin to decline early and will not live past the end of the line, as he has not enough vitality to create great determination to live. 

A good Head line is a fine possession with such a disappearing line.
