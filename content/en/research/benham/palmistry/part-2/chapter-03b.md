## Island 

This is not a single sign. It is a split that returns to the original line of the lower end of the part which has broken away. 

![Island](/graphics/palm/03.png)

Chance lines which merely cross each other to form an island (see 3B) is not a true island. 

<!-- The fact that the ends of these chance lines overlap each other, constituting defects for each other, may spoil the operation of both the chance lines, but it does not form a true island.  -->

If it is formed by two chance lines crossing each other, or by a chance line crossing a Main or Minor line at both ends, read the chance lines separately and not as an island. 

The only reason why palmists have been at all successful in handling the island according to the present acceptation of what constitutes an island, is that the effect of chance lines crossing each other is similar to some of the bad effects of the island, and it has not been because the island itself has been thoroughly understood. 


A true island is only produced by a splitting of the Main line, and a return of the split to the Main line.

Islands can be as small as mere dots, seen only under the glass. Some can be big.


The island is always a defect, always a disturber, a warning to look out for something, and must never be disregarded. The operation of an island is to divide the Current flowing along a line.

One half of the Current passes around one side of the island, the other half going around the other side. These divided currents reunite on the lower side of the island and resume their course. 

The word "island" is taken from its geographical namesake, and the true island in the hand is literally what its name implies, an isolated surface of skin surrounded by the divided line.

Thus the island is an impeding object in no. 3 the course of a line, which divides the strength of the Current, producing a consequent division of strength and force. The size and length of the island shows the extent of obstruction and its duration, and from the point at which it is seen on a line you can read the age at which this weakening of the force occurs. It is not the intention here to do more than to impress upon you the general meaning of the island. 

Its specific application will be made to each line as we study it. 

When an island is seen remember the divided stream, the impeding, obstructing island, and the consequent weakness and impairment of the line during its presence, and you will always think of a menace to the subject from some direction.

## Breaks

These are frequently encountered. They always indicate a defective condition. 

![Break](/graphics/palm/04.png)

The Current is interrupted and stopped in exactly the same manner as when a telegraph wire is cut. The kind of a break will make a great difference in the outcome of the defect. 

<!-- It is only by the Electric Current theory that you will be able to judge correctly and quickly what the seriousness of any break in the line is. The theory is this = -->

When the Current reaches the break it is checked and some repair process is needed at once, else the Current will flow out of all regular channels. This is like the overflow of a river spreading destruction not properly confined within its banks.

<!-- , that of spreading destruction.  -->

If the break in a line is small, and the line continues clearly after the break and in a direct course, the Current may skip over the small break and continue in its regular path.

In this case the danger is serious, but not insurmountable. 

In such an instance the two ends of the line will probably grow together eventually. The wider the break, the more serious it becomes and the less likelihood there is of the Current's passing over the space between the broken ends. 

Everything tending to make it easier to hold the Current in its proper course, or enabling it to get back to it after a break occurs, lessens the serious results of the broken line, and everything that makes it harder for the Current to continue its course without interruption adds to the complication. 

Thus broken lines may be repaired when the broken ends overlap each other, or by a small cross-line uniting the ends of the two lines, by sister lines running alongside of the line and break, or by squares (5).

All of these help transmit the Current from the broken end of the line to its regular channel, and while during this break and its repair there is a decided check to the best operation of the line, still it is possible of repair, and not so serious as if unaccompanied by any sign of repair. 

Always a danger, breaks must be regarded seriously. 

<!-- From their size, or the repair signs present, you can accurately estimate their outcome.  -->

One of the worst forms is when the end of the line turns back after a break and starts to run towards its source (6), forming a hook. 

![Break](/graphics/palm/06.png)

<!-- This probably led the old palmists to use this indication found in the Life line as denoting a fatal termination, and you have read perhaps that the "Life line broken and turning toward the thumb means death." -->

In this case the Current turns back on itself. It finds it harder to continue its course with such a break than in any other formation. 

It overflows where there is no channel to carry it forward.

If there is no means by which this Current can be carried back to its original course, it produces disaster.

There are various methods of repair, some:
- by lines joining the turned-back end of the Main line
- by sister lines, squares, or various lines which will attract the Current and take it back to its regular channel.

These methods of repair are shown in Fig. 6. 

Every turned-back line is a most serious check to the subject, either as to life, health, or career; the line on which it is found will tell in which direction this check leads. 

If unrepaired it is well-nigh fatal, even worse than when the line ends abruptly, for in the latter case the Current may be forced through new paths, and may dig itself a new channel; 

But when it is deliberately turned back to its source there is little hope that it will ever go on in its original direction. Of all repair signs the best and most certain is the square, shown in Fig. 7
