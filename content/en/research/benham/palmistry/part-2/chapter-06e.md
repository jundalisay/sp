In very many hands, the Head line slopes towards the Mount of the Moon (122).
- This shows that the subject is influenced by imagination and is not practical to the exclusion of everything else.

There is a great misconception prevalent on this sloping Head line, which has been used as indicating danger of insanity. Nothing can be farther from the truth, for such a Head line is found on the hands of most sensible, self-contained, practical persons. 

The ability to imagine is not a sign of insanity or impracticality if the line of Head be good, deep, well cut, and clear.

<!-- , little concern need be felt because it inclines toward the Mount of Moon. With this indication, as with all others, excess may make it bad.'  -->

<!-- Other combinations with the line, or the character of the line itself, may spoil it, but the general proposition is,  -->

A Head line running toward the Moon shows that the subject is not entirely material in his ideas, but has the power of imagination.

This is an essential qualification for writers, speakers, and linguists.
- In the most successful men of these professions I find a droop to the Head line, some going far down into the Mount.
- These persons were writers of fiction and poetry (123).

A line to reach the Moon must be a long one, so there is in these cases no lack of mentality.


<!-- It is only when the drooping line is seen on a poor type of subject or when it is thin or defective that it is unfavorable.  -->

An excess of imagination is one species of insanity; the drooping Head line with other unfavorable signs will clearly indicate mental derangement. 

If the line droops low on the Mount and ends in a star (124), it will indicate insanity.

- Drooping to the Moon and ending in a chain (125), it will tell of mental impairment.
- If it droops to the Moon and ends in a cross (126), it will indicate a check to the mentality. 
- If it droops and ends in an island (127) or a dot (128), there is danger of mental disturbance. In these cases the size of the island or dot will tell how serious.

If on the Mount of Moon the line is broken (129) and intermittent, it is another indication of mental disturbance.

These markings of the line are more dangerous because the line droops to the Moon, the imaginative tendencies of the Mount making it a fertile place for such trouble. In every case the curve toward the Moon must be carefully considered.

- If it begins to droop from the start of the line (130), the tendency of the ideas have always been in that direction. 
- If the line runs straight during the first part of its course and then slopes downward (131), the practical plane at the beginning is changed to a tendency toward imaginative ideas later in life, the date to be read from the point where the droop begins. Such violent changes or markings are not the best ones with this line. It is when the line forms a graceful curve, and gradually tends downward that no bad results follow.
- Sometimes the line forks at the end (132). This will indicate versatility, a union of practical and imaginative ideas which make the subject see things from a double point of view. I have seen this marking on the hands of successful theatrical people, and those who successfully appeal to the public in other ways. If the fork be slight, it must be read simply as versatility.

If it be more marked, as in No. 133, it shows that the subject has a strong practical set of ideas and a strong set of imaginative ones. 

He can see things from both the practical and fanciful sides, and with this double point of view, he is less inclined to be narrow and one-sided.

By noting which of the two forks is deeper and stronger, you can tell which side (practical or imaginative) will obtain the mastery. 

This is a fine marking on a good hand. The double line, however, with its double point of view, often leads a subject into the habit of falsifying. 

He is not always an intentional liar; often he is not sure whether he is telling the literal story or the imaginative one.

His imagination is vivid, and he sometimes makes himself think he is telling the truth when he is not. Prom the forking Head line is produced the liar, and when seen on an otherwise bad hand, it will make you sure of this interpretation. 

**In habitual liars, I have found the forking Head line always present.** 

Sometimes they lie from pride or vanity, for mercenary or vicious ends, and in each case the forking Head line will be seen. 

This applies to habitual falsifiers, not mere occasional "story tellers." 

If the line has a fork with one line running to upper Mars and one going low on to the Moon, with this fork again forking (134), it will show that the double-pointed imagination, shown by the forked fork on the Moon, will be so vivid that the subject will "stretch" everything and will lie when the truth is better.

He possesses such an enlarged imagination that he magnifies everything to double the original size, and all descriptions show this distortion. 

If the fork on the Moon ends in a star, a cross, or a dot (135), it will be practically certain that the enlarged imagination will produce insanity from:

1. Over-imagination
2. Mental disease shown by the star, cross, or dot.

In the two cases above mentioned, if the Mount of Moon be grilled and much rayed. It will add to the force of the indication all of the restlessness of the Lunarian. It will emphasize every bad indication found on a much drooped and forked line of Head. 

By keeping constantly in mind what constitutes a clear line of Head and what makes it defective, you can distinguish between a good, healthy imagination and mental disorder, and you will never tell a fine writer that he is going crazy.

Sometimes a line of Head divides into 3 well-cut forks, one going toward Mercury, one toward Mars, and one toward the Moon (136). This is a splendid marking, showing great diversity of intellect, adaptability, and versatility. In this case the three terminations unite business (Mercury), resistance (upper Mars), and imagination (the Moon).

This combination generally produces a successful career, and unless laziness, lack of ambition, or some other defect is very strongly marked, a subject with this triple-forked termination will achieve much. 

In rare cases the Head line curves around and ends on the Mount of Venus (137). This will indicate that Venusian ideas of attraction are uppermost in the mind of the subject.

This line is long, so there is plenty of mentality, and if it be deep and clear it is not per se an indication of defective mental health, but it shows the drawing, attracting power of Venus.
