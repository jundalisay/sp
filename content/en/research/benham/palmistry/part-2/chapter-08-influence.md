The Lines of Influence are those that are on the Mount of Venus and inside the Life line. 
- Some of these run parallel to the Life line
- Others run across the Mount (277). 


These tell about factors outside of the subject himself, forming a part of his "environment." 

<!-- Only those indications which my own experience as well as that of other careful investigators has fully verified are here considered, and all matters which are traditional or hypothetical have been left out. -->

I depend mostly on the elaborate system  of the Hindus for using these lines of Influence.

**Only the lines which run inside the Life line are properly lines of Influence.** 

They indicate persons who have strongly influenced the life either for good or ill.

They generally represent members of one's own family or the closest of friends. 

If the latter class, and blood relationship is not present, they are those who have grown into the life and have become a part of it.

- The more there are of these lines, the greater the number of persons who have exerted strong influence. 
- The less the number the more self-contained is the subject
  - He makes few close friendships, and even blood relations do not greatly influence him.


These influences have made strong impressions on the mind of the subject which then show themselves in the hand. 

The Lines of Influence, both vertical and horizontal, form the Grille on the Mount of Venus.

This generally indicates an increase of Venusian qualities, particularly the sexual appetites. 

Many Influence lines on the Mount of Venus shows subjects to have strong sexual appetites. 

Every line of the Grille represents an influence which has affected the life.
- The more of these there are, the more the Mount will have Currents which excite it, and consequently fire its qualities. 

The absence of lines on the Mount of Venus shows an absence of electrifying Currents.
- This calm Mount expends its energy in a love of beauty, gayety, color, art, and dress, instead of in sexual desires.

The line of Mars is a sister to the line of Life, running inside of that line and parallel to it (278). 

This is really an Influence line, but it is an influence upon the health of the subject, sustaining and strengthening it, and does not relate to the influence of other persons. 

The line of Mars is comparatively a rare marking, and the greater number of lines seen alongside the Life line are simply Influence lines. 

The Influence line which runs closest to the line of Life is the closest influence. This may be mother, father, a brother or a sister. 

A line starting near the beginning of the Life line and running close to it is generally the mother (279), as a mother's influence begins earlier in life than that of any one else. 

Next to this line, counting from the Life line, comes a line representing the father.
- The line which represents this parent is usually deeper than the others.

Next follow other relatives, grandparents being generally the fourth line. 


## Length 

The length of these lines tell the duration of the influences as factors in the life of a subject. 

In most hands a new Influence line is seen to appear at some age between 20-30 (280). 

This is generally the husband or wife, as it is at about this age that most marriages occur. 

This line becomes the dominating influence of the subject from the time of its appearance if the marriage is happy, but it only shows faintly if the marriage has made no more than a passing impression on the subject.

In many cases there is a fine line connecting this Influence line with the Life line, showing that the influence has merged into the life of the subject. On the Mount of Venus, then, are congregated the close influences of a subject's life.
