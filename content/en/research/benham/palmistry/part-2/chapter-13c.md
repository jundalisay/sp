Often, the Girdle is composed of broken fragments (525).

This will increase:
- the nervousness
- the danger of hysteria
- the retiring disposition. 

If such subjects fall into bad practices, the habits are very hard to overcome. 

Often, the Girdle of Venus is composed of double or triple lines (526). These make its properties, whether of health or temperament, doubly strong. 

If the Girdle is composed of many broken lines (527) and the rest of the hand be a nervous one, the danger from hysteria is great and all nervous symptoms will be intensified. 

If these go with indications of female trouble (528) the subject will be a great sufferer.
- Nervous depression, ill-health, and constant discontent and unhappiness will surround her.

These subjects should be taken to a specialist, who may relieve them, but often the real trouble is not known. With such a marking you will frequently find very defective Life and Head lines.


If the Head line in this case has islands, dots, crosses, or a star on it, there will be grave danger of insanity (529). 

The ultra-nervous condition shown by a bad Girdle of Venus will have its effect on every phase of life.

Defects in the Saturn or Apollo lines may be accounted for by a bad Girdle of Venus. 

They may come from either lasciviousness or ill-health. This can be verified by examining the Main lines.

With the Girdle of Venus, a factor which may be so potent in its operation, there will be many combinations in which it will play an important part. 

If the Head line slopes low into the Mount of Moon and has a star near its end or a dot, cross, or island be seen, with a broken Girdle of Venus, and many lines in the hand (530), the subject is in grave danger of insanity, as a result of intense nervousness and excessive imagination. This subject will be erratic, cranky, and hard to get along with. 


If a cross be seen on the Mount of Saturn, a broken Girdle of Venus, dots or islands in the Head line under Saturn, a grille on the Mount of the Moon, with brittle or fluted nails, the subject will be in grave danger from paralysis (531).

If the hand be thick at the base, fingers thick, color red, lines deep and red, with a deep Girdle of Venus, and the lines of Life and Head short and ending in defects, the subject will be likely to die very suddenly at the age at which the Life line ends, as a result of dissipation and excess (532). 

If the hand is sensual with a Girdle of Venus which cuts a troubled Saturn line deeply, and a dot be seen on the Mount of Apollo, or on the Apollo line near the termination, the excesses of the subject will ruin his career and end in the entire loss of his reputation (533).

<!-- It will be noted in the foregoing illustrations that the Chirognomic type of the hand is taken into account, and that  -->

- A broken Girdle of Venus indicates the nervous condition
- A deep Girdle indicates its excess

If a deep Girdle of Venus cuts a line of Affection, the Heart line has drooping lines from it, the Head line becomes defective toward the end and terminates in a star, and the Saturn line is cut by a bar which stops it, the excesses of the subject will ruin his married life and cause great sorrow, finally ending in an impairment of the mental faculties, insanity, and the ruining of his career (534). 



<!-- You will see the Girdle of Venus in all kinds of hands. 

Some of the best men and women have had it. 
- Their careers have never suffered. -->

It has been argued that the added warmth imparted by the Girdle of Venus gives a greater richness to the character that can hold it within bounds.
- From this standpoint it would be considered as an absolute blessing. 
- But its presence may produce unpleasant results.


The Girdle has a positive or negative meaning when you fit the line to the type of hand which has it. Do not try to fit lasciviousness to every person on whom the Girdle is seen. 

A poor, trembling, nervous, cold-handed person with the Girdle should not be told that he indulges in great excesses.
- An extra cup of coffee or tea might mean a great dissipation to him. 
- Yet nost Girdles are found on such palms.
 <!-- it is on such subjects that you will find a large percentage of Girdles.  -->

<!-- Good judgment and a clean way of looking at things must be displayed in handling the Girdle of Venus, which, used with discrimination, will produce only good results for the practitioner. 

There are those who seek unpleasant sides to every character, and for such  -->

The Girdle has peculiar charms, but in momst cases, it inspirtes pity and tenderness.
