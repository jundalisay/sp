The Mount of Moon is the seat of imagination.
- It is the attracting power which causes the Head line to start downward. 

<!-- I have observed in the hands of many spiritists and of persons strongly  that the period at which these matters began to greatly interest them could be determined by  -->

A downward deflection of the Head line can reveal when a person will be impressed with psychic phenomena and spiritism. 
- If the deflection is short, the subject is for a time pulled in that direction
- But the line coming back to the straight course again shows that the ideas have been drawn back into the practical line again. 
- If the deflection covers the whole line (105), there has been conflict between practical ideas and a desire to indulge in imaginative things, but as the line at the end gets back to the straight position, the inference is that practical ideas have conquered.

When the line is deflected downward under a Mount (as in 104) the qualities of that Mount have impelled the subject to such thoughts as are indicated by the downward deflection. 

The 3 worlds will tell which side of the type qualities, mental, money-making, or baser, have caused the mental change.

<!-- The Line Of Head Part 5 261 No. 104. The Line Of Head Part 5 262 No. 106. The Line Of Head Part 5 263 No. 106. The Line Of Head Part 5 264 No. 107. -->

With all deflections, note the character of the line before, during, and after a deflection. This will show the outcome. 

If a line is found deep and well cut before, thin during, and chained after (106), it will show that a vigorous mind (before) became less vigorous (during) and was impaired (after), the ages to be read from the line. 

If the line is thin at the start, chained during deflection, and ends in a star (107), the subject has a weak mind to start with, which was impaired by whatever caused the deflection, and ends in an explosion, as shown by the star. 

This will show either insanity or death. Look to Life line, nails, color, type, etc., to determine which. 

These illustrations are only 2 out of the infinite number of combinations which may be found, and are given simply in order to show the method of reasoning. 

The source of the line shows the starting of the mental activity, the course through the hand indicates the changes which have affected it, and the termination shows the ultimate outcome. 

If the line is short, either the mentality is not great, or the termination of it comes early in life, by death or loss of mind. 

This matter has been treated under the head of "Length of the Line". 

When the line is very short and turns upward toward Saturn (108) the mental attitude of the subject will be Saturnian, and a health defect of Saturn will cause early death. As we are considering the Head line, this health defect must apply to something affecting the head, which is manifestly the brain. 

Paralysis is a prominent defect of the Saturnian will be the cause to which you may ascribe the end. Nails fluted, turning back, or brittle, yellow color, and many chance lines in the hand, a thin Life line, chained, islanded, broken, or otherwise defective, will enable you to confirm the indication. 

Older palmists gave to this line the reading " sudden death," the reason for this must be apparent. 

If this line runs up on to the Mount of Saturn (109), the indication is doubly sure. If it ends in a star, a cross, or a dot (110), the sudden termination of the mentality and the life is assured. 

If the line ends in a tassel (111), paralysis followed by paresis is indicated, as the tassel shows the gradual dissipation and diffusion of the mental powers and not the sudden shock and catastrophe which the cross, the dot, or the star portend.

The older palmists ascribed grave results to all indications in which Saturn was concerned. This was because of the serious disorders peculiar to the Saturnian.

When the line of Head turns up toward Apollo (112) it shows that the subject is strong in Apollonian ideas. The world which rules in each case will determine to which side of the type the ideas lean. In all of these cases where the Head line turns up toward a Mount it is an indication that the mental stamina is not especially strong. 

If it were, the subject might belong to a type, might be strong in his love of all things peculiar to the type, and yet would not lose self-control, or allow the typical Mount qualities to entirely dominate him, as must be the case when the line of Head is pulled out of its course and toward a Mount.

When the line is drawn upward, but is not long enough to reach the Mount, heart or sentiment are stronger than head, and the subject has allowed a mere love of the things peculiar to some particular type to dominate him instead of reason. In other words, his head has been overcome by his feelings. 

When the Head line rises and is merged in the Heart line (113) it shows that the subject allows his feelings to overcome his judgment. This has been used by some palmists as indicating criminality. 


It is not per se an indication of such tendencies. It does show that when the emotions, the sentiments, the feelings, the desires, or whatever it may be are aroused, that the subject will lose self-control and often commit crime in response to the appeal of his passions. He is not necessarily criminal, though he may be weak. 

If the hand is brutal, Mount of Venus large, full, and red, with Heart line deep and red, nails short, Mounts of Mars large, you will have one, who to satisfy his desires would become criminal and even commit murder. 

His head will not be strong enough to control the passions which rage within him. If the line cut clear up into Apollo (114), the cutting of the Heart line under Apollo by the Head line, will indicate a complication of the heart difficulty of the Apollonian, and some disorder in the mental health, most probably apoplexy. Note the Mount of Jupiter, color of hands, lines, nails, and all other-indications which may throw light on the subject.

If at the point where the 2 lines cross they are deep cut and red, the danger will be serious. If at this point there is a star (115) the danger is very grave, for the explosion is most likely. 

If this marking is followed by an island (116), the shock will permanently weaken the mind, and at the least brain fever is indicated. 


If the line of Head turns toward Mercury (117), it will show how strongly the Mercurian qualities attract the subject. No matter what side of the Mercurian is developed, there will be a love of and talent for money-making. 

![Head Line](/graphics/palm/117.png)

So strong is this desire for money that the subject will ruin his health or make any sacrifice to obtain it.

As employers these people are tyrannical and exacting, they desire to make "every edge cut" and will work employees just as long as they can, and give them the least possible material with which to do the work. They love bargains, and will go miles to save a few pennies. 

Everything is measured by its money value. 

When this line is seen, note carefully the type of the subject. If he be a bad or mean Saturnian, the combination of this type with the Head line rising to Mercury is distressing. If he be a crooked Mercurian you know that honestly or dishonestly, as may be necessary, he will have money. 

The crooked and twisted finger, with short nails should cause you to make your estimate strong, and if no Heart line is seen you know that the subject will stop at nothing. If you find this line on a good hand read it merely as the love of money. If with it the Medical Stigmata is present (118), which indicates the especial aptitude for medicine, you will have the money-making physician, if with this line the third phalanx of the finger is longest the money-making business man.

No matter what the combination, the money side is strong. If the line goes clear up into the Mount (119), it will be in addition a health warning. The bilious tendency, the stomach disorder, and the nervousness, always present, will affect the head and produce vertigo, though serious results are not often encountered from the indication per se. The time period of the line when it has reached this point is about seventy and at that time the end is naturally not far distant.

- If the line should end in a star (120), sudden death is indicated. 
- When the line runs into the upper Mount of Mars (121) it shows that practical common-sense ideas prevail. 
  - It is the medium position and the mental qualities are not pulled out of their balance. 

If upper Mars be well developed, it will give its qualities to the subject, who will defend himself when attacked, will be cool, calm, brave, and warlike in spirit. 

If the Mount be deficient, the mentality will partake of these deficiencies in Martian qualities and the subject will be easily discouraged, unable to resist strong attacks, and lacking in confidence.

Whatever would be attributed to the Mount, attribute to the line. But whatever these attributes may be, the line ending here always gives practical ideas about everything.
