Many Saturn lines will be seen which have little fine lines rising from them, or falling in a downward direction (373). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/373.jpg)

Rising lines will indicate the upward tendency of the life. These add strength to the line. 

<!-- During whatever portion of the line these branches appear, that part of the line will be filled with hope and ambition and will be more successful than any other period.  -->

Downward branches show life will be harder, more filled with discouragements, and progress will be difficult.

These upward and downward branches follow the health of the subject closely. 
- When upward branches are seen, the physical powers will be found good. 

With downward branches on the Saturn line and an island in the Life line, the unfavorable condition of the Saturn line is to be accounted for by delicacy of health (374). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/374.png)

If downward branches be seen, with an island in the Head line or Heart line at the same age, the difficulty will be brain or heart disease, according to which line shows the marking (375). 

If rheumatic indications be seen on Saturn and Middle Mount of Moon and downward branches are on the Saturn line, the difficulty will be rheumatism, or maybe gout (376). The Life line will generally be defective during the same period. 

In every case the difficulty during the period indicated by these downward branches can be accounted for by defects seen in some other part of the hand. 

The downward branches are the warning. You should find the cause. 

Upward branches on the Saturn line are favorable.

There is one marking of the upward branches, however, which is useful. 


If Worry lines from Mount of Venus cut the Life line and in turn cut these upward branches from the Saturn line, the upward course of the subject will be constantly interfered with (377). They will materially hamper and annoy him.

In many hands, the followingg cross and join to the line of Saturn (378):
- worry lines from the Mount of Venus
- lines from the Mount of Moon
- chance lines from all parts of the hand

This is particularly the case with nervous person, who has much lined and rayed hands. 


Each one of these events, persons, illnesses, or whatever may be the interpretation of the several lines, will in some way affect the career of the subject. Some of these will be a positive detriment, others will strengthen and aid in the advancement of the subject. 


As a general proposition, all lines which cut the Saturn line weaken it, and impede the progress of the subject at the age indicated by the cut (379).

All lines which merge into or run alongside the line strengthen it.

These lines will rise from all parts of the hand, and will represent different factors which are a detriment and a check to the subject's progress, or which aid him. 


In all cases, the place from which these lines start will give you the clue to the influence. If a chance line from a star on Mount of Jupiter cuts the Saturn line, the subject will suffer a severe check from too much ambition. 

His endeavor to know distinguished people will lead him to do foolish things which injure his prospects (380).

If this chance line runs to an island in the Saturn line, his ambition to move in the front rank will cause him to be extravagant, and financial difficulties will result (381).

If with a bad Mercurian hand, grilled Mount, twisted finger, and large third phalanx of Mercury, a chance line from the Mount of Mercury cut the Saturn line, the dishonesty of the subject will bring him to grief (382). 

In these cases the type of your subject will aid you greatly, and the end of the Saturn line will give you the outcome of the cutting. 

If a line of Saturn be cut by a line running from an Influence line on Mount of Venus, and the Saturn line be broken for the rest of its course, an influence will cause a serious disaster (383). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/383.png)

If the Influence line is the spouse, and if from it a chance line run to Mount of Jupiter, the ambitions of the spouse have led the subject to extravagances which he could not afford.

If the Saturn line be defective for the balance of its course, he will never recover from the reverses (384). 

If the Saturn line be cut by Worry lines from the Life line which is defective, ill health will be a bar to the prospects of the subject, and if the Saturn line be defective after the cut, the subject will never be able to get over it (385). 

The combinations of these cutting chance lines are infinite ; in some hands several will be seen, each one of which indicates a check from a different source. In these cases every cutting line is an object of special inquiry. 

<!-- The Line Of Saturn Part 5 531 No. 380. The Line Of Saturn Part 5 532 No. 381. The Line Of Saturn Part 5 533 No. 382. The Line Of Saturn Part 5 534 No. 383. The Line Of Saturn Part 5 535 No. 384. The Line Of Saturn Part 5 536 No. 385. --> 

Many chance lines run toward the Saturn line but do not touch it (386). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/386.png)

These lines are events or influences, according to their source, but are abortive attempts to influence the career, and, while they exist as possible menaces, for the lines may grow until they cut the Saturn line, they are not immediate dangers. Some chance lines merge into the Saturn line (387).


These lines represent events or influences which have come into and become a part of the life of the subject, but as they do not cut the line the career is not checked. 

If the Saturn line be thin or defective in any no. 386. way, and these influencing lines are deep and strong, they will add to the prosperity of the subject and assist to overcome his difficulties. 

If, in the beginning, a Saturn line be chained or otherwise defective, and a chance line merges into it, after which it becomes deep, the influence which has come into the life has improved the subject's condition.

If this chance line comes from the Mount of Moon it will be some outside influence (388), if it comes from Mount of Venus it will be the influence of close relatives (389).

At whatever point these chance lines merge into the Saturn line, the good effect of the influence will be exerted at the age indicated, and the subsequent condition of the Saturn line will show how much strength the influence has given. 

If a Saturn line, defec tive at the start, has a chance line merging into it, and if the Saturn line becomes only thin afterwards, or not guile so defective, the influence has not been very beneficial. 

If the Saturn line becomes deep, the benefit has been great. Other chance lines which do not touch the Saturn line, but run alongside of it (390), are lines exerting a strong influence on the subject's career, for by helping and supporting they act as sister lines. 

By the place from which these lines start you can judge what they are, and by the effect they have on the Saturn line you can tell how much good they do. 

If a Saturn line is broken, and a chance line from the Head line run alongside of it, the subject's good judgment will come to his relief and will carry him over his difficulty (391).
