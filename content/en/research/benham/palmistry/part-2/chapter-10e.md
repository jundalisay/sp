Many Saturn lines will be seen which have little fine lines rising from them, or falling in a downward direction (373). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/373.jpg)

Rising lines will indicate the upward tendency of the life. These add strength to the line. 

<!-- During whatever portion of the line these branches appear, that part of the line will be filled with hope and ambition and will be more successful than any other period.  -->

Downward branches show life will be harder, more filled with discouragements, and progress will be difficult.

These upward and downward branches follow the health of the subject closely. 
- When upward branches are seen, the physical powers will be found good. 

With downward branches on the Saturn line and an island in the Life line, the unfavorable condition of the Saturn line is to be accounted for by delicacy of health (374). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/374.png)

If downward branches be seen, with an island in the Head line or Heart line at the same age, the difficulty will be brain or heart disease, according to which line shows the marking (375). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/375.png)

If rheumatic indications be seen on Saturn and Middle Mount of Moon and downward branches are on the Saturn line, the difficulty will be rheumatism, or maybe gout (376). The Life line will generally be defective during the same period. 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/376.png)

In every case the difficulty during the period indicated by these downward branches can be accounted for by defects seen in some other part of the hand. 

The downward branches are the warning to look for trouble, and the task of the palmist must be to find out what will cause it. Upward branches on the Saturn line, being favorable, do not need this care, for during favorable times people get along well enough; it is the periods of trouble that need to be guarded against. 

There is one marking of the upward branches, however, which is useful. With upward branches from the Saturn line, if Worry lines from Mount of Venus cut the Life line and in turn cut these upward branches, the course of the subject, which is upward, will be constantly interfered with (377). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/377.png)


While these interferences may not be able to destroy the effect of his favorable period, they will materially hamper and annoy him. In many hands Worry lines from the Mount of Venus, lines from the Mount of Moon, and chance lines from all parts of the hand will be found crossing and joining themselves to the line of Saturn (378). This is particularly the case with nervous persona, who have much lined and rayed hands. 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/378.png)


Each one of these events, persons, illnesses, or whatever may be the interpretation of the several lines, will in some way affect the career of the subject. Some of these will be a positive detriment, others will strengthen and aid in the advancement of the subject.

As a general proposition, all lines which cut the Saturn line weaken it, and impede the progress of the subject at the age indicated by the cut (379).

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/379.png)

And all lines which merge into or run alongside the line strengthen it. These lines will rise from all parts of the hand, and will represent different factors which are a detriment and a check to the subject's progress, or which aid him. In all cases, the place from which these lines start will give you the clew to the influence. If a chance line from a star on Mount of Jupiter cuts the Saturn line, the subject will suffer a severe check from too much ambition. 

His endeavor to know distinguished people will lead him to do foolish things which injure his prospects (380). If this chance line runs to an island in the Saturn line, his ambition to move in the front rank will cause him to be extravagant, and financial difficulties will result (381). 

If with a bad Mercurian hand, grilled Mount, twisted finger, and large third phalanx of Mercury, a chance line from the Mount of Mercury cut the Saturn line, the dishonesty of the subject will bring him to grief (382). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/382.png)

In these cases the type of your subject will aid you greatly, and the end of the Saturn line will give you the outcome of the cutting. If a line of Saturn be cut by a line running from an Influence line on Mount of Venus, and the Saturn line be broken for the rest of its course, an influence will cause a serious disaster (383). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/383.png)

If you correctly judge the Influence line from which this cutting line starts to be the wife or husband, and if from it a chance line run to Mount of Jupiter, the ambitions of the wife or husband have led the subject to extravagances which he could not afford, and if the Saturn line be defective for the balance of its course, he will never recover from the reverses (384). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/384.png)

If the Saturn line be cut by Worry lines from the Life line which is defective, ill health will be a bar to the prospects of the subject, and if the Saturn line be defective after the cut, the subject will never be able to get over it (385). 

The combinations of these cutting chance lines are infinite ; in some hands several will be seen, each one of which indicates a check from a different source. In these cases every cutting line is an object of special inquiry.

Many chance lines run toward the Saturn line but do not touch it (386). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/386.png)

These lines are events or influences, according to their source, but are abortive attempts to influence the career, and, while they exist as possible menaces, for the lines may grow until they cut the Saturn line, they are not immediate dangers. Some chance lines merge into the Saturn line (387).

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/387.png)


These lines represent events or influences which have come into and become a part of the life of the subject, but as they do not cut the line the career is not checked. 

If the Saturn line be thin or defective in any no. 386. way, and these influencing lines are deep and strong, they will add to the prosperity of the subject and assist to overcome his difficulties. 

If, in the beginning, a Saturn line be chained or otherwise defective, and a chance line merges into it, after which it becomes deep, the influence which has come into the life has improved the subject's condition. If this chance line comes from the Mount of Moon it will be some outside influence (388), if it comes from Mount of Venus it will be the influence of close relatives (389). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/388.png)

At whatever point these chance lines merge into the Saturn line, the good effect of the influence will be exerted at the age indicated, and the subsequent condition of the Saturn line will show how much strength the influence has given. If a Saturn line, defec tive at the start, has a chance line merging into it, and if the Saturn line becomes only thin afterwards, or not guile so defective, the influence has not been very beneficial. 

If the Saturn line becomes deep, the benefit has been great. Other chance lines which do not touch the Saturn line, but run alongside of it (390), are lines exerting a strong influence on the subject's career, for by helping and supporting they act as sister lines. By the place from which these lines start you can judge what they are, and by the effect they have on the Saturn line you can tell how much good they do. 

If a Saturn line is broken, and a chance line from the Head line run alongside of it, the subject's good judgment will come to his relief and will carry him over his difficulty (391). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/391.png)


In all cases where defects in the line are seen, look first for their cause and then to the repair indications. If a defective Saturn line have a chance line from a smooth and good Upper Mars running by its side, the resistance of the Mount will not permit discouragements to overthrow the subject, and this determination will save him from trouble (392).
