To avoid possible confusion, it is best to limit the Apollo line to a line wholly under the Mount.

If it is as indicated in No. 431, read it as a chance line from the Life line to the Mount of Apollo, and not as the Apollo line. 

Use everything for what it really is, and do not get into the habit of calling all sorts of chance lines, Apollo lines. 

In like manner read a line rising from the Saturn line and ending on the Mount of Apollo as a branch of the Saturn line, adding greatly to the success of the career, rather than call it the Apollo line (432).

When the line of Apollo rises from the top of the Mount of Moon near the percussion (433), it indicates imagination and the power of language; to a line so rising we should, if the mental world be strongest, say that the subject will achieve success as an author. If the tips be conic and fingers smooth, he will love poetry. 

If his fingers are knotty or square, he will write history, epic poems, historical novels, or works of that nature. 

If the Mount of Mars be large, he will write of battles and heroes. If Venus be large, he will move the heart and bring tears to the eye, so near to nature and human sympathy will be his productions. 

If Saturn be high, he will write on chemistry, physics, or scientific subjects, and often on history.

This subject will also be a great writer of uncanny stories. Basing your estimate upon Chirognomy you can thus locate the special direction in which the line will bring success. 

If a line of Apollo rises from a good Upper Mount of Mars, the subject will, by the display of calmness, resignation, resistance, and the fact that he does not allow himself to become discouraged, achieve success and reputation; the world in which he will operate to be located Chirog-nomically (434). 

In its course through the hand the line of Apollo must run toward the Mount of Apollo, for it is the effect of the qualities of this type which give to the line its meaning and its name.

There is a constant danger of reading chance lines as the Apollo line, and to avoid doing this the rule must be fixed that while in its course through the hand the Apollo line may slightly deflect, may stop at any point, throw out branches, or be met, strengthened, or crossed by chance lines, the general direction of the line itself must be from the Mount of Moon to the Mount of Apollo. 

Any line which cannot possibly be thus specifically classed as the line of Apollo, must be read as another line. This will increase accuracy; for only thus can a line have its proper meaning, and the erroneous readings which are constantly given to supposed Apollo lines will be avoided.

Most mistakes with the line come from an enthusiasm due to the fact that the influence of an Apollo line is known to be so beneficial, that practitioners are tempted to overestimate the success of their clients. This is especially true because praise is what gives greatest satisfaction and is what clients are most anxious to hear. 

<!-- It is easier and more profitable for the palmist, for it is remarkable how  -->

Clients agree with the reader when told of brilliancy, wonderful perception, latent talents, etc.

Everyone will say he has always thought this was the case, but was never quite sure of it before. 

Palmists who have a pleasant story to tell, get the most clients, and this being known to professionals, leads to a system of flattery totally out of proportion to the subject. 

Most of this is referred to supposed lines of Apollo for corroboration. 

Our effort here is to reach the facts only, that we may deal with the line just as it deserves, and in order to do this we must limit ourselves to the consideration of the lines whose course between the Mounts of the Moon and Apollo mark them unmistakably as Apollo lines. 

<!-- The Line Of Apollo Part 3 586 No. 435. The character of the Apollo line indicates the intensity and power of the qualities it represents.  -->

The best line is that which is deep and well cut (435). 

This gives in the highest degree the beneficial qualities of the line, indicates success and reputation, and gives to a subject creative power in whatever world he operates. 

He is not one who is merely fond of color, painting, and art, but has the creative power which will enable him to produce work of merit. 

It distinguishes the real artist from the lover of, or dabbler in art, and when the first phalanges of the fingers, especially if that of Apollo, be longest, and a long deep Apollo line cuts the hand, your client is entitled to be told that in the artistic world he may achieve fame. 

With proper combinations this line is also seen in the hands of celebrated literary men and women. If the second phalanx of the finger be longest, with the first well developed, he will still be the artist, but will also have the ability to make money from his talents. 

This subject is successful in the business world, and even his money-making is done in an artistic way. In using the word "artist," do not understand that it means only a painter of pictures. 

It may mean a poet, an actor, a singer, or refer to any other of the artistic callings. 

On all sides of his character, the Apollonian loves beauty, and whatever is pleasing to the eye or sense. If the third phalanx be longest, especially if it be thick, and a deep line of Apollo is seen, the subject is not an artist, for he will like chromos better than the old masterpieces, will love high colors, flashy dressing, and will seek to display his taste on all occasions, much to the amusement of people of true artistic feelings, whose society he affects. Such subjects are always money-makers. 

These 3 illustrations show the method of applying a deep line to the three worlds of the finger, by giving an intense interpretation to the line, based upon the quality of the subject. 

A thin line of Apollo (436) will decrease the intensity of the reading. The subject will not have the great creative power of the deep line. 

If an artist, he will be more guided by the effects produced by other artists, and, whether the mental, business, or material worlds rule, he will achieve less celebrity and make less money. If a line be broad and shallow (437) it will show that little of the Apollonian power is left. 

The subject will like pretty things, will be fond of artists, will affect a little bohemianism, but will avoid attempting any productions himself. If the hand be coarse in its development, the taste will be for showy things, and little refinement will be indicated. 

If the band be refined, the subject will dress in taste, will have an eye for harmony in colorings, his home will be tastefully furnished, and he may do a little dabbling in writing or painting.

From this class come the army of literary and art copyists. 

A chained line of Apollo (438) will indicate an utter lack of artistic talent, although the subject may be impressed with his own knowledge on matters of art, most of which is incorrect. These subjects do not realize their shallowness and most of their effort is expended in talk. 

In dealing with these lines, apply each one to the subject according to the world in which he moves, and give its defective operation to the affairs of that world. Color in the line of Apollo is not an important consideration, for this line does not bear upon the health of the subject. To a pink colored line give a better estimate of strength than one which is white or yellow. 

This is as far as color will be considered as affecting the line of Apollo.
