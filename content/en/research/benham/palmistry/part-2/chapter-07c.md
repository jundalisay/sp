The thin Life line indicates a lack of robust, muscular vitality and great endurance. 

Those who have such a marking should never go beyond their strength. 

For a Jupiterian and a Martian, this thin line will reduce the tendencies to excess. 
- They will not have the strong impelling force of great vitality to urge them, consequently such subjects do not stand in danger from apoplexy and blood disorders resulting from dissipation, but they suffer from nervous disorders. 

The Apollonian will run on a lower schedule of speed, and the Venusian will not be impelled toward as great physical gratifications. 

As strong vitality urges and feeds the desire of all types, so the thin Life line, indicating lack of robustness, minimizes and reduces the operation of every type, and makes each milder. 

These subjects are often lazy, and thin Life lines must be noted even with elastic consistency, for sometimes a lack of energy is accounted for by a lack of physical vigor.

A broad and shallow line (182) shows an utter lack of vitality. 
- There is no power to resist disease, no robustness, no strong constitution, no physical vigor, no muscular power. 
- These subjects:
  - are an easy prey to all kinds of disorders. 
  - have no endurance, no stamina, no confidence in themselves. 
- Their system is in a flabby, weak condition, and furnishes a fertile soil in which bacteria germinate. 
- They have weak constitutions, and lack energy and push. 


This is because they are not physically strong, and must not be taken as an indication of inherent laziness. 

They are conscious of a labored effort whenever they undertake physical exertion, and from this kind of a Life line we get the chronic complainers and those who never feel well. 

These subjects are very dependent; they lean on friends and relatives, and soon fall into the way of being looked after. 

They do not often achieve great success, for they have not the strength to breast the tide of competition and the " hustle " of the age. They lack aggression and strength, and consequently must be taken care of or they go under. Such Life lines are an indication of great nervousness, and these subjects are carried purely by their nervous force. 

Often when necessity forces them to make strong efforts they will work when they feel that they can hardly put one foot in front of the other. Only positions where the work is purely routine, easy, and does not require much responsibility are suited to subjects with such Life lines. 

When they are forced into vocations requiring greater physical exertion and the shouldering of responsibilities they do not hold out a great while. Such a Life line on a flabby hand indicates the extreme of laziness. Even an elastic consistency cannot overcome the lack of vital strength and energy of a broad and shallow Life line. 

Spatulate tips will be only mentally active with this line; the skill these splendid tips give to a subject in all kinds of sports and games, or in the battle of life, will be only a shadow if accompanied by such a line, for all the type qualities will be lessened in their force and achievement. 

- The Jupiterian will have no strength for excess, the Martian will be too weak to fight. 
- Venusians will lack physical sexual power, no matter how much the thought of sexual relations may attract them. 

Children are seldom born to or from such subjects. There are many variations in this line; some are very broad and very shallow, and show that the Current has no deep channel through which to flow. Other lines will only approach such a condition. 

Estimate the intensity of any line by its degree of breadth and shallowness. 

Note both hands. If the Life line be good in the left hand and broad and shallow in the right, the weak constitution is growing on the subject. If the marking be reversed, the weak constitution is growing stronger. 

Note the proportion of the lines. If the Life line alone be broad and shallow, and the other lines are good, the constitution cannot carry its share of the life's effort. 
- Such a subject will be unsuccessful, sickly, despondent, and miserable. 

With this line, study the Mount of Saturn carefully. 
- If it be large or gives in any way a large share of Saturnian quality to the subject, he will be melancholy, gloomy, and wretched.

Such subjects commit suicide more frequently than any other. 

If the lower third of the Mount of Moon in a woman's hand shows female weakness the subject will be much more strongly impelled toward self-destruction. 

With such a line at once locate the type of your subject and hunt for health defects, either of his primary type or of the secondary or tertiary types, whose qualities will be supplementary; or health defects which may be shown on any other part of the hand. 

Chance lines will often point you to these defects. No subject with such markings should marry, for it will turn the home into a hospital. Sometimes people are found who are strong enough to make them willing to spend a life in nursing and humoring whims, but these cases are few. 

Parents are the safest reliance for such subjects. The Life line running like a ladder (183) has the same general effect as the broad and shallow line.

The health will be very unstable and intermittent with this line, and not only is the subject delicate, but he has repeated illnesses, all of more than ordinary severity.

When the Life line is composed of several fine lines close together (184), instead of a single deep line, it shows an intensely nervous state of health, great delicacy, and a liability to general debility. All of these lines reduce the vigor of every type, diminish their strength, and render them less likely to be pushing, active persons. 

Examine the Mounts to locate the health defects present, which will be exaggerated with these poor Life lines. The very thing that is causing your subject to be delicate, and which shows through the poor Life line, is some one of the health defects of the types. 

You need have no trouble in locating the source of the difficulty. A chained Life line (185) is one which shows great obstruction of the life Current, and the subject with this line will be delicate no. tea and suffer repeated annoying illnesses. If the chaining run through the entire course of the line, this poor condition of health will be always present, but if it cover only a part of the line, the delicacy will only extend over the part of the life covered by the chain. 

The chained line is an aggravated addition of delicacy to the broad and shallow line. Conceive the Life Current bumping over the many rocks and shoals in the channel of a badly chained Life line, and you can figure something of the miserable health such a line indicates. 


The character of the Life line as we have considered it above is a study of the line in general. The application of these general characteristics must be made in detail to the line from its source to termination. It is by such a method of procedure that we are able to locate from the line the periods of ill-health or delicacy and to read at what ages they occur. 

It is from the character of the line that we read constitutional tendencies to disease or debility, and it is to the signs and chance lines that we look for indications of acute attacks of fever or other diseases which come upon the subject suddenly and not as a result of constitutional deficiency. With nearly every Life line we find the first years chained, or poorly marked in some way (186).

This shows the period of life covered by infantile diseases. 
- If this beginning of the line is bad for a long distance, the child did not pass the danger point until late. 
- If this bad beginning runs only a short distance, the period of childish delicacy was soon over. 

After this period, if the line become deep and well cut, and continue so to its end, the subject will have a strong constitution which asserts itself as soon as the delicacy of infancy is passed, and continues as long as the subject lives. 

If, after the delicacy natural to the early years, the line be thin and continue so to the end, the subject has not a vigorous constitution to start with, and is never robust. 

If after the childish delicacy the line continue chained, broad, and shallow, or otherwise poorly marked, the subject will never be strong during life, but will always have a weak constitution. There are periods in almost every one's life when he is stronger than at others. 

Even a weak constitution will have times of revival. 

This will be shown by an uneven line in which the combinations of the character of the line may vary infinitely. 

We may find a line marked like 187. 

This line would be read:: great delicacy in childhood up to 12, at which time the health improved to a marked degree, though the subject was never robust.

At 30, a period of great delicacy developed, lasting 3 years, after which time the subject seemed entirely to recover health and become robust and vigorous.

This condition continues until 50, when the constitution becomes gradually weaker until the end of life.
