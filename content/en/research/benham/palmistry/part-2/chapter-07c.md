The thin Life line indicates a lack of robust, muscular vitality and great endurance. 

Those who have such a marking should never go beyond their strength. 

For a Jupiterian and a Martian, this thin line will reduce the tendencies to excess. 
- They will not have the strong impelling force of great vitality to urge them, consequently such subjects do not stand in danger from apoplexy and blood disorders resulting from dissipation, but they suffer from nervous disorders. 

The Apollonian will run on a lower schedule of speed, and the Venusian will not be impelled toward as great physical gratifications. 

As strong vitality urges and feeds the desire of all types, so the thin Life line, indicating lack of robustness, minimizes and reduces the operation of every type, and makes each milder. 

These subjects are often lazy, and thin Life lines must be noted even with elastic consistency, for sometimes a lack of energy is accounted for by a lack of physical vigor. 

A broad and shallow line (182) shows an utter lack of vitality. 
- There is no power to resist disease, no robustness, no strong constitution, no physical vigor, no muscular power. 
- These subjects:
  - are an easy prey to all kinds of disorders. 
  - have no endurance, no stamina, no confidence in themselves. 
- Their system is in a flabby, weak condition, and furnishes a fertile soil in which bacteria germinate. 
- They have weak constitutions, and lack energy and push. 

This is because they are not physically strong, and must not be taken as an indication of inherent laziness. 

They are conscious of a labored effort whenever they undertake physical exertion, and from this kind of a Life line we get the chronic complainers and those who never feel well. 

These subjects are very dependent; they lean on friends and relatives, and soon fall into the way of being looked after. 

They do not often achieve great success, for they have not the strength to breast the tide of competition and the " hustle " of the age. They lack aggression and strength, and consequently must be taken care of or they go under. Such Life lines are an indication of great nervousness, and these subjects are carried purely by their nervous force. 

Often when necessity forces them to make strong efforts they will work when they feel that they can hardly put one foot in front of the other. Only positions where the work is purely routine, easy, and does not require much responsibility are suited to subjects with such Life lines. 

When they are forced into vocations requiring greater physical exertion and the shouldering of responsibilities they do not hold out a great while. Such a Life line on a flabby hand indicates the extreme of laziness. Even an elastic consistency cannot overcome the lack of vital strength and energy of a broad and shallow Life line.

Spatulate tips will be only mentally active with this line; the skill these splendid tips give to a subject in all kinds of sports and games, or in the battle of life, will be only a shadow if accompanied by such a line, for all the type qualities will be lessened in their force and achievement. The Jupiterian will have no strength for excess, the Martian will be too weak to fight. 

Venusians will lack physical sexual power, no matter how much the thought of sexual relations may attract them. Children are seldom born to or from such subjects. There are many variations in this line; some are very broad and very shallow, and show that the Current has no deep channel through which to flow. Other lines will only approach such a condition. Estimate the intensity of any line by its degree of breadth and shallowness. 

Note both hands. If the Life line be good in the left hand and broad and shallow in the right, the weak constitution is growing on the subject. If the marking be reversed, the weak constitution is growing stronger. 

Note the proportion of the lines. If the Life line alone be broad and shallow, and the other lines are good, the constitution cannot carry its share of the life's effort. 
- Such a subject will be unsuccessful, sickly, despondent, and miserable. 

With this line, study the Mount of Saturn carefully. 
- If it be large or gives in any way a large share of Saturnian quality to the subject, he will be melancholy, gloomy, and wretched.

Such subjects commit suicide more frequently than any other. 

If the lower third of the Mount of Moon in a woman's hand shows female weakness the subject will be much more strongly impelled toward self-destruction. 

With such a line at once locate the type of your subject and hunt for health defects, either of his primary type or of the secondary or tertiary types, whose qualities will be supplementary; or health defects which may be shown on any other part of the hand. 

Chance lines will often point you to these defects. No subject with such markings should marry, for it will turn the home into a hospital. Sometimes people are found who are strong enough to make them willing to spend a life in nursing and humoring whims, but these cases are few. 

Parents are the safest reliance for such subjects. The Life line running like a ladder (183) has the same general effect as the broad and shallow line. The health will be very unstable and intermittent with this line, and not only is the subject delicate, but he has repeated illnesses, all of more than ordinary severity.

When the Life line is composed of several fine lines close together (184), instead of a single deep line, it shows an intensely nervous state of health, great delicacy, and a liability to general debility. All of these lines reduce the vigor of every type, diminish their strength, and render them less likely to be pushing, active persons. 

Examine the Mounts to locate the health defects present, which will be exaggerated with these poor Life lines. The very thing that is causing your subject to be delicate, and which shows through the poor Life line, is some one of the health defects of the types. 

You need have no trouble in locating the source of the difficulty. A chained Life line (185) is one which shows great obstruction of the life Current, and the subject with this line will be delicate no. tea and suffer repeated annoying illnesses. If the chaining run through the entire course of the line, this poor condition of health will be always present, but if it cover only a part of the line, the delicacy will only extend over the part of the life covered by the chain. 

The chained line is an aggravated addition of delicacy to the broad and shallow line. Conceive the Life Current bumping over the many rocks and shoals in the channel of a badly chained Life line, and you can figure something of the miserable health such a line indicates.

The character of the Life line as we have considered it above is a study of the line in general. The application of these general characteristics must be made in detail to the line from its source to termination. It is by such a method of procedure that we are able to locate from the line the periods of ill-health or delicacy and to read at what ages they occur. 

It is from the character of the line that we read constitutional tendencies to disease or debility, and it is to the signs and chance lines that we look for indications of acute attacks of fever or other diseases which come upon the subject suddenly and not as a result of constitutional deficiency. With nearly every Life line we find the first years chained, or poorly marked in some way (186). 

This shows the period of life covered by infantile diseases. If this beginning of the line is bad for a long distance, the child did not pass the danger point until late. If this bad beginning runs only a short distance, the period of childish delicacy was soon over. After this period, if the line become deep and well cut, and continue so to its end, the subject will have a strong constitution which asserts itself as soon as the delicacy of infancy is passed, and continues as long as the subject lives. If, after the delicacy natural to the early years, the line be thin and continue so to the end, the subject has not a vigorous constitution to start with, and is never robust. 

If after the childish delicacy the line continue chained, broad, and shallow, or otherwise poorly marked, the subject will never be strong during life, but will always have a weak constitution. There are periods in almost every one's life when he is stronger than at others. Even a weak constitution will have times of revival. 

This will be shown by an uneven line in which the combinations of the character of the line may vary infinitely. We may find a line marked like 187. This line would be read =  great delicacy in childhood up to twelve, at which time the health improved to a marked degree, though the subject was never robust; at thirty a period of great delicacy developed, lasting three years, after which time the subject seemed entirely to recover health and become robust and vigorous ; this condition continues until fifty, when the constitution becomes gradually weaker until the end of life.

The combinations possible to be seen in Life lines are so many that an indefinite number of illustrations could be given, and yet not a fraction of the possibilities be shown. By handling every variation of the line, however, according to the general rules governing the different characters of lines, and by following the method of reading as given in 187, you can correctly decipher every line. 

Back of all of these delicacies of constitution there are causes which produce them, and these causes are the health defects of the types, which in most cases are chronic ailments. Having discovered that your subject has a weak constitution, endeavor to discover what has made it weak. In this examination the type of the subject will aid, for it will tell to what he is predisposed. After you have located his type or combination of types, look at the primary Mount for grilles, cross-bars, crosses, or any marking which will enable you to locate a health defect of the type. 

If one be seen, go over the list and look at nails, color, Mercury line, and from some of these you will be able to locate which one of his type health defects has undermined the constitution. With this information you can tell him not only that he is constitutionally weak, but what is the cause. If you see no health defect of his primary Mount, look to the second, and tertiary, and all the other Mounts for health defects. 

It is written somewhere, if only looked for in the right place. Sometimes a chance line will point from the delicacy on the Life line to the cause producing it, and generally it will be found on one of the Mounts. The individual signs, or as we have called some of them, "defects," in the line will locate specific points when illnesses occurred or will occur. 

These defects are cross-bars cutting the line, islands, dots, breaks, and splits. All lines which cut across the Life line interrupt or cut the Current, and at the time the cutting occurs they produce a defective operation which in the case of the Life line is one of health. 

In some cases, especially with very nervous persons, the Life line is continually cut by little lines which are fine and do not cut the Life line in two (188). 

These lines show innumerable worries, the result of an intensely nervous condition, and the subject is prone to numerous small illnesses which have kept him in a continual state of depression or of ill-health. 

If these cross-bars be fine, the illnesses have not been serious but annoying, and there have been as many as there are bars cutting the Life line. If these bars be deep and cut the Life line, there have been severe illnesses.

If they be red the illness has been by fever. It is by the depth of these cross-lines that you must estimate their seriousness, and generally they will end somewhere on a Mount or line which will give you the clew to the nature of the trouble. The age at which these illnesses occur can be read from the Life line.

If a crossbar cut the Life line and end in a grille on Saturn (189), the illness will be a health defect of Saturn; which one you can determine from nails and color. If the cross-bar go to a dot, island, or a break in the Heart line under Apollo (190), the illness is heart disease; the outcome can be read from the Heart line or the termination of the Life line. Nails and color will aid to confirm the diagnosis. 

If the cross-bar run to a wavy line of Mercury (191). the illness is jaundice or severe bilious fever; age in all cases to be read from the point at which the cross-bar cuts the Life line. 

If the crossbar run to a grille on Upper Mars (192), with the Martian type strong, the trouble will be either blood disorder or throat and bronchial trouble. 

Nails will confirm the latter, or islands on the line of Mercury. If the cross-bar go to a grille or cross on the Upper Moon (193), bowel trouble or intestinal inflammation is the difficulty. 

If the cross-bar run to the middle of the Mount of Moon (194), especially if grilled, gout or rheumatism is the difficulty. This is completely confirmed if a line with an island runs to Saturn (195). This double indication is reliable even though no grille or cross is found on the Mount of Moon. 

If the cross-bar goes to a grille, cross-bar, or cross on Lower Moon (196), the trouble is with kidneys or bladder, or from female disease. White color and soft or flabby hands, transparent in appearance, will confirm the former; a star in the Mercury line, especially if at the point where it crosses the line of Head, will confirm the latter (197).

If the Life line is good with the above markings, the type defects are natural to the subject, as shown by the grille or other defects on the Mounts. 

However, the strong Life line shows a vigorous constitution and ability to resist and throw off disease, consequently the chronic trouble only manifests itself in a severe illness, not by a prolonged period of delicacy. 

If the Life line be thin, chained, or broad and shallow, these crossbars will be found more frequently, for the constitution is not robust and cannot shake off the type health defects as in the case of the deep line. With all cross-bars note the Life line after it is cut, and it will tell whether recovery is complete or not. 

If, after a cross-bar cutting a thin Life line and running to an island, dot, cross, or break on the Head line, the Life line has an island and becomes broad and shallow afterward (198), the subject, naturally not robust, has a severe attack of brain trouble which leaves him delicate, and from which he never regains his normal strength. 

The head is also left delicate as a result of this illness, shown by the island on the Head line. Sometimes the cross-bars cutting the Life line begin on Influence lines on the Mount of Venus (199). 

In these cases, worry concerning the influence has caused the illness shown by the cross-bar. 

This is especially true if the Influence line be deep and strong. 

If the cross-bar run to a narrow quadrangle (200), it will be a sign of asthma ; the narrowing of the quadrangle as a health indication shows a tendency to suffocation, and this has been found to relate to attacks of asthma. Always see the narrow quadrangle before using this reading, as that is the thing which locates the disease ; a line running into a normal quadrangle would not give such an indication.

If a cross-bar run to a ladder-like line of Mercury (201), it shows that the illness comes from stomach trouble, as that is the weakness shown by such a Mercury line. 

If the cross-bar run to an islanded line of Mercury (202), it shows that throat and lung trouble is the difficulty, that being the indication of such a Mercury line.
