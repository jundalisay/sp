In all cases where defects in the line are seen, look first for their cause and then to the repair indications. 

If a defective Saturn line have a chance line from a smooth and good Upper Mars running by its side, the resistance of the Mount will not permit discouragements to overthrow the subject, and this determination will save him from trouble (392).

In most hands, there are 2 places where the Saturn line shows the greatest number of defects or difficulties.

1. At the start of the line, which period covers events brought into the child's life by his parents, and which show the manner in which he is started in life. 

If the Saturn line at this period is deep and strong, he will have little difficulty in getting started in life. 

Usually, those who have the best kind of a start often fall into trouble later on because they never experienced adversity. 
- They do not know how to act under adversity and how to take its consequent hard knocks.

There seems to be a given amount of experience necessary to each individual, and if he does not receive this at one time he does at another. 

Those hands on which the Saturn line is defective at the start, generally improve, for the subject having adversity when young, early learns to avoid the dangers that beset him and becomes able to do for himself.

2. The age between 30-45

In most hands, this fills the period or space between the Head and Heart lines. 

This is the critical time in most business careers, and is the formative financial period in life. 

In most hands before this age the subject has been cared for and guided by parents or relatives. As the time approaches when these aids are no longer so closely depended upon, the subject begins to be guided by his own ideas. 

If these be good, he gets along all right, but if he believes that the experience of others will not apply to him, he will have disappointments, and will have to "pay for his experience." During the period of life indicated by the space between the Head and Heart lines, sometimes beginning earlier than this, the greatest number of defects are generally seen in the Saturu line. 

Between childhood and 25 years old, most Saturn lines are deep. 

Many hands has defective Saturn lines from 30-45 (393).

It often becomes good afterwards, and often no Hue is seen after 45. 

All of the defects seen during 30-45 years are disastrous in proportion as they are destructive to the line of Saturu, and must be so estimated. 

Often the line gets thin as it approaches the Head line, and often the breaks and defects come into a deep strong line. 

When the entire space between the Head and Heart lines is filled with an island, there will be continuous financial difficulty during all of these years (394). 


If during this period the line be wavy, the career at this time will be variable (395). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/395.png)

If in this portion of the line a break should be repaired by a square, one side of which continues, the subject will have a serious reverse at the age indicated, but will be able to get through it (396).

If the Saturn lines between Head and Heart line be covered with crosses, the subject will have repeated reverses which he will withstand if the line continues after this period, but which will overcome him if it does not (397).

If this portion of the Saturn line be cut with cross-bars, the subject will meet with obstacles to his career (398). If the line cuts through these bars and severs them, the subject will overcome the difficulties; but if these bars cut the Saturn line he will have great difficulty in doing so.

If this portion of the Saturn line be cut by chance lines from the Head line, the difficulties will arise from errors of judgment (399).

If the Saturn line during this period be cut by chance lines from the Heart line, the subject permits his affections to get the better of him, and sentiment in business is disastrous (400). 


If the Life line is defective, and chance lines from it cut the Saturn line at the period between 30-45, ill health has obstructed the career during the financial formative period (401). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/401.png)

If an Influence line on Mount of Venus ends in a star, and a Worry line from it cuts the Saturn line between the lines of Head and Life, the death of a relative will obstruct the career at this period (402). 

If this Worry line cuts a rising line from the Life line, the death of a relative will bring on a check to the upward career of the subject (403). 

**Defects in any part of the line must be read at the age they occur.** 


All lines do not show all of their defects in childhood or the formative period. 

I emphasize these two periods because they are most frequently found defective.

The indications given for those parts of the line apply to any defective period, and all supports or strengthening influences act equally well upon any portion of the line. 

<!-- Any line that rises at the base of the hand, running to the various Mounts is a Saturn line.
- It shows success coming from the attributes of the Mount where it ends.  -->

The Saturn line cannot end on any Mount but Saturn, with the one exception that it may run to Jupiter. 

If the Saturn line runs through its usual course in the centre of the hand and ends on the Mount of Jupiter, the success of the subject will be the result of great ambition (404). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/404.png)

If the Saturn line is deep and rises from inside the Life line ending on the Mount of Jupiter, the influence of relatives and great ambition unite to make the career of the subject a success (405).

If the Saturn line rises inside the Life line runs deep for a while and then becomes defective, the assistance of relatives and ambition help for a while, but do not bring ultimate success (406). 

At the point where the ill success begins, look for a cause. This may be:
- ill health
- loss of mental power
- unhappy environment, or
- some special disease

If such a Saturn line is seen, and a Worry line, cutting a rising line from the Life line, crosses the hand and cuts a forked line of Affection, an unhappy marriage has injured the prospects of the subject (407). 

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/407.png)

In the same manner the death of a relative, outside influences, ill health, will be shown by chance lines running from the cause of the trouble and cutting the Saturn line.

Sometimes chance lines do not connect the bad defects with the Saturn line. 

If a Saturn line rises on the Mount of the Moon and runs deep and strong to the Mount of Jupiter, the influence of one of the opposite sex together with the great ambition of the subject cause his prosperity (408). If the confirmations of marriage be present, the influence will be husband or wife.

If a Saturn line running in this manner be defective in any part, the combination of influences has not been sufficient to prevent trouble. 

When a line runs from the base of the hand to the Mount of Apollo or Mercury, it is an apollo or mercury line, not of Saturn.

A line running toward Upper Mars is also likely to be the Mercury line.

<!-- consequently in practice it is best to consider as a line of Saturn, only lines which run through the centre of the hand.  -->

If such lines are then deflected toward the Mounts, they are Saturn lines, strongly influenced by the Mount to which they run (409). 

If such a Saturn line ends on Upper Mars, the subject will achieve success from his leadership, power of resistance, and because he does not become discouraged (410).

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/410.png)

<!-- All of these indications will be accented if the Mounts be large and well developed.  -->

If a line branches from the Saturn line to Mount of Jupiter, the subject's success will be largely their due to ambition and ability to command men and obtain support. Such a line is a fine one for a politician (411). 


If the Saturn line has a branch rising to the Mount of Apollo, the subject will win success in art, business, or as an actor, according to which phalanx of the Apollo finger rules (412).

If a Saturn line have one branch rising to Jupiter, and one to Apollo, the subject will have an assured future of wealth and fame, for ambition and the Jupiterian attributes, the wisdom of Saturn, with brilliancy, art, and business from Apollo, are all united to assist him to a rich harvest (413). This is the most favorable combination possible.

![Saturn](/graphics/palm/413.png)

If the Saturn line have a branch rising to Mercury, the subject will have the assistance of shrewdness, business ability, good power of expression, and a scientific turn of mind to assist in his success (414).

If a Saturn line have a branch rising and joining but not cutting the Head line, the subject will have the assistance of a good head in the shaping of his career (415).
