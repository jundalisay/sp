The termination of the line will show the outcome of the career.

In many hands, the line does not reach the Mount of Saturn but ends somewhere below it. 

It shows periods of productive capacity. So it is not strange that it should be absent in old age, for at this time disease or delicacy generally makes the career negative. 

The presence of a Mount without a line shows at least that no forces are working against the subject, and if the line be good in its early course it shows that a productive life is behind him, and it will be found that he is enjoying in old age the result of his early labors. 

On some Mounts a deep line is seen. This is a strong indication of well-to-do old age. 

In any event the point at which the line ceases, be it in youth or old age, terminates our work with it, except that we can say to those whose line has stopped and no other has taken its place, that the future is as they make it.

If a deep line runs only for 25 years, the subject can be promised a productive period only during that time; the period after it, is as be makes it by effort.

If the line runs deep for part of the way and terminates in a wavy line (416):
- the career during the latter years will be uncertain
- there will be worries in old age.

These defective terminations on the Mount may not mean poverty or money losses in old age. But they may mean financial checks to the career from disappointments in children, or similar troubles. 

I mention this in order to warn sagainst reading defective terminations as necessarily meaning poverty when the Saturn line has previously been deep for its entire course. 

Breaks in the line, bars cutting it, crosses or dots following a hitherto deep line, will indicate trials and crosses in old age. 

If the Saturn line breaks on the Mount, and the Life, Head, and Heart lines be defective at the same age, ill health in old age will render the last days ones of trouble (417). 

If the Saturn line end in an island and downward branches be seen on the Life line with a long tassel, financial difficulties due to ill health will cloud the last days of the subject (418). 

If the line be crossed by bars which cut it on the Mount, the subject will suffer losses and trials in old age (419). If the bars be faint and do not cut the line they are troubles and worries.

If the line has crosses on the Mount, great trials and misfortunes will harass the latter years of the subject (420). 

<!-- All of these terminations apply to the line on the Mount of Saturn, and have their various indications in old age. -->

If the line terminate in these signs at any age the reading will be the same, except that it applies to the age indicated on the line at the time at which it occurs.

If the line be defective during its entire course and terminates in any of these signs, the indication will be worse than when these markings terminate a deep line, for in the first instance the subject will not have a prosperous life behind him, during which he might have provided for old age.

Image 421 will give various examples of such defective lines.

If I had only known the productive periods, the end might have been different.

This<!--  oft-repeated exclamation --> is sadly true, for in only few lives are productive periods taken advantage of in their fullest measure. 

If by a careful application of the rules laid down in this chapter you are enabled to help struggling humanity to make use of the harvest portion of their lives, and thus provide for the days when vital forces wane, and labor can no longer be done, you will have wasted no time which has been spent in a study of the line of Saturn.
