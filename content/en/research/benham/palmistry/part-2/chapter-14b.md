## The Rascettes


The Rascettes, or Bracelets, are the lines which cross the wrist at the base of the hand (548). 
- Sometimes there are three, and there may be only one. 
- These are of little use, except the first one.

Traditionally, older palmists add 30 years to the life of a subject for each Bracelet seen. 

I could not confirm this. I never use them as bearing on longevity. 

<!-- There are other traditions on signs found on the Bracelets which experience has proven false.  -->

The first Bracelet, if deep, indicates a strong constitution. 
- With a deep Life line, a deeply cut Rascette will prove an added strength. 

If the Rascette is poorly marked, chained, or broad and shallow, the constitution of the subject is not so strong. 

If short branches rise from the Rascettes, it indicates a rising tendency in the life of the subject, ambitious efforts, and a desire to improve.


## Travel Lines

These are long branches which rise high into the Mount of the Moon. These indicate journeys. 

These lines increase the restlessness and desire to travel which belongs to a Lunarian subject. He will improve every opportunity of travel which comes to him. 

Long lines indicate more restlessness and longer journeys. 

When Travel lines are seen, the type of the subject will help to use them correctly. 

- The Lunarian is the most anxious to travel, the Mercurian next. 
- The Martian, Apollonian, and Jupiterian all like travel to some extent, but most often make journeys with the idea of improving their material success. 
- The Saturnian will travel in search of knowledge, and the Venusian purely for pleasure. 

Spatulate tips with Travel lines are the strongest possible confirmatory companions. 

If the hand is very soft, the travels will often be mental ones.

I have seen a branch from the Life line to a Travel line (549) indicate the time when a subject retired from business, changed his thoughts from business to books, and mentally travelled a great deal, though actually taking few journeys.

These Travel lines must be treated as a part of the Rascettes, for they rise from the first one. One other indication of the first Rascette will complete its usefulness. 

When this line rises in the centre (550) it indicates a delicacy of the internal organs contained in the abdomen.
- In women this means the procreative organs, and constitutes a danger to them in maternity. 

If evidence of female weakness appears on the lower Mount of Moon, or in the Mercury line, the bulging Bracelet will confirm this weakness.

<!-- These are valuable as premarriage indications, denoting the probability of a fruitful marriage.  -->

While these markings do not show absolute sterility they show a defective condition of the parts which will produce the same results.
