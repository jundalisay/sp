ATHENIAN: Then our tyrant must temperance as well as the other qualities, if the state is to acquire in the best manner and in the shortest time the form of government which is most conducive to happiness; for there neither is nor ever will be a better or speedier way of establishing a polity than by a tyranny.

CLEINIAS: By what possible arguments, Stranger, can any man persuade himself of such a monstrous doctrine?

ATHENIAN: There is surely no difficulty in seeing, Cleinias, what is in accordance with the order of nature?

CLEINIAS: You would assume, as you say, a tyrant who was young, temperate, quick at learning, having a good memory, courageous, of a noble nature?

ATHENIAN: Yes. You must add fortunate.

His good fortune must be that he is the contemporary of a great legislator, and that some happy chance brings them together. 

When this has been accomplished, God has done all that he ever does for a state which he desires to be eminently prosperous; 

He has done second best for a state in which there are 2 such rulers, and third best for a state in which there are three. 

The difficulty increases with the increase, and diminishes with the diminution of the number.


CLEINIAS: You mean that:
- the best government is produced from a tyranny and originates in a good lawgiver and an orderly tyrant
- the change from such a tyranny into a perfect form of government takes place most easily; less easily when from an oligarchy; and, in the third degree, from a democracy


ATHENIAN: No. 

I mean that the change is best made out of a tyranny.

 and secondly, out of a monarchy; and thirdly, out of some sort of democracy: fourth, in the capacity for improvement, comes oligarchy, 

Oligarchy has the greatest difficulty in admitting of such a change because the government is in the hands of a number of potentates.

The legislator is by nature of the true sort. His strength is united with that of the chief men of the state. When the ruling element is numerically small, and at the same time very strong, as in a tyranny, there the change is likely to be easiest and most rapid.

Have you ever seen a city under a tyranny?

CLEINIAS: No, and I have no great desire to see one.

ATHENIAN: The tyrant, if he wishes, can change the manners of a state.

He has only to go in the direction of virtue or of vice, whichever he prefers, he himself indicating by his example the lines of conduct, praising and rewarding some actions and reproving others, and degrading those who disobey.

CLEINIAS: But how can we imagine that the citizens in general will at once follow the example set to them; and how can he have this power both of persuading and of compelling them?

ATHENIAN: Let no one, my friends, persuade us that there is any quicker and easier way in which states change their laws than when the rulers lead: such changes never have, nor ever will, come to pass in any other way. 

The real impossibility or difficulty is of another sort, and is rarely surmounted in the course of ages; but when once it is surmounted, ten thousand or rather all blessings follow.

The difficulty is to find the divine love of temperate and just institutions existing in any powerful forms of government, whether in a monarchy or oligarchy of wealth or of birth. You might as well hope to reproduce the character of Nestor, who is said to have excelled all men in the power of speech, and yet more in his temperance. This, however, according to the tradition, was in the times of Troy; in our own days there is nothing of the sort; but if such an one either has or ever shall come into being, or is now among us, blessed is he and blessed are they who hear the wise words that flow from his lips. And this may be said of power in general: When the supreme power in man coincides with the greatest wisdom and temperance, then the best laws and the best constitution come into being; but in no other way. And let what I have been saying be regarded as a kind of sacred legend or oracle, and let this be our proof that, in one point of view, there may be a difficulty for a city to have good laws, but that there is another point of view in which nothing can be easier or sooner effected, granting our supposition.

CLEINIAS: How do you mean?

ATHENIAN: Let us try to amuse ourselves, old boys as we are, by moulding in words the laws which are suitable to your state.

CLEINIAS: Let us proceed without delay.

ATHENIAN: Then let us invoke God at the settlement of our state; may He hear and be propitious to us, and come and set in order the State and the laws!

CLEINIAS: May He come!

ATHENIAN: But what form of polity are we going to give the city?

CLEINIAS: Tell us what you mean a little more clearly. Do you mean some form of democracy, or oligarchy, or aristocracy, or monarchy? For we cannot suppose that you would include tyranny.

ATHENIAN: Which of you will first tell me to which of these classes his own government is to be referred?

MEGILLUS: Ought I to answer first, since I am the elder?

CLEINIAS: Perhaps you should.

MEGILLUS: The government of Sparta seems to me to be like a tyranny.

The power of our Ephors is marvellously tyrannical.

Yet sometimes it appears to me to be of all cities the most democratic.

It is an aristocracy. 

We have also a monarchy which is held for life and is the most ancient of all monarchies.

So I cannot precisely say which form of government the Spartan is.


CLEINIAS: I am in the same difficulty about the polity of Cnosus.


ATHENIAN: This is because you really have polities, but the states of which we were just now speaking are merely aggregations of men dwelling in cities who are the subjects and servants of a part of their own state, and each of them is named after the dominant power.

They are not polities at all. 

But if states are to be named after their rulers, the true state ought to be called by the name of the God who rules over wise men.

<!-- CLEINIAS: Who is this God? -->
