The Noble Buddha-to-be Avalokiteśvara, while dwelling deep in the practice of the perfection of wisdom, beheld these 5 constituent groups (of mind and body) and saw them empty of self-nature.

Here, Śāriputra, form is emptiness, emptiness is surely form.

Emptiness is not different from form, form is not different from emptiness.

Whatever form there is, that is emptiness; whatever emptiness there is, that is form.

The same for feelings, perceptions, volitional processes and consciousness.

Here, Śāriputra, all things have the characteristic of emptiness,
<!-- Iha, Śāriputra, rūpaṁ śūnyatā, śūnyataiva rūpaṁ; -->

No arising, no ceasing; no purity, no impurity; no deficiency, no completeness.
 
Therefore, Śāriputra, in emptiness there is no form, no feeling, no perception, no volitional processes, no consciousness.

There are no eye, ear, nose, tongue, body or mind;

no forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, thoughts;

no eye-element (and so on) up to no mind-consciousness element;

no ignorance, no destruction of ignorance (and so on) up to no old age and death, no  destruction of old age and death.

no suffering, arising, cessation, path;

no knowledge, no attainment, no non-attainment.

Therefore, Śāriputra, because of the Buddha-to-be's non-attainments, he relies on the Perfection of Wisdom, and dwells with his mind unobstructed, having an unobstructed mind he does not tremble,  overcoming opposition, he attains the state of Nirvāṇa.

All the Buddhas abiding in the 3 times  through relying on the Perfection of Wisdom fully awaken to the unsurpassed Perfect and Complete Awakening.

Therefore one should know the Perfection of Wisdom is a great mantra, a great scientific mantra, an unsurpassed mantra, an unmatched mantra, the subduer of all suffering, the truth, not falsehood.

In the Perfection of Wisdom the mantra has been uttered in this way:

"gate, gate, pāragate, pārasaṁgate, Bodhi, svāhā!"
[gone, gone, gone beyond, gone completely beyond, Awakening, blessings!]

Thus the Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom is Complete
