I. THE “GRAN RIFIUTO”

AS MEMBERS of their international organization, the socialist parties
had done all they could to avert the war. But when nevertheless it broke
out, they rallied to their national causes with a readiness that was truly
astounding. The German Marxists hesitated even less than the English
laborites. 1 Of course it must be borne in mind that every belligerent nation
was fully convinced that it was waging a purely defensive war—every war
is defensive or at least “preventive” in the eyes of the nations that wage it. 2
Still, if we reflect that the socialist parties had an indubitable constitutional
right to vote against war budgets and that within the general moral schema
of bourgeois democracy there is no obligation to identify oneself with
national policy—men far removed from socialist anti-militarism in fact
disapproved of the war in all the belligerent countries—we seem to face a
problem that is not solved by doubtful references to Marx or to previous
declarations by Bebel and von Vollmar that they would defend their country
if attacked. There should have been no difficulty in recalling Marx’s true
teaching on the subject. Moreover, defending one’s country means only
doing one’s duty with the army; it does not imply voting with the
government and entering into unions sacrées.3 Guesde and Sembat in France
and Vandervelde in Belgium who took office in war cabinets, and the
German socialists who voted the war budgets, thus did more than loyalty to
their nations required, as then commonly understood. 4
There is but one solution to the puzzle. Whether or not the majority
of socialist politicians believed in Marxian internationalism—perhaps
this belief had by that time shared the fate of the cognate belief in a
1 The English Labour party was in fact alone in making a serious stand for peace in 1914,
though it joined the war coalition later on.
2 This is why the attempt made by the victors to decide the moral issue by means of a clause
in an imposed peace treaty was not only so unfair but also so foolish.
3 Nor is it true that failure to do so would have weakened the national cause. Lord Morley’s
resignation clearly did not injure England.
4 Many of us will think differently at present. But this merely shows how far we have
traveled from the old moorings of liberal democracy. To exalt national unity into a moral precept
spells acceptance of one of the most important principles of fascism.
From the First to the Second World War 353
spectacular revolution—they certainly realized that any stand taken
upon the gospel would have cost them their following. The masses
would have first stared at them and then they would have renounced
allegiance, thereby refuting via facti the Marxian doctrine that the
proletarian has no country and that class war is the only war that
concerns him. In this sense, and with a proviso to the effect that things
might have been different if the war had impinged after a longer spell
of evolution within the bourgeois framework, a vital pillar of the
Marxian structure broke in August 1914. 5
This was in fact widely felt. It was felt in the conservative camp: German
conservatives suddenly began to refer to the socialist party in language that
was the pink of courtesy. It was felt in that part of the socialist camp in
which the faith still retained its old ardor. Even in England MacDonald lost
the leadership of the labor party and eventually his seat rather than join the
war coalition. In Germany, Kautsky and Haase left the majority (March
1916) and in 1917 organized the Independent Social Democratic party,
though most of its important members returned to the fold in 1919. 6 Lenin
declared that the Second International was dead and that the cause of
socialism had been betrayed.

There was an element of truth in this. So far as the majorities of the
Marxist parties were concerned, socialism at the crossroads had in fact
not stood the test. It had not chosen the Marxist route. The creeds, the
slogans, the ultimate goals, the organizations, the bureaucracies, the
leaders had not changed. They remained on the morrow of the gran
rifiuto what they had been on its eve. But what they meant and stood for
had changed all the more. After that experimentum crucis neither
socialists nor anti-socialists could any longer look at those parties in the
same light as before. Nor could those parties themselves go on with their
old antics. For better and for worse they had stepped out of their ivory
tower. They had testified to the fact that the fate of their countries meant
more to them than did the socialist goal.
The case was different however with those of them who, like the Social
Democratic parties of the Scandinavian countries, never had been in any
ivory tower. And even with the others the case will look different to observers
5 To some extent this must also be attributed to the success of non-socialist reforms.
6 It is worth noting that the Independents recruited themselves by no means exclusively from
the uncompromising Marxists. Kautsky and Haase belonged to that sector, but many who joined
with them did not. Bernstein, for instance, joined and so did several other revisionists whose
motive cannot have been respect for the Marxian faith. But there is nothing to wonder at in
this. Orthodox Marxism was of course not the only reason a socialist might have had for
disapproving the course taken by the majority. These revisionists simply shared Ramsay
MacDonald’s persuasion.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties354
who never took those revolutionary antics seriously. As regards the German
party in particular, it may well be nearer the truth to say that the “social
traitors”—as they were dubbed—simply came down from unrealistic clouds
and that the national emergency taught them to stand on their feet instead
of on their heads—which, so some of us will add, was all to their credit and
no rifiuto at all. But whichever view we take, there cannot be any doubt that
the new attitude of responsibility drastically shortened the long stretch that
before 1914 seemed to lie between them and the natural goal of every
party—office. I am far indeed from attributing to German Social Democrats
any calculations of this kind or from doubting the sincerity of their decision
not to take office in bourgeois society. But it is obvious that, as a result of
the stand they took at the beginning of the war, they were—if I may say so—
“sitting pretty” at the end of it. Unlike the other parties, they had not
compromised themselves by running along in full cry. But neither had they
deserted their nation in the hour of danger.



II. T HE E FFECTS O F T HE F IRST W ORLD W AR O N T HE C HANCES O F

THE SOCIALIST PARTIES OF EUROPE

1. Any major war that ends in defeat will shake the social fabric and
threaten the position of the ruling group; the loss of prestige resulting from
military defeat is one of the hardest things for a regime to survive. I do
not know of any exception to this rule. But the converse proposition is not
so certain. Unless success be quick or, at all events, striking and clearly
associated with the performance of the ruling stratum—as was, for
instance, Germany’s success in 1870—exhaustion, economic, physical and
psychological may well produce, even in the case of victory, effects on the
relative position of classes, groups and parties that do not differ essentially
from those of defeat.

The First World War illustrates this. In the United States the effort had
not been sufficiently prolonged and exhausting to show it. Even here the
administration responsible for the war suffered a crushing defeat at the
polls. But in all other victorious countries the prestige of the ruling strata
and their hold on their people were impaired and not enhanced. For the
fortunes of the German and English socialist parties, this meant the advent
of power or, at all events, office. In Germany control of the central organs
of society was thrust upon the party: though in order to save doctrinal face
some of them as well as some anti-socialists insisted on speaking of a
revolution, the fact was that they undertook government by request—and
a humble request it was. In England the labor vote that had been at little
over half a million in January 1910 and not quite two millions and a
quarter in 1918, 7 went to 4,236,733 in 1922 and to 5,487,620 in 1924
From the First to the Second World War 355
(8,362,594 in 1929). MacDonald reconquered the leadership and in 1924
the party came into office if not really into power. In France the structure
of the political world prevented any such clear-cut consummation, but the
general contours were the same: there was a syndicalist revival immediately
after the war, but the Confédération Générale du Travail, leaving the newly
founded Confédération Générale du Travail Syndicaliste and the
communist Confédération Générale du Travail Unitaire to absorb
inadaptable elements, discouraged revolutionary courses and slowly
prepared itself for a dominant political role.
Moreover, the socialist or quasi-socialist parties who then shouldered
the responsibility that came to them may well have felt that they had
almost a monopoly of many of the qualifications required in order to
make a success of their venture. Better than any other group they were
able to handle the masses that seethed with discontent. As the German
example shows, they even were in a better position than anyone else was
for the time being to deal firmly with revolutionary outbreaks—if need
be, by force. At any rate, they were the very people to administer the
right dose of social reform, to carry it on the one hand, and to make the
masses accept it on the other. Most important of all, they were, from their
standpoint, quite justified in believing that they were also the people to
heal the wounds the “imperialist war” had inflicted, to restore
international relations and to clear up the mess which, without any fault
of theirs, purely bourgeois governments had made of the peace. In this
they committed the same kind of error which from a different standpoint
was committed by their bourgeois competitors who believed in collective
security, the League of Nations, the reconstruction of gold currencies and
the removal of trade barriers. But once we grant the erroneous premise
we must also grant that the socialists were right in hoping for success,
particularly in the field of foreign policy.

2. The achievements of the two MacDonald governments—MacDonald’s
and Henderson’s work at the foreign office—are sufficient to illustrate this.
But the German case is still more significant. First of all, only the Social
Democrats were in a moral position to accept the peace treaty and to support
a policy that aimed at fulfilling its provisions. They lamented the national
catastrophe, of course, and the burdens it imposed. But feeling as they did
about military glory, neither the defeat itself nor the peace spelled unbearable
humiliation for them. Some of them almost subscribed to the Anglo-French
theory of the war. Most of them cared little for rearmament. While other
Germans looked on in sullen disgust, they worked for peaceful understanding

and the simplification of the electoral qualification. -->

with the victors in a spirit that was perfectly free, if not from resentment,
yet from passionate hatred. In the matter of what to others was an imposed
democracy, they even saw eye to eye with the western nations: having
disposed of the communist revolts in 1918–1919 and having by judicious
compromise acquired a dominant role in domestic politics, they were in their
most democratic mood.

Second, their hold on the masses was strong enough to make this attitude
politically effective. For the moment, a great part of the population saw
things in the same light. Their views of the situation and the right way of
dealing with it temporarily became the official view whatever the politics of
the government that happened to be in office. They provided the political
support for the coalitions which negotiated the Dawes plan and the Locarno
pact and which could never have been formed or, if formed, could never have
taken that line without them. Stresemann was no socialist. Yet the policy
associated with his name was the policy of the Social Democratic party—
the policy for which they were to get all the credit during one decade and
all the punishment in another.
Third, they were at an advantage in their relations to political opinion
abroad. The world knew little about Germany. But it understood two things:
on the one hand, it realized that there was a party that was ready to accept
for good many of the postwar arrangements and in fact quite approved of
some of them, a party that was the enemy of what France and England had
convinced themselves was their enemy; on the other hand, it realized that
German Social Democracy need not be feared on other counts—however
conservative a government might be, there was no need for it to object to
German as it did object to Russian socialism. In the long run this was a
weakness. It had much to do with the dilatory treatment dealt out to German
grievances, for it induced the foreign offices of England and France to
believe that Germany would remain indefinitely the meek petitioner who
could be made happy by assurances that some day he might be promoted to
a position of equality with the superior nations. In the short run, however,
and especially during the dark days of the Ruhr invasion, it was an asset:
the party—or rather governments known to depend on the support of the
party—had an entrée that would have been denied to others.
Fourth, there were the old contacts of the Social Democratic party with
the corresponding parties in other countries which dated from the Second
International. These contacts had not been completely severed by the war.
After all, the Second International had never been officially dissolved, and
many individuals and groups within it—especially, but by no means
exclusively, those of the neutral countries—had kept their internationalist
beliefs intact. The secretary (C. Huysmans) had continued to act, and in
From the First to the Second World War 357
1917, on the suggestion of the Scandinavian socialists, he had even made
an attempt to convene a congress which failed only because the Allied
powers, by that time determined to crush their adversary, refused to grant
passports. 8 Thus it was but natural that many socialists should have thought
of reviving it as a matter of course.

3. It was revived but not without difficulties. The first conferences that
were held for this purpose in 1919 and 1920 were only moderately
successful. The Communist (Third) International that had emerged
meanwhile (see below) exerted an attraction that proved a serious obstacle
to unity among the laborite and socialist parties of the world. And several
important groups that were in no mind to throw in their lot with the
communists still wanted something more up to date than the Second
International. This situation was met successfully by a clever tactical
device. On the initiative of the Austrian Socialists who were joined by the
German Independents and the English Independent Labor Party, a new
organization, the Workers’ International Union of Socialist Parties (the so-
called Vienna International), was formed in order to radicalize the groups
in the revived Second International, to restrain the groups that leaned too
much toward communism and to bring them both into line by judicious formulations of aims. 9

The meaning of the venture is exactly rendered by the sobriquet the
communists immediately found for it, the “International number two and
one-half.” That is precisely why it was able to serve the needs of the time.
At the Congress of Hamburg (1923) the Second and the Vienna
Internationals were united in order to form the Labor and Socialist
International, to stigmatize the peace as “imperialist” and to call for a united
front against international reaction—which at any rate sounded well—for the
eight-hour day and for international social legislation. The reduction of
Germany’s indemnity to a definite and reasonable figure, the abolishment of
interallied debts and the evacuation of German territory had been declared
necessary a year before (Frankfort Resolutions, 1922). In the light of
subsequent events we cannot fail to realize how great an achievement—and
service—that was.

<!-- 8 Before that there had actually been two conventions in Switzerland—at Zimmerwald
(1915) and at Kienthal (1916)—which acquired, contrary to the original intention I believe, a
different color owing to the fact that the attendance was not representative of the official parties.
I shall return briefly to them later on.

9 Some of those formulations would have done credit to any eighteenth-century diplomatist.
The great stumbling block was class war. The continental groups could not live without it, the
English could not live with it. So, when the merger was consummated at the Congress of
Hamburg, the Klassenkampf and the lutte des classes were retained in the German and French
texts but in the English text they were replaced by an unrecognizable circumlocution. -->


III. COMMUNISM A ND T HE R USSIAN E LEMENT

1. Meanwhile, communist parties were rapidly developing. In itself this
is only what we should have expected. Nor was it dangerous. Any party
that experiences the sobering influence of responsibility will unavoidably
have to leave room for groups further to the left (or right) to develop in,
and such room is not likely to remain unoccupied for long. Provided
defection can be kept within bounds, this need not be more than a
nuisance—it may even be preferable to keeping unruly elements in the
fold. Socialist parties had always had trouble with hyper-radical wings. 10
That such “leftist” groups should gain ground in the troubled days that
followed upon the war and that they should seize the opportunity to
acquire the status of distinct parties is no more surprising than that they
should follow classical usage and call themselves “communist” or that
they should display a much stronger internationalist slant than the official
parties did at the time.

Bear in mind that all this is completely independent of the Russian aspect
of the case. There would be communist parties and there would be a
Communist International if the tsars still reigned over Russia. But since the
Russian element became a factor in shaping the fortunes of both socialism
and communism all over the world—in fact, in shaping the social and
political history of our time—it is essential to restate how it developed and
to appraise its nature and importance. For this purpose we shall divide its
development into three stages.

2. At first—that is to say, until the bolsheviks seized power in 1917—
there was nothing particularly Russian about the development of the
communist groups except that the strongest man happened to be a Russian
and that a streak of Mongol despotism was present in his scheme of
thought. When at the outbreak of the war the Second International
suspended itself via facti, and when Lenin declared that it was dead and
that the hour had struck for more effective methods, it was natural for those
who felt as he did to get together. Opportunity presented itself at the two
conventions that were held in Switzerland, at Zimmerwald (1915) and at
Kienthal (1916). Since practically all of those who had espoused the causes
of their nations stayed away, the attending militants found little difficulty
10 The splits that occurred in England and Germany over the war issue were of course
a different matter and of only temporary importance. Even the German Spartacus League,
founded in 1916 by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, though it went much further in
its opposition to war than the Independents approved, took time to develop a definitely
hostile attitude and even then did not go, officially at least, beyond insisting on the letter
of the old Erfurt program. So far as I know, neither Liebknecht nor Mrs. Luxemburg ever
completely severed contact with the party. The latter was one of the most relentless critics
of bolshevist practice.
From the First to the Second World War 359
in—more or less—rallying to Lenin’s program of converting the imperialist
war into an international revolution. There was more in this than a mere
profession of faith in pristine Marxism and its Messianic promise. There
was, with some of them, also the clear perception of the truth, to which
the bourgeois of all countries were so completely blind, that the fabric of
bourgeois society is unequal to the strains and stresses of prolonged “total”
warfare and that breakdowns would occur at least in some countries.
Beyond that however Lenin’s leadership was not accepted. Most of those
who were present thought of convincing, bullying and using existing
socialist parties rather than of destroying them. Moreover—and in this
Lenin agreed—the international revolution was to be brought about by the
individual actions of the national proletariats, and in the “advanced”
countries first.

The second stage I date from 1917 to 1927, that is to say, from the rise
of the bolsheviks to power in Russia to Trotsky’s expulsion from the Central
Committee of the Bolshevik party (October 1927). That decade witnessed
the emergence of communist parties and of a Communist (the “Third”)
International. It also witnessed the (for the time being) definitive break with
the socialist and laborite parties which, in the case of Germany, was
embittered beyond remedy by the severely repressive measures adopted by
the Social Democrats in power during the winter of 1918 to 1919. And
finally it witnessed the forging of the Russian chain.

But during the whole of that decade, the chain neither galled nor
distorted. It must be remembered that the bolshevik conquest of the rule
over the most backward of all the great nations was nothing but a fluke. 11
To a certain extent Lenin himself recognized this. He repeated over and
over again that final victory would be won only by the action of the
revolutionary forces in more advanced countries and that this action was
the really important thing. Of course he dictated to communists as he had
done before, and he insisted on a strictly centralist organization of the
Communist International—whose bureau took power to prescribe every
move of the individual parties—but he did so in his role of communist
leader and not in his role of Russian despot. That made all the difference.
The headquarters of the International were in Moscow, the actual leader
was Russian, but policy was directed in a thoroughly internationalist
spirit, without any particular reference to Russian national interests and
on principles with which the communists of all countries substantially
11 For this fluke, bolshevism was possibly indebted to the German general staff, by whose
orders Lenin was transported to Russia. If this should be thought an exaggeration of his personal
share in the events of 1917, there were enough other chance factors in the situation to teach us
the freakishness of this piece of history.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties360
agreed. Though the personal relation between the Bureau of the
International and the Political Bureau of the Soviet power 12 was then
much closer than it was later on, the two were nevertheless much more
nearly distinct agencies. Thus the International itself and the individual
parties did not behave differently than they would have behaved in the
absence of the link with Russia.
During that decade, therefore, the importance of the Russian
connection, though great, did not amount to more than this. First of all,
there was the weighty fact that however insignificant in quality and
quantity of membership a communist group might be and however little
claim to being taken seriously it might have, it could bask in the glory
reflected by that other group which had conquered an empire, and it
could derive encouragement from such a backing. Second, bolshevist
reality notwithstanding—the terror, the misery, the confession of failure
implied in the adoption of the New Economic Policy after the Kronstadt
revolt—it was henceforth possible to point to a socialist system that
“worked.” The bolsheviks proved themselves masters in the art of
exploiting the fact that public opinion in England and the United States
will swallow anything provided it is served up in the garb of familiar
slogans. This of course also redounded to the advantage of the other
communist parties. Third, so long as communists of all countries (Lenin
himself included) believed in the imminence of a world revolution, the
Russian army meant as much to them as the army of Tsar Nicholas I had
meant to the reactionary groups during the second quarter of the
nineteenth century. 13 In 1919 such hopes were less unreasonable and
nearer to fulfillment than people are now prepared to believe. It is true
that communist republics were actually established only in Bavaria and
in Hungary. 14 
<!-- 12 In Lenin’s time, administrative authority was wielded by the Political Bureau, run by
Lenin himself, by the Military Council, Trotsky’s domain, and by the Cheka, then managed by
Dzerzhinsky. All three bodies were unknown to the constitution of the Soviet state, which vested
that authority in the “Soviet of the People’s Commissars.” Perhaps they should theoretically
be called organs of the party. But the party was the state.
13 It should be noticed that communists had dropped anti-militarism and noninterventionism
as easily as they had dropped democracy.
14 The Hungarian case (the government of Béla Kun) is highly instructive. The paralysis of
the upper classes and the indifference of the peasantry made it possible für a small group of
intellectuals to seize power without meeting significant resistance. They were a strange crowd—
some of them displaying (the same was true in Bavaria) unmistakably pathological symptoms—
and utterly unequal to this or any other serious task. But they had unbounded confidence in
themselves and their creed and no objection whatever to terrorist methods. And that proved quite
sufficient. They were allowed to stage their opera and might have gone on for an indefinite time
if the Allies had not permitted (or ordered) the Rumanian army to eject them.
 -->

But in Germany, Austria and Italy the social structure was perilously near toppling and there-is no saying what would have happened in those countries and possibly farther west if Trotsky’s war
machine had been in working order at that time and not engaged in the
civil and the Polish wars. 15 It should not be forgotten that the Communist
International was founded in that atmosphere of impending life and death
struggle. Many things which acquired a different meaning afterwards—
such as the centralized management that has unlimited power over the
individual parties and deprives them of all freedom of action—may then
have seemed quite reasonable from that aspect.
The third stage I have dated from the expulsion of Trotsky (1927)
because this is a convenient landmark in the rise of Stalin to absolute
power. After that every actual decision in matters of policy seems to
have been his, though he still met some opposition in the Political
Bureau and elsewhere until the “trial” of Kamenew and Zinoviev (1936)
or even until Yezhov’s reign of terror (1937). For our purpose this
means that every decision was thenceforth the decision of a Russian
statesman acting on behalf of national Russian interests as seen from
the standpoint of a streamlined despotism. And this in turn, if correct,
defines what his attitude to the “Comintern” (the Communist
International) and to foreign communist parties must have been. They
became tools of Russian policy, taking rank within the huge arsenal of
such tools and being realistically evaluated relative to others according
to circumstances. Up to the present war which may revive it, the world
revolution was a frozen asset. The surviving veterans as well as the
neophytes of internationalist communism may have been contemptible.
But they were still of some use. They could preach the glories of the
Russian regime. They could serve as pins with which to prick hostile
governments. They increased the bargaining power of Russia. So it was
worth while to go to some trouble and expense in order to keep them
in subjection, to supervise them by agents of the secret police, and to
man the Comintern’s bureau with absolutely obsequious serfs who
would obey in fear and trembling.

3. In all this (and in lying about it) Stalin followed the established practice
of the ages. Most national governments have acted as he did and it is pure
hypocrisy to profess specific indignation in his case.

<!-- 15 Therefore it is doubtful whether it is correct to say that the western powers acted foolishly
and inefficiently in supporting in a half-hearted way the various counterrevolutions that were
attempted in Russia, particularly the Denikin and Wrangel ventures. It seems to me that,
whether by a shrewd appraisal of the situation or by luck, they attained exactly what they could
have wished: they neutralized the Soviet power at a crucial moment and thus stopped the
advance of bolshevism. Less than this would have endangered their own social systems; more
than this would have involved prolonged, costly and perhaps unprofitable efforts that might
easily have defeated their aims. -->

The most obvious examples are afforded by the practice of governments
who espoused a religious creed. As long as the respective creeds were
sufficiently vital to motivate action, these governments often used foreign
groups of the same creed for their purposes. But, as the history of the years
from 1793 to 1815 is sufficient to prove, the practice is much more general
than these examples suggest. No less standardized is the reaction—
phraseological and other—by the governments which are affected by it:
politicians of all types and classes are happy to seize the opportunity of
calling an opponent a traitor.
But for the communist parties outside of Russia it was a serious matter
to receive orders from a caput mortuum in the hands of a modernized tsar.
Their abject servility raises two questions, one as to its causes and another
as to its possible bearing on the future character and fate of revolutionary
socialism.
The first question is perhaps less difficult to answer than it seems. All we
have to do is to put ourselves in the communist’s chair and, taking account
of his type, look at his situation in a practical spirit. He would not object to
the Stalin regime on humanitarian considerations. He may even glory in the
slaughter—some neurasthenic degenerates do, and others, the communists
from failure and resentment, experience satisfaction at the sufferings of a
certain class of victims. Moreover, why should he resent cruelties that do not
prevent thoroughly bourgeois people from idolizing the regime? Why should
he, on that ground, condemn bolshevism when the Dean of Canterbury does
not? 16 Why indeed?
Again, there was hardly any reason for communists to object on the
ground of Thermidorism. This phrase was first used by the opponents of the
New Economic Policy but Trotsky adopted it later in order to stigmatize
Stalin’s regime as “reactionary” in the sense in which the action of the men
who overthrew Robespierre in 1794 was “reactionary.” But it is completely
meaningless. After all, it was Stalin who collectivized agriculture,
“liquidated” the Kulaks, reversed the New Economic Policy. In fact, like a
good tactician, he suppressed opposition and substantially carried out the
opposition’s program.
Finally, what the protecting power does at home is not of primary
importance to the communist in another country as long as that power
plays fair with him. And even if it does not play fair with him, what is
16 The sentiments expressed in the book by that ecclesiastic cannot be defended on the
ground that the principles of the “Russian experiment” are one thing and the mode of its
execution is another thing. For the really terrible point about the Stalin regime is not what it
did to millions of victims but the fact that it had to do it if it wished to survive. In other words,
those principles and that practice are inseparable.
From the First to the Second World War 363
he to do? The chain tightened and galled. But it also supported. The
socialist parties would not have accepted him. The normal healthy-
minded workman turned from him with a groan. He would have been at
loose ends like Trotsky. He was in no position to do without the chain, 17
and in accepting his slavery he may have hoped—he may still hope—that
junctures will arise in which he may be able to pull it his way…after the
present World War perhaps…
The last point goes some way toward answering the second question.
Certainly there is a possibility that Russian despotism will spread over the
ruins of European civilization—or even beyond them—and that in this case
the communist parties all over the world will be turned into Russian
garrisons. But there are many other possibilities. And one of them is that the
Russian regime will founder in the process or that in spreading over other
countries it will acquire traits more congenial to the individual national soils.
A special case of this kind would be that in the end the Russian element will
have changed nothing in the future character of revolutionary socialism. To
bank on this is no doubt risky. But it is not as foolish as it is to hope that
our civilization will emerge unscathed from the present conflagration—
unless of course this conflagration subsides more quickly than we have a
right to expect.
IV. A DMINISTERING C APITALISM ?
1. So far, then, we have not seen any convincing reason why the
experiments in political responsibility that socialist parties made after 1918
should not have been perfectly successful. To repeat: in some countries—
in Sweden for instance—socialists merely continued to consolidate a power
they had acquired before; in others, power had come naturally to them
without having to be conquered by revolutionary action; in all countries,
they seemed to be much more in a position to grapple with the great
problems of the time than was any other party. As I have put it before, they
almost seemed to monopolize the essential conditions for success.
Moreover, though most of them had not had any previous experience in
office, they had acquired plenty of experience of a most useful sort in
17 This of course particularly applies to the communist group or groups in the United States.
The conditions of American politics are not favorable to the growth of an official communist
party—a few county treasurerships do not go far from the recruiting standpoint. But the
importance of the communist element must not be measured by the membership of the official
party. Those intellectuals who are either straight communists or fellow travelers have really no
motive to join it. They have every motive to stay out of it, for they are much better able to
serve if, without carrying the badge, they conquer positions on opinion-producing committees
or in administrative bodies and so on, remaining free to deny, with perfect truth, that they are
communists in a party sense. Such invisible groups are incapable of concerted action except
for the lead from Moscow.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties364
organizing, negotiating and in administration. In fact, it should be stated
at once that they hardly ever did a downright foolish thing. Finally, neither
the inevitable emergence of a new party to the left of the socialists nor the
connection of that party with Moscow was as serious for them as their
opponents tried to make out.
But in spite of all this, their situation was everywhere precarious. To the
true believer it might well have seemed an impossible one. For all those
tactical advantages hid a fundamental difficulty which they were powerless
to remove. The war and the upheaval caused by the war had brought the
socialists into office; but below the tatters of the old garb, the social
organism, and in particular the economic process, were still what they had
been before. That is to say, socialists had to govern in an essentially
capitalist world.
Marx had visualized the conquest of political power as the prerequisite
of socialization which was to be taken in hand immediately. This implied,
however, as in fact Marx’s argument implied throughout, that the opportunity
for that conquest would occur when capitalism had run its course or, to use
our own phrase again, when things and souls were ripe. The breakdown he
thought of was to be a breakdown of the economic engine of capitalism from
internal causes. 18 Political breakdown of the bourgeois world was to be a
mere incident to this. But now the political breakdown—or something akin
to it—had happened, and the political opportunity had occurred, while the
economic process was nowhere near maturity as yet. The “superstructure”
had moved more quickly than the propelling mechanism. It was a most un-
Marxian situation.
The student in his closet may speculate about what the course of things
would have been if the socialist parties, recognizing the state of things, had
refused the Trojan horse of office, remained in the opposition and allowed
the bourgeoisie to deal with the wreckage left by the war and by the peace.
Perhaps it would have been better for them, for socialism, for the world—
who knows? But for men who by that time had learned to identify
themselves with their nations and to take the point of view of responsibility
there was no choice. They resolutely faced what fundamentally was an
insoluble problem.
There was a social and economic system that would not function except
on capitalist lines. The socialists might control it, regulate it in the interest
of labor, squeeze it to the point of impairing its efficiency—but they were
unable to do anything specifically socialist. If they were to run it, they would
have to run it according to its logic. They would have to “administer
18 This in part explains the favor enjoyed in the United States by theories which aim at
showing that capitalism is as a matter of fact breaking down from internal causes. See ch. x.
From the First to the Second World War 365
capitalism.” And this they did. Something was done to dress up their
measures in socialist phrases, and the magnifying glass was applied, with
some success, to every difference between their policy and what the
bourgeois alternative was in each case supposed to be. In substance however
they had to do what liberals or conservatives would also have done under
the same circumstances. But, though the only possible course, 19 this was, for
the socialist parties, a most dangerous one to pursue.
Not that it was entirely hopeless or, from the standpoint of the socialist
faith, entirely incapable of defense. At the beginning of the twenties,
socialists in Europe may well have hoped that, with luck and cautious
steering, they would establish themselves in or near the centers of
political power so as to be able to avert any danger of “reaction” and to
buttress the position of the proletariat until the day when it would be
possible to socialize society without any violent break; they would
preside over the euthanasia of bourgeois society and at the same time
make sure that the process of dying went on all right and that the victim
would not experience a comeback. But for the presence of other factors
than those which enter the socialist’s or the labor man’s picture of
society, this hope might have come true.
Defense from the standpoint of the Faith might have been based on the
proposition stated above, viz., that the situation was a novel one and had not
been foreseen by Marx. The bourgeois victim turning to the socialists for
shelter—such a case was evidently not provided for in his schema. It might
have been argued that under the circumstances even mere “administering
capitalism” was a great step in advance. Nor was it a question of
administering capitalism in the capitalist interest but of doing honest work
in the field of social reform, and of building a state that would pivot on the
workman’s interests. In any case that was the only thing to do if the
democratic road was to be chosen, for the immaturity of the situation
asserted itself precisely by the fact that there were no majorities to be had
for the socialist alternative. No wonder that the socialist parties which had
resolved to accept office under such circumstances loudly proclaimed their
allegiance to democracy!

Thus, the political hack’s craving for office was capable of justification
on the highest grounds of doctrine and proletarian interest. The reader will
have no difficulty in visualizing how such comfortable concordance must
have impressed radical critics. But since later events have induced so many
people to speak of the failure of that policy and to lecture the leaders of that
19 I do not propose to discuss, as another possibility, an attempt at fundamental
reconstruction on Russian lines. For it seems to me too obvious that any such attempt would
have speedily ended in chaos and counterrevolution.
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties366
time on what they ought to have done, I do wish to emphasize both the
rationale of their views and the compelling nature of the pattern within which
they had to act. If failure there was, its causes must be looked for elsewhere
than in stupidity or treason. In order to convince ourselves of this we need
only glance at the English and German cases.
2. As soon as the orgy of nationalist sentiment that accompanied the close
of the war subsided, a genuinely revolutionary situation developed in
England, the temper of the masses asserting itself, for instance, by political
strikes. Responsible socialists and responsible laborites were so completely
driven together by these events—and by the danger of the nation’s being
goaded into a truly reactionary mood—that they henceforth accepted a
common leadership, at least as far as parliamentary maneuvering was
concerned. The lion’s share of the combined weight went to the labor interest
and, within the labor interest, to the bureaucracy of a few big unions so that
an opposition of disgruntled intellectuals developed almost at once. These
intellectuals objected to the laborite character of the alliance and professed
themselves unable to see anything socialist about it. The ideological
opportunism of the laborites lends some color to this view but, stressing the
facts of the situation rather than slogans, we shall nevertheless equate the
whole of the political labor forces, as far as they then accepted MacDonald’s
leadership, with the Social Democratic party of Germany.
Having successfully emerged from that revolutionary situation the party
steadily improved its position until MacDonald came into office in 1924. He
and his men made so creditable a showing that even malcontent intellectuals
were temporarily subdued. In matters of foreign and colonial policy, this
government was able to strike a note of its own—particularly with respect
to Russia. In domestic affairs, this was less easy to do, mainly because fiscal
radicalism had been (and continued to be) carried, quite as far as was
possible under the circumstances, by conservative governments dependent
upon a share in the labor vote. But while in legislation the labor government
did not go beyond comparative details, it proved itself qualified to administer
the nation’s affairs. Snowden’s excellent performance in the office of
chancellor of the exchequer would have sufficed to show to the nation and
to the world that labor was fit to govern. And this was in itself a service to
the cause of socialism. 20
Of course that success was greatly facilitated and any other kind of
success was rendered more difficult or even impossible by the fact that the
labor government was in a minority and had to rely not only on the
cooperation of the liberals—with whom they had much in common, for
20 Moreover, from the standpoint of party tactics, it made things much more difficult for
the conservatives than headstrong radicalism would have done.
From the First to the Second World War 367
instance their free-trade views—but also, to some extent, on the tolerance
of the conservatives. They were in much the same situation as the
conservatives were during their short spells of office in the 1850’s and
1860’s. It would not have been so easy for them to take a responsible attitude
if they had had a majority. But, as stated above, the very fact that they had
not should have proved even to a Marxist tribunal that the time had not yet
come for a stronger course of action—at all events, on any plan that would
answer democratic requirements.
The rank and file however did not appreciate all this. Still less did the
masses realize that they owed to the labor party not only what that party itself
accomplished but also part of what was being done for them by its
conservative competitor for the labor vote. They missed spectacular proposals
of reconstruction and promises of immediate benefits, and did not know how
unfair they were when they naïvely asked: “Why don’t the socialists do
something for us now they are in power?” The intellectuals who did not relish
being sidetracked naturally availed themselves of the opportunity afforded by
this mood in order to attack the sway of the laborites over the true socialists
and to work up current grievances into horrible wrongs callously neglected by
tyrannical trade-union bureaucrats. Under their influence the Independent
Labor party grew increasingly restive during the subsequent years of
opposition especially when MacDonald proved impervious to their arguments
for a more radical program.21 Thus, to many people, success looked much like
failure, and responsibility much like cowardice.
This was unavoidable however. The difficulties and dangers that are
inherent in a policy of socialist parties which involves accepting office under
conditions of “immaturity” are still better illustrated by the history of
MacDonald’s second ministry. 22 Historians have learned to do justice to the
21 That program primarily ran in terms of the socialization of banking and of certain key
industries and hence was not really on the lines of orthodox socialism. But under the
circumstances it was advertised as the genuine thing whereas MacDonald’s was styled
“reformist”—a term which according to classical usage applies equally well to the I.L.P.
program.
22 Readers may miss a comment on the general strike of 1926. Though it was to the interest
of both parties to the contest to minimize its symptomatic importance and though the official
theories of it have been shaped accordingly, it was much more than a series of tactical errors
issuing in a situation in which the trade-union congress had to “bluff” and the conservative
government had to “call the bluff.” We need only ask ourselves what the consequences of a
success would have been, for the authority of government and for democracy, in order to realize
that the strike was an historical event of the first order of importance. If that weapon had proved
effective, the trade unions would have become absolute masters of England and no other
political, judicial or economic power could have continued to exist beside them except on
sufferance. And in this position they could not have remained what they were. However
reluctantly, the leaders would have had to use the absolute power thrust upon them.
For our purpose, only two points need be noticed. First, the situation described above, in
particular the discontent that spread among the rank and file and was sedulously fostered by
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties368
statesmanship of Sir Robert Peel. 23 I trust that they will learn to do justice
to the statesmanship of MacDonald. He had the singular misfortune of
coming in at the very beginning of the world depression which, moreover,
was the immediate cause of the breakdown of the international system
embodied in the League of Nations.
Lesser men might have thought—lesser men did think, as a matter of
fact—that an opportunity had come for fundamental reconstruction. This
would have rent the nation in two and there cannot be any doubt about
what the result would have been. Short of fundamental reconstruction,
however, a policy of monetary expansion combined with less-than-
fundamental social reform—individual measures of nationalization for
instance and additional security legislation—and resort to mercantilist
policies in the field of international relations was being widely
recommended. But part of this program would undoubtedly have
intensified the depression, and the rest of it—abandonment of the gold
parity of the pound and mercantilism—meant so radical a break with the
national tradition and with the tradition of the labor party itself that the
socialists would hardly have been able to carry it, still less to make a
success of it; to carry it safely and effectively it had to be carried by
consent, that is to say, by a coalition.
So long as coalition was not possible, therefore, MacDonald and his men
applied themselves to the task of working the system as they found it. This,
under such conditions, was the most difficult of all the tasks they could have
undertaken. While everybody was clamoring that “something” must be done
at once, while irresponsibles of all types had the floor to themselves, while
the masses were grumbling, businessmen despairing, intellectuals ranting,
they steadily fought every inch of their ground. At home they kept order in
the finances, they supported the pound and they refrained from speeding up
the legislative machine. Abroad they strove with desperate energy—and
considerable success—to make the Geneva system work and to reduce
dangers and tensions all around. When the time had come and the national
interest seemed to warrant the party risk, they took the plunge and helped
the National Government into existence.
It is a melancholy reflection that, in many and important cases, a policy
many irresponsible elements, had much to do with the causation of the strike. Second, the strike
did not impair the power of the party-as it might have done. On the contrary, defeat seems to
have produced a radicalization of the masses which partly accounts for the party’s success in
1929.
23 The analogy extends from certain features of the political and economic situations that
confronted both men (although Peel had the advantage of entering upon office after the crisis
of 1836–1839) to matters of political detail. In both cases there was a party split, boldly risked
and eventually boldly accepted; in both cases the leaders were felt to be “traitors.”
From the First to the Second World War 369
is bound to be the more unpopular with the public and with the intellectual
critic the wiser it is. This is a case in point. To the radical critic who failed
to link up that policy with the comparative mildness of the depression in
England and with the steadiness of the subsequent recovery, there was
nothing in it except weakness, incompetence, hidebound traditionalism, if
not traitorous abandonment of the socialist cause. What probably was one
of the best performances in the history of democratic politics and one of
the best examples of action responsibly decided on from a correct
perception of an economic and social situation, the critic looked upon with
“shame and disgust.” At best he considered MacDonald simply as a bad
jockey who had brought the horse to its knees. But the hypothesis that
appealed to him most was that the MacDonald government yielded to the
diabolical whisperings (or worse) of English bankers or to the pressure of
their American backers.
Unfortunately, such nonsense is a factor of real importance and must
be taken account of in any attempt at prognosis. It may seriously interfere
with the ability of socialist parties to serve the cause of civilization
during the transitional age in which we live. But if we discard this
element and also the truism that any party which makes a sacrifice in the
national interest will suffer for it in the short run, we shall have little
difficulty in recognizing that in the long run the labor influence may well
turn out to have been strengthened by MacDonald’s second tenure of
office. Again the analogy with Sir Robert Peel’s second ministry will help
to illustrate this. Peel’s conservative majority split on the issue of the
repeal of the corn laws. The Peelite wing, though much more numerous
and important than MacDonald’s personal following, soon disintegrated.
The conservative party was maimed and proved unable to get into
power—though it got three times into office—until Disraeli’s great
victory in 1873. But after that and until Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman’s victory in 1905, it held power for about two-thirds of the
time. More important than this, the English aristocracy and gentry,
politically speaking, held their own all the time much better than they
would have done if the stigma of dear bread had not been removed.
As a matter of fact, the labor party quickly recovered and consolidated
its position in the country during the years that followed upon the split.
It is safe to say that even in the normal course of things—irrespective of
the war, that is—the socialists would have again come into office before
long, with increased power and better chances of success, and that they
would have been able to take a stronger line than they had taken
previously. But it is equally safe to say that both as to their program and
as to their ability to give effect to it, their policy would have differed only
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties370
in degree from the MacDonald policy—principally by some individual
measures of socialization.
3. The postwar career of the German Social Democratic party of course
differs from that of the English labor party in many particulars. But as soon
as the German socialists who stayed in the Social Democratic party had
accepted office and made up their minds to fight communism they were just
as much committed to “administer capitalism” as were their English
colleagues. If we grant these premises and take account of the fact that they
did not have, and could not expect to have in the calculable future, a majority
either in the federal parliament or in the Prussian diet or in the population,
everything else follows with inexorable logic. In 1925 the total population was
about 62 millions. The proletariat (laborers and their families; I include the
domestic servants) numbered not quite 28 millions and part of the vote of this
class went to other parties. The “independent” population was not much
smaller—about 24 millions—and largely impervious to the socialist
persuasion. Even if we exclude an upper stratum—say one million—and
confine ourselves to the groups that count at the polls—the peasants, artisans,
retailers—there was not much to be conquered there, not only for the moment
but even for the near future. Between these two groups there were the white-
collar employees, no less than 10 millions of them including their families. The
Social Democratic party of course realized that this class held the key position,
and made great efforts to conquer it. But in spite of considerable success, these
efforts only served to show that the white collar is a much more serious barrier
than it should be according to the Marxian theory of social classes.24
Thus, even if the communists had been the allies of the Social Democrats
instead of being their bitterest enemies, the party would still have been in
the minority. It is true that the non-socialist majority was not actively hostile
in all its sections: the left-wing liberals (the Democratic People’s party),
stronger in talent than in numbers, were always ready for cooperation (up
to a point). It is also true that this majority was split up into many groups
which were quite incapable of acting in unison and whose members and
supporters were not anything like as disciplined as were the Social
Democrats themselves. But sensible people who were neither able nor
24 When confronted with this fact socialists usually derive comfort from the arguments
that non-socialist employees are just erring sheep who have not yet found their true political
location but who are sure to find it eventually, or that they are prevented from joining the
party by the ruthless pressure exerted by their employers. The first argument will not carry
conviction to anyone beyond the Marxian fold—we have seen that the theory of social classes
is one of the weakest links in the Marxian chain. The second argument is false as a matter
of plain fact. Whatever truth it may have contained at other times, the German employers of
the twenties were, save exceptions without quantitative importance, in no position to influence
the vote of their employees.
From the First to the Second World War 371
willing to embark upon hazardous courses would nevertheless feel that there
was for them but one line to take—the line of democracy—and that this line
spelled coalition.
The party that best qualified for the role of an ally was the Catholic party
(the Center). It was powerful. Before the advent of Hitler it seemed that
nothing could shake the loyalty of its supporters. Its organization was
excellent. Provided the interests of the church were safeguarded, it was
prepared to go nearly as far in social reform of the immediately practical
kind as were the socialists themselves, in some respects even further. Not
harboring any particularly fervent feelings for the displaced dynasties, it
stood squarely behind the Weimar constitution. Last but not least, it
welcomed spoils-sharing arrangements that would guarantee its preserves.
Thus understanding came about with what to the foreign observer might
seem surprising ease. The socialists treated the Catholic Church with the
utmost deference and tact. They made no difficulties about a concordat with
the pope that gave the clergy more than it ever had had under the heretic
Hohenzollerns. As to policies, there were hardly any dissensions at all.
But although this alliance was fundamental, no party that professed
allegiance to the Weimar constitution was excluded from office. Democrats,
National Liberals, Nationals (=Conservatives) were all of them admitted,
even to positions of high command. Coalition as a universal principle meant
compromise as a universal principle. The necessary concessions as to
measures were in fact readily made. The army was left alone, practically
under management of its own choosing, and adequately provided with
means. Eastern Prussia was subsidized and agriculture in general was the
object of solicitous care. Some implications of this which might not quite
tally with socialist professions were made more palatable to the proletariat
that paid the bill by calling this sort of thing Planning—perhaps the reader
feels that there is nothing new under the sun.
In its attitude toward the industrial masses and toward its own program
the Social Democratic party laborized itself. At the beginning a token
payment was made by the passing of a very moderate bill of which the most
radical feature consisted in the word Socialization that was inserted in its title
(1919). But the socialists soon shelved all this in order to apply themselves
to labor legislation of the kind made familiar to Americans by the New Deal.
This satisfied the trade unions whose bureaucracy was increasingly allowed
to form the operative section of the party’s policy-making machine.
This, so one might think, should have been difficult for a party with a
Marxian tradition that continued to prevail in the party schools. But it was not.
Except for a certain amount of communist defection, the intellectuals from
whom opposition within the party could have been expected to arise were kept
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties372
well in hand. Unlike the English party, the German one had settled down in
the administrative apparatus of the Reich, the states and the municipalities.
Moreover, it had, in its press and elsewhere, many jobs of its own to offer. This
patronage was energetically used. Obedience spelled preferment in the civil
service, in the academic career, in the numerous public enterprises and so on.
These means were effective in bringing radicals to heel.
The firm hold the Social Democrats acquired on all the parts of the
machinery of public administration not only made for stricter discipline but
also helped to increase membership and, beyond membership, the vote on
which the party was able to count. Of course it also increased its power in
other ways. For instance, the socialists secured dominant power in the
Prussian Free State. This gave them control of the police force and they
were careful to choose party members or reliable careerists for police
presidents (chiefs of police) in the big towns. Thus they buttressed their
camp until their position seemed impregnable according to all ordinary
standards. And, again according to all ordinary rules of political analysis,
even an orthodox Marxist could have comforted himself by arguing that
in those trenches they could quite comfortably dwell till things in their
secular course would of themselves change minority into majority and
draw the curtains that veiled the Ultimate Goal for the time being.
Quotation from the Communist Manifesto…
Irrespective of the mechanics of the party’s power plant, the political
setup as well as the general social situation looked eminently stable.
Moreover, whatever might be urged against many individual measures,
legislative and administrative, on the whole the coalition’s policies made for
and not against stability. Much that was done must command our sincere
respect. Nothing that was done qualifies for explanation of anything worse
than the ordinary measure of discontent that every regime elicits which lacks
authority and glamour. The only possible exception to this lies in the
financial sphere. Part of the cultural and political achievements of this
governmental system was associated with large and rapidly increasing public
expenditure. Furthermore, this expenditure was financed by methods—
though a highly successful sales tax was among them—which drained the
sources of accumulation. So long as the inflow of foreign capital continued,
all went comparatively well, although budgetary and even cash difficulties
began to appear more than a year before it ceased. When it did cease, that
well-known situation emerged which would have undermined the position
of the most magnetic of leaders. All in all, however, the socialist critics of
the party and its conduct during this spell of power will be entitled to boast
of no mean achievement if, in case they were ever installed in office, they
should do equally well
From the First to the Second World War 373
V. T HE P RESENT W AR A ND T HE F UTURE O F S OCIALIST P ARTIES
How the present war will affect the fortunes of existing socialist groups of
course depends on its duration and outcome. For our purpose, I do not see
any point in speculating about this. Let us however, by way of example,
consider two cases out of a great many possible ones.
Even now (July 1942) many observers seem to expect that Russia will
emerge from the war with a great access of power and prestige, in fact that
Stalin will emerge as the true victor. If this should be so, it does not
necessarily follow that a communist world revolution will be the
consequence or even that there will be “Russification” of continental Europe
accompanied by an extermination of the upper strata and a settlement of
accounts with non-communist socialist (and Trotskyite) groups. For even
barring a possible Anglo-American resistance to the expansion of Russian
power, it is not certain that the self-interest of Russian autocracy will lie in
that direction. But it is certain that the chances for such a consummation—
realization of the full Lenin program—would be immeasurably increased.
However this world revolution might differ from the Marxian idea, it would
for those who are willing to accept it as a substitute doubtless cease to be a
daydream. And not only as regards Europe.
In that case the fate of orthodox socialism and all it stands for would
be sealed. And so it would be, on the continent of Europe, in case the
fascist powers hold their own. If however we again assume complete
victory of the Anglo-American-Russian alliance—that is to say, a victory
that enforces unconditional surrender but with all the honors held by
England and the United States—then we see readily that orthodox
socialism of the German Social Democratic or of a still more laborite type
stands a much better chance to survive on the continent of Europe, at all
events for some time. One reason for believing this is that people, if they
find both the bolshevist and the fascist routes barred, may well turn to the
Social Democratic republic as the most obvious of the remaining choices.
But there is a much more important reason: laborite socialism will enjoy
the favor of the victors. For the consequence of so complete a victory as
we now envisage will be Anglo-American management of the affairs of the
world—a kind of Anglo-American rule which, from the ideas we see taking
shape under our eyes, may be termed Ethical Imperialism. A world order
of this kind in which the interests and ambitions of other nations would
count only as far as understood and approved by England and the United
States can be established only by military force and upheld only by
permanent readiness to use military force. It is perhaps unnecessary to
explain why, in the political and economic conditions of our time, this
A Historical Sketch of Socialist Parties374
would mean for these two countries a social organization that is best
described as Militarist Socialism. But it is clear that the task of controlling
and policing the world would be much facilitated, on the one hand, by the
re-creation and new creation of small and inefficient states in Europe and,
on the other hand, by installing governments of the laborite or Social
Democratic types. Especially in Germany and Italy, the debris of the Social
Democratic parties would constitute the only political material from which
to construct governments which could possibly accept this world order for
longer than a period of prostration and cooperate with the agents of the
world protectorate without mental reservations. Whatever it may be worth,
this is the chance of Liberal Socialism.
From the standpoint of the subject of this book however (though from no
other) all this is of secondary importance. Whatever the fate of particular
socialist groups, there cannot be any doubt that the present conflagration
will—inevitably, everywhere, and independently of the outcome of the war—
mean another great stride toward the socialist order. An appeal to our
experience of the effects of the First World War on the social fabric of
Europe suffices to establish this prognosis. This time however the stride will
be taken also in the United States.
But that experience, though a valuable guide, is an inadequate one. A
quarter of a century has elapsed. This is no negligible span even as regards
the secular forces that make for socialism in the sense explained in Part II.
Independently of everything else we shall be confronted at the end of this war
with an economic situation, a social atmosphere, a distribution of political
power substantially different from those of 1918. Much however has happened
during these twentyfive years that could not have been predicted from secular
tendencies alone. Among other things there was the great depression which,
impinging upon a delicate situation, shook social structures to their
foundations, nowhere more than in this country. Still more effective in
undermining these structures were the policies by which that depression was
handled. And this must be attributed largely to political configurations that
were in part accidental. The consequences are obvious. In particular, huge
bureaucracies have developed that by now are powerful enough to hold their
ground and to implement policies of fundamental reconstruction.

In no country will war taxation of business and of the business class be
reduced in the proportion in which it was reduced after 1919. This may in
itself suffice to paralyze the motors of capitalism for good and thus provide
another argument for government management. 

Inflation, even if it should
go no further than is, for instance in this country, unavoidable in the present
political pattern, may well do the rest, both directly and, through the
radicalization of the expropriated holders of bonds and insurance policies, indirectly. Moreover, nowhere will war controls be liquidated to the extent the experience of the years after 1918 might lead us to believe. They will
be put to other uses. In this country steps are already being taken to prepare
public opinion for governmental management of postwar adjustments and to
put the bourgeois alternative out of court. Finally, there is no reason to
believe that governments will ever relax the hold they have gained on the
capital market and the investment process. To be sure, this does not sum up
to socialism. But socialism may, under such conditions, impose itself as the
only practicable alternative to deadlocks and incessant friction.
Details and phrases will of course differ in different countries. So will
political tactics and economic results. English developments are comparatively
easy to foresee. The labor men entered the Churchill government in response
to the call of emergency. But, as has been pointed out before, they were then
well advanced on the road to office and power irrespective of any emergency.
Therefore they will quite naturally be in a position to manage postwar
reconstruction alone or—which may prove to be the most effective method—
in a coalition they would control. The war economy will have realized some
of their immediate aims. To a considerable extent they will only have to keep
what they have got already. Further advance toward the socialist goal can be
expected to be relatively easy in conditions in which there is not much left
for capitalists to fight for. And it may prove possible to be quite frank about
it and to carry out socialization soberly, in an orderly way, and largely by
consent. For many reasons, but principally because of the weakness of the
official socialist party, prognosis is less easy in the case of this country. But
ultimate results are not likely to be different, though slogans are almost sure
to be—and costs in terms of both welfare and cultural values.
Once more: it is only socialism in the sense defined in this book that is
so predictable. Nothing else is. In particular there is little reason to believe
that this socialism will mean the advent of the civilization of which orthodox
socialists dream. It is much more likely to present fascist features. That
would be a strange answer to Marx’s prayer. But history sometimes indulges
in jokes of questionable taste.
