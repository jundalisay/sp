## 1. The “Gran Rifiuto”

<!-- AS MEMBERS of their international organization, the socialist parties
had done all they could to avert the war. But when nevertheless it broke
out, they rallied to their national causes with a readiness that was truly
astounding.  -->

During the war, the German Marxists hesitated even less than the English
laborites. 1 

Every belligerent nation
was fully convinced that it was waging a purely defensive war—every war
is defensive or at least “preventive” in the eyes of the nations that wage it. 2
Still, if we reflect that the socialist parties had an indubitable constitutional
right to vote against war budgets and that within the general moral schema
of bourgeois democracy there is no obligation to identify oneself with
national policy—men far removed from socialist anti-militarism in fact
disapproved of the war in all the belligerent countries—we seem to face a
problem that is not solved by doubtful references to Marx or to previous
declarations by Bebel and von Vollmar that they would defend their country
if attacked. There should have been no difficulty in recalling Marx’s true
teaching on the subject. Moreover, defending one’s country means only
doing one’s duty with the army; it does not imply voting with the
government and entering into unions sacrées.3 Guesde and Sembat in France
and Vandervelde in Belgium who took office in war cabinets, and the
German socialists who voted the war budgets, thus did more than loyalty to
their nations required, as then commonly understood. 4



<!-- 1 The English Labour party was in fact alone in making a serious stand for peace in 1914,
though it joined the war coalition later on.
2 This is why the attempt made by the victors to decide the moral issue by means of a clause
in an imposed peace treaty was not only so unfair but also so foolish.
3 Nor is it true that failure to do so would have weakened the national cause. Lord Morley’s
resignation clearly did not injure England.

4 Many of us will think differently at present. But this merely shows how far we have
traveled from the old moorings of liberal democracy. To exalt national unity into a moral precept
spells acceptance of one of the most important principles of fascism. -->

There is but one solution to the puzzle. Whether or not the majority
of socialist politicians believed in Marxian internationalism—perhaps
this belief had by that time shared the fate of the cognate belief in a
spectacular revolution—they certainly realized that any stand taken
upon the gospel would have cost them their following. The masses
would have first stared at them and then they would have renounced
allegiance, thereby refuting via facti the Marxian doctrine that the
proletarian has no country and that class war is the only war that
concerns him. In this sense, and with a proviso to the effect that things
might have been different if the war had impinged after a longer spell
of evolution within the bourgeois framework, a vital pillar of the
Marxian structure broke in August 1914. 5

This was in fact widely felt. It was felt in the conservative camp: German
conservatives suddenly began to refer to the socialist party in language that
was the pink of courtesy. It was felt in that part of the socialist camp in
which the faith still retained its old ardor. Even in England MacDonald lost
the leadership of the labor party and eventually his seat rather than join the
war coalition. In Germany, Kautsky and Haase left the majority (March
1916) and in 1917 organized the Independent Social Democratic party,
though most of its important members returned to the fold in 1919. 6 Lenin
declared that the Second International was dead and that the cause of
socialism had been betrayed.

There was an element of truth in this. So far as the majorities of the
Marxist parties were concerned, socialism at the crossroads had in fact
not stood the test. It had not chosen the Marxist route. The creeds, the
slogans, the ultimate goals, the organizations, the bureaucracies, the
leaders had not changed. They remained on the morrow of the gran
rifiuto what they had been on its eve. But what they meant and stood for
had changed all the more. After that experimentum crucis neither
socialists nor anti-socialists could any longer look at those parties in the
same light as before. Nor could those parties themselves go on with their
old antics. For better and for worse they had stepped out of their ivory
tower. They had testified to the fact that the fate of their countries meant
more to them than did the socialist goal.

The case was different however with those of them who, like the Social
Democratic parties of the Scandinavian countries, never had been in any
ivory tower. And even with the others the case will look different to observers
5 To some extent this must also be attributed to the success of non-socialist reforms.
6 It is worth noting that the Independents recruited themselves by no means exclusively from
the uncompromising Marxists. Kautsky and Haase belonged to that sector, but many who joined
with them did not. Bernstein, for instance, joined and so did several other revisionists whose
motive cannot have been respect for the Marxian faith. But there is nothing to wonder at in
this. Orthodox Marxism was of course not the only reason a socialist might have had for
disapproving the course taken by the majority. These revisionists simply shared Ramsay
MacDonald’s persuasion.

who never took those revolutionary antics seriously. As regards the German
party in particular, it may well be nearer the truth to say that the “social
traitors”—as they were dubbed—simply came down from unrealistic clouds
and that the national emergency taught them to stand on their feet instead
of on their heads—which, so some of us will add, was all to their credit and
no rifiuto at all. But whichever view we take, there cannot be any doubt that
the new attitude of responsibility drastically shortened the long stretch that
before 1914 seemed to lie between them and the natural goal of every
party—office. I am far indeed from attributing to German Social Democrats
any calculations of this kind or from doubting the sincerity of their decision
not to take office in bourgeois society. But it is obvious that, as a result of
the stand they took at the beginning of the war, they were—if I may say so—
“sitting pretty” at the end of it. Unlike the other parties, they had not
compromised themselves by running along in full cry. But neither had they
deserted their nation in the hour of danger.
