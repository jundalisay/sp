<!-- PART IV
Socialism and Democracy -->


I. The Dictatorship of the Proletariat

NOTHING is so treacherous as the obvious. Events during the past twenty
or twenty-five years have taught us to see the problem that lurks behind
the title of this part. Until about 1916 the relation between socialism and
democracy would have seemed quite obvious to most people and to nobody
more so than to the accredited exponents of socialist orthodoxy. 

It would
hardly have occurred to anyone to dispute the socialists’ claim to membership
in the democratic club. Socialists themselves of course—except a few
syndicalist groups—even claimed to be the only true democrats, the exclusive
sellers of the genuine stuff, never to be confused with the bourgeois fake.
Not only was it natural for them to try to enhance the values of their
socialism by the values of democracy; but they had also a theory to offer that
proved to their satisfaction that the two were indissolubly wedded. 

According
to this theory, private control over the means of production is at the bottom
both of the ability of the capitalist class to exploit labor and of its ability to
impose the dictates of its class interest upon the management of the political
affairs of the community; the political power of the capitalist class thus appears
to be but a particular form of its economic power. The inferences are, on the
one hand, that there cannot be democracy so long as that power exists—that
mere political democracy is of necessity a sham—and, on the other hand, that
the elimination of that power will at the same time end the “exploitation of
man by man” and bring about the “rule of the people.”

This argument is essentially Marxian of course. Precisely because it
follows logically—tautologically in fact—from the definitions of terms in the
Marxian schema, it will have to share the fate of the latter and in particular
the fate of the doctrine of “exploitation of man by man.” 1 What seems to
me a more realistic analysis of the relation between socialist groups and the
democratic creed will presently be offered. 

But we also want a more realistic
theory of the relation that may exist between socialism and democracy
themselves, that is to say, of the relation that may exist, independently of wishes and slogans, between the socialist order as we have defined it and
the modus operandi of democratic government. In order to solve this
problem we must first inquire into the nature of democracy. Another point
however calls for immediate clarification.

<!-- 1 The fact that individual and group-wise power cannot be defined in purely economic
terms—as Marx’s theory of social classes defines it—is however a still more fundamental
reason why this argument is inacceptable. -->

Socialism in being might be the very ideal of democracy. But socialists are
not always so particular about the way in which it is to be brought into being.
The words Revolution and Dictatorship stare us in the face from sacred texts,
and many modern socialists have still more explicitly testified to the fact that
they have no objection to forcing the gates of the socialist paradise by violence
and terror which are to lend their aid to more democratic means of conversion.
Marx’s own position concerning this matter is no doubt capable of an
interpretation that will clear him in the eyes of democrats. 

In Part I it was
shown how his views on revolution and evolution may be reconciled.
Revolution need not mean an attempt by a minority to impose its will upon a
recalcitrant people; it may mean no more than the removal of obstructions
opposed to the will of the people by outworn institutions controlled by groups
interested in their preservation. The dictatorship of the proletariat will bear a
similar interpretation. In support, I may again point to the wording of the
relevant passages in the Communist Manifesto where Marx talks about
wresting things from the bourgeoisie “by degrees” and about the disappearance
of class distinctions “in the course of development”—phrases which, the
emphasis on “force” notwithstanding, seem to point toward a procedure that
might come within the meaning of democracy as ordinarily understood.2
But the grounds for this interpretation, which all but reduces the famous
social revolution and the no less famous dictatorship to agitatorial flourishes
intended to fire the imagination, are not quite conclusive. Many socialists
who were, and many others who declared themselves to be, disciples of
Marx were of a different opinion. Yielding to the authority of the true scribes
and pharisees who should know the Law better than I do, and to an
impression based upon perusal of the volumes of the Neuc Zeit, I must admit
the possibility that, if he had had to choose, Marx might have put socialism
above the observance of democratic procedure.

In that case he would no doubt have declared, as so many have done after
him, that he was not really deviating from the truly democratic path because
in order to bring true democracy to life it is necessary to remove the
poisonous fumes of capitalism that asphyxiate it. Now for the believer in
democracy, the importance of observing democratic procedure obviously
increases in proportion to the importance of the point at issue. 



<!-- 2 In ch. xxv I shall return to the question of how the problem of democracy presented itself
to Marx personally. -->

Hence its
observance never needs to be more jealously watched and more carefully safeguarded by all available guarantees than in the case of fundamental social
reconstruction. Whoever is prepared to relax this requirement and to accept
either frankly undemocratic procedure or some method of securing formally
democratic decision by undemocratic means, thereby proves conclusively
that he values other things more highly than he values democracy. The
thoroughgoing democrat will consider any such reconstruction as vitiated in
its roots, however much he might approve of it on other grounds. To try to
force the people to embrace something that is believed to be good and
glorious but which they do not actually want—even though they may be
expected to like it when they experience its results—is the very hall mark
of anti-democratic belief. It is up to the casuist to decide whether an
exception may be made for undemocratic acts that are perpetrated for the
sole purpose of realizing true democracy, provided they are the only means
of doing so. For this, even if granted, does not apply to the case of socialism
which, as we have seen, is likely to become democratically possible precisely
when it can be expected to be practically successful.

In any case however it is obvious that any argument in favor of shelving
democracy for the transitional period affords an excellent opportunity to
evade all responsibility for it. Such provisional arrangements may well last
for a century or more and means are available for a ruling group installed
by a victorious revolution to prolong them indefinitely or to adopt the forms
of democracy without the substance.
