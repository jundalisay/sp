Definiteness and rationality in thought and action 11 are not guaranteed by this familiarity with men and things or by that sense of reality or responsibility. 

Quite a few other conditions which often fail to be fulfilled would be necessary for that. For instance, generation after generation may suffer from irrational behavior in matters of hygiene and yet fail to link their sufferings with
their noxious habits. 

As long as this is not done, objective consequences, however
regular, of course do not produce subjective experience. Thus it proved
unbelievably hard for humanity to realize the relation between infection and
epidemics: the facts pointed to it with what to us seems unmistakable clearness;

Yet to the end of the eighteenth century doctors did next to nothing to keep
people afflicted with infectious disease, such as measles or smallpox, from
mixing with other people. And things must be expected to be still worse
whenever there is not only inability but reluctance to recognize causal relations
or when some interest fights against recognizing them.

Nevertheless and in spite of all the qualifications that impose themselves,
there is for everyone, within a much wider horizon, a narrower field—widely
differing in extent as between different groups and individuals and bounded
by a broad zone rather than a sharp line—which is distinguished by a sense
of reality or familiarity or responsibility. 

This field harbors relatively
definite individual volitions. These may often strike us as unintelligent,
narrow, egotistical; and it may not be obvious to everyone why, when it
comes to political decisions, we should worship at their shrine, still less why
we should feel bound to count each of them for one and none of them for
more than one. If, however, we do choose to worship we shall at least not
find the shrine empty. 12

<!-- 11 Rationality of thought and rationality of action are two different things. Rationality
of thought does not always guarantee rationality of action. And the latter may be present
without any conscious deliberation and irrespective of any ability to formulate the rationale
of one’s action correctly. The observer, particularly the observer who uses interview and
questionnaire methods, often overlooks this and hence acquires an exaggerated idea of the
importance of irrationality in behavior. This is another source of those overstatements which
we meet so often.
12 It should be observed that in speaking of definite and genuine volitions I do not mean to
exalt them into ultimate data for all kinds of social analysis. Of course they are themselves
the product of the social process and the social environment. All I mean is that they may serve
as data for the kind of special-purpose analysis which the economist has in mind when he
derives prices from tastes or wants that are “given” at any moment and need not be further
analyzed each time. Similarly we may for our purpose speak of genuine and definite volitions
that at any moment are given independently of attempts to manufacture them, although we -->

This comparative definiteness of volition and rationality of behavior
does not suddenly vanish as we move away from those concerns of daily life
in the home and in business which educate and discipline as. In the realm
of public affairs there are sectors that are more within the reach of the
citizen’s mind than others. This is true, first, of local affairs. Even there we
find a reduced power of discerning facts, a reduced preparedness to act upon
them, a reduced sense of responsibility. 

We all know the man—and a very
good specimen he frequently is—who says that the local administration is
not his business and callously shrugs his shoulders at practices which he
would rather die than suffer in his own office. High-minded citizens in a
hortatory mood who preach the responsibility of the individual voter or
taxpayer invariably discover the fact that this voter does not feel responsible
for what the local politicians do. Still, especially in communities not too big
for personal contacts, local patriotism may be a very important factor in
“making democracy work.” Also, the problems of a town are in many
respects akin to the problems of a manufacturing concern. The man who
understands the latter also understands, to some extent, the former. The
manufacturer, grocer or workman need not step out of his world to have a
rationally defensible view (that may of course be right or wrong) on street
cleaning or town halls.

Second, there are many national issues that concern individuals and groups
so directly and unmistakably as to evoke volitions that are genuine and definite
enough. The most important instance is afforded by issues involving immediate
and personal pecuniary profit to individual voters and groups of voters, such
as direct payments, protective duties, silver policies and so on. Experience that
goes back to antiquity shows that by and large voters react promptly and
rationally to any such chance. But the classical doctrine of democracy
evidently stands to gain little from displays of rationality of this kind. Voters
thereby prove themselves bad and indeed corrupt judges of such issues, 13 and
often they even prove themselves bad judges of their own long-run interests,
recognize that these genuine volitions themselves are the result of environmental influences in
the past, propagandist influences included. This distinction between genuine and manufactured
will (see below) is a difficult one and cannot be applied in all cases and for all purposes. For
our purpose however it is sufficient to point to the obvious common-sense case which can be
made for it.

<!-- 13 The reason why the Benthamites so completely overlooked this is that they did not
consider the possibilities of mass corruption in modern capitalism. Committing in their political
theory the same error which they committed in their economic theory, they felt no compunction
about postulating that “the people” were the best judges of their own individual interests and
that these must necessarily coincide with the interests of all the people taken together. Of course
this was made easier for them because actually though not intentionally they philosophized in
terms of bourgeois interests which had more to gain from a parsimonious state than from any
direct bribes. -->

for it is only the short-run promise that tells politically and only short-run
rationality that asserts itself effectively.


However, when we move still farther away from the private concerns of
the family and the business office into those regions of national and
international affairs that lack a direct and unmistakable link with those
private concerns, individual volition, command of facts and method of
inference soon cease to fulfill the requirements of the classical doctrine.
What strikes me most of all and seems to me to be the core of the trouble is
the fact that the sense of reality 14 is so completely lost. Normally, the great
political questions take their place in the psychic economy of the typical
citizen with those leisure-hour interests that have not attained the rank of
hobbies, and with the subjects of irresponsible conversation. These things
seem so far off; they are not at all like a business proposition; dangers may
not materialize at all and if they should they may not prove so very serious;
one feels oneself to be moving in a fictitious world.

This reduced sense of reality accounts not only for a reduced sense of
responsibility but also for the absence of effective volition. One has one’s
phrases, of course, and one’s wishes and daydreams and grumbles:
especially, one has one’s likes and dislikes. But ordinarily they do not
amount to what we call a will—the psychic counterpart of purposeful
responsible action. In fact, for the private citizen musing over national affairs
there is no scope for such a will and no task at which it could develop. He
is a member of an unworkable committee, the committee of the whole
nation, and this is why he expends less disciplined effort on mastering a
political problem than he expends on a game of bridge. 15

The reduced sense of responsibility and the absence of effective volition
in turn explain the ordinary citizen’s ignorance and lack of judgment in
matters of domestic and foreign policy which are if anything more shocking
in the case of educated people and of people who are successfully active in
non-political walks of life than it is with uneducated people in humble
stations. Information is plentiful and readily available. But this does not seem
to make any difference. Nor should we wonder at it. We need only compare
a lawyer’s attitude to his brief and the same lawyer’s attitude to the

<!-- 14 William James’ “pungent sense of reality.” The relevance of this point has been
particularly emphasized by Graham Wallas.

15 It will help to clarify the point if we ask ourselves why so much more intelligence and
clear-headedness show up at a bridge table than in, say, political discussion among non-
politicians. At the bridge table we have a definite task; we have rules that discipline us;
success and failure are clearly defined; and we are prevented from behaving irresponsibly
because every mistake we make will not only immediately tell but also be immediately
allocated to us. These conditions, by their failure to be fulfilled for the political behavior of
the ordinary citizen, show why it is that in politics he lacks all the alertness and the judgment
he may display in his profession. -->

statements of political fact presented in his newspaper in order to see what
is the matter. In the one case the lawyer has qualified for appreciating the
relevance of his facts by years of purposeful labor done under the definite
stimulus of interest in his professional competence; and under a stimulus that
is no less powerful he then bends his acquirements, his intellect, his will to
the contents of the brief. In the other case, he has not taken the trouble to
qualify; he does not care to absorb the information or to apply to it the
canons of criticism he knows so well how to handle; and he is impatient of
long or complicated argument. 

All of this goes to show that without the
initiative that comes from immediate responsibility, ignorance will persist in
the face of masses of information however complete and correct. It persists
even in the face of the meritorious efforts that are being made to go beyond
presenting information and to teach the use of it by means of lectures,
classes, discussion groups. Results are not zero. But they are small. People
cannot be carried up the ladder.

Thus the typical citizen drops down to a lower level of mental performance
as soon as he enters the political field. He argues and analyzes in a way which
he would readily recognize as infantile within the sphere of his real interests.
He becomes a primitive again. His thinking becomes associative and
affective. 16 And this entails two further consequences of ominous significance.
First, even if there were no political groups trying to influence him, the
typical citizen would in political matters tend to yield to extrarational or
irrational prejudice and impulse. The weakness of the rational processes he
applies to politics and the absence of effective logical control over the results
he arrives at would in themselves suffice to account for that. Moreover,
simply because he is not “all there,” he will relax his usual moral standards
as well and occasionally give in to dark urges which the conditions of private
life help him to repress. But as to the wisdom or rationality of his inferences
and conclusions, it may be just as bad if he gives in to a burst of generous
indignation. This will make it still more difficult for him to see things in their
correct proportions or even to see more than one aspect of one thing at a
time. Hence, if for once he does emerge from his usual vagueness and does
display the definite will postulated by the classical doctrine of democracy,
he is as likely as not to become still more unintelligent and irresponsible than
he usually is. At certain junctures, this may prove fatal to his nation. 17

<!-- 16 See ch. xii.
17 The importance of such bursts cannot be doubted. But it is possible to doubt their
genuineness. Analysis will show in many instances that they are induced by the action of some
group and do not spontaneously arise from the people. In this case they enter into a (second)
class of phenomena which we are about to deal with. Personally, I do believe that genuine
instances exist. But I cannot be sure that more thorough analysis would not reveal some psycho-
technical effort at the bottom of them. -->

Second, however, the weaker the logical element in the processes of the
public mind and the more complete the absence of rational criticism and of
the rationalizing influence of personal experience and responsibility, the
greater are the opportunities for groups with an ax to grind. These groups
may consist of professional politicians or of exponents of an economic
interest or of idealists of one kind or another or of people simply interested
in staging and managing political shows. The sociology of such groups is
immaterial to the argument in hand. The only point that matters here is that,
Human Nature in Politics being what it is, they are able to fashion and,
within very wide limits, even to create the will of the people. What we are
confronted with in the analysis of political processes is largely not a genuine
but a manufactured will. And often this artefact is all that in reality
corresponds to the volonté générale of the classical doctrine. So far as this
is so, the will of the people is the product and not the motive power of the
political process.

The ways in which issues and the popular will on any issue are being
manufactured is exactly analogous to the ways of commercial advertising.
We find the same attempts to contact the subconscious. We find the same
technique of creating favorable and unfavorable associations which are the
more effective the less rational they are. We find the same evasions and
reticences and the same trick of producing opinion by reiterated assertion
that is successful precisely to the extent to which it avoids rational argument
and the danger of awakening the critical faculties of the people. And so on.
Only, all these arts have infinitely more scope in the sphere of public affairs
than they have in the sphere of private and professional life. The picture of
the prettiest girl that ever lived will in the long run prove powerless to
maintain the sales of a bad cigarette. There is no equally effective safeguard
in the case of political decisions. Many decisions of fateful importance are
of a nature that makes it impossible for the public to experiment with them
at its leisure and at moderate cost. Even if that is possible, however,
judgment is as a rule not so easy to arrive at as it is in the case of the
cigarette, because effects are less easy to interpret.

But such arts also vitiate, to an extent quite unknown in the field of
commercial advertising, those forms of political advertising that profess to
address themselves to reason. To the observer, the anti-rational or, at all
events, the extra-rational appeal and the defenselessness of the victim stand
out more and not less clearly when cloaked in facts and arguments. We have
seen above why it is so difficult to impart to the public unbiased information
about political problems and logically correct inferences from it and why it
is that information and arguments in political matters will “register” only if
they link up with the citizen’s preconceived ideas. As a rule, however, these ideas are not definite enough to determine particular conclusions. 

Since they
can themselves be manufactured, effective political argument almost
inevitably implies the attempt to twist existing volitional premises into a
particular shape and not merely the attempt to implement them or to help
the citizen to make up his mind.

Thus information and arguments that are really driven home are likely to
be the servants of political intent. Since the first thing man will do for his ideal
or interest is to lie, we shall expect, and as a matter of fact we find, that
effective information is almost always adulterated or selective 18 and that
effective reasoning in politics consists mainly in trying to exalt certain
propositions into axioms and to put others out of court; it thus reduces to the
psycho-technics mentioned before. The reader who thinks me unduly
pessimistic need only ask himself whether he has never heard—or said
himself—that this or that awkward fact must not be told publicly, or that a
certain line of reasoning, though valid, is undesirable. 

If men who according
to any current standard are perfectly honorable or even high-minded reconcile
themselves to the implications of this, do they not thereby show what they
think about the merits or even the existence of the will of the people?
There are of course limits to all this. 19 And there is truth in Jefferson’s
dictum that in the end the people are wiser than any single individual can
be, or in Lincoln’s about the impossibility of “fooling all the people all the
time.” But both dicta stress the long-run aspect in a highly significant way.
It is no doubt possible to argue that given time the collective psyche will
evolve opinions that not infrequently strike us as highly reasonable and even
shrewd. History however consists of a succession of short-run situations that
may alter the course of events for good. 

If all the people can in the short
run be “fooled” step by step into something they do not really want, and if
this is not an exceptional case which we could afford to neglect, then no
amount of retrospective common sense will alter the fact that in reality they
neither raise nor decide issues but that the issues that shape their fate are
normally raised and decided for them. More than anyone else the lover of
democracy has every reason to accept this fact and to clear his creed from
the aspersion that it rests upon make-believe.
