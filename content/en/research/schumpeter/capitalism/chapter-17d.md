As a matter of blueprint logic, the socialist blueprint is drawn at a higher level of rationality. 

This, I
believe, is the correct way of putting the matter. It is not a case of rationality
versus irrationality. The farmer whose reaction to hog and fodder prices
produces the hog cycle is, individually and from the standpoint of the
moment, acting perfectly rationally. So is the management of a concern that
maneuvers in an oligopolistic situation. So is the firm that expands in the
boom and restricts in recession. It is the kind and scope of rationality that
makes the difference.

This is certainly not all that can be adduced on behalf of the socialist
plan. But so far as the pure logic of a socialist economy is concerned,
most arguments that are not provably wrong are in fact implied in the
one submitted.

An example of the first importance is afforded by unemployment. We
have seen in Part II that, as regards the interest of the unemployed
themselves, capitalist society in any stage sufficiently advanced to offer a
chance for successful socialization need and presumably will not leave very
much to be desired. But concerning the loss to society the preceding
argument implies that in a socialist society unemployment will be less,
mainly in consequence of the elimination of depressions, and that where it
does occur, mainly in consequence of technological improvement, the
ministry of production will be in a position—whatever it may actually do—
to redirect the men to other employments which, if the planning lives up to its possibilities at all, might in each case be waiting for them.
A minor advantage that is also implied in the superior rationality of the
socialist plan results from the fact that in the capitalist order improvements
occur as a rule in individual concerns and take time and meet resistance in
spreading. If the pace of progress is rapid, there is often a large number of
firms that cling to old methods or are otherwise of substandard efficiency.
In the socialist order every improvement could theoretically be spread by
decree and substandard practice could be promptly eliminated. 

I call this a
minor advantage because capitalism as a rule also deals pretty efficiently with the inefficient. Of course, the likelihood of this particular advantage,
whether great or small, being realized by a bureaucracy is another matter; a
decent bureaucracy may always be relied on to bring all its members up to
its standard, but this says nothing about what this standard itself will be. That
possible superiorities might in practice turn into actual inferiorities must be
kept in mind throughout.

Again, managers or owner-managers of small or medium-sized concerns
are as a rule primarily either engineers or salesmen or organizers and, even
if good men, rarely do all things equally well. We often find that even
successful businesses are indifferently managed in some respect or other—
witness the reports of efficiency experts—and their leaders are therefore
partially misplaced. The socialist economy could, as modern largest-scale
business does, use them to fuller advantage by using them exclusively in
what they really know how to do. But obvious considerations that need not
detain us will not allow us to entertain high hopes on that score.
There is however an advantage of prime importance that is not visible in
our blueprint as drawn. The outstanding feature of commercial society is the
division between the private and the public sphere—or, if you prefer, the fact
that in commercial society there is a private sphere which contains so much
more than either feudal or socialist society allocates to it. This private sphere
is distinct from the public sphere not only conceptually but also actually. The
two are to a great extent manned by different people—the history of local
self-government offering the most conspicuous exception—and organized as
well as run on different and often conflicting principles, productive of
different and often incompatible standards.
Friction can only temporarily be absent from such an arrangement the
paradoxical nature of which would be a source of wonder to us if we
were not so accustomed to it. As a matter of fact, friction was present
long before it developed into antagonism in consequence of the wars of
conquest waged upon the bourgeois domain with ever-increasing success
by the men of the public sphere. This antagonism entails struggle. Most
activities of the state in the economic field then appear in the light that
is well characterized by the old bourgeois economist’s phrase,
government interference. These activities do in fact interfere in every
sense of the word, especially in the sense that they hamper and paralyze
the private engine of production. It cannot be urged that they are
frequently successful, even in increasing productive efficiency. But as far
as they are, the central board’s activity would stand a still greater chance
of being so, whereas the costs and losses incident to the struggle as such
would be entirely avoided in the socialist case. And these losses are
considerable, especially if we count in all the worry caused by incessant

inquiries and prosecutions and the consequent discouraging effects on the
energies that propel business.
One element of these costs should be mentioned specifically. It consists
in the absorption of ability in merely protective activities. A considerable part
of the total work done by lawyers goes into the struggle of business with
the state and its organs. It is immaterial whether we call this vicious
obstruction of the common good or defense of the common good against
vicious obstruction. In any case the fact remains that in socialist society there
would be neither need nor room for this part of legal activity. The resulting
saving is not satisfactorily measured by the fees of the lawyers who are thus
engaged. That is inconsiderable. But not inconsiderable is the social loss
from such unproductive employment of many of the best brains. Considering
how terribly rare good brains are, their shifting to other employments might
be of more than infinitesimal importance.

The friction or antagonism between the private and the public sphere was
intensified from the first by the fact that, ever since the princes’ feudal
incomes ceased to be of major importance, the state has been living on a
revenue which was being produced in the private sphere for private purposes
and had to be deflected from these purposes by political force. 11 On the one
hand, taxation is an essential attribute of commercial society—or, if we
accept the conception of the state alluded to in the first chapter, of the state—
and, on the other hand, it is almost inevitably 12 in the nature of an injury to
the productive process. 

Until 1914 roughly—if we agree to consider modern
times only—that injury was confined within narrow bounds. But since then
taxes have grown, by degrees, into the dominant item of business and family
budgets and into a major factor in the explanation of unsatisfactory economic
performance. Moreover, in order to wrench ever-increasing amounts from an
unwilling organism, a huge administrative apparatus has come into existence
that does nothing but struggle with the bourgeoisie for every dollar of its
revenue. That organism has in response developed organs of defense and
does an immense amount of work in self-protection.

Nothing else brings out so well the wastes that result from the conflict
of structural principles in a social body. Modern capitalism relies on the
profit principle for its daily bread yet refuses to allow it to prevail. No such
conflict, consequently no such wastes, would exist in socialist society. 

Since it would control all sources of revenue, taxes could vanish with the state or, if my conception of the state does not command approval, with the bourgeois state. For, as a matter of common sense, it would be clearly absurd for the
central board to pay out incomes first and, after having done so, to run after
the recipients in order to recover part of them. If radicals were not so fond
of chivying the bourgeois that they cannot see anything wrong in taxes
except that they are too low, it would have been recognized before this that
here we have got hold of one of the most significant titles to superiority that
can be advanced in favor of the socialist plan.

<!-- 11 The theory which construes taxes on the analogy of club dues or of the purchase of the
services of, say, a doctor only proves how far removed this part of the social sciences is from
scientific habits of mind.

12 Exceptions exist, but they do not matter for practical purposes. -->
