Modern economists with Marxist sympathies really should know better than to say that even now
their bourgeois colleagues do not see the relation between the trend
toward protectionism and the trend toward big units of control, though
these colleagues may not always think it necessary to stress so obvious
a fact. 

Not that the classics and their successors to this day were right
about protection: their interpretation of it was, and is, as one-sided as
was the Marxian one, besides being often wrong in the appraisal of
consequences and of the interests involved. But for at least fifty years
they have known about the monopoly component in protectionism all
that Marxists ever knew, which was not difficult considering the
commonplace character of the discovery.

And they were superior to the Marxist theory in one very important
respect. Whatever the value of their economics—perhaps it was not great—
they mostly 6 stuck to it. 

In this instance, that was an advantage. 

The proposition that many protective duties owe their existence to the pressure of large concerns that desire to use them for the purpose of keeping their
prices at home above what they otherwise would be, possibly in order to be
able to sell more cheaply abroad, is a platitude but correct, although no tariff
was ever wholly or even mainly due to this particular cause. It is the Marxian
synthesis that makes it inadequate or wrong. 

If our ambition is simply to
understand all the causes and implications of modern protectionism, political,
social and economic, then it is inadequate. 

For instance, the consistent
support given by the American people to protectionist policy, whenever they
had the opportunity to speak their minds, is accounted for not by any love
for or domination by big business, but by a fervent wish to build and keep
a world of their own and to be rid of all the vicissitudes of the rest of the
world. 

<!-- 6 They did not always confine themselves to their economics. When they did not,
results were anything but encouraging. Thus, James Mill’s purely economic writings,
while not particularly valuable, cannot be simply dismissed as hopelessly substandard.
The real nonsense—and platitudinous nonsense at that—is in his articles on government
and cognate subjects. -->


Synthesis that overlooks such elements of the case is not an asset but
a liability. But if our ambition is to reduce all the causes and implications
of modern protectionism, whatever they may be, to the monopolistic element
in modern industry as the sole causa causans and if we formulate that
proposition accordingly, then it becomes wrong. Big business has been able
to take advantage of the popular sentiment and it has fostered it; but it is
absurd to say that it has created it. 

Synthesis that yields—we ought rather
to say, postulates—such a result is inferior to no synthesis at all.
Matters become infinitely worse if, flying in the face of fact plus common
sense, we exalt that theory of capital export and colonization into the
fundamental explanation of international politics which thereupon resolves
into a struggle, on the one hand, of monopolistic capitalist groups with each
other and, on the other hand, of each of them with their own proletariat. 

This
sort of thing may make useful party literature but otherwise it merely shows
that nursery tales are no monopoly of bourgeois economics. As a matter of
fact, very little influence on foreign policy has been exerted by big
business—or by the haute finance from the Fuggers to the Morgans—and
in most of the cases in which large-scale industry as such, or banking
interests as such, have been able to assert themselves, their naïve dilettantism
has resulted in discomfiture. 

The attitudes of capitalist groups toward the
policy of their nations are predominantly adaptive rather than causative,
today more than ever. Also, they hinge to an astonishing degree on short-
run considerations equally remote from any deeply laid plans and from any
definite “objective” class interests. At this point Marxism degenerates into
the formulation of popular superstitions. 7

<!-- 7 This superstition is exactly on a par with another that is harbored by many worthy and
simple-minded people who explain modern history to themselves on the hypothesis that there
is somewhere a committee of supremely wise and malevolent Jews who behind the scenes
control international or perhaps all politics. Marxists are not victims of this particular
superstition but theirs is on no higher plane. It is amusing to record that, when faced with either
doctrine, I have always experienced great difficulty in replying in anything like a fashion
satisfactory to myself. This was not only due to the circumstance that it is always difficult to
establish denial of factual assertions. The main difficulty came from the fact that people, lacking
any first-hand knowledge of international affairs and their personnel, also lack any organ for
the perception of absurdity. -->

There are other instances of a similar state of things in all parts of the
Marxian structure. To mention one, the definition of the nature of governments
that was quoted from the Communist Manifesto a little while ago has certainly an element of truth in it. And in many cases that truth will account for governmental attitudes toward the more obvious manifestations of class
antagonisms. 

But so far as true, the theory embodied in that definition is trivial.
All that is worth while troubling about is the Why and How of that vast
majority of cases in which the theory either fails to conform to fact or, even
if conforming, fails to describe correctly the actual behavior of those
“committees for managing the common affairs of the bourgeoisie.” Again, in
practically all cases the theory can be made tautologically true. For there is
no policy short of exterminating the bourgeoisie that could not be held to serve
some economic or extra-economic, short-run or long-run, bourgeois interest,
at least in the sense that it wards off still worse things. This, however, does
not make that theory any more valuable. But let us turn to our second example
of the problem-solving power of the Marxian synthesis.

The badge of Scientific Socialism which according to Marx is to distinguish
it from Utopian Socialism consists in the proof that socialism is inevitable
irrespective of human volition or of desirability. As has been stated before, all
this means is that by virtue of its very logic capitalist evolution tends to destroy
the capitalist and to produce the socialist order of things. 8 

How far has Marx succeeded in establishing the existence of these tendencies?

As regards the tendency toward self-destruction, the question has already been answered. 9 

The doctrine that the capitalist economy will inevitably break down for purely economic reasons has not been
established by Marx, as Hilferding’s objections would suffice to show.
On the one hand, some of his propositions about future facts that are
essential to the orthodox argument, especially the one about the
inevitable increase of misery and oppression, are untenable; on the other
hand, the breakdown of the capitalist order would not necessarily follow
from these propositions, even if they were all true. But other factors in
the situation that the capitalist process tends to develop were correctly
seen by Marx, as was, so I hope to show, the ultimate outcome itself.
Concerning the latter, it may be necessary to replace the Marxian nexus
by another, and the term “breakdown” may then turn out to be a
misnomer, particularly if it be understood in the sense of a breakdown
caused by the failure of the capitalist engine of production; but this does
not affect the essence of the doctrine, however much it may affect its
formulation and some of its implications.

As regards the tendency toward socialism, we must first realize that this
is a distinct problem. The capitalist or any other order of things may
evidently break down—or economic and social evolution may outgrow it—

9 See supra, ch. iii, § 7. -->

and yet the socialist phoenix may fail to rise from the ashes. There may be
chaos and, unless we define as socialism any non-chaotic alternative to
capitalism, there are other possibilities. The particular type of social
organization that the average orthodox Marxist—before the advent of
bolshevism at any rate—seemed to anticipate is certainly only one of many
possible cases.

Marx himself, while very wisely refraining from describing socialist
society in detail, emphasized conditions of its emergence: on the one hand,
the presence of giant units of industrial control—which, of course, would
greatly facilitate socialization—and, on the other hand, the presence of an
oppressed, enslaved, exploited, but also very numerous, disciplined, united
and organized proletariat. This suggests much about the final battle that is
to be the acute stage of the secular warfare between the two classes which
will then be arrayed against each other for the last time. It also suggests
something about what is to follow; it suggests the idea that the proletariat
as such will “take over” and, through its dictatorship, put a stop to the
“exploitation of man by man” and bring about classless society. If our
purpose were to prove that Marxism is a member of the family of chiliastic
creeds this would indeed be quite enough. Since we are concerned not with
that aspect but with a scientific forecast, it clearly is not. Schmoller was on
much safer ground. 

For though he also refused to commit himself to details,
he obviously visualized the process as one of progressive bureaucratization,
nationalization and so on, ending in state socialism which, whether we like
it or not, at least makes definite sense. Thus Marx fails to turn the socialist
possibility into a certainty even if we grant him the breakdown theory in its
entirety; if we do not, then failure follows a fortiori.
In no case, however—whether we accept Marx’s reasoning or any other—
will the socialist order be realized automatically; even if capitalist evolution
provided all conditions for it in the most Marxian manner conceivable,
distinct action would still be necessary to bring it about. 10 This of course is
in accordance with Marx’s teaching. His revolution is but the particular garb
in which his imagination liked to clothe that action. The emphasis on
violence is perhaps understandable in one who in his formative years had
experienced all the excitement of 1848 and who was, though quite able to
despise revolutionary ideology, yet never able to shake off its trammels.
Moreover, the greater part of his audience would hardly have been willing
to listen to a message that lacked the hallowed clarion call. Finally, though
he saw the possibility of peaceful transition, at least for England, he may
not have seen its likelihood. In his day it was not so easy to see, and his pet idea of the two classes in battle array made it still more difficult to see it.

His friend Engels actually went to the trouble of studying tactics. But though
the revolution can be relegated to the compound of non-essentials, the
necessity for distinct action still remains.

This should also solve the problem that has divided the disciples:
revolution or evolution? 

If I have caught Marx’s meaning, the answer is not
hard to give. Evolution was for him the parent of socialism. 

He was much
too strongly imbued with a sense of the inherent logic of things social to
believe that revolution can replace any part of the work of evolution. The
revolution comes in nevertheless. But it only comes in order to write the
conclusion under a complete set of premises. 


therefore differs entirely, in nature and in function, from the revolutions both
of the bourgeois radical and of the socialist conspirator. It is essentially
revolution in the fullness of time.11 

It is true that disciples who dislike this
conclusion, and especially its application to the Russian case, 12 can point to
many passages in the sacred books that seem to contradict it. But in those
passages Marx himself contradicts his deepest and most mature thought
which speaks out unmistakably from the analytic structure of Das Kapital
and—as any thought must that is inspired by a sense of the inherent logic
of things—carries, beneath the fantastic glitter of dubious gems, a distinctly
conservative implication. And, after all, why not? No serious argument ever
supports any “ism” un-conditionally. 13 

To say that Marx, stripped of phrases,
admits of interpretation in a conservative sense is only saying that he can
be taken seriously.

<!-- 11 This should be noticed for later reference. We shall repeatedly return to the subject and,
among other things, discuss the criteria of that “fullness of time.”
12 Karl Kautsky, in his preface to Theorien über den Mehrwert, even claimed the revolution
of 1905 for Marxian socialism, although it is patent that the Marxian phraseology of a few
intellectuals was all that was socialist about it.
13 This argument could be carried much further. In particular, there is nothing specifically
socialist in the labor theory of value; this of course everyone would admit who is familiar with
the historical development of that doctrine. But the same is true (excepting of course the phrase)
of the theory of exploitation. We need only recognize that existence of the surpluses so dubbed
by Marx is—or at least was—a necessary condition for the emergence of all that we comprise
in the term civilization (which in fact it would be difficult to deny), and there we are. In order
to be a socialist, it is of course not necessary to be a Marxist; but neither is it sufficient to be
a Marxist in order to be a socialist. Socialist or revolutionary conclusions can be impressed on
any scientific theory; no scientific theory necessarily implies them. And none will keep us in
what Bernard Shaw somewhere describes as sociological rage, unless its author goes out of his
way in order to work us up.
