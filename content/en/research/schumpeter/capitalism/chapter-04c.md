Two examples will illustrate the merits and the demerits of the Marxian synthesis as a problem-solving engine.

1. The Marxist theory of Imperialism

<!-- Its roots are all
to be found in Marx’s chief work, but it has been developed by the Neo-
Marxist school which flourished in the first two decades of this century and,
without renouncing communion with the old defenders of the faith, such as
Karl Kautsky, did much to overhaul the system.  -->

Vienna was its center; Otto Bauer, Rudolf Hilferding, Max Adler were its leaders. 

In the field of imperialism their work was continued, with but secondary shifts of emphasis,
by many others, prominent among whom were Rosa Luxemburg and Fritz
Sternberg. 

The argument runs as follows.

Capitalist society cannot exist. Its economic system cannot function without profits and since, on the other hand, profits
are constantly being eliminated by the very working of that system,
incessant effort to keep them alive becomes the central aim of the capitalist
class. 

Accumulation accompanied by qualitative change in the composition
of capital is, as we have seen, a remedy which though alleviating for the
moment the situation of the individual capitalist makes matters worse in
the end. So capital, yielding to the pressure of a falling rate of profits—it
falls, we recall, both because constant capital increases relative to variable
capital and because, if wages tend to rise and hours are being shortened,
the rate of surplus groups were in most cases wholly, in all cases mainly, interested in economic theory. This
performance is hence incommensurable with Marx’s synthesis. It could only be compared with
Marx’s theoretical apparatus and in that field comparison is all to their advantage.

value falls—seeks for outlets in countries in which there is still labor
that can be exploited at will and in which the process of mechanization
has not as yet gone far. Thus we get an export of capital into undeveloped
countries which is essentially an export of capital equipment or of
consumers’ goods to be used in order to buy labor or to acquire things
with which to buy labor. 3 

But it is also export of capital in the ordinary
sense of the term because the exported commodities will not be paid
for—at least not immediately—by goods, services or money from the
importing country. And it turns into colonization if, in order to safeguard
the investment both against hostile reaction of the native environment—
or if you please, against its resistance to exploitation—and against
competition from other capitalist countries, the undeveloped country is
brought into political subjection. This is in general accomplished by
military force supplied either by the colonizing capitalists themselves or
by their home government which thus lives up to the definition given in
the Communist Manifesto: “the executive of the modern State [is]…a
committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.”
Of course, that force will not be used for defensive purposes only. There
will be conquest, friction between the capitalist countries and internecine
war between rival bourgeoisies.


Colonial expansion is prompted by a falling rate of profit in the capitalist countries, it should occur in the later stages
of capitalist evolution—Marxists in fact speak of imperialism as a stage,
preferably the last stage, of capitalism. 

Hence it would coincide with a
high degree of concentration of capitalist control over industry and with
a decline of the type of competition that characterized the times of the
small or medium-sized firm. 

Marx himself did not lay much stress on the
resulting tendency toward monopolistic restriction of output and on the
consequent tendency toward protecting the domestic game preserve
against the intrusion of poachers from other capitalist countries. Perhaps
he was too competent an economist to trust this line of argument too far.

But the Neo-Marxists were glad to avail themselves of it. Thus we get
not only another stimulus for imperialist policy and another source of
imperialist imbroglios but also, as a by-product, a theory of a phenomenon that is not necessarily imperialist in itself, modern
protectionism.

3 Think of luxuries to be traded to chieftains against slaves or to be traded against wage
goods with which to hire native labor. For the sake of brevity, I do not take account of the fact
that capital export in the sense envisaged will in general arise as a part of the total trade of
the two countries which also includes commodity transactions unconnected with the particular
process we have in mind. These transactions of course greatly facilitate that capital export, but
do not affect its principle. I shall also neglect other types of capital exports. The theory under
discussion is not, and is not intended to be, a general theory of international trade and finance.

Note one more hitch in that process that will stand the Marxist in good
stead in the task of explaining further difficulties. When the undeveloped
countries have been developed, capital export of the kind we have been
considering will decline. 

There may then be a period during which the
mother country and the colony will exchange, say, manufactured products
for raw materials. But in the end the exports of manufacturers will also
have to decline while colonial competition will assert itself in the mother
country. Attempts to retard the advent of that state of things will provide
further sources of friction, this time between each old capitalist country and
its colonies, of wars of independence and so on. But in any case colonial
doors will eventually be closed to domestic capital which will no longer
be able to flee from vanishing profits at home into richer pastures abroad.
Lack of outlets, excess capacity, complete deadlock, in the end regular
recurrence of national bankruptcies and other disasters—perhaps world
wars from sheer capitalist despair—may confidently be anticipated. History
is as simple as that.
