Perhaps some readers feel that a proviso should be added about the
distribution of the total monetary income. Until about forty years ago,
many economists besides Marx believed that the capitalist process tended
to change relative shares in the national total so that the obvious
inference from our average might be invalidated by the rich growing
richer and the poor growing poorer, at least relatively. 

But there is no
such tendency. Whatever may be thought of the statistical measures
devised for the purpose, this much is certain: that the structure of the
pyramid of incomes, expressed in terms of money, has not greatly
changed during the period covered by our material—which for England

<!-- 6 “Consumption” includes the acquisition of durable consumers’ goods such as motor cars,
refrigerators and homes. We do not distinguish between transient consumers’ goods and what
is sometimes referred to as “consumers’ capital.”
7 That is to say, average real income per head would increase at a compound interest rate
of 1? per cent. It so happens that in England, during the century preceding the First World War,
real income per head of population increased at almost exactly that rate (see Lord Stamp in
Wealth and Taxable Capacity). No great confidence can be placed in this coincidence. But I
think it serves to show that our little calculation is not wildly absurd. In Number 241 of the
National Industrial Conference Board Studies, Table I, pp. 6 and 7, we find that “per capita
realized national income” adjusted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the National
Industrial Conference Board cost of living index, was in 1929 a little over four times the 1829
figure—a similar result, though open to still more serious doubts as to reliability. -->

includes the whole of the nineteenth century 8 —and that the relative share
of wages plus salaries has also been substantially constant over time.
There is, so long as we are discussing what the capitalist engine might
do if left to itself, no reason to believe that the distribution of incomes
or the dispersion about our average would in 1978 be significantly
different from what it was in 1928.

One way of expressing our result is that, if capitalism repeated its past
performance for another half century starting with 1928, this would do away
with anything that according to present standards could be called poverty,
even in the lowest strata of the population, pathological cases alone excepted.
Nor is this all. Whatever else our index may do or may not do, it
certainly does not overstate the actual rate of increase. It does not take
account of the commodity, Voluntary Leisure. New commodities escape
or are inadequately represented by an index which must rest largely on
basic commodities and intermediate products. 

For the same reason
improvements in quality almost completely fail to assert themselves
although they constitute, in many lines, the core of the progress
achieved—there is no way of expressing adequately the difference
between a motorcar of 1940 and a motorcar of 1900 or the extent to
which the price of motorcars per unit of utility has fallen. It would be
more nearly possible to estimate the rate at which given quantities of
raw materials or semi-finished products are made to go further than
they used to—a steel ingot or a ton of coal, though they may be
unchanged in physical quality, represent a multiple of their economic
efficiency sixty years ago. But little has been done along this line. I
have no idea about what would happen to our index if there were a
method for correcting it for these and similar factors. It is certain,
however, that its percentage rate of change would be increased and that
we have here a reserve that should make the estimate adopted proof
against the effects of any conceivable downward revision. Moreover,
even if we had the means of measuring the change in the technological
efficiency of industrial products, this measure would still fail to convey
an adequate idea of what it means for the dignity or intensity or
pleasantness of human life—for all that the economists of an earlier
generation subsumed under the heading of Satisfaction of Wants. And
this, after all, is for us the relevant consideration, the true “output” of
8 See Stamp, op. cit. The same phenomenon can be observed in all countries for which there
is sufficient statistical information, if we clear the latter of the disturbing effect of the cycles
of various span that are covered by the available material. The measure of income distribution
(or of inequality of incomes) devised by Vilfredo Pareto is open to objection. But the fact itself
is independent of its shortcomings.

capitalist production, the reason why we are interested in the index of
production and the pounds and gallons that enter into it and would
hardly be worth while in themselves.

But let us keep to our 2 per cent. There is one more point that is
important for a correct appraisal of that figure. I have stated above that,
broadly speaking, relative shares in national income have remained
substantially constant over the last hundred years. This, however, is true
only if we measure them in money. Measured in real terms, relative shares
have substantially changed in favor of the lower income groups. This
follows from the fact that the capitalist engine is first and last an engine
of mass production which unavoidably means also production for the
masses, whereas, climbing upward in the scale of individual incomes, we
find that an increasing proportion is being spent on personal services and
on handmade commodities, the prices of which are largely a function of
wage rates.

Verification is easy. There are no doubt some things available to the
modern workman that Louis XIV himself would have been delighted to
have yet was unable to have—modern dentistry for instance. On the whole,
however, a budget on that level had little that really mattered to gain from
capitalist achievement. Even speed of traveling may be assumed to have
been a minor consideration for so very dignified a gentleman. Electric
lighting is no great boon to anyone who has money enough to buy a
sufficient number of candles and to pay servants to attend to them. It is
the cheap cloth, the cheap cotton and rayon fabric, boots, motorcars and
so on that are the typical achievements of capitalist production, and not as
a rule improvements that would mean much to the rich man. Queen
Elizabeth owned silk stockings. The capitalist achievement does not
typically consist in providing more silk stockings for queens but in
bringing them within the reach of factory girls in return for steadily
decreasing amounts of effort.

The same fact stands out still better if we glance at those long waves in
economic activity, analysis of which reveals the nature and mechanism of
the capitalist process better than anything else. Each of them consists of an
“industrial revolution” and the absorption of its effects. For instance, we are
able to observe statistically and historically—the phenomenon is so clear that
even our scanty information suffices to establish it—the rise of such a long
wave toward the end of the 1780’s, its culmination around 1800, its
downward sweep and then a sort of recovery ending at the beginning of the
1840’s. This was the Industrial Revolution dear to the heart of textbook
writers. Upon its heels, however, came another such revolution producing
another long wave that rose in the forties, culminated just before 1857 and ebbed away to 1897, to be followed in turn by the one that reached its peak about 1911 and is now in the act of ebbing away. 9

These revolutions periodically reshape the existing structure of industry
by introducing new methods of production—the mechanized factory, the
electrified factory, chemical synthesis and the like; new commodities, such
as railroad service, motorcars, electrical appliances; new forms of
organization—the merger movement; new sources of supply—La Plata wool,
American cotton, Katanga copper; new trade routes and markets to sell in
and so on. This process of industrial change provides the ground swell that
gives the general tone to business: while these things are being initiated we
have brisk expenditure and predominating “prosperity”—interrupted, no
doubt, by the negative phases of the shorter cycles that are superimposed on
that ground swell—and while those things are being completed and their
results pour forth we have elimination of antiquated elements of the
industrial structure and predominating “depression.” Thus there are
prolonged periods of rising and of falling prices, interest rates, employment
and so on, which phenomena constitute parts of the mechanism of this
process of recurrent rejuvenation of the productive apparatus.
