FIRST of all we must see whether or not there is anything wrong with
the pure logic of a socialist economy. For although no proof of the
soundness of that logic will ever convert anyone to socialism or, in fact,
prove much for socialism as a practical proposition, proof of logical
unsoundness or even failure in an attempt to prove logical soundness would
in itself suffice to convict it of inherent absurdity.

More precisely, our question may be formulated as follows: given a
socialist system of the kind envisaged, is it possible to derive, from its data
and from the rules of rational behavior, uniquely determined decisions as to
what and how to produce or, to put the same thing into the slogan of exact
economics, do those data and rules, under the circumstances of a socialist
economy, yield equations which are independent, compatible—i.e., free from
contradiction—and sufficient in number to determine uniquely the unknowns
of the problem before the central board or ministry of production?

1. The answer is in the affirmative. There is nothing wrong with the pure logic of socialism. And this is so obvious that it would not have occurred to me to insist on it were it not for the fact that it has been denied and the still
more curious fact that orthodox socialists, until they were taught their
business by economists of strongly bourgeois views and sympathies, failed
to produce an answer that would meet scientific requirements.
The only authority standing for denial that we need to mention is
Professor L.von Mises. 1 Starting from the proposition that rational economic
behavior presupposes rational cost calculations, hence prices of cost factors,
hence markets which price them, he concluded that in a socialist society,
since there would be no such markets, the beacon lights of rational
production would be absent so that the system would have to function in a
haphazard manner if at all. To this and similar criticisms or perhaps to some
doubts of their own, the accredited exponents of socialist orthodoxy had at
first not much to oppose except the argument that the socialist management
would be able to start from the system of values evolved by its capitalist
predecessor—which is no doubt relevant for a discussion of practical difficulties but not at all for the question of principle—or a paean on the
miraculous glories of their heaven, in which it would be easy to dispense
altogether with capitalist tricks like cost rationality and in which comrades
would solve all problems by helping themselves to the bounties pouring forth
from social stores. This amounts to accepting the criticism, and some
socialists actually seem to do so even today.

The economist who settled the question in a manner that left little to do
except elaboration and the clearing up of points of secondary importance,
was Enrico Barone to whose argument I refer readers who want a rigorous
demonstration. 2 Here a brief sketch will suffice.

Viewed from the economists’ standpoint, production—including
transportation and all operations incident to marketing—is nothing but the
rational combination of the existing “factors” within the constraints imposed
by technological conditions. In a commercial society, the task of combining
factors involves buying or hiring them, and those individual incomes which
are typical of such a society emerge in this very process of buying or hiring.

That is to say, the production and the “distribution” of the social product are
but different aspects of one and the same process that affects both
simultaneously. Now the most important logical—or purely theoretical—
difference between commercial and socialist economy is that in the latter this
is no longer so. Since prima facie there are no market values of means of
production and, what is still more important, since the principles of socialist
society would not admit of making them the criterion of distribution even if
they did exist, the distributive automatism of commercial society is lacking
in a socialist one. The void has to be filled by a political act, let us say by
the constitution of the commonwealth. Distribution thus becomes a distinct
operation and, in logic at least, is completely severed from production. This
political act or decision would have to result from, and in turn go a long way toward determining, the economic and cultural character of the society, its
behavior, aims and achievements; but it would be completely arbitrary when
viewed from the economic standpoint. As has been pointed out before, the
commonwealth may adopt an equalitarian rule—and this again in any of the
many meanings that may be associated with equalitarian ideals—or admit
inequalities to any desired degree. It might even distribute with a view to
producing maximum performance in any desired direction—a particularly
interesting case. It may study the wishes of individual comrades or resolve
to give them what some authority or other thinks best for them; the slogan
“to everyone according to his needs” might carry either meaning. But some
rule must be established. For our purpose it will be sufficient to consider a
very special case.

2 Upward of a dozen economists had hinted at the solution before Barone. Among them were
such authorities as F.von Wieser (in his Natural Value, 1893, German original 1889) and Pareto
(Cours d’Économie politique, vol. ii, 1897). Both perceived the fact that the fundamental logic
of economic behavior is the same in both commercial and socialist society from which the
solution follows. But Barone, a follower of Pareto, was the first to work it out. See his papers
entitled “Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Collettivista,” Giornale degli Economisti,
1908; English translation included in the volume Collectivist Economic Planning mentioned
in the preceding note.
It is neither possible nor necessary to do justice to the rich crop of later work. I will only
mention, as particularly important in one way or another: Fred M.Taylor, “The Guidance of
Production in a Socialist State,” American Economic Review, March 1929; K.Tisch,
Wirtschaftsrechnung und Verteilung im… sozialistischen Gemeinwesen, 1932; H.Zassenhaus,
“Theorie der Planwirtschaft,” Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie, 1934; especially Oskar Lange,
“On the Economic Theory of Socialism,” Review of Economic Studies, 1936/7, republished as
a book in Lange and Taylor, same title, 1938; and A.P.Lerner whose articles will be referred
to in a later footnote.


2. Suppose then that the ethical persuasion of our socialist commonwealth
is thoroughly equalitarian but at the same time prescribes that comrades
should be free to choose as they please among all the consumers’ goods
which the ministry is able and willing to produce—the community may of
course refuse to produce certain commodities, alcoholic beverages for
instance. Furthermore let us assume that the particular equalitarian ideal
adopted is satisfied by handing out to every person—children and possibly
other individuals counting for fractional persons as the competent authority
may decide—a voucher representing his or her claim to a quantity of
consumers’ goods equal to the social product available in the current period
of account divided by the number of claimants, all vouchers to become
valueless at the end of that period. These vouchers can be visualized as
claims to the Xth part of all food, clothing, household goods, houses,
motorcars, movie plays and so on that have been or are being produced for
consumption (for the purpose of being delivered to consumers) during the
period under consideration. It is only to avoid a complex and unnecessary
mass of exchanges that would otherwise have to take place among the
comrades, that we express the claims not in goods but by equal amounts of
conveniently chosen but meaningless units—we can call them simply units,
or moons or suns or even dollars—and rule that units of each good will be
handed over against the surrender of a stated number of them. These “prices”
charged by the social stores would under our assumptions have always to
fulfill the condition that, each of them multiplied by the existing quantity of
the commodity to which it refers, they add up to the otherwise arbitrary total
of the comrades’ claims. But the ministry need not fix the individual “prices”
except by way of initial suggestions. Given the tastes and the equal “dollar
incomes,” comrades will reveal, by their reaction to these initial suggestions,
at what prices they are ready to take the whole social product save those
articles that nobody cares to have at all, and the ministry will then have to accept those prices if it wishes to have the stores cleared. This will
accordingly be done and the principle of equal shares will be thus carried
out in a very plausible sense and in a uniquely determined way.

But of course this presupposes that a definite quantity of every good has
already been produced. The real problem, the solvability of which has been
denied, is precisely how this can be done rationally, i.e., in a way which will
result in a maximum of consumers’ satisfaction 3 subject to the limits imposed
by the available resources, the technological possibilities and the rest of the
environmental conditions. It is clear that decision on the plan of production
by, say, a majority vote of the comrades would entirely fail to fulfill this 4
requirement because in this case certainly some people and possibly all the
people would not get what they want and what it would still be possible to
give them without reducing the satisfaction of others. It is, however, equally
clear that economic rationality in this sense can be attained in another way.
For the theorist this follows from the elementary proposition that consumers
in evaluating (“demanding”) consumers’ goods ipso facto also evaluate the
means of production which enter into the production of those goods. For the
layman proof of the possibility of a rational plan of production in our
socialist society can be supplied as follows.
