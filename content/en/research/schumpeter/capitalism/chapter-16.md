FIRST of all we must see whether or not there is anything wrong with
the pure logic of a socialist economy. For although no proof of the
soundness of that logic will ever convert anyone to socialism or, in fact,
prove much for socialism as a practical proposition, proof of logical
unsoundness or even failure in an attempt to prove logical soundness would
in itself suffice to convict it of inherent absurdity.

More precisely, our question may be formulated as follows: given a
socialist system of the kind envisaged, is it possible to derive, from its data
and from the rules of rational behavior, uniquely determined decisions as to
what and how to produce or, to put the same thing into the slogan of exact
economics, do those data and rules, under the circumstances of a socialist
economy, yield equations which are independent, compatible—i.e., free from
contradiction—and sufficient in number to determine uniquely the unknowns
of the problem before the central board or ministry of production?

1. The answer is in the affirmative. There is nothing wrong with the pure logic of socialism. And this is so obvious that it would not have occurred to me to insist on it were it not for the fact that it has been denied and the still
more curious fact that orthodox socialists, until they were taught their
business by economists of strongly bourgeois views and sympathies, failed
to produce an answer that would meet scientific requirements.
The only authority standing for denial that we need to mention is
Professor L.von Mises. 1 Starting from the proposition that rational economic
behavior presupposes rational cost calculations, hence prices of cost factors,
hence markets which price them, he concluded that in a socialist society,
since there would be no such markets, the beacon lights of rational
production would be absent so that the system would have to function in a
haphazard manner if at all. To this and similar criticisms or perhaps to some
doubts of their own, the accredited exponents of socialist orthodoxy had at
first not much to oppose except the argument that the socialist management
would be able to start from the system of values evolved by its capitalist
predecessor—which is no doubt relevant for a discussion of practical difficulties but not at all for the question of principle—or a paean on the
miraculous glories of their heaven, in which it would be easy to dispense
altogether with capitalist tricks like cost rationality and in which comrades
would solve all problems by helping themselves to the bounties pouring forth
from social stores. This amounts to accepting the criticism, and some
socialists actually seem to do so even today.

Planning (F.A.von Hayek. ed., 1935). Also see his Gemeinwirtschaft, English translation under
the title Socialism (1937). -->

The economist who settled the question in a manner that left little to do
except elaboration and the clearing up of points of secondary importance,
was Enrico Barone to whose argument I refer readers who want a rigorous
demonstration. 2 Here a brief sketch will suffice.

Viewed from the economists’ standpoint, production—including
transportation and all operations incident to marketing—is nothing but the
rational combination of the existing “factors” within the constraints imposed
by technological conditions. In a commercial society, the task of combining
factors involves buying or hiring them, and those individual incomes which
are typical of such a society emerge in this very process of buying or hiring.

That is to say, the production and the “distribution” of the social product are
but different aspects of one and the same process that affects both
simultaneously. Now the most important logical—or purely theoretical—
difference between commercial and socialist economy is that in the latter this
is no longer so. Since prima facie there are no market values of means of
production and, what is still more important, since the principles of socialist
society would not admit of making them the criterion of distribution even if
they did exist, the distributive automatism of commercial society is lacking
in a socialist one. The void has to be filled by a political act, let us say by
the constitution of the commonwealth. Distribution thus becomes a distinct
operation and, in logic at least, is completely severed from production. This
political act or decision would have to result from, and in turn go a long way toward determining, the economic and cultural character of the society, its
behavior, aims and achievements; but it would be completely arbitrary when
viewed from the economic standpoint. As has been pointed out before, the
commonwealth may adopt an equalitarian rule—and this again in any of the
many meanings that may be associated with equalitarian ideals—or admit
inequalities to any desired degree. It might even distribute with a view to
producing maximum performance in any desired direction—a particularly
interesting case. It may study the wishes of individual comrades or resolve
to give them what some authority or other thinks best for them; the slogan
“to everyone according to his needs” might carry either meaning. But some
rule must be established. For our purpose it will be sufficient to consider a
very special case.

2 Upward of a dozen economists had hinted at the solution before Barone. Among them were
such authorities as F.von Wieser (in his Natural Value, 1893, German original 1889) and Pareto
(Cours d’Économie politique, vol. ii, 1897). Both perceived the fact that the fundamental logic
of economic behavior is the same in both commercial and socialist society from which the
solution follows. But Barone, a follower of Pareto, was the first to work it out. See his papers
entitled “Il Ministro della Produzione nello Stato Collettivista,” Giornale degli Economisti,
1908; English translation included in the volume Collectivist Economic Planning mentioned
in the preceding note.
It is neither possible nor necessary to do justice to the rich crop of later work. I will only
mention, as particularly important in one way or another: Fred M.Taylor, “The Guidance of
Production in a Socialist State,” American Economic Review, March 1929; K.Tisch,
Wirtschaftsrechnung und Verteilung im… sozialistischen Gemeinwesen, 1932; H.Zassenhaus,
“Theorie der Planwirtschaft,” Zeitschrift für Nationalökonomie, 1934; especially Oskar Lange,
“On the Economic Theory of Socialism,” Review of Economic Studies, 1936/7, republished as
a book in Lange and Taylor, same title, 1938; and A.P.Lerner whose articles will be referred
to in a later footnote.


2. Suppose then that the ethical persuasion of our socialist commonwealth
is thoroughly equalitarian but at the same time prescribes that comrades
should be free to choose as they please among all the consumers’ goods
which the ministry is able and willing to produce—the community may of
course refuse to produce certain commodities, alcoholic beverages for
instance. Furthermore let us assume that the particular equalitarian ideal
adopted is satisfied by handing out to every person—children and possibly
other individuals counting for fractional persons as the competent authority
may decide—a voucher representing his or her claim to a quantity of
consumers’ goods equal to the social product available in the current period
of account divided by the number of claimants, all vouchers to become
valueless at the end of that period. These vouchers can be visualized as
claims to the Xth part of all food, clothing, household goods, houses,
motorcars, movie plays and so on that have been or are being produced for
consumption (for the purpose of being delivered to consumers) during the
period under consideration. It is only to avoid a complex and unnecessary
mass of exchanges that would otherwise have to take place among the
comrades, that we express the claims not in goods but by equal amounts of
conveniently chosen but meaningless units—we can call them simply units,
or moons or suns or even dollars—and rule that units of each good will be
handed over against the surrender of a stated number of them. These “prices”
charged by the social stores would under our assumptions have always to
fulfill the condition that, each of them multiplied by the existing quantity of
the commodity to which it refers, they add up to the otherwise arbitrary total
of the comrades’ claims. But the ministry need not fix the individual “prices”
except by way of initial suggestions. Given the tastes and the equal “dollar
incomes,” comrades will reveal, by their reaction to these initial suggestions,
at what prices they are ready to take the whole social product save those
articles that nobody cares to have at all, and the ministry will then have to
The Socialist Blueprint 175
accept those prices if it wishes to have the stores cleared. This will
accordingly be done and the principle of equal shares will be thus carried
out in a very plausible sense and in a uniquely determined way.
But of course this presupposes that a definite quantity of every good has
already been produced. The real problem, the solvability of which has been
denied, is precisely how this can be done rationally, i.e., in a way which will
result in a maximum of consumers’ satisfaction 3 subject to the limits imposed
by the available resources, the technological possibilities and the rest of the
environmental conditions. It is clear that decision on the plan of production
by, say, a majority vote of the comrades would entirely fail to fulfill this 4
requirement because in this case certainly some people and possibly all the
people would not get what they want and what it would still be possible to
give them without reducing the satisfaction of others. It is, however, equally
clear that economic rationality in this sense can be attained in another way.
For the theorist this follows from the elementary proposition that consumers
in evaluating (“demanding”) consumers’ goods ipso facto also evaluate the
means of production which enter into the production of those goods. For the
layman proof of the possibility of a rational plan of production in our
socialist society can be supplied as follows.
3. To facilitate matters we will assume that means of production are
present in given and, for the moment, unalterable quantities. Now let the
central board resolve itself into a committee on a particular industry or,
still better, let us set up an authority for each industry that is to manage
it and to cooperate with the central board which controls and coordinates
all these industrial managers or managing boards. This the central board
does by allocating productive resources—all of which are under its
control—to these industrial managements according to certain rules.
Suppose the board rules that industrial managements can have any
quantities of producers’ goods and services they choose to call for subject
to three conditions. First, they must produce as economically as possible.
Second, they are required to transfer to the central board, for every unit
of each producer’s good and service called for, a stated number of those
consumers’ dollars which they have acquired by previous deliveries of
consumers’ goods—we might just as well say that the central board
declares itself ready to “sell” to any industrial management unlimited
quantities of producers’ goods and services at stated “prices.” Third, the
3 If modern theorists should object to this turn of phrase, let me entreat them to consider
the amount of entirely unnecessary circumlocution that more correct phrasing would involve
without offering, for the purposes of this argument, any compensatory advantage.
4 This is not to say that it would not fulfill requirements from the standpoint of another
definition of rationality. No assertion is being made here about how the arrangement under
discussion compares with others. Something will be said about this presently.
Can Socialism Survive?176
managements are required to call for and to use such quantities as (and
not less than), producing in the most economical manner, they can use
without having to “sell” any part of their products for less “dollars” than
they have to transfer to the central board for the corresponding amounts
of means of production. In more technical language, this condition means
that production in all lines should be such as to make “prices” equal (not
merely proportional) to marginal costs. 5
5 This principle, which follows from the general logic of choice, was not universally
accepted until Mr. A.P.Lerner stressed it and fought for it in a number of notes and papers,
mostly in the Review of Economic Studies (also in the Economic Journal, September 1937),
which constitute an important contribution to the theory of the socialist economy and to
which I take this opportunity of drawing the reader’s attention. It is also correct, as a
proposition of that logic of choice, to say that the above condition should prevail over the
rule of equating prices to total cost per unit whenever it conflicts with it. But the relation
between them has been somewhat obscured by a confusion of different things, and calls
for some clarification.
The concept of marginal cost, meaning the increment of total cost that must be incurred
if production is to be increased by a small amount, is indeterminate as long as we do not
relate it to a definite period of time. Thus, if the question is whether or not to transport an
additional passenger by a train that would run in any case, marginal cost to be considered
might be zero and at all events is very small. This may be expressed by saying that, from
the standpoint of a very short period—an hour or a day, or even a week—practically
everything is overhead, even lubricants and coal, and that overhead does not enter into
marginal cost. But the longer the period envisaged the more cost elements enter marginal
cost, first all that are usually comprised in the concept of prime cost and after them more
and more of what the businessman calls overhead, until, for the very long run or from the
standpoint of planning an as yet non-existent industrial unit, nothing (or practically nothing)
is left in the category of overhead and everything including depreciation has to be taken
into account in figuring out marginal cost, so far as this principle is not modified, in the
case of some factors such as a railroad track, by the technological fact that they are
available or usable only in very big units (“indivisibility”). Marginal costs should hence
always be distinguished from (marginal) prime costs.
Now we often associate the condition under discussion with the rule that the socialist—
just like the capitalist—managements should, at any point of time, let bygones be bygones
if they are to act rationally; that is to say that in their decisions they are not to take account
of the book values of existing investments. But this is only a rule for short-run behavior
in a given situation. It does not mean that they are to neglect ex ante those elements that
will crystallize into fixed costs or overhead. To neglect these would spell irrational behavior
with respect to the labor hours and units of natural resources that go into the production
of the overhead, whenever there is an alternative use for them. But to take account of them
will in general imply equating prices to total cost per unit of product as long as things
develop according to plans, and since exceptions are mainly due to the technological
obstacle to rationality represented by indivisibility or to deviations of the actual course of
events from the plans, the logic of these plans is after all not badly expressed by the latter
principle. Though in a short-run situation it may be the most rational thing to do, it is yet
never part of that logic to operate an industry at a deficit. This is important to note for
two reasons.
First, it has been denied. It has even been suggested that welfare would (i.e., in the
long run) be increased if prices were always equated to short-run marginal costs
excluding depreciation and that overhead (say, the cost of a bridge) should be financed
The Socialist Blueprint 177
The task of each industrial board is then uniquely determined. Exactly
as today every firm in a perfectly competitive industry knows what and
how much to produce and how to produce it as soon as technical
possibilities, reactions of consumers (their tastes and incomes) and prices
of means of production are given, so the industrial managements in our
socialist commonwealth would know what to produce, how to produce and
what factor quantities to “buy” from the central board as soon as the
latter’s “prices” are published and as soon as the consumers have revealed
their “demands.”
In a sense these “prices,” unlike the “prices” of consumers’ goods, are
unilaterally set by the central board. We may also say however that industrial
managers display a uniquely determined “demand” for the producers’ goods
much as consumers do for consumers’ goods. All we still need to complete
our proof is a rule, conforming to the maximum criterion, for that price-
fixing activity of the central board. But this rule is obvious. The board has
simply to set a single price on every kind and quality of producers’ goods—
if the board dis criminates, i.e., charges different prices for the same kind
and quality to different managements, this would in general 6 have to be
justified on non-economic grounds—and to see to it that that price exactly
“clears the market,” i.e., that no unused quantities of producers’ goods
remain on its hands and that no additional quantities are called at those
“prices.” This rule will normally suffice to insure rational cost accounting,
hence economically rational allocation of productive resources—for the
former is nothing but a method of insuring and verifying the latter—hence
rationality of the plan of production in socialist societies. Proof follows from
the consideration that as long as this rule is being observed no element of
productive resources can be diverted to any other line of production without
causing the destruction of as much (or more) consumers’ values, expressed
by taxation. Our rule, as given in the text, does not mean this, and it would not be a
rational thing to do.
Second, in a decree of March 1936 the Russian central authority, abolishing for a
number of industries the system of subsidies till then in force, prescribed that prices
should be regulated so as to equate average total cost per unit plus an addition for
accumulation. For the first part of the rule it may be said that, though not strictly correct,
it differs less from the correct one than incorrect formulations of the latter might lead
one to suppose; for the latter, that the obvious objection to it is much weakened as soon
as we take into account the conditions or necessities of rapid development—the reader
will recall the argument submitted in Part II for the capitalist case—and that it is quite
conceivable that the Soviet government was right both in embarking upon its policy of
subsidies, which amounted to financing investment at a loss, and in partly abolishing the
practice in 1936.
6 There are exceptions to this which are of importance but do not affect the drift
of our argument.
Can Socialism Survive?178
in terms of consumers’ dollars, as that element would add in its new
employment. This amounts to saying that production is being carried, in all
directions open in the general conditions of the society’s environment, as far
as and no farther than it rationally can be and completes our case for the
rationality of socialist planning in a stationary process of economic life in
which everything is correctly foreseen and repeats itself and in which nothing
happens to upset the plan.
4. But no great difficulties arise if we go beyond the precincts of the
theory of the stationary process and admit the phenomena incident to
industrial change. So far as economic logic is concerned, it cannot be held
that socialism of the kind envisaged, while theoretically capable of coping
with the recurrent tasks of the administration of a stationary economy, would
necessarily fail in the solution of the problems presented by “progress.” We
shall see later why it is nevertheless important for the success of a socialist
society that it should embark upon its career not only as richly endowed as
possible by its capitalist predecessor—with experience and techniques as
well as with resources—but also after the latter has sown its wild oats, done
its work and is approaching a stationary state. But the reason for it is not in
any inability of ours to devise a rational and uniquely determined course for
the socialist society to take whenever the opportunity for an improvement
in the industrial apparatus presents itself.
Suppose that a new and more efficient piece of machinery has been designed
for the productive process of industry X. In order to exclude the problems
incident to the financing of investment—to be considered presently—and to
isolate a distinct set of phenomena, we will assume that the new machine can
be produced by the same plants which thus far produced the less efficient one
and at exactly the same costs in terms of productive resources. The management
of industry X, in obedience to the first clause of its instruction—viz., the rule
to produce as economically as possible—will adopt the new machine and thus
produce the same output with a smaller amount of means of production than
heretofore. Consequently it would henceforth be in a position to transfer to the
ministry or central board an amount of consumers’ dollars smaller than the
amount received from consumers. Call the difference as you please, for instance
D, or a shovel, or “profits.” The management would, it is true, violate the
condition set by the third clause of its instruction if it realized that “profit”; and
if it obeys that clause and immediately produces the greater amount now required
in order to satisfy that condition, those profits will never emerge. But their
potential existence in the calculations of the management is quite sufficient to
make them fill the only function they would have under our assumption, viz.,
the function of indicating, in a uniquely determined manner, the direction and
extent of the reallocation of resources that it is now rational to carry out.
The Socialist Blueprint 179
If, at a time when the available resources of the society are fully employed
in the task of providing a given level of consumption, an improvement—such
as a new bridge or a new railway—which requires the use of additional
factors or, as we may also say, additional investment suggests itself, the
comrades would either have to work beyond the hours which so far we have
assumed to be fixed by law or to restrict their consumption or both. In this
case our assumptions, framed for the purpose of solving the fundamental
problem in the simplest possible way, preclude an “automatic” solution, i.e.,
a decision at which the central board and the industrial managements could
arrive merely by passively following, within the three rules, the guidance of
objective indications. But this of course is a disability of our schema and not
of the socialist economy. All we have to do if we wish to have such an
automatic solution is to repeal the law invalidating all claims to consumers’
goods that are not used during the period for which they are issued, to
renounce the principle of absolute equality of incomes and to grant power
to the central board to offer premiums for overtime and—what shall we call
it?—well, let us say saving. The condition that possible improvements or
investments be undertaken to such an extent that the least tempting one of
them would yield a “profit” equal to the premiums which have to be offered
in order to call forth the amounts of overtime or saving (or both) required
for it, then uniquely determines all the new variables that our problem
introduces provided overtime and saving are in the relevant interval single-
valued functions of the respective premiums. 7 The “dollars” that are handed
out in discharge of the latter may conveniently be assumed to be additional
to the income dollars issued before. The readjustments this would impose
in various directions need not detain us.
But this argument about investment makes it still clearer that the schema
which seemed best adapted to our particular purpose is neither the only
possible blueprint of a socialist economy, nor necessarily the. one that would
recommend itself to a socialist society. Socialism need not be equalitarian
but no amount of inequality of incomes that we could reasonably expect a
socialist society to tolerate is likely to produce the rate of investment that
capitalist society produces in the average of cyclical phases. Even capitalist
inequalities are not sufficient for that and they have to be reinforced by
corporate accumulation and “created” bank credit, methods which are not
particularly automatic or uniquely determined either. If, therefore, a socialist
7 The problem, it should be observed, only arises with new investment. Such investment as
is currently needed in order to keep a stationary process going can and would be provided for
exactly as are all other cost items. In particular, there would be no interest. I may take the
opportunity to observe that the attitude of socialists toward the phenomenon of interest is not
uniform. St. Simon admitted it almost as a matter of course. Marx excluded it from socialist
society. Some modern socialists again admit it. Russian practice admits it.
Can Socialism Survive?180
society desires to achieve a similar or even greater rate of real investment—
of course it need not—methods other than saving would have to be resorted
to. Accumulation out of “profits” which could be allowed to materialize
instead of remaining potential only or, as suggested above, something
analogous to credit creation would be quite feasible. It would be much
more natural however to leave the matter to the central board and the
congress or parliament who between them could settle it as part of the
social budget; while the vote on the “automatic” part of the society’s
economic operations would be purely formal or perhaps supervisory in
character, the vote on the investment item—at least on its amount—would
involve a real decision and stand on a par with the vote on army estimates
and so on. Coordination of this decision with the “automatic” decisions
about the quantities and qualities of individual consumers’ goods would
not present any insurmountable difficulties. But in accepting this solution
we should renounce allegiance to the basic principle of our schema in a
very important point.
Other features of our blueprint can be altered even within its general
framework. For example, with a conditional exception as to overtime, I
have not left it to the individual comrades to decide how much work they
are going to do, though as voters and in other ways they may have as
much influence on this decision as they have on the distribution of
incomes and so on. Nor have I allowed them more freedom of choice of
occupation than the central board, within the requirements of its general
plan, may be able and willing to grant them. The arrangement may be
visualized by means of the analogy with compulsory military service.
Such a plan comes fairly close to the slogan: “to everyone according to
his need, everyone to contribute according to his aptitude”—or at all
events it could, with only minor modifications, be made to conform to
it. But instead we may also leave it to the individual comrades to decide
how much and what kind of work they are to do. Rational allocation of
the working force would then have to be attempted by a system of
inducements—premiums again being offered, in this case not only for
overtime but for all work, so as to secure everywhere the “offer” of labor
of all types and grades appropriate to the structure of consumers’ demand
and to the investment program. These premiums would have to bear an
obvious relation to the attractiveness or irksomeness of each job and to
the skill that must be acquired in order to fill it, hence also to the wage
schedule of capitalist society. Though the analogy between the latter and
such a socialist system of premiums should not be pushed too far, we
might speak of a “labor market.” Insertion of this piece of mechanism
would of course make a great deal of difference to our blueprint. But it
The Socialist Blueprint 181
would not affect the determinateness of the socialist system. Its formal
rationality would in fact stand out still more strongly.
5. So would that family likeness between commercial and socialist
economy which the reader cannot have failed to notice all along. Since this
resemblance seems to have given pleasure to non-socialists and some
socialists and to have annoyed other socialists, it is just as well to restate
explicitly in what it consists and to what it is due. It will then be seen how
little reason there is for either the pleasure or the annoyance. In trying to
construct a rational schema of a socialist economy we have made use of
mechanisms and concepts traditionally specified by terms that are familiar
to us from our discussions of the processes and problems of capitalist
economy. We have described a mechanism which is immediately understood
as soon as we utter the words “market,” “buying and selling,” “competing”
and so on. We seem to have used, or barely avoided using, such terms
savoring of capitalism as prices, costs, incomes and even profits while rent,
interest, wages and others, money among them, have, as it were, hovered
about our path.
Let us consider what to most socialists would certainly seem to be one
of the worst cases, that of rent, meaning thereby returns from the productive
use of natural agents, let us say “land.” Our schema evidently cannot imply
that ground rent would be paid to any landholders. What then does it imply?
Simply that any kind of land which is not plentiful beyond all requirements
in the calculable future must be used economically or allocated rationally
exactly like labor or any other type of productive resources, and that for this
purpose it must receive an index of economic significance with which any
new use that may suggest itself must be compared and by means of which
the land enters the social bookkeeping process. If this were not done the
commonwealth would be behaving irrationally. But no concession to
capitalism or to the spirit of capitalism is implied in doing it. All that is
commercial or capitalist about ground rent, in both its economic and its
sociological associations, and all that can possibly be sympathetic to the
advocate of private property (private income, the landlord and so on) has
been completely removed.
The “incomes” with which we endowed the comrades at the start are not
wages. In fact they would on analysis be seen to be composites of disparate
economic elements of which one only could be linked to marginal
productivity of labor. The premiums which we introduced later have more
to do with the wages of capitalist society. But the counterpart of the latter
really exists nowhere except in the books of the central board and again
consists in a mere index of significance associated, for the purposes of
rational allocation, with every type and grade of labor—an index from which
Can Socialism Survive?182
has vanished a whole bundle of meanings that pertain to the capitalist world.
In passing, we may observe that since we can call as we please the units into
which we split the vouchers that represent the comrade’s claims to
consumers’ goods, we can also call them hours of labor. And since the total
number of these units is—within the limits set by convenience—no less
arbitrary we could make it equal to the hours actually worked, adjusting all
kinds and grades of labor to some standard quality in the Ricardo-Marxian
way. Finally our commonwealth can adopt, just as well as any other, the
principle that “incomes” should be proportional to the hours of standard
work contributed by each comrade. Then we should have a system of labor
notes. And the interesting point about it is that barring technical difficulties
which do not concern us now such a system would prove quite workable.
But it is easy to see why even then these “incomes” would not be “wages.”
It is no less obvious that the workability of such an arrangement does not
prove anything for the labor theory of value.
It is hardly necessary to perform the same operation on profits, interest,
prices and costs. The cause of that family likeness is by now clearly visible
without doing so: our socialism borrows nothing from capitalism, but
capitalism borrows much from the perfectly general logic of choice. Any
rational behavior must of course display certain formal similarities with any
other rational behavior, and it so happens that in the sphere of economic
behavior the molding influence of mere rationality goes pretty far, at least
with regard to the pure theory of it. The concepts which express the
behaviorist pattern are then drenched with all the particular meanings of a
historical epoch and will tend to retain, in the layman’s mind, the colors thus
acquired. If our historical acquaintance with economic phenomena had been
made in socialist environments, we should now seem to be borrowing
socialist concepts when analyzing a capitalist process.
So far, there is nothing for capitalist-minded economists to congratulate
themselves on in the discovery that socialism could after all only use
capitalist mechanisms and categories. There should be as little reason for
socialists to object. For only the most naïve mind can feel disappointed at
the fact that the socialist miracle does not create a logic of its own, and only
the crudest and most stupid variants of the socialist creed can be endangered
by any demonstration to that effect—those variants according to which the
capitalist process is nothing but a wild jumble without any logic or order at
all. 

Reasonable people of both persuasions can agree on such resemblance
as there is and remain just as far apart as ever. But an objection on the score
of terminology might remain: it may be argued that it is not convenient to
use terms loaded with adventitious yet very important meaning which not
everyone can be trusted to discard. Moreover, we must not forget that one may accept the result arrived at about the essential sameness of the economic logic of socialist and commercial production and yet object to the particular
schema or model by means of which we have arrived at it (see below)
This is not all however. Some socialist as well as non-socialist economists
have been not only willing but anxious to recognize a particularly strong
family likeness between a socialist economy of the type envisaged and a
commercial economy of the perfectly competitive type. We might almost
speak of a school of socialist thought that tends to glorify perfect competition
and to advocate socialism on the ground that it offers the only method by
which the results of perfect competition can be attained in the modern world.

The tactical advantages to be reaped by placing oneself on this standpoint
are indeed obvious enough to explain what at first sight looks like surprising
broad-mindedness. A competent socialist who sees as clearly as any other
economist all the weaknesses of Marxian and of popular arguments can thus
admit whatever he feels should be admitted without compromising his
convictions because the admissions refer to a historical stage that (so far as
it ever did exist) is safely dead and buried; he is enabled, by judiciously
confining his condemnatory verdict to the non-competitive case, to lend
qualified support to some indictments, such as that in modern capitalism
production is for profit and not for the consumption of the people, which
otherwise would be merely silly; and he can baffle and puzzle good bourgeois by telling them that socialism will only do what they really wanted
all along and what their own economic ulemas always taught them. 

But the analytic advantages of stressing that family likeness are not equally great. 8
As we have already seen, the bloodless concept of perfect competition that
economic theory has framed for its purposes turns on whether or not individual
firms can, by their single-handed action, influence the prices of their products
and of their cost factors. If they cannot—that is, if each firm is a mere drop in
an ocean and therefore has to accept the prices that rule in the market—the
theorist speaks of perfect competition. And it can be shown that in this case the
mass effect of the passive reaction of all individual firms will result in market
prices and volumes of output displaying certain formal properties that are similar
to those of the indices of economic significance and volumes of output in our
blueprint of a socialist economy. However, in all that really matters—in the
principles governing the formation of incomes, the selection of industrial leaders,
the allocation of initiative and responsibility, the definition of success and
failure—in everything that constitutes the physiognomy of competitive
capitalism, the blueprint is the very opposite of perfect competition and much
further removed from it than from the big-business type of capitalism.


Though I do not think therefore that our blueprint can be objected to on the
ground that it is borrowed from commercialism or that it wastes socialist oil
in order to anoint that unholy thing, I am yet much in sympathy with those
socialists who object to it on other grounds. I have, it is true, pointed out
myself that the method of constructing a “market” of consumers’ goods and
of orienting production according to the indications derived from it will
come nearer than any other, for instance the method of decision by majority
vote, to giving each individual comrade what he wants—there exists no more
democratic institution than a market—and that in this sense it will result in
a “maximum of satisfaction.” But this maximum is only a short-run one 9 and,
moreover, is relative to the actual desires of the comrades as they are felt at
the moment. Only outright beefsteak socialism can be content with a goal
such as this. I cannot blame any socialist for despising it and dreaming of
new cultural forms for the human clay, perhaps of a new clay withal; the real
promise of socialism, if any, lies that way. Socialists who are of this mind
may still allow their commonwealth to be guided by the comrades’ actual
tastes in matters that present no other than the hedonist aspect. But they will
adopt a Gosplan not only, as we conditionally did ourselves, for their
investment policy but for all purposes that do present other aspects. They
may still let the comrades choose as they like between peas and beans. They
may well hesitate as to milk and whisky and as to drugs and improvement
of housing. And they will not allow comrades to choose between loafing and
temples—if the latter be allowed to stand for what Germans inelegantly but
tellingly call objective (manifestations of) culture.

6. It is therefore necessary to ask whether, if we jettison our “markets,”
rationality and determinateness do not go overboard also. The answer is
obvious. There would have to be an authority to do the evaluating, i.e., to
determine the indices of significance for all consumers’ goods. Given its
system of values, that authority could do this in a perfectly determined
manner exactly as a Robinson Crusoe can. 10 And the rest of the planning
process could then run its course, much as it did in our original blueprint.
The vouchers, prices, and the abstract units would still serve the purposes
of control and cost calculation, although they would lose their affinity to
disposable income and its units. All the concepts that derive from the general
logic of economic action would turn up again.

<!-- 9 It is however a provable maximum and as such establishes the economic rationality of that
type of socialism exactly as the competitive maximum establishes the rationality of competitive
economy. And in neither case does this mean very much.
10 This is perhaps why Marx showed considerable interest in Crusoe economics. -->


Any kind of centralist socialism, therefore, can successfully clear the first
hurdle—logical definiteness and consistency of socialist planning—and we may as well negotiate the next one at once. It consists of the “practical
impossibility” on which, it seems, most anti-socialist economists are at
present inclined to retire after having accepted defeat on the purely logical
issue. They hold that our central board would be confronted with a task of
unmanageable complication,11 and some of them add that in order to function
the socialist arrangement would presuppose a wholesale reformation of souls
or of behavior—whichever way we prefer to style it—which historical
experience and common sense prove to be out of the question. Deferring
consideration of the latter point we can easily dispose of the former.
First, a glance at our solution of the theoretical problem will satisfy the
reader that it is eminently operational; that is to say, it not only establishes
a logical possibility but in doing so also shows the steps by which this
possibility can be realized in practice. This holds even if, in order to face
the issue squarely, we require that the plan of production be built up ab ovo,
i.e., without any previous experience as to quantities and values and on no
other basis to start from than a survey of the available resources and
technologies and a general knowledge about what kind of people the
comrades are. Moreover it must be borne in mind that under modern
conditions a socialist economy requires the existence of a huge bureaucracy
or at least social conditions favorable to its emergence and functioning. This
requirement constitutes one of the reasons why the economic problems of
socialism should never be discussed without reference to given states of the
social environment or to historical situations. Such an administrative
apparatus may or may not deserve all the derogatory comments which some
of us are in the habit of passing upon bureaucracy—we shall presently
comment upon it ourselves—but just now we are not concerned with the
question how well or ill it may be expected to fulfill its task; all that matters
is that, if it exists at all, there is no reason to believe that it will break down
under the task.

In any normal situation it would command information sufficient to
enable it to come at first throw fairly close to the correct quantities of output
in the major lines of production, and the rest would be a matter of
adjustments by informed trial and error. So far there is in this respect no very
fundamental difference 12 between socialist and commercial economies either
as to the problems which the theorist meets in showing how an economic system proceeds to a state that could be “rational” or “optimal” in the sense
of fulfilling certain maximum conditions, or as to the problems which
managers have to meet in actual practice. If we admit previous experience
to start from as most socialists do and especially Karl Kautsky always did,
the task is of course greatly simplified, particularly if that experience is of
the big-business type.

<!-- 11 This is the line taken by most authors of non-socialist persuasion who accept the logical
credentials of socialism. Professors Robbins and von Hayek may be mentioned as the chief
authorities for this view.
12 Some writers seem to imply that the process by which equilibrium is reached would be
the same as in a state of perfect competition. That is not so however. Step-by-step adjustment
in reaction to price changes alone might easily miss the goal altogether. This is why in the text
I spoke of “informed” trial and error. -->

But something else follows, secondly, from another inspection of our
blueprint: solution of the problems confronting the socialist management
would be not only just as possible as is the practical solution of the problems
confronting commercial managements: it would be easier. Of this we can
readily convince ourselves by observing that one of the most important
difficulties of running a business—the difficulty which absorbs most of the
energy of a successful business leader—consists in the uncertainties
surrounding every decision. A very important class of these consists in turn
in the uncertainties about the reaction of one’s actual and potential
competitors and about how general business situations are going to shape.

Although other classes of uncertainties would no doubt persist in a socialist
commonwealth, these two can reasonably be expected to vanish almost
completely. The managements of socialized industries and plants would be
in a position to know exactly what the other fellows propose to do and
nothing would prevent them from getting together for concerted action.13 The
central board could, and to a certain extent would unavoidably, act as a
clearing house of information and as a coordinator of decisions—at least as
much as an all-embracing cartel bureau would. This would immensely reduce
the amount of work to be done in the workshops of managerial brains and
much less intelligence would be necessary to run such a system than is
required to steer a concern of any importance through the waves and
breakers of the capitalist sea. This suffices to establish our proposition.

<!-- 13 So far as this is being done in capitalist economies, it is a most important step toward
socialism. In fact, it progressively reduces the difficulties of transition and is in itself a symptom
of the advent of the transitional stage. To fight this tendency unconditionally is tantamount to
fighting socialism. -->
