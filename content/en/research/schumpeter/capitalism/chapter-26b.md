Every country has its own socialism. But things did not differ greatly from
the English paradigma in those continental countries whose contributions to
humanity’s fund of cultural values is so strikingly out of proportion to their
size—the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries in particular. Take
Sweden for an instance. Like her art, her science, her politics, her social
institutions and much besides, her socialism and her socialists owe their
distinction not to any peculiar features of principle or intention, but to the
stuff the Swedish nation is made of and to its exceptionally well-balanced
social structure. That is why it is so absurd for other nations to try to copy
Swedish examples; the only effective way of doing so would be to import
the Swedes and to put them in charge.

The Swedes being the people they are and their social structure being
what it is, we shall have no difficulty in understanding the two outstanding
characteristics of their socialism. The socialist party, almost always ably
and conscientiously led, grew slowly in response to a very normal social
process, without any attempt to push ahead of normal development and to
antagonize for the sake of antagonizing. Hence its rise to political power
produced no convulsions. Responsible office came naturally to its leaders
who were able to meet the leaders of other parties on terms of equality and
largely on common ground: to this day, though a communist group has of
course developed, the differences in current politics reduce to such
questions as whether a few million kroner more or less should be spent on
some social purpose accepted by all. 

And within the party, the antagonism
between intellectuals and labor men only shows under the microscope
precisely because, owing to the level of both, there is no great cultural gulf
between them and because, the Swedish social organism producing a
relatively smaller supply of unemployable intellectuals than do other social
organisms, exasperated and exasperating intellectuals are not as numerous
as they are elsewhere. This is sometimes described as the “enervating
control” exerted by trade unions over the socialist movement in general and
over the party in particular. To observers steeped in the phraseology of
current radicalism, this may well seem so. But this diagnosis entirely fails
to do justice to the social and racial environment of which not only the
labor men but also the intellectuals are the products and which prevents
both of them from exalting their socialism into a religion. Though room
might be found in Marx’s teaching for such patterns, the average Marxist
cannot of course be expected to look with favor upon a socialist party of the Swedish type, or even to admit that it embodies a genuine case of
socialist endeavor. 

Swedish socialists in turn were very lightly tinged with
Marxism though they frequently used language that conformed to what was
then considered socialist etiquette, especially in their international relations
with other socialist groups.

On the other end of the scale, in Russia, we find a socialism that was
almost purely Marxist and hence enjoyed that favor to the full, but is no less
easy to understand from its environment. Tsarist Russia was an agrarian
country of largely pre-capitalist complexion. The industrial proletariat, so far
as it was accessible to the professional socialist, formed but a small part of
the total population of about 150 millions. 7 The commercial and industrial
bourgeoisie, correspondingly weak in numbers, was not much more efficient
than was anyone else, though capitalist evolution fostered by the government
was rapidly gathering momentum. Inserted into this structure was an
intelligentsia whose ideas were as foreign to the soil as were the Paris dresses
of Russian society women.

To many of the intellectuals, the form of government then prevailing—
an absolute monarch (autocrator) heading a huge bureaucracy and allied with
the landed aristocracy and the church—was of course abomination. And
public opinion all over the world has accepted their reading of history. Even
writers most hostile to the regime that followed upon that of the tsars
invariably make haste to assure their readers that they are duly horrified at
the monstrosity of tsarism. Thus the simple truth has been entirely lost in a
maze of cant phrases. As a matter of fact, that form of government was no
less appropriate to the social pattern that had produced it than was the
parliamentary monarchy in England and the democratic republic in the
United States. The performance of the bureaucracy, considering the
conditions under which it had to work, was far above what the world has
been made to believe; its social reforms, agrarian and other, and its halting
steps toward a diluted type of constitutionalism were all that could have been
expected in the circumstances. It was the imported radicalism and the group
interest of the intellectuals that clashed with the spirit of the nation and not
the tsarist monarchy which on the contrary had a strong hold upon the vast
majority of all classes.


<!-- 7 In 1905 factory employment amounted to about one million and a half. -->

From this, two conclusions follow which at first sight seem paradoxical
though no serious student of history will consider them so. On the one hand,
any big or sudden move in the direction desired by those liberal lawyers, doctors,
professors and civil servants that formed the Kadet party (the party of the
Constitutional Democrats) was impossible not so much because their program was inacceptable to the monarchy as because they were so weak. 

Admitting them
to power would have meant admitting an element that commanded not more but
less support among the masses and was not more but less in sympathy with their
feelings and interests than were the groups that ran tsarism. There was no scope
for a bourgeois regime let alone a socialist one. And there was no analogy
between the French situation of 1789 and the Russian situation of 1905. The
social structure that crumbled in 1789 was obsolete, stood in the way of almost
everything that had any vitality in the nation, and was unable to cope with the
fiscal, economic and social problems of the hour. This was not so in the Russia
of 1905. There had been loss of prestige owing to the defeat suffered at the hands
of Japan and there were disaffection and disorder in consequence. But the state
proved itself equal to the tasks not only of suppressing the disorder but also of
attacking the problems behind it. In France the result was Robespierre, in Russia
it was Stolypin. This would not have been possible if the life had gone out of
tsarism as it had gone out of the French ancien régime. There is no reason for
assuming that, but for the strain the World War put upon the social fabric, the
Russian monarchy would have failed to transform itself peacefully and
successfully under the influence of, and in step with, the economic development
of the country.8

8 This analysis, of course, raises questions of great interest concerning the nature of what
we are in the habit of calling historical necessity on the one hand and of the role in the historical
process of the quality of individual leadership on the other. It would, I think, be difficult to
hold that Russia was driven into the war by inexorable necessity. The interests at stake in the
Serbian quarrel were not of vital importance, to say the least. The domestic situation in 1914
was not such as to enforce a policy of military aggression as a last resort. The former no doubt
actuated nationalists, the latter some (not all) of the extreme reactionaries, and both a number
of individuals and groups with axes to grind. But a modicum of common prudence and firmness
in the last of the tsars could no doubt have averted participation in the war. It would have been
more difficult, but it cannot be called impossible, to avert catastrophe later on when the situation
had declared itself and when, after the battle of Gorlice, all hope for military success had gone.
Even after the downfall of the monarchy, it is by no means certain that the Kerensky government
could not have saved the situation by carefully husbanding its resources and refusing to yield
to the importunity of the Allies instead of ordering that desperate last attack. But tsarist society
before the bourgeois revolt, and bourgeois society after it, watched the approaching doom in a
state of paralysis that was as unmistakable as it is difficult to explain. Now the presence of
groupwise incompetence in the one camp and of ability and energy in the other cannot of course
be attributed to chance. But in this case, the incompetence of the old regime merely amounted
to its being not equal to a situation of complete disorganization and this situation could
doubtless have been avoided.

The reader will hardly expect to find that my analysis of Russian socialism and its
environmental conditions agrees with Trotsky’s (History of the Russian Revolution, English
translation by M.Eastman, 1934). All the more significant is the fact that the two do not differ
toto coelo and that, in particular, Trotsky considered the question what would have happened
if the revolutionary movement had impinged upon a “different tsar.” It is true that he dismisses
the obvious inference from considerations of that order. But he recognizes that the Marxist
doctrine does not constrain us to neglect the element of personality, though he does not seem
to admit the full importance of it for a diagnosis of the Russian revolution.


On the other hand, it was precisely because of the fundamental stability
of the social structure that the intellectuals, who could not hope to prevail
by anything like normal methods, were driven into a desperate radicalism
and into courses of criminal violence. Theirs was the kind of radicalism
whose intensity is in inverse proportion to its practical possibilities, the
radicalism of impotence. Assassinations might be futile and productive of
nothing but repression but there was not much else to do. The brutality of
the methods of repression in turn produced retaliation and thus that tragedy
unfolded, the tragedy of cruelty and crime incessantly reinforcing each
other, which is all that the world saw and felt and which it diagnosed as
we should expect.

Now Marx was no putschist. For some of the antics of Russian
revolutionaries, especially for those of the Bakunin type, he harbored as
much hatred as is compatible with contempt. Moreover, he should have
seen—perhaps he did see—that the social and economic structure of
Russia failed to fulfill every one of the conditions which according to his
own doctrine are essential for the success and even for the emergence of
his type of socialism. But if, on logical grounds, this should have
prevented the Russian intellectuals from embracing his teaching, we shall
understand readily why, on the contrary, it was a tremendous success with
them. They were—more or less seriously—revolutionaries and they were
at loose ends. Here was a revolutionary gospel of unsurpassable force.
Marx’s glowing phrases and chiliastic prophecy were exactly what they
needed in order to get out of the dreary desert of nihilism. Moreover, this
compound of economic theory, philosophy and history suited the Russian
taste to perfection. Never mind that the gospel was quite inapplicable to
their case and really held out no promise to them. The believer always
hears what he wants to hear, no matter what the prophet actually says.
The further removed the actual situation was from the state of maturity
which Marx visualized, the more ready were the Russian intellectuals—
not only the professed socialists among them—to look to him for a
solution of their problems.

Thus, a Marxist group emerged as early as 1883, to evolve into the
Social Democratic party in 1898. Leadership and, at the beginning,
membership were primarily intellectual of course, though sufficient
success attended the underground organizing activity among the “masses”
to enable sympathetic observers to speak of a fusion of labor groups
under Marxist leadership. This accounts for the absence of many of the
difficulties met by other Marxist groups in countries with strong labor
unions. In any case at first, the workmen who entered the organization
accepted the intellectuals’ leadership with the utmost docility and hardly even pretended to decide anything for themselves. 

In consequence, developments in doctrine and in action were on strictly Marxian lines and
on a high level. Naturally this drew the blessings of the German
defenders of the faith who, beholding such disarming virtue, evidently
felt that there must be some exceptions to the Marxian thesis that serious
socialism can spring only from full-fledged capitalism. Plekhanov,
however, the founder of the group of 1883 and the leading figure of the
first two decades, whose able and learned contributions to Marxist
doctrine commanded universal respect, really accepted this thesis and
therefore cannot have hoped for the early realization of socialism. While
valiantly fighting the good fight against reformism and all the other
contemporaneous heresies that threatened the purity of the faith, and
while upholding belief in the revolutionary goal and method, this true
Marxist must have felt early misgivings at the rise, within the party, of a
group that seemed bent on action in the immediate future, though he
sympathized with it and with its leader, Lenin.

The inevitable conflict that split the party into Bolsheviks and Mensheviks
(1903) meant something much more serious than a mere disagreement
regarding tactics such as the names of the two groups suggest. At the time
no observer, however experienced, could have realized fully the nature of the
rift. By now the diagnosis should be obvious. The Marxist phraseology
which both groups retained obscured the fact that one of them had
irrevocably broken away from classical Marxism.

Lenin had evidently no illusions concerning the Russian situation. He saw
that the tsarist regime could be successfully attacked only when temporarily
weakened by military defeat and that in the ensuing disorganization a resolute
and well-disciplined group could by ruthless terror overthrow whatever other
regime might attempt to replace it. For this contingency, the likelihood of
which he seems to have realized more clearly than did anyone else, he was
resolved to prepare the appropriate instrument. He had little use for the semi-
bourgeois ideology about the peasants—who of course in Russia constituted
the relevant social problem—and still less for theories about the necessity of
waiting for the workmen to rise of their own initiative in order to accomplish
the grand revolution. What he needed was a well-trained bodyguard of
revolutionist janissaries, deaf to any argument but his own, free from all
inhibitions, impervious to the voices of reason or humanity. Under the
circumstances and in the requisite quality such a troop could be recruited only
from the intellectual stratum, and the best material available was to be found
within the party. His attempt to gain control of the latter therefore amounted
to an attempt to destroy its very soul. The majority and their leader, L.Martov,
must have felt that. He did not criticize Marx or advocate any new departure.


He resisted Lenin in the name of Marx and stood for the Marxist doctrine of
a proletarian mass party. The novel note was struck by Lenin.
Since time immemorial, heretics have invariably claimed that they
were not out to destroy whatever gospel they found in possession but,
on the contrary, that they were trying to restore its pristine purity.
Lenin, adopting the time-honored practice, exalted and out-Marxed
Marx instead of renouncing allegiance. At the most, he gave the lead
implied in the phrase that became so popular with Trotsky and Stalin,
“Marxism in the epoch of imperialism.” And the reader will readily see
that, up to a certain crucial range, it was not difficult for Lenin to adopt
both form and matter of unadulterated Marxism. Yet it is no less easy
to see that from this stronghold he sallied forth to occupy an essentially
un-Marxian position. Un-Marxian was not merely the idea of
socialization by pronunciamiento in an obviously immature situation;
much more so was the idea that “emancipation” was to be not, as the
Marxist dogma has it, the work of the proletariat itself but of a band
of intellectuals officering the rabble. 9 This meant more than a different
view about agitatorial practice and compromises, more than a
disagreement on secondary points of Marxist doctrine. This meant
divorce from its innermost meaning. 10

9 As a matter of fact, contact with criminal elements was formed, though not by Lenin
himself but by (he lieutenants on the spot. This led to the activity of the “ex’s” (shock groups
engaged in practical “expropriations,” i.e., holdups) both in Russia proper and in Poland. This
was pure gangsterdom though western intellectuals swallowed an apologetic “theory” of it.
10 For our purpose it is not necessary to comment further on the details of a well-known
story. The following remarks will suffice. Lenin did not succeed in subjugating the Russian
socialist party whose leaders on the contrary drew away from him as time went on the difficulty
of their situation, arising from their wish to keep up something like a united front without
jettisoning their principles, is well illustrated by Plekhanov’s vacillations. But Lenin did succeed
in keeping his group together, in curbing it into obedience and in adjusting its course to the
problems raised by the revolt of 1905 and its aftermath, including the presence of a Leninist
element in the Duma. At the same time, he succeeded in keeping contact with, and standing
in, the Second International (see below) of which he attended three congresses and in whose
bureau he for a time represented the Russian party. This would hardly have been possible if
his views and activities had been allowed to impress the representatives of the other nations as
they impressed the majority of Russian socialists. As it was, that body, and western socialist
opinion in general, looked upon him simply as the outstanding figure in the left wing of
orthodoxy and bore with him and his unbending extremism, admiring him in some respects and
not taking him too seriously in others. Thus in his sphere of politics he played a double role
that was not without analogy with the double role of the tsarist regime whose international
attitudes (as exemplified by its sponsoring international arbitration and security) also differed
considerably from its attitudes at home.

Neither these achievements nor his contributions to socialist thought—most of them
distinctly mediocre (as, by the way, were those of Trotsky)—would have secured him a place
in the front rank of socialists. Greatness came after Russia s breakdown in the World War and
was as much the result of a unique combination of circumstances that made his weapons
