CHAPTER XXIII
THE INFERENCE
I. S OME I MPLICATIONS O F T HE P RECEDING A NALYSIS
T HE theory of competitive leadership has proved a satisfactory
interpretation of the facts of the democratic process. So we shall
naturally use it in our attempt to unravel the relation between democracy and
a socialist order of things. As has been stated before, socialists claim not only
compatibility; they claim that democracy implies socialism and that there
cannot be true democracy except in socialism. On the other hand, the reader
cannot but be familiar with at least some of the numerous pamphlets that
have been published in this country during the last few years in order to
prove that a planned economy, let alone full-fledged socialism, is completely
incompatible with democracy. Both standpoints are of course easy to
understand from the psychological background of the contest and from the
natural wish of both parties to it to secure the support of a people the great
majority of whom fervently believes in democracy. But suppose we ask:
where lies the truth?
Our analysis in this and preceding parts of this book readily yields an
answer. Between socialism as we defined it and democracy as we defined it
there is no necessary relation: the one can exist without the other. At the
same time there is no incompatibility: in appropriate states of the social
environment the socialist engine can be run on democratic principles.
But observe that these simple statements depend upon our view about what
socialism and democracy are. Therefore they mean not only less than, but also
something different from, what either party to the contest has in mind. For this
reason and also because behind the question of mere compatibility there
inevitably arises the further question whether the democratic method will work
more or less effectively in a socialist as compared with a capitalist regime, we
have still a lot of explaining to do. In particular we must try to formulate the
conditions under which the democratic method can be expected to give
satisfaction. This will be done in the second section of this chapter. Now we shall
look at some of the implications of our analysis of the democratic process.
First of all, according to the view we have taken, democracy does not
mean and cannot mean that the people actually rule in any obvious sense of
the terms “people” and “rule.” Democracy means only that the people have
The Inference 285
the opportunity of accepting or refusing the men who are to rule them. But
since they might decide this also in entirely undemocratic ways, we have had
to narrow our definition by adding a further criterion identifying the
democratic method, viz., free competition among would-be leaders for the
vote of the electorate. Now one aspect of this may be expressed by saying
that democracy is the rule of the politician. It is of the utmost importance
to realize clearly what this implies.
Many exponents of democratic doctrine have striven hard to divest
political activity of any professional connotation. They have held strongly,
sometimes passionately, that politics ought not to be a profession and that
democracy degenerates whenever it becomes one. But this is just ideology.
It is true that, say, businessmen or lawyers may be elected to serve in
parliament and even taken office occasionally and still remain primarily
businessmen and lawyers. It is also true that many who become primarily
politicians continue to rely on other activities for their livelihood. 1 But
normally, personal success in politics, more than occasional rise to cabinet
office in particular, will imply concentration of the professional kind and
relegate a man’s other activities to the rank of sidelines or necessary
chores. If we wish to face facts squarely, we must recognize that, in
modern democracies of any type other than the Swiss, politics will
unavoidably be a career. This in turn spells recognition of a distinct
professional interest in the individual politician and of a distinct group
interest in the political profession as such. It is essential to insert this factor
into our theory. Many a riddle is solved as soon as we take account of it. 2
Among other things we immediately cease to wonder why it is that
politicians so often fail to serve the interest of their class or of the groups
with which they are personally connected. Politically speaking, the man is
still in the nursery who has not absorbed, so as never to forget, the saying
attributed to one of the most successful politicians that ever lived: “What
businessmen do not understand is that exactly as they are dealing in oil so
I am dealing in votes.” 3
1 Illustrations abound of course. A particularly instructive class are the lawyers in the French
chambre and sénat. Some of the outstanding political leaders were also great avocats: think
for instance of Waldeck-Rousseau and of Poincaré. But as a rule (and if we choose to neglect
the cases in which lawyers’ firms will miraculously run by themselves if one of their partners
is a leading politician and enjoys frequent spells of political office) success at the bar and
success in politics do not go together.
2 It should be noticed how this argument links up with our analysis of the position and
behavior of the intellectuals in ch. xiii, Section II.
3 Such a view is sometimes disapproved of as frivolous or cynical. I think, on the
contrary, that it is frivolous or cynical to render lip service to slogans for which in private
one has nothing but an augur’s smile. But it is just as well to point out that the view in
question is not so derogatory to the politician as it might seem. It does not exclude ideals
Socialism and Democracy286
Let us note that there is no reason to believe that this will be either
better or worse in a socialist organization of society. The doctor or engineer
who means to fill the cup of his ambitions by means of success as a doctor
or engineer will still be a distinct type of man and have a distinct pattern
of interests; the doctor or engineer who means to work or reform the
institutions of his country will still be another type and have another
pattern of interests.
Second, students of political organization have always felt doubts
concerning the administrative efficiency of democracy in large and complex
societies. In particular it has been urged that, as compared with other
arrangements, the efficiency of democratic government is inevitably impaired
because of the tremendous loss of energy which the incessant battle in
parliament and outside of it imposes upon the leading men. It is further
impaired, for the same reason, by the necessity of bending policies to the
exigencies of political warfare. Neither proposition is open to doubt. Both are
but corollaries to our previous statement that the democratic method produces
legislation and administration as by-products of the struggle for political office.
Visualize, for instance, the situation of a Prime Minister. Where
governments are as unstable as they have been in France from 1871 to the
breakdown in 1940, his attention must be almost monopolized by a task
that is like trying to build a pyramid from billiard balls. Only men of quite
unusual force under such conditions can have had any energy to spare for
current administrative work on bills and so on; and only such exceptional
men can have acquired any authority with their civil service subordinates
who like everybody else knew that their chief would be out before long.
Of course this is not anything like as bad in the English case. Unstable
governmental combinations are exceptions, and normally a government can
count on a life of about five or six years. Ministers can settle down in their
offices and are not so easy to unhorse in Parliament. But this does not
mean that they are exempt from fighting. There always is a current contest
and if governments are not constantly on trial for their lives it is only
because they are as a rule able to smother current attacks this side of the
danger point. The Prime Minister has to watch his opponents all the time,
to lead his own flock incessantly, to be ready to step into breaches that
might open at any moment, to keep his hand on the measures under debate,
to control his cabinet—all of which amounts to saying that, when
or a sense of duty. The analogy with the businessman will again help to make this clear.
As I have said in another place, no economist who knows anything about the realities of
business life will hold for a moment that sense of duty and ideals about service and
efficiency play no role in shaping businessmen’s behavior. Yet the same economist is
within his rights if he bases his explanation of that behavior on a schema that rests on
the profit motive.
The Inference 287
Parliament is in session, he is lucky if he has a couple of hours in the
morning left for thinking things over and for real work. Individual
miscarriages and defeats of a government as a whole are not infrequently
due to physical exhaustion of the leading man or men. 4 How could he, so
it might well be asked, undertake to lead and supervise an administrative
organism that is to embrace all the problems of economic life?
But this wastage of governmental energy is not all. The incessant
competitive struggle to get into office or to stay in it imparts to every
consideration of policies and measures the bias so admirably expressed by
the phrase about “dealing in votes.” The fact that in a democracy government
must attend primarily to the political values of a policy or a bill or an
administrative act—that is to say, the very fact that enforces the democratic
principle of the government’s dependence upon the voting of parliament and
of the electorate—is likely to distort all the pro’s and con’s. In particular, it
forces upon the men at or near the helm a short-run view and makes it
extremely difficult for them to serve such long-run interests of the nation as
may require consistent work for far-off ends; foreign policy, for instance, is
in danger of degenerating into domestic politics. And it makes it no less
difficult to dose measures rationally. The dosing that a government decides
on with an eye to its political chances is not necessarily the one that will
produce the results most satisfactory to the nation.
Thus the prime minister in a democracy might be likened to a horseman
who is so fully engrossed in trying to keep in the saddle that he cannot plan
his ride, or to a general so fully occupied with making sure that his army will
accept his orders that he must leave strategy to take care of itself. And this
remains true (and must, in the case of some countries such as France and Italy,
be frankly recognized as one of the sources from which anti-democratic feeling
has spread) in spite of the facts that may be invoked in extenuation.
There is, to begin with, the fact that the instances in which those
consequences show to an extent that may be felt to be unbearable can often
be explained on the ground that the social pattern is not up to the task of
working democratic institutions. As the examples of France and Italy show,
this may happen in countries that are much more civilized than some which
4 To give a portentous example: no student of the origins, of the World War of 1914–1918
can fail to be struck by the passivity of the English government from the murder of the
Archduke to the declarations of war. Not that no efforts were made to avoid the conflagration.
But they were singularly ineffective and fell far short of what could have been done. It is of
course possible to explain this on the theory that the Asquith government did not really wish
to avoid the war. But if this theory be considered unsatisfactory, as I think it should be, then
we are driven back upon another: it is just possible that the gentlemen on the treasury bench
were so absorbed in their political game that they did not wake up to the dangers of the
international situation until it was too late.
Socialism and Democracy288
do succeed in that task. But nevertheless the weight of the criticism is
thereby reduced to the statement that the satisfactory working of the
democratic method is contingent upon fulfillment of certain conditions—a
subject that will be taken up presently.
Then there is the question of the alternative. These weaknesses are
obviously not absent in non-democratic patterns. Paving one’s way to a
leading position, say, at a court, may absorb quite as much energy and
distort one’s views about issues quite as much as does the democratic
struggle though that waste or distortion does not stand out so publicly. This
amounts to saying that attempts at comparative appraisal of engines of
government will have to take account of many other factors besides the
institutional principles involved.
Moreover, some of us will reply to the critic that a lower level of
governmental efficiency may be exactly what we want. We certainly do not
want to be the objects of dictatorial efficiency, mere material for deep games.
Such a thing as the Gosplan may at present be impossible in the United
States. But does not this prove precisely that, just like the Russian Gosplan,
its hypothetical analogue in this country would violate the spirit as well as
the organic structure of the commonwealth?
Finally, something can be done to reduce the pressure on the leading men
by appropriate institutional devices. The American arrangement for instance
shows up to advantage on this point. The American “prime minister” must
no doubt keep his eye on his political chessboard. But he need not feel
responsible for every individual measure. And, not sitting in Congress, he
is at least exempt from the physical strain this would involve. He has all the
opportunity he wants to nurse his strength.
Third, our analysis in the preceding chapter brings into bold relief the
problem of the quality of the men the democratic method selects for
positions of leadership. The well-known argument about this hardly needs
recalling: the democratic method creates professional politicians whom
it then turns into amateur administrators and “statesmen.” Themselves
lacking all the acquirements necessary for dealing with the tasks that
confront them, they appoint Lord Macaulay’s “judges without law and
diplomatists without French,” ruining the civil service and discouraging
all the best elements in it. Worse still, there is another point, distinct from
any question of specialized competence and experience: the qualities of
intellect and character that make a good candidate are not necessarily
those that make a good administrator, and selection by means of success
at the polls may work against the people who would be successes at the
head of affairs. And even if the products of this selection prove successes
in office these successes may well be failures for the nation. The
The Inference 289
politician who is a good tactician can successfully survive any number
of administrative miscarriages.
Recognition of the elements of truth in all this should again be tempered
by the recognition of the extenuating facts. In particular, the case for
democracy stands to gain from a consideration of the alternatives: no system
of selection whatever the social sphere—with the possible exception of
competitive capitalism—tests exclusively the ability to perform and selects in
the way a stable selects its Derby crack. Though to varying degrees, all systems
put premiums on other qualities as well, qualities that are often inimical to
performance. But we may perhaps go further than this. It is not quite true that
in the average case political success proves nothing for a man or that the
politician is nothing but an amateur. There is one very important thing that he
knows professionally, viz., the handling of men. And, as a broad rule at least,
the ability to win a position of political leadership will be associated with a
certain amount of personal force and also of other aptitudes that will come in
usefully in a prime minister’s workshop. There are after all many rocks in the
stream that carries politicians to national office which are not entirely
ineffective in barring the progress of the moron or the windbag.
That in such matters general argument one way or another does not lead
to a definite result is only what we should expect. It is much more curious
and significant that factual evidence is not, at first sight at least, any more
conclusive. Nothing is easier than to compile an impressive list of failures
of the democratic method, especially if we include not only cases in which
there was actual breakdown or national discomfiture but also those in which,
though the nation led a healthy and prosperous life, the performance in the
political sector was clearly substandard relative to the performance in others.
But it is just as easy to marshal hardly less impressive evidence in favor of
the politician. To cite one outstanding illustration: It is true that in antiquity
war was not so technical an affair as it has become of late. Yet one would
think that the ability to make a success at it had even then very little to do
with the ability to get oneself elected to political office. All the Roman
generals of the republican era however were politicians and all of them got
their commands directly through the elective offices they held or had
previously held. Some of the worst disasters were due to this. But on the
whole, these politician-soldiers did remarkably well.
Why is that so? There can be only one answer to this question.
