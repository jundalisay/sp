(b) The theory of simple and discriminating monopoly teaches that,
excepting a limiting case, monopoly price is higher and monopoly output
smaller than competitive price and competitive output. This is true
provided that the method and organization of production—and everything
else—are exactly the same in both cases. Actually however there are
superior methods available to the monopolist which either are not
dawn to the effect that even though some pressure can be exerted on them in the short run,
long-run developments might eventually destroy practically all that was left on the lists.

<!-- 17 There was more excuse for that uncritical attitude in the case of Adam Smith and the
classics in general than there is in the case of their successors because big business in our sense
had not then emerged. But even so they went too far. In part this was due to the fact that they
had no satisfactory theory of monopoly which induced them not only to apply the term rather
promiscuously (Adam Smith and even Senior interpreted for instance the rent of land as a
monopoly gain) but also to look upon the monopolists’ power of exploitation as practically
unlimited which is of course wrong even for the most extreme cases.

18 This instance illustrates the way in which the term keeps on creeping into illegitimate
uses. Protection of agriculture and a monopoly of agrarian products are entirely different things.
The struggle was over protection and not over a non-existent cartel of either landowners or
farmers. But in fighting protection it was just as well to beat up for applause. And there was
evidently no simpler means of doing so than by calling protectionists monopolists -->

available at all to a crowd of competitors or are not available to them so
readily: for there are advantages which, though not strictly unattainable
on the competitive level of enterprise, are as a matter of fact secured only
on the monopoly level, for instance, because monopolization may
increase the sphere of influence of the better, and decrease the sphere of
influence of the inferior, brains, 19 or because the monopoly enjoys a
disproportionately higher financial standing. Whenever this is so, then
that proposition is no longer true. In other words, this element of the case
for competition may fail completely because monopoly prices are not
necessarily higher or monopoly outputs smaller than competitive prices
and outputs would be at the levels of productive and organizational
efficiency that are within the reach of the type of firm compatible with
the competitive hypothesis.

There cannot be any reasonable doubt that under the conditions of our
epoch such superiority is as a matter of fact the outstanding feature of
the typical large-scale unit of control, though mere size is neither
necessary nor sufficient for it. These units not only arise in the process
of creative destruction and function in a way entirely different from the
static schema, but in many cases of decisive importance they provide the
necessary form for the achievement. They largely create what they
exploit. Hence the usual conclusion about their influence on long-run
output would be invalid even if they were genuine monopolies in the
technical sense of the term.

Motivation is quite immaterial. Even if the opportunity to set monopolist
prices were the sole object, the pressure of the improved methods or of a
huge apparatus would in general tend to shift the point of the monopolist’s
optimum toward or beyond the competitive cost price in the above sense,
thus doing the work—partly, wholly, or more than wholly—of the
competitive mechanism,20 even if restriction is practiced and excess capacity
19 The reader should observe that while, as a broad rule, that particular type of superiority
is simply indisputable, the inferior brains, especially if their owners are entirely eliminated,
are not likely to admit it and that the public’s and the recording economists’ hearts go out to
them and not to the others. This may have something to do with a tendency to discount the
cost or quality advantages of quasi-monopolist combination that is at present as pronounced as
was the exaggeration of them in the typical prospectus or announcement of sponsors of such
combinations.

20 The Aluminum Company of America is not a monopoly in the technical sense as defined
above, among other reasons because it had to build up its demand schedule, which fact
suffices to exclude a behavior conforming to the Cournot-Marshall schema. But most
economists call it so and in the dearth of genuine cases we will for the purposes of this note
do the same. From 1890 to 1929 the price of the basic product of this single seller fell to
about 12 per cent or, correcting for the change in price level (B.L.S. index of wholesale
prices), to about 8.8 per cent. Output rose from 30 metric tons to 103,400. Protection by
patent ceased in 1909. 

Argument from costs and profits in criticism of this “monopoly” must is in evidence all along. Of course if the methods of production, organization and so on are not improved by or in connection with monopolization as is
the case with an ordinary cartel, the classical theorem about monopoly price
and output comes into its own again. 21 So does another popular idea, viz.,
that monopolization has a soporific effect. For this, too, it is not difficult to
find examples. But no general theory should be built upon it. For, especially
in manufacturing industry, a monopoly position is in general no cushion to
sleep on. As it can be gained, so it can be retained only by alertness and
energy. What soporific influence there is in modern business is due to
another cause that will be mentioned later.

(c) In the short run, genuine monopoly positions or positions
approximating monopoly are much more frequent. The grocer in a village
on the Ohio may be a true monopolist for hours or even days during an
inundation. Every successful corner may spell monopoly for the moment.

A firm specializing in paper labels for beer bottles may be so
circumstanced—potential competitors realizing that what seem to be good
profits would be immediately destroyed by their entering the field—that it
can move at pleasure on a moderate but still finite stretch of the demand
curve, at least until the metal label smashes that demand curve to pieces.
New methods of production or new commodities, especially the latter, do
not per se confer monopoly, even if used or produced by a single firm. The
product of the new method has to compete with the products of the old ones
and the new commodity has to be introduced, i.e., its demand schedule has
to be built up. As a rule neither patents nor monopolistic practices avail
against that. But they may in cases of spectacular superiority of the new
device, particularly if it can be leased like shoe machinery; or in cases of
new commodities, the permanent demand schedule for which has been
established before the patent has expired.

Thus there an element of genuine monopoly gain in those entrepreneurial profits which are the prizes offered by
capitalist society to the successful innovator. But the quantitative
importance of that clement, its volatile nature and its function in the
process in which it emerges put it in a class by itself. The main value to a
concern of a single seller position that is secured by patent or monopolistic
strategy does not consist so much in the opportunity to behave temporarily
take it for granted that a multitude of competing firms would have been about equally
successful in cost-reducing research, in the economical development of the productive
apparatus, in teaching new uses for the product and in avoiding wasteful breakdowns. This
is, in fact, being assumed by criticism of this kind, i.e., the propelling factor of modern
capitalism is being assumed away.


according to the monopolist schema, as in the protection it affords against
temporary disorganization of the market and the space it secures for long-
range planning. Here however the argument merges into the analysis
submitted before.
