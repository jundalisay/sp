III. D EMOCRACY I N T HE S OCIALIST O RDER

1. In setting forth our conclusions we had better begin with the relation
between democracy and the capitalist order of things.
The ideology of democracy as reflected by the classical doctrine rests on
a rationalist scheme of human action and of the values of life. By virtue of
a previous argument (Chapter XI) this fact would in itself suffice to suggest
that it is of bourgeois origin. History clearly confirms this suggestion:
historically, the modern democracy rose along with capitalism, and in causal
7 In ancient Rome whose term we are in the habit of misusing, an autocracy developed that
for several centuries displayed certain features not dissimilar to those of modern dictatorships
though the analogy should not be pushed too far. But that autocracy did not make use of the
republican office of dictator except in one case, that of G.Julius Caesar. Sulla’s dictatorship
was simply a temporary magistracy created for a definite purpose (constitutional reform). And
there are no other but quite “regular” cases.
The Inference 297
connection with it. But the same holds true for democratic practice:
democracy in the sense of our theory of competitive leadership presided over
the process of political and institutional change by which the bourgeoisie
reshaped, and from its own point of view rationalized, the social and political
structure that preceded its ascendancy: the democratic method was the
political tool of that reconstruction. We have seen that the democratic method
works, particularly well, also in certain extra- and pre-capitalist societies. But
modern democracy is a product of the capitalist process.
Whether or not democracy is one of those products of capitalism which
are to die out with it is of course another question. And still another is how
well or ill capitalist society qualifies for the task of working the democratic
method it evolved.
As regards the latter question, it is clear that capitalist society qualifies
well in one respect. The bourgeoisie has a solution that is peculiar to it for
the problem of how the sphere of political decision can be reduced to those
proportions which are manageable by means of the method of competitive
leadership. The bourgeois scheme of things limits the sphere of politics by
limiting the sphere of public authority; its solution is in the ideal of the
parsimonious state that exists primarily in order to guarantee bourgeois
legality and to provide a firm frame for autonomous individual endeavor in
all fields. If, moreover, account be taken of the pacific—at any rate, anti-
militarist—and free-trade tendencies we have found to be inherent in
bourgeois society, it will be seen that the importance of the role of political
decision in the bourgeois state can, in principle at least, be scaled down to
almost any extent that the disabilities of the political sector may require.
Now this kind of state has no doubt ceased to appeal to us. Bourgeois
democracy is certainly a very special historical case and any claims that may
be made on behalf of it are obviously contingent upon acceptance of
standards which are no longer ours. But it is absurd to deny that this solution
which we dislike is a solution and that bourgeois democracy is democracy.
On the contrary, as its colors fade it is all the more important to recognize
how colorful it was in the time of its vitality; how wide and equal the
opportunities it offered to the families (if not to the individuals); how large
the personal freedom it granted to those who passed its tests (or to their
children). It is also important to recognize how well it stood, for some
decades at least, the strain of uncongenial conditions and how well it
functioned, when faced by demands that were outside of and hostile to the
bourgeois interests.
Also in another respect capitalist society in its meridian qualified well for
the task of making democracy a success. It is easier for a class whose interests
are best served by being left alone to practice democratic self-restraint than it
Socialism and Democracy298
is for classes that naturally try to live on the state. The bourgeois who is
primarily absorbed in his private concerns is in general—as long as these
concerns are not seriously threatened—much more likely to display tolerance
of political differences and respect for opinions he does not share than any
other type of human being. Moreover so long as bourgeois standards are
dominant in a society this attitude will tend to spread to other classes as well.
The English landed interest accepted the defeat of 1845 with relatively good
grace; English labor fought for the removal of disabilities but until the
beginning of the present century was slow to claim privileges. It is true that
in other countries such self-restraint was much less in evidence. These
deviations from the principle were not always serious or always associated with
capitalist interests only. But in some cases political life all but resolved itself
into a struggle of pressure groups and in many cases practices that failed to
conform to the spirit of the democratic method have become important enough
to distort its modus operandi. That there “cannot” be true democracy in the
capitalist order is nevertheless an obvious over-statement.8
In both respects however capitalism is rapidly losing the advantages it
used to possess. Bourgeois democracy which is wedded to that ideal of the
state has for some time been working with increasing friction. In part this
was due to the fact that, as we have seen before, the democratic method
never works at its best when nations are much divided on fundamental
questions of social structure. And this difficulty in turn proved particularly
serious, because bourgeois society signally failed to fulfill another condition
for making the democratic method function. The bourgeoisie produced
individuals who made a success at political leadership upon entering a
political class of non-bourgeois origin, but it did not produce a successful
political stratum of its own although, so one should think, the third
generations of the industrial families had all the opportunity to form one.
Why this was so has been fully explained in Part II. All these facts together
seem to suggest a pessimistic prognosis for this type of democracy. They also
suggest an explanation of the apparent ease with which in some cases it
surrendered to dictatorship.
2. The ideology of classical socialism is the offspring of bourgeois
ideology. In particular, it fully shares the latter’s rationalist and utilitarian
background and many of the ideas and ideals that entered the classical
8 What should be said is that there are some deviations from the principle of democracy
which link up with the presence of organized capitalist interests. But thus corrected, the
statement is true both from the standpoint of the classical and from the standpoint of our own
theory of democracy. From the first standpoint, the result reads that the means at the disposal
of private interests are often used in order to thwart the will of the people. From the second
standpoint, the result read: that those private means are often used in order to interfere with
the working of the mechanism of competitive leadership.
The Inference 299
doctrine of democracy. So far as this goes, socialists in fact experienced no
difficulty whatever in appropriating this part of the bourgeois inheritance and
in making out a case for the proposition that those elements of the classical
doctrine which socialism is unable to absorb—the emphasis on protection
of private property for instance—are really at variance with its fundamental
principles. Creeds of this kind could survive even in entirely non-democratic
forms of socialism and we may trust the scribes and pharisees to bridge by
suitable phrases any gap there may be between creed and practice. But it is
the practice that interests us—the fate of democratic practice as interpreted
by the doctrine of competitive leadership. And so, since we have seen that
non-democratic socialism is perfectly possible, the real question is again how
well or ill socialism qualifies for the task of making the democratic method
function should it attempt to do so.
The essential point to grasp is this. No responsible person can view with
equanimity the consequences of extending the democratic method, that is to
say the sphere of “politics,” to all economic affairs Believing that democratic
socialism means precisely this, such a person will naturally conclude that
democratic socialism must fail. But this does not necessarily follow. As has
been pointed out before, extension of the range of public management does
not imply corresponding extension of the range of political management.
Conceivably, the former may be extended so as to absorb a nation’s
economic affairs while the latter still remains within the boundaries set by
the limitations of the democratic method.
It does follow however that in socialist society these limitations will raise
a much more serious problem. For socialist society lacks the automatic
restrictions imposed upon the political sphere by the bourgeois scheme of
things. Moreover, in socialist society it will no longer be possible to find
comfort in the thought that the inefficiencies of political procedure are after
all a guarantee of freedom. Lack of efficient management will spell lack of
bread. However, the agencies that are to operate the economic engine—the
Central Board we met in Part III as well as the subordinate bodies entrusted
with the management of individual industries or concerns—may be so
organized and manned as to be sufficiently exempt in the fulfillment of their
current duties from interference by politicians or, for that matter, by fussing
citizens’ committees or by their workmen. That is to say, they may be
sufficiently removed from the atmosphere of political strife as to display no
inefficiencies other than those associated with the term Bureaucracy. And
even these can be much reduced by an appropriate concentration of
responsibility on individuals and by a system of well-chosen incentives and
penalties, of which the methods of appointment and promotion are the most
important part.
Socialism and Democracy300
Serious socialists, when off the stump and in a responsible mood, have
always been aware of this problem and also of the fact that “democracy”
is no answer to it. An interesting illustration is afforded by the deliberations
of the German Committee on Socialization (Sozialisierungs Kommission).
In 1919, when the German Social Democratic party had definitely set its
face against bolshevism, the more radical among its members still believed
that some measure of socialization was imminent as a matter of practical
necessity and a committee was accordingly appointed in order to define
aims and to recommend methods. It did not consist exclusively of socialists
but socialist influence was dominating. Karl Kautsky was chairman.
Definite recommendations were made only about coal and even these,
arrived at under the gathering clouds of anti-socialist sentiment, are not
very interesting. All the more interesting are the views that emerged in
discussion at the time when more ambitious hopes still prevailed. The idea
that managers of plants should be elected by the workmen of the same
plants was frankly and unanimously condemned. The workmen’s councils
that had grown up during the months of universal breakdown were objects
of dislike and suspicion. The committee, trying to get away as far as
possible from the popular ideas about Industrial Democracy, 9 did its best
to shape them into an innocuous mold and cared little for developing their
functions. All the more did it care for strengthening the authority and
safeguarding the independence of the managerial personnel. Much thought
was bestowed on how to prevent managers from losing capitalist vitality
and sinking into bureaucratic ruts. In fact—if it be possible to speak of
results of discussions that were soon to lose practical importance—these
socialist managers would not have differed very much from their capitalist
predecessors, and in many cases the same individuals would have been
reappointed. We thus reach, by a different route, the conclusion already
arrived at in Part III.
But we are now in a position to link up this conclusion with an answer
to the problem of democracy in socialism. In a sense, of course, the present-
day forms and organs of democratic procedure are as much the outgrowth
of the structure and the issues of the bourgeois world as is the fundamental
9 Industrial or Economic Democracy is a phrase that figures in so many quasiutopias
that it has retained very little precise meaning. Mainly, I think, it means two things: first,
the trade-union rule over industrial relations; second, democratization of the monarchic
factory by workmen’s representation on boards or other devices calculated to secure them
influence on the introduction of technological improvements, business policy in general
and, of course, discipline in the plant in particular, including methods of “hiring and firing.”
Profit-sharing is a nostrum of a subgroup of schemes. It is safe to say that much of this
economic democracy will vanish into thin air in a socialist regime. Nor is this so offensive
as it may sound. For many of the interests this kind of democracy is intended to safeguard
will then cease to exist.
The Inference 301
principle of democracy itself. But this is no reason why they should have to
disappear along with capitalism General elections, parties, parliaments,
cabinets and prime ministers may still prove to be the most convenient
instruments for dealing with the agenda that the socialist order may reserve
for political decision. The list of these agenda will be relieved of all those
items that at present arise from the clash of private interests and from the
necessity of regulating them. Instead there will be new ones. There will be
such questions to decide as what the volume of investment should be or how
existing rules for the distribution of the social product should be amended
and so on. General debates about efficiency, investigation committees of the
type of the English Royal Commissions would continue to fulfill their
present functions.
Thus the politicians in the cabinet, and in particular the politician at the
head of the Ministry of Production, would no doubt assert, the influence of
the political element, both by their legislative measures concerning the
general principles of running the economic engine and by their power to
appoint which could not be entirely absent or entirely formal. But they need
not do so to an extent incompatible with efficiency. And the Minister of
Production need not interfere more with the internal working of individual
industries than English Ministers of Health or of War interfere with the
internal working of their respective departments.
3. It goes without saying that operating socialist democracy in the way
indicated would be a perfectly hopeless task except in the case of a society
that fulfills all the requirements of “maturity” listed in Part III, including, in
particular, the ability to establish the socialist order in a democratic way and
the existence of a bureaucracy of adequate standing and experience. But a
society that does fulfill these requirements—I shall not deal with any other—
would first of all command an advantage of possibly decisive importance.
I have emphasized that democracy cannot be expected to function
satisfactorily unless the vast majority of the people in all classes are resolved
to abide by the rules of the democratic game and that this in turn implies that
they are substantially agreed on the fundamentals of their institutional
structure. At present the latter condition fails to be fulfilled. So many people
have renounced, and so many more are going to renounce, allegiance to the
standards of capitalist society that on this ground alone democracy is bound
to work with increasing friction. At the stage visualized however, socialism
may remove the rift. It may reestablish agreement as to the tectonic principles
of the social fabric. If it does, then the remaining antagonisms will be exactly
of the kind with which the democratic method is well able to cope.
It has also been pointed out in Part III that those remaining antagonisms
will be further decreased in number and importance by the elimination of
Socialism and Democracy302
clashing capitalist interests. The relations between agriculture and industry,
small-scale and large-scale industry, steel-producing and steel-consuming
industries, protectionist and export industries will—or may—cease to be
political questions to be settled by the relative weights of pressure groups
and become technical questions to which technicians would be able to give
unemotional and unequivocal answers. Though it may be utopian to expect
that there would be no distinct economic interests or conflicts between them,
and still more utopian to expect that there would be no non-economic issues
to disagree about, a good case may be made out for expecting that the sum
total of controversial matter would be decreased even as compared with what
it was in intact capitalism. There would, for instance, be no silver men.
Political life would be purified.
On the face of it, socialism has no obvious solution to offer for the
problem solved in other forms of society by the presence of a political class
of stable traditions. I have said before that there will be a political
profession. There may evolve a political set, about the quality of which it
is idle to speculate.
Thus far socialism scores. It might still be argued that this score can be
easily balanced by the importance and likelihood of possible deviations. To
some extent we have provided for this by insisting on economic maturity
which among other things implies that no great sacrifices need be required
of one generation for the benefit of a later one. But even if there is no
necessity for sweating the people by means of a Gosplan, the task of keeping
the democratic course may prove to be extremely delicate. Circumstances in
which the individuals at the helm would normally succeed in solving it are
perhaps no easier to imagine than circumstances in which, faced by a
spectacle of paralysis spreading from the political sector all over the nation’s
economy, they might be driven into a course of action which must always
have some temptation for men beholding the tremendous power over the
people inherent in the socialist organization. After all, effective management
of the socialist economy means dictatorship not of but over the proletariat
in the factory. The men who are there so strictly disciplined would, it is true,
be sovereign at the elections. But just as they may use this sovereignty in
order to relax the discipline of the factory, so governments—precisely the
governments which have the future of the nation at heart—may avail
themselves of this discipline in order to restrict this sovereignty. As a matter
of practical necessity, socialist democracy may eventually turn out to be more
of a sham than capitalist democracy ever was.

In any case, that democracy will not mean increased personal freedom.

And, once more, it will mean no closer approximation to the ideals enshrined
in the classical doctrine.
