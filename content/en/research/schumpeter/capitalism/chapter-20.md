We have a starting point from which to proceed with our investigation. But
a definition that is to serve us in an attempt to analyze the relations between
democracy and socialism is not yet in sight. A few preliminary difficulties
still bar the outlook.

It would not help us much to look up Aristotle who used the term in order
to designate one of the deviations from his ideal of a well-ordered
commonwealth. But some light may be shed on our difficulties by recalling
the meaning we have attached to the term Political Method. It means the
method a nation uses for arriving at decisions. Such a method we ought to
be able to characterize by indicating by whom and how these decisions are
made. Equating “making decisions” to “ruling,” we might then define
democracy as Rule by the People. Why is that not sufficiently precise?
It is not because it covers as many meanings as there are combinations
between all the possible definitions of the concept “people” (demos, the
Roman populus) and all the possible definitions of the concept “to rule”
(kratein), and because these definitions are not independent of the argument about democracy. 

<!-- 9 In particular it is not true that democracy will always safeguard freedom of conscience
better than autocracy. Witness the most famous of all trials. Pilate was from the standpoint of
the Jews, certainly the representative of autocracy. Yet he tried to protect freedom. And he
yielded to a democracy. -->



As regards the first concept, the populus in the
constitutional sense may exclude slaves completely and other inhabitants
partially; the law may recognize any number of status between slavery and
full or even privileged citizenship. And irrespective of legal discrimination,
different groups considered themselves as the People at different times. 11
Of course we might say that a democratic society is one that does not thus
differentiate, at least in matters concerning public affairs, such as the
franchise. But, first, there have been nations that practiced discrimination of
the kind alluded to and nevertheless displayed most of those characteristics
which are usually associated with democracy. Second, discrimination can
never be entirely absent. For instance, in no country, however democratic,
is the right to vote extended below a specified age. If, however, we ask for
the rationale of this restriction we find that it also applies to an indefinite
number of inhabitants above the age limit. If persons below the age limit are
not allowed to vote, we cannot call a nation undemocratic that for the same
or analogous reasons excludes other people as well. Observe: it is not
relevant whether we, the observers, admit the validity of those reasons or of
the practical rules by which they are made to exclude portions of the
population; all that matters is that the society in question admits it. 

Nor
should it be objected that, while this may apply to exclusions on grounds of
personal unfitness (e.g., “age of discretion”), it does not apply to wholesale
exclusion on grounds that have nothing to do with the ability to make an
intelligent use of the right to vote. For fitness is a matter of opinion and of
degree. Its presence must be established by some set of rules. Without
absurdity or insincerity it is possible to hold that fitness is measured by one’s
ability to support oneself. In a commonwealth of strong religious conviction
it may be held—again without any absurdity or insincerity—that dissent
disqualifies or, in an anti-feminist commonwealth, sex. 

A race-conscious
nation may associate fitness with racial considerations. 12 And so on. The
salient point, to repeat, is not what we think about any or all of these possible
disabilities. The salient point is that, given appropriate views on those and
similar subjects, disqualifications on grounds of economic status, religion and
11 See, e.g., the definition given by Voltaire in his Letters Concerning the English
Nation (published in English, 1733; reprint of the first edition published by Peter Davies,
1926, p. 49): “the most numerous, the most useful, even the most virtuous, and
consequently the most venerable part of mankind, consisting of those who study the laws
and the sciences; of traders, of artificers, in a word, of all who were not tyrants; that is,
those who are call’d the people.” At present “people” is likely to mean the “masses,”
but Voltaire’s concept comes nearer to identifying that people for which the Constitution
of this country was written.

<!-- 12 Thus the United States excludes Orientals and Germany excludes Jews from
citizenship; in the southern part of the United States Negroes are also often deprived
of the vote. -->

sex will enter into the same class with disqualifications which we all of us
consider compatible with democracy. We may disapprove of them to be sure.
But if we do so we should in good logic disapprove of the theories about
the importance of property, religion, sex, race and so on, rather than call such
societies undemocratic. 

Religious fervor for instance is certainly compatible
with democracy however we define the latter. There is a type of religious
attitude to which a heretic seems worse than a madman. Does it not follow
that the heretic should be barred from participation in political decisions as
is the lunatic. 13 Must we not leave it to every populus to define himself?
This inescapable conclusion is usually evaded by introducing additional
assumptions into the theory of the democratic process, some of which will
be discussed in the next two chapters. Meanwhile we will merely note that
it clears much mist from the road. Among other things it reveals the fact that
the relation between democracy and liberty must be considerably more
complex than we are in the habit of believing.

Still more serious difficulties arise with respect to the second element that
enters into the concept of democracy, the kratein. The nature and the modus
operandi of any “rule” are always difficult to explain. Legal powers never
guarantee the ability to use them yet are important pegs as well as fetters;
traditional prestige always counts for something but never for everything;
personal success and, partly independent of success, personal weight act and
are reacted upon by both the legal and the traditional components of the
institutional pattern. No monarch or dictator or group of oligarchs is ever
absolute. They rule not only subject to the data of the national situation but
also subject to the necessity of acting with some people, of getting along
with others, of neutralizing still others and of subduing the rest. And this may
be done in an almost infinite variety of ways each of which will determine
what a given formal arrangement really means either for the nation in which
it obtains or for the scientific observer; to speak of monarchy as if it meant
a definite thing spells dilettantism. But if it is the people, however defined,
who are to do the kratein, still another problem emerges. How is it
technically possible for “people” to rule?


There is a class of cases in which this problem does not arise, at least not
in an acute form. In small and primitive communities with a simple social
structure 14 in which there is not much to disagree on, it is conceivable that
13 To the bolshevik any non-bolshevik is in the same category. Hence the rule of the
Bolshevik party would not per se entitle us to call the Soviet Republic undemocratic. We are
entitled to call it so only if the Bolshevik party itself is managed in an undemocratic
manner—as obviously it is.

<!-- 14 Smallness of numbers and local concentration of the people are essential.
Primitivity of civilization and simplicity of structure are less so but greatly facilitate the
functioning of democracy. -->


all the individuals who form the people as defined by the constitution
actually participate in all the duties of legislation and administration. Certain
difficulties may still remain even in such cases and the psychologist of
collective behavior would still have something to say about leadership,
advertising and other sources of deviation from the popular ideal of a
democracy. Nevertheless there would be obvious sense in speaking of the
will or the action of the community or the people as such—of government
by the people—particularly if the people arrive at political decisions by
means of debates carried out in the physical presence of all, as they did, for
instance, in the Greek polis or in the New England town meeting. The latter
case, sometimes referred to as the case of “direct democracy,” has in fact
served as a starting point for many a political theorist.

In all other cases our problem does arise but we might dispose of it
with comparative ease provided we are prepared to drop government by
the people and to substitute for it government approved by the people.
There is much to be said for doing this. Many of the propositions we
usually aver about democracy will hold true for all governments that
command the general allegiance of a large majority of their people or,
better still, of a large majority of every class of their people. This applies
in particular to the virtues usually associated with the democratic method:
human dignity, the contentment that comes from the feeling that by and
large things political do conform to one’s ideas of how they should be,
the coordination of politics with public opinion, the citizen’s attitude of
confidence in and cooperation with government, the reliance of the latter
on the respect and support of the man in the street—all this and much
besides which to many of us will seem the very esssence of democracy
is quite satisfactorily covered by the idea of government approved by the
people. And since it is obvious that excepting the case of “direct
democracy” the people as such can never actually rule or govern, the case
for this definition seems to be complete.

All the same we cannot accept it. Instances abound—perhaps they are the
majority of historical cases—of autocracies, both dei gratia and dictatorial,
of the various monarchies of non-autocratic type, of aristocratic and
plutocratic oligarchies, which normally commanded the unquestioned, often
fervent, allegiance of an overwhelming majority of all classes of their people
and which, considering their environmental conditions, did very well in
securing what most of us believe the democratic method should secure.
There is point in emphasizing this and in recognizing the large element of
democracy—in this sense—that entered into those cases. Such an antidote
to the cult of mere forms, of mere phraseologies even, would indeed be
highly desirable. But this does not alter the fact that by accepting this solution we should lose the phenomenon we wish to identify: democracies
would be merged in a much wider class of political arrangement which
contains individuals of clearly non-democratic complexion.

Our failure teaches us one thing however. Beyond “direct” democracy lies
an infinite wealth of possible forms in which the “people” may partake in
the business of ruling or influence or control those who actually do the
ruling. None of these forms, particularly none of the workable ones, has any
obvious or exclusive title to being described as Government by the People
if these words are to be taken in their natural sense. If any of them is to
acquire such a title it can do so only by virtue of an arbitrary convention
defining the meaning to be attached to the term “to rule.” Such a convention
is always possible of course: the people never actually rule but they can
always be made to do so by definition.

The legal “theories” of democracy that evolved in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries were precisely intended to provide such
definitions as would link certain actual or ideal forms of government
to the ideology of the Rule by the People. Why this ideology should
have imposed itself is not difficult to understand. At that time, with the
nations of western Europe at least, the trappings of God-ordained
authority were rapidly falling from the shoulders of royalty 15 —the
process set in much earlier of course—and, as a matter of both ethical
and explanatory principle, the Will of the People or the Sovereign
Power of the People stood out as the substitute most acceptable to a
mentality which, while prepared to drop that particular charisma of
ultimate authority, was not prepared to do without any.

The problem being thus set, the legal mind ransacked the lumber room
of its constructs in search for tools by which to reconcile that supreme
postulate with existing political patterns. Fictitious contracts of subjection to
a prince 16 by which the sovereign people was supposed to have bargained
away its freedom or power, or no less fictitious contracts by which it
delegated that power, or some of it, to chosen representatives, were
substantially what the lumber room supplied. However well such devices
may have served certain practical purposes, they are utterly valueless for us.
They are not even defensible from a legal standpoint.
For in order to make sense at all the terms delegation and representation

<!-- 15 Sir Robert Filmer’s Patriarcha (published 1680) may be looked upon as the ast important
exposition of the doctrine of divine right in English political philosophy.
16 Those contracts were fictiones juris et de jure. But there was one realistic analogy for
them, viz., the voluntary and contractual subjection of a freeholder to a medieval lord
extensively practiced between the sixth and twelfth centuries. The freeholder accepted the
jurisdiction of the lord and certain economic obligations. He gave up his status as a fully free
man. In exchange he received the lord’s protection and other advantages. -->

must refer not to the individual citizens—that would be the doctrine of the
medieval estates—but to the people as a whole. The people as such, then,
would have to be conceived as delegating its power to, say, a parliament that
is to represent it. But only a (physical or moral) person can legally delegate
or be represented. Thus the American colonies or states that sent delegates
to the continental congresses which met from 1774 on in Philadelphia—the
so-called “revolutionary congresses”—were in fact represented by these
delegates. But the people of those colonies or states were not, since a people
as such has no legal personality: to say that it delegates powers to, or is
represented by, a parliament is to say something completely void of legal
meaning. 17 What, then, is a parliament? The answer is not far to seek: it is
an organ of the state exactly as the government or a court of justice is. If a
parliament represents the people at all, it must do so in another sense which
we have still to discover.

However, these “theories” about the sovereignty of the people and about
delegation and representation reflect something more than an ideological
postulate and a few pieces of legal technique. They complement a sociology
or social philosophy of the body politic that, partly under the influence of
the revival of Greek speculations on the subject, partly under the influence
of the events of the time, 18 took shape and reached its apogee toward the end
of the eighteenth century and actually tried to solve the problem. 

Though
such general terms are never adequate or strictly correct, I will risk
describing it—in the usual way—as fundamentally rationalist, hedonist and
individualist: the happiness, defined in hedonic terms, of individuals
endowed with a clear perception—or amenable to education that will impart
clear perception—both of this end and of the appropriate means, was
conceived as the meaning of life and the grand principle of action in the
private as well as in the political sphere. We may just as well designate this
sociology or social philosophy, the product of early capitalism, by the term
introduced by John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism. According to it, behavior
conforming to that principle was not merely the only rational and justifiable
but ipso facto also the “natural” one. This proposition is the bridge between the otherwise very different theories of Bentham and Rousseau’s contrat
social—names that may serve us for beacons in what for the rest must be
left in darkness here.

<!-- 17 Similarly, there is no legal sense in describing a public prosecution as a case of “the
People versus So-and-so.” The prosecuting legal person is the state.
18 This is particularly obvious in England and especially in the case of John Locke. As a
political philosopher he simply pleaded, in the guise of general argument, against James II and
for his Whig friends who made themselves responsible for the “glorious” revolution. This
accounts for the success of a line of reasoning that without this practical connotation would
have been beneath contempt. The end of government is the good of the people and this good
consists in the protection of private property which is why men “enter into society.” For this
purpose they meet and make an Original Contract of submission to a common authority. This
contract is broken, property and liberty endangered and resistance justified when, to put it
frankly. Whig aristocrats and London merchants think they are. -->



If such desperate brevity does not prevent readers from following my
argument, the bearing of this philosophy on the subject of democracy should
be clear. It evidently yielded, among other things, a theory of the nature of
the state and the purposes for which the state exists. Moreover, by virtue of
its emphasis on the rational and hedonistic individual and his ethical
autonomy it seemed to be in a position to teach the only right political
methods for running that state and for achieving those purposes—the greatest
happiness for the greatest number and that sort of thing. Finally, it provided
what looked like a rational foundation for belief in the Will of the People
(volonté générale) and in the advice that sums up all that democracy meant
to the group of writers who became known as Philosophical Radicals: 19
educate the people and let them vote freely.

Adverse criticism of this construction arose almost immediately as
a part of the general reaction against the rationalism of the eighteenth
century that set in after the revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
Whatever we may think about the merits or demerits of the movement
usually dubbed Romanticism, it certainly conveyed a deeper
understanding of pre-capitalist society and of historical evolution in
general and thus revealed some of the fundamental errors of
utilitarianism and of the political theory for which utilitarianism served
as base. Later historical, sociological, biological, psychological and
economic analysis proved destructive to both and today it is difficult
to find any student of social processes who has a good word for either.
But strange though it may seem, action continued to be taken on that
theory all the time it was being blown to pieces. The more untenable it
was being proved to be, the more completely it dominated official
phraseology and the rhetoric of the politician. This is why in the next
chapter we must turn to a discussion of what may be termed the
Classical Doctrine of Democracy.

But no institution or practice or belief stands or falls with the theory
that is at any time offered in its support. Democracy is no exception.
It is in fact possible to frame a theory of the democratic process that
takes account of all the realities of group-wise action and of the public
mind. This theory will be presented in Chapter XXII and then we shall
at last be able to say how democracy may be expected to fare in a
socialist order of things.
