3. In doing so he not only displayed much keener perception of the nature
of the problem involved, but he also improved the conceptual apparatus he
received. For instance, he replaced to good purpose Ricardo’s distinction between fixed and circulating capital by the distinction between constant and variable (wage) capital, and Ricardo’s rudimentary notions about duration
of the processes of production by the much more rigorous concept of
“organic structure of capital” which turns on the relation between constant
and variable capital. He also made many other contributions to the theory
of capital. 

We will however confine ourselves now to his explanation of the
net return to capital, his Theory of Exploitation.

The masses have not always felt themselves to be frustrated and exploited.
But the intellectuals that formulated their views for them have always told
them that they were, without necessarily meaning by it anything precise.
Marx could not have done without the phrase even if he had wanted to. His
merit and achievement were that he perceived the weakness of the various
arguments by which the tutors of the mass mind before him had tried to show
how exploitation came about and which even today supply the stock in trade
of the ordinary radical. None of the usual slogans about bargaining power
and cheating satisfied him. What he wanted to prove was that exploitation
did not arise from individual situations occasionally and accidentally; but that
it resulted from the very logic of the capitalist system, unavoidably and quite
independently of any individual intention.

This is how he did it. The brain, muscles and nerves of a laborer constitute, as it were, a fund or stock of potential labor (Arbeitskraft, usually
translated not very satisfactorily by labor power). This fund or stock Marx
looks upon as a sort of substance that exists in a definite quantity and in
capitalist society is a commodity like any other. We may clarify the thought
for ourselves by thinking of the case of slavery: Marx’s idea is that there is
no essential difference, though there are many secondary ones, between the
wage contract and the purchase of a slave—what the employer of “free”
labor buys is not indeed, as in the case of slavery, the laborers themselves
but a definite quota of the sum total of their potential labor.
Now since labor in that sense (not the labor service or the actual man-
hour) is a commodity the law of value must apply to it. That is to say, it must
in equilibrium and perfect competition fetch a wage proportional to the
number of labor hours that entered into its “production.” But what number
of labor hours enters into the “production” of the stock of potential labor
that is stored up within a workman’s skin? Well, the number of labor hours
it took and takes to rear, feed, clothe and house the laborer. 5 This constitutes
the value of that stock, and if he sells parts of it—expressed in days or weeks
or years—he will receive wages that correspond to the labor value of these
5 That is, barring the distinction between “labor power” and labor, the solution which
S.Bailey (A Critical Discourse on the Nature, Measure and Causes of Value, 1825) by
anticipation voted absurd, as Marx himself did not fail to notice (Das Kapital, vol. i, ch. xix).

parts, just as a slave trader selling a slave would in equilibrium receive a
price proportional to the total number of those labor hours. It should be
observed once more that Marx thus keeps carefully clear of all those popular
slogans which in one form or another hold that in the capitalist labor market
the workman is robbed or cheated or that, in his lamentable weakness, he is
simply compelled to accept any terms imposed. The thing is not as simple
as this: he gets the full value of his labor potential.
But once the “capitalists” have acquired that stock of potential services they
are in a position to make the laborer work more hours—render more actual
services—than it takes to produce that stock or potential stock. They can exact,
in this sense, more actual hours of labor than they have paid for. Since the
resulting products also sell at a price proportional to the man-hours that enter
into their production, there is a difference between the two values—arising
from nothing but the modus operandi of the Marxian law of values—which
necessarily and by virtue of the mechanism of capitalist markets goes to the
capitalist. This is the Surplus Value (Mehrwert). 6 By appropriating it the
capitalist “exploits” labor, though he pays to the laborers not less than the full
value of their labor potential and receives from consumers not more than the
full value of the products he sells. Again it should be observed that there is
no appeal to such things as unfair pricing, restriction of production or cheating
in the markets for the products. Marx did of course not mean to deny the
existence of such practices. But he saw them in their true perspective and
hence never based any fundamental conclusions upon them.
Let us admire, in passing, the pedagogics of it: however special and removed
from its ordinary sense the meaning might be which the word Exploitation now
acquires, however doubtful the support which it derives from the Natural Law
and the philosophies of the schoolmen and the writers of the Enlightenment, it
is received into the pale of scientific argument after all and thus serves the
purpose of comforting the disciple marching on to fight his battles.
As regards the merits of this scientific argument we must carefully
distinguish two aspects of it, one of which has been persistently neglected
by critics. At the ordinary level of the theory of a stationary economic
process it is easy to show that under Marx’s own assumptions the doctrine
of surplus value is untenable. The labor theory of value, even if we could
grant it to be valid for every other commodity, can never be applied to the
commodity labor, for this would imply that workmen, like machines, are
being produced according to rational cost calculations. Since they are not,
there is no warrant for assuming that the value of labor power will be
proportional to the man-hours that enter into its “production.” Logically

<!-- 6 The rate of surplus value (degree of exploitation) is defined as the ratio between surplus
value and the variable (wage) capital. -->


Marx would have improved his position had he accepted Lassalle’s Iron Law
of Wages or simply argued on Malthusian lines as Ricardo did. But since
he very wisely refused to do that, his theory of exploitation loses one of its
essential props from the start. 7
Moreover, it can be shown that perfectly competitive equilibrium
cannot exist in a situation in which all capitalist-employers make
exploitation gains. For in this case they would individually try to expand
production, and the mass effect of this would unavoidably tend to
increase wage rates and to reduce gains of that kind to zero. It would no
doubt be possible to mend the case somewhat by appealing to the theory
of imperfect competition, by introducing friction and institutional
inhibitions of the working of competition, by stressing all the possibilities
of hitches in the sphere of money and credit and so on. Only a moderate
case could be made out in this manner, however, one that Marx would
have heartily despised.

But there is another aspect of the matter. We need only look at Marx’s
analytic aim in order to realize that he need not have accepted battle on the
ground on which it is so easy to beat him. This is so easy only as long as
we see in the theory of surplus value nothing but a proposition about
stationary economic processes in perfect equilibrium. Since what he aimed
at analyzing was not a state of equilibrium which according to him capitalist
society can never attain, but on the contrary a process of incessant change
in the economic structure, criticism along the above lines is not completely
decisive. Surplus values may be impossible in perfect equilibrium but can
be ever present because that equilibrium is never allowed to establish itself.
They may always tend to vanish and yet be always there because they are
constantly recreated. This defense will not rescue the labor theory of value,
particularly as applied to the commodity labor itself, or the argument about
exploitation as it stands. But it will enable us to put a more favorable
interpretation on the result, although a satisfactory theory of those surpluses
will strip them of the specifically Marxian connotation. This aspect proves
to be of considerable importance. It throws a new light also on other parts
of Marx’s apparatus of economic analysis and goes far toward explaining
why that apparatus was not more fatally damaged by the successful criticisms
directed against its very fundaments.
