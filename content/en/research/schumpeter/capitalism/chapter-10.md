THE nature of this problem can be most tellingly displayed against the
background of contemporaneous discussion. The present generation of
economists has witnessed not only a world-wide depression of unusual
severity and duration but also a subsequent period of halting and
unsatisfactory recovery. I have already submitted my own interpretation 1 of
these phenomena and stated the reasons why I do not think that they
necessarily indicate a break in the trend of capitalist evolution. 

But it is
natural that many if not most of my fellow economists should take a different
view. As a matter of fact they feel, exactly as some of their predecessors felt
between 1873 and 1896—though then this opinion was mainly confined to
Europe—that a fundamental change is upon the capitalist process. According
to this view, we have been witnessing not merely a depression and a bad
recovery, accentuated perhaps by anti-capitalist policies, but the symptoms
of a permanent loss of vitality which must be expected to go on and to
supply the dominating theme for the remaining movements of the capitalist
symphony; hence no inference as to the future can be drawn from the
functioning of the capitalist engine and of its performance in the past.


This view is being held by many with whom the wish is not father to the
thought. But we shall understand why socialists with whom it is, should have
with particular alacrity availed themselves of the windfall—some of them to
the point of shifting the base of their anti-capitalist argument completely to
this ground. In doing so, they reaped the additional advantage of being able
to fall back once more upon Marxian tradition which, as I have pointed out
before, the trained economists among them had felt compelled to discard
more and more. For, in the sense explained in the first chapter, Marx had
predicted such a state of things: according to him capitalism, before actually
breaking down, would enter into a stage of permanent crisis, temporarily
interrupted by feeble upswings or by favorable chance occurrences. Nor is
this all. One way of putting the matter from a Marxian standpoint is to stress
the effects of capital accumulation and capital agglomeration on the rate of
profits and, through the rate of profits, on the opportunity to invest. Since the capitalist process always has been geared to a large amount of current
investment, even partial elimination of it would suffice to make plausible the
forecast that the process is going to flop. This particular line in the Marxist
argument no doubt seems to agree well not only with some outstanding facts
of the past decade—unemployment, excess reserves, gluts in money markets,
unsatisfactory margins of profits, stagnation of private investment—but also
with several non-Marxist interpretations. There is surely no such gulf
between Marx and Keynes as there was between Marx and Marshall or
Wicksell. Both the Marxist doctrine and its non-Marxist counterpart are well
expressed by the self-explanatory phrase that we shall use: the theory of
vanishing investment opportunity. 2

It should be observed that this theory really raises three distinct problems.
The first is akin to the question that heads this part. Since nothing in the social
world can ever be aere perennius and since the capitalist order is essentially the
framework of a process not only of economic but also of social change, there is
not much room for difference about the answer. The second question is whether
the forces and mechanisms offered by the theory of vanishing investment
opportunity are the ones to stress. In the following chapters I am going to submit
another theory of what will eventually kill capitalism, but a number of
parallelisms will remain. There is however a third problem. Even if the forces
and mechanisms stressed by the theory of vanishing investment opportunity were
in themselves adequate to establish the presence in the capitalist process of a
long-run tendency toward ultimate deadlock, it does not necessarily follow that
the vicissitudes of the past decade have been due to them and—which it is
important to add for our purpose—that similar vicissitudes should therefore have
to be expected to persist for the next forty years.

For the moment we are mainly concerned with the third problem. But
much of what I am going to say also bears on the second. The factors that
are held to justify a pessimistic forecast concerning the performance of
capitalism in the near future and to negative the idea that past performance
may be repeated may be divided into three groups.

1. The environmental factors. 

The capitalist process produces a distribution of political
power and a socio-psychological attitude—expressing itself in corresponding
policies—that are hostile to it and may be expected to gather force so that
they will eventually prevent the capitalist engine from functioning. This
phenomenon I will set aside for later consideration. What follows now must
be read with the appropriate proviso. But it should be noted that that attitude
and cognate factors also affect the motive power of the bourgeois profit economy itself, and that hence the proviso covers more than one might think
at first sight—more, at any rate, than mere “politics.”

Then there is the capitalist engine itself. The theory of vanishing
investment opportunity does not necessarily include, but as a matter of fact
is apt to be in alliance with, the other theory that modern largest-scale
business represents a petrified form of capitalism in which restrictive
practices, price rigidities, exclusive attention to the conservation of existing
capital values and so on are naturally inherent. This has been dealt with
already.

Finally, there is what may be described as the “material” the capitalist
engine feeds on, i.e., the opportunities open to new enterprise and
investment. The theory under discussion puts so much emphasis on this
element as to justify the label we have affixed to it. The main reasons for
holding that opportunities for private enterprise and investment are vanishing
are these: saturation, population, new lands, technological possibilities, and
the circumstance that many existing investment opportunities belong to the
sphere of public rather than of private investment.

1. For every given state of human wants and of technology (in the widest
possible sense of the term) there is of course for every rate of real wages a
definite amount of fixed and circulating capital that will spell saturation. If
wants and methods of production had been frozen for good at their state in
1800, such a point would have been reached long ago. But is it not
conceivable that wants may some day be so completely satisfied as to
become frozen forever after? Some implications of this case will presently
be developed, but so long as we deal with what may happen during the next
forty years we evidently need not trouble ourselves about this possibility.
If ever it should materialize, then the current decline in birth rate, still
more an actual fall in population, would indeed become an important factor
in reducing opportunities for investment other than replacement. For if
everyone’s wants were satisfied or nearly satisfied, increase in the number
of consumers would ex hypothesi be the only major source of additional
demand. But independently of that possibility, decrease in the rate of increase
in population does not per se endanger investment opportunity or the rate
of increase in total output per head. 3 Of this we can easily satisfy ourselves
by a brief examination of the usual argument to the contrary.

3 This also holds true for a small decline in absolute numbers of people such as may occur
in Great Britain before very long (see E.Charles, London and Cambridge Economic Service,
Memo. No. 40). A considerable absolute decline would raise additional problems. These we
shall neglect however because this cannot be expected to occur during the space: of time under
consideration. Still other problems, economic as well as political and socio-psychological, are
presented by the aging of a population. Though they are beginning to assert themselves
already—there is practically such a thing as a “lobby of the old”—we cannot enter into them

On the one hand it is being held that a declining rate of increase in
total population ipso facto spells a declining rate of increase in output
and hence of investment because it restricts the expansion of demand.
This does not follow. Want and effective demand are not the same thing.
If they were, the poorest nations would be the ones to display the most
vigorous demand. As it is, the income elements set free by the falling
birth rate may be diverted to other channels and they are particularly apt
to be so diverted in all those cases in which the desire to expand
alternative demands is the very motive of childlessness. A modest
argument can indeed be made out by stressing the fact that the lines of
demand characteristic of an increasing population are particularly
calculable and thus afford particularly reliable investment opportunities.
But the desires that provide alternative opportunities are, in the given
state of satisfaction of wants, not much less so. Of course the prognosis
for certain individual branches of production, especially for agriculture,
is in fact not a bright one. But this must not be confused with the
prognosis for total output. 4

On the other hand, we might argue that the declining rate of increase in
population will tend to restrict output from the supply side. Rapid increase
was in the past frequently one of the conditions of the observed development
of output, and we might conclude a contrario that increasing scarcity of the
labor factor might be expected to be a limiting factor. However, we do not
hear much of this argument and for very good reasons. The observation that
at the beginning of 1940 output of manufacturing industry in the United
States was about 120 per cent of the average for 1923–1925 whereas factory
employment was at about 100 per cent supplies an answer that is adequate
for the calculable future. The extent of current unemployment; the fact that
with a falling birth rate women are increasingly set free for productive work
and that the falling death rate means prolongation of the useful period of life;
the unexhausted stream of labor-saving devices; the possibility, increasing
relatively to what it would be in the case of rapid increase of population, of
avoiding complementary factors of production of inferior quality (warding
off in part the operation of the law of diminishing returns)—all this gives
either. But it should be observed that, as long as retiring ages remain the same, the percentage
share of those who have to be provided for without contributing need not be affected by a
decreasing percentage of persons under 15.

4 There seems to be an impression, prevalent with many economists, to the effect that an
increase in population per se provides another source of demand for investment. Why—must
not all these new workmen be equipped with tools and their complement of raw material? This
however is by no means obvious. Unless the increase is allowed to depress wages, the
implication as to investment opportunity lacks motivation, and even in that case reduction of
investment per head employed would have to be expected.

ample support to Mr. Colin Clark’s expectation that product per man-hour
is going to rise during the next generation. 5

Of course, the labor factor may be made artificially scarce through high-
wage and short-hour policies and through political interference with the
discipline of the labor force. Comparison of the economic performance in
the United States and France from 1933 to 1940 with the economic
performance of Japan and Germany during the same years suggests in fact
that something of this kind has already occurred. But this belongs to the
group of environmental factors.

As my argument will abundantly show before long, I am very far indeed
from making light of the phenomenon under discussion. The falling birth rate
seems to me to be one of the most significant features of our time. We shall
see that even from a purely economic standpoint it is of cardinal importance,
both as a symptom and as a cause of changing motivation. This however is
a more complicated matter. Here we are concerned only with the mechanical
effects of a decreasing rate of increase in population and these certainly do
not support any pessimistic forecast as to the development of output per head
during the next forty years. As far as that goes, those economists who predict
a “flop” on this ground simply do what unfortunately economists have
always been prone to do: as once they worried the public, on quite
inadequate grounds, with the economic dangers of excessive numbers of
mouths to feed, 6 so they worry it now, on no better grounds, with the
economic dangers of deficiencies.

2. Next as to the opening up of new lands—that unique opportunity for
investment which cannot ever recur. Even if, for the sake of argument, we
grant that humanity’s geographical frontier is closed for good—which is not
in itself very obvious in view of the fact that at present there are deserts
where once there were fields and populous cities—and even if we further
grant that nothing will ever contribute to human welfare as much as did the
foodstuffs and raw materials from those new lands—which is more
plausible—it does not follow that total output per head must therefore
decline, or increase at a smaller rate, during the next half-century. This would
indeed have to be expected if the lands that in the nineteenth century entered

<!-- 6 Forecasts of future populations, from those of the seventeenth century on, were
practically always wrong. For this, however, there is some excuse. There may be even for
Malthus’s doctrine. But I cannot see any excuse for its survival. In the second half of the
nineteenth century it should have been clear to anyone that the only valuable things about
Malthus’s law of population are its qualifications. The first decade of this century definitely
showed that it was a bogey. But no less an authority than Mr. Keynes attempted to revitalise
it in the post-war period! And as late as 1925, Mr. H.Wright in his book on Population
spoke of “wasting the gains of civilization on a mere increase in numbers.” Will economics
never come of age? -->

the capitalist sphere had been exploited in the sense that diminishing returns
would now be due to assert themselves. This however is not the case and,
as was just pointed out, the decreasing rate of increase in population removes
from the range of practical considerations the idea that nature’s response to
human effort either already is or must soon become less generous than it has
been. Technological progress effectively turned the tables on any such
tendency, and it is one of the safest predictions that in the calculable future
we shall live in an embarras de richesse of both foodstuffs and raw materials,
giving all the rein to expansion of total output that we shall know what to
do with. This applies to mineral resources as well.

There remains another possibility. Though the current output per head
of foodstuffs and raw materials need not suffer and may even increase, the
vast opportunities for enterprise and hence for investment that were
afforded by the task of developing the new countries seem to have vanished
with its completion and all sorts of difficulties are being predicted from
the resulting reduction of outlets for savings. We will assume again for the
sake of argument that those countries actually are developed for good and
that savings, failing to adapt themselves to a reduction of outlets, might
cause troubles and wastes unless other outlets open up instead. Both
assumptions are indeed most unrealistic. But there is no necessity for us
to question them because the conclusion as to the future development of
output is contingent upon a third one that is completely gratuitous, viz.,
the absence of other outlets.

This third assumption is simply due to lack of imagination and
exemplifies a mistake that very frequently distorts historical interpretation.
The particular features of a historic process that impress the analyst tend in
his mind to slip into the position of fundamental causes whether they have
a claim to that role or not. For instance, what is usually referred to as the
Rise of Capitalism roughly coincides with the influx of silver from the Potosi
mines and with a political situation in which the expenditure of princes
habitually outran their revenue so that they had to borrow incessantly. Both
facts are obviously relevant in a variety of ways to the economic
developments of those times—even peasants’ revolts and religious upheavals
may without absurdity be linked up with them. The analyst thereupon is apt
to jump to the conclusion that the rise of-the capitalist order of things is
causally connected with them in the sense that without them (and a few other
factors of the same type) the feudal world would have failed to transform
itself into the capitalist one. But this is really another proposition and one
for which there is, on the face of it, no warrant whatsoever. All that can be
averred is that this was the road by which events traveled. It does not follow
that there was no other. In this case, by the way, it cannot even be held that those factors favored capitalist development for though they certainly did do
so in some respects they obviously retarded it in others.

Similarly, as we have seen in the preceding chapter, the opportunities for
enterprise afforded by the new areas to be exploited were certainly unique,
but only in the sense in which all opportunities are. It is gratuitous to assume
not only that the “closing of the frontier” will cause a vacuum but also that
“whatever steps into the vacant place must necessarily be less important in
any of the senses we may choose to give to that word. The conquest of the
air may well be more important than the conquest of India was—we must
not confuse geographical frontiers with economic ones.

The relative positions of countries or regions may
significantly change as one type of investment opportunity is replaced by
another. The smaller a country or region is and the more closely its fortunes
are wedded to one particular element in the productive process, the less
confidence we shall feel as to the future in store for it when that element is
played out. Thus agricultural countries or regions may lose permanently by
the competitive synthetic products (rayon, dyes, synthetic rubber for
instance), and it may be no comfort to them that, if the process be taken as
a whole, there may be net gain in total output. It is also true that the possible
consequences of this may be much intensified by the division of the
economic world into hostile national spheres. And it is finally true that all
we can assert is that the vanishing of the investment opportunities incident
to the development of new countries—if they are already vanishing—need
not cause a void that would necessarily affect the rate of increase in total
output. We cannot assert that they actually will be replaced by at least
equivalent ones. We may point to the fact that from that development further
developments naturally arise in those same countries or in others; we may
put some trust in the ability of the capitalist engine to find or create ever
new opportunities since it is geared to this very purpose; but such
considerations do not carry us beyond our negative result. And recalling our
reasons for embarking upon the subject, this is quite enough.

3. An analogous argument applies to the widely accepted view that the
great stride in technological advance has been made and that but minor
achievements remain. So far as this view does not merely render the
impressions conceived from the state of things during and after the world
crisis—when an apparent absence of novel propositions of the first
magnitude was part of the familiar pattern of any great depression—it
exemplifies still better than did the “closing of humanity’s frontier” that error
in interpretation economists are so prone to commit. We are just now in the
downgrade of a wave of enterprise that created the electrical power plant,
the electrical industry, the electrified farm and home and the motorcar. We find all that very marvelous, and we cannot for our lives see where
opportunities of comparable importance are to come from. As a matter of
fact however, the promise held out by the chemical industry alone is much
greater than what it was possible to anticipate in, say, 1880, not to mention
the fact that the mere utilization of the achievement of the age of electricity
and the production of modern homes for the masses would suffice to provide
investment opportunities for quite a time to come.

Technological possibilities are an uncharted sea. We may survey a
geographical region and appraise, though only with reference to a given
technique of agricultural production, the relative fertility of individual plots.
Given that technique and disregarding its possible future developments, we
may then imagine (though this would be wrong historically) that the best
plots are first taken into cultivation, after them the next best ones and so on.
At any given time during this process it is only relatively inferior plots that
remain to be exploited in the future. But we cannot reason in this fashion
about the future possibilities of technological advance. From the fact that
some of them have been exploited before others, it cannot be inferred that
the former were more productive than the latter. And those that are still in
the lap of the gods may be more or less productive than any that have thus
far come within our range of observation. Again this yields only a negative
result which even the fact that technological “progress” tends, through
systemization and rationalization of research and of management, to become
more effective and sure-footed, is powerless to turn into a positive one. But
for us the negative result suffices: there is no reason to expect slackening of
the rate of output through exhaustion of technological possibilities.
4. Two variants of this branch of the theory of vanishing investment
opportunity remain to be noticed. Some economists have held that the labor force
of every country had to be fitted out at some time or other with the necessary
equipment. This, so they argue, has been accomplished roughly in the course
of the nineteenth century. While it was being accomplished, it incessantly created
new demand for capital goods, whereas, barring additions, only replacement
demand remains forever after. The period of capitalist armament thus would turn
out to be a unique intermezzo after all, characterized by the capitalist economy’s
straining every nerve in order to create for itself the necessary complement of
tools and machines, and thus becoming equipped for the purpose of producing
for further production at a rate which it is now impossible to keep up. This is a
truly astounding picture of the economic process. Was there no equipment in
the eighteenth century or, in fact, at the time our ancestors dwelled in caves?
And if there was, why should the additions that occurred in the nineteenth
century have been more saturating than any that went before? Moreover,
additions to the armor of capitalism are as a rule competitive with the preexisting pieces of it. They destroy the economic usefulness of the latter. Hence the task
of providing equipment can never be solved once for all. The cases in which
replacement reserves are adequate to solve it—as they normally would be in the
absence of technological change—are exceptions. This is particularly clear where
the new methods of production are embodied in new industries; obviously the
automobile plants were not financed from the depreciation accounts of railroads.
The reader will no doubt observe that even if we were able to accept the
premises of this argument, no pessimistic forecast about the rate of expansion
of total output would necessarily follow. On the contrary he might draw the
opposite inference, viz., that the possession of an extensive stock of capital
goods that acquires economic immortality through continuous renewal should
if anything facilitate further increase in total output. 

If so, he is quite right.
The argument rests entirely on the disturbance to be expected if an economy
geared to capital production faces a reduced rate of increase in the
corresponding demand. But this disturbance which is not of sudden occurrence
can easily be exaggerated. The steel industry for instance has not experienced
great difficulties in transforming itself from an industry that produced capital
goods almost exclusively into one that produces primarily durable consumers’
goods or semi-finished products for the production of durable consumers’
goods. And though compensation may not be possible within each existing
capital goods industry, the principle involved is the same in all cases.
The other variant is this. The great bursts of economic activity that used
to spread the symptoms of prosperity all over the economic organism have
of course always been associated with expansions of producers’ expenditure
that were in turn associated with the construction of additional plant and
equipment. Now some economists have discovered, or think they have
discovered, that at the present time new technological processes tend to
require less fixed capital in this sense than they used to in the past,
particularly in the epoch of railroad building. The inference is that spending
for capital construction will henceforth decrease in relative importance. Since
this will adversely affect those intermittent bursts of economic activity that
evidently have much to do with the observed rate of increase in total output,
it further follows that this rate is bound to decline, especially if saving goes
on at the old rate.

This tendency of new technological methods to become increasingly
capital-saving has not so far been adequately established. Statistical evidence
up to 1929—later data do not qualify for the purpose—point the other way.
All that the sponsors of the theory in question have offered is a number of
isolated instances to which it is possible to oppose others. But let us grant
that such a tendency exists. We have then the same formal problem before
us which exercised so many economists of the past in the case of labor-saving devices. These may affect the interests of labor favorably or adversely,
but nobody doubts that on the whole they are favorable to an expansion of
output. And this is—barring possible disturbances in the saving-investment
process which it is the fashion to exaggerate—no different in the case of
devices that economize outlay on capital goods per unit of the final product.
In fact, it is not far from the truth to say that almost any new process that is
economically workable economizes both labor and capital. Railroads were
presumably capital-saving as compared with the outlay that transportation,
by mailcoach or cart, of the same numbers of passengers and of the same
quantities of goods that actually are being transported by railroads now
would have involved. Similarly silk production by mulberry trees and
silkworms may be more capital-consuming—I don’t know—than the
production of an equivalent amount of rayon fabric would be. That may be
very sad for the owners of capital already sunk in the former. But it need
not even mean decrease of investment opportunity. It certainly does not
necessarily mean decrease in the expansion of output. Those who hope to
see capitalism break down solely by virtue of the fact that the unit of capital
goes further in productive effect than it used to, may have to wait long
indeed.

5. Finally, since the subject is usually dealt with by economists who aim
at impressing upon the public the necessity of governmental deficit spending,
another point never fails to turn up, viz., that such opportunities for
investment as remain are more suited for public than they are for private
enterprise. This is true to some extent. First, with increasing wealth certain
lines of expenditure are likely to gain ground which do not naturally enter
into any cost-profit calculation, such as expenditure on the beautification of
cities, on public health and so on. Second, an ever-widening sector of
industrial activity tends to enter the sphere of public management, such as
means of communication, docks, power production, insurance and so on,
simply because these industries become increasingly amenable to the
methods of public administration. National and municipal investment could
thus be expected to expand, absolutely and relatively, even in a thoroughly
capitalist society, just as other forms of public planning would.

But that is all. In order to recognize it we need not make any hypothesis
about the course of things in the private sector of industrial activity.
Moreover, for the purpose in hand it is immaterial whether in the future
investment and the incident expansion of output will to a greater or a lesser
extent be financed and managed by public rather than by private agencies
unless it be held in addition that public financing will impose itself because
private business would not be able to face the deficits to be expected in the
future from any investment. This however has been dealt with before.
