<!-- THE nature of this problem can be most tellingly displayed against the
background of contemporaneous discussion. The present generation of
economists has witnessed not only a world-wide depression of unusual
severity and duration but also a subsequent period of halting and
unsatisfactory recovery. I have already submitted my own interpretation 1 of
these phenomena and stated the reasons why I do not think that they
necessarily indicate a break in the trend of capitalist evolution.  -->

<!-- But it is
natural that many if not most of my fellow economists should take a different
view. As a matter of fact they feel, exactly as some of their predecessors felt
between 1873 and 1896—though then this opinion was mainly confined to
Europe—that  -->

A fundamental change is upon the capitalist process. 

We have been witnessing:
- a depression
- a bad recovery, accentuated by anti-capitalist policies
- a permanent loss of vitality
  - This is expected to go on

Hence, no inference as to the future can be drawn from the functioning of the capitalist engine and of its performance in the past.*

<!-- This view is being held by many with whom the wish is not father to the thought.  -->

But we shall understand why socialists with whom it is, should have
with particular alacrity availed themselves of the windfall—some of them to
the point of shifting the base of their anti-capitalist argument completely to
this ground. In doing so, they reaped the additional advantage of being able
to fall back once more upon Marxian tradition which, as I have pointed out
before, the trained economists among them had felt compelled to discard
more and more. For, in the sense explained in the first chapter, Marx had
predicted such a state of things: according to him capitalism, before actually
breaking down, would enter into a stage of permanent crisis, temporarily
interrupted by feeble upswings or by favorable chance occurrences. 

Nor is
this all. One way of putting the matter from a Marxian standpoint is to stress
the effects of capital accumulation and capital agglomeration on the rate of
profits and, through the rate of profits, on the opportunity to invest. Since the capitalist process always has been geared to a large amount of current
investment, even partial elimination of it would suffice to make plausible the
forecast that the process is going to flop. This particular line in the Marxist
argument no doubt seems to agree well not only with some outstanding facts
of the past decade—unemployment, excess reserves, gluts in money markets,
unsatisfactory margins of profits, stagnation of private investment—but also
with several non-Marxist interpretations. There is surely no such gulf
between Marx and Keynes as there was between Marx and Marshall or
Wicksell. 

Both the Marxist doctrine and its non-Marxist counterpart are well
expressed by the self-explanatory phrase that we shall use: the theory of
vanishing investment opportunity. 2

It should be observed that this theory really raises three distinct problems.
The first is akin to the question that heads this part. Since nothing in the social
world can ever be aere perennius and since the capitalist order is essentially the
framework of a process not only of economic but also of social change, there is
not much room for difference about the answer. The second question is whether
the forces and mechanisms offered by the theory of vanishing investment
opportunity are the ones to stress. In the following chapters I am going to submit
another theory of what will eventually kill capitalism, but a number of
parallelisms will remain. There is however a third problem. Even if the forces
and mechanisms stressed by the theory of vanishing investment opportunity were
in themselves adequate to establish the presence in the capitalist process of a
long-run tendency toward ultimate deadlock, it does not necessarily follow that
the vicissitudes of the past decade have been due to them and—which it is
important to add for our purpose—that similar vicissitudes should therefore have
to be expected to persist for the next forty years.

For the moment we are mainly concerned with the third problem. But
much of what I am going to say also bears on the second. The factors that
are held to justify a pessimistic forecast concerning the performance of
capitalism in the near future and to negative the idea that past performance
may be repeated may be divided into three groups.

1. The environmental factors. 

The capitalist process produces a distribution of political
power and a socio-psychological attitude—expressing itself in corresponding
policies—that are hostile to it and may be expected to gather force so that
they will eventually prevent the capitalist engine from functioning. This
phenomenon I will set aside for later consideration. What follows now must
be read with the appropriate proviso. But it should be noted that that attitude
and cognate factors also affect the motive power of the bourgeois profit economy itself, and that hence the proviso covers more than one might think
at first sight—more, at any rate, than mere “politics.”

Then there is the capitalist engine itself. The theory of vanishing
investment opportunity does not necessarily include, but as a matter of fact
is apt to be in alliance with, the other theory that modern largest-scale
business represents a petrified form of capitalism in which restrictive
practices, price rigidities, exclusive attention to the conservation of existing
capital values and so on are naturally inherent. This has been dealt with
already.

Finally, there is what may be described as the “material” the capitalist
engine feeds on, i.e., the opportunities open to new enterprise and
investment. The theory under discussion puts so much emphasis on this
element as to justify the label we have affixed to it. The main reasons for
holding that opportunities for private enterprise and investment are vanishing
are these: saturation, population, new lands, technological possibilities, and
the circumstance that many existing investment opportunities belong to the
sphere of public rather than of private investment.
