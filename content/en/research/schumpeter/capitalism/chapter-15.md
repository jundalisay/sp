<!-- PART III Can Socialism Work? -->

CAN socialism work? 

Of course it can. No doubt is possible about that
once we assume, first, that the requisite stage of industrial development
has been reached and, second, that transitional problems can be successfully
resolved. One may, of course, feel very uneasy about these assumptions
themselves or about the questions whether the socialist form of society can
be expected to be democratic and, democratic or not, how well it is likely
to function. All that will be discussed later on. But if we accept these
assumptions and discard these doubts the answer to the remaining question
is clearly Yes.

Before I attempt to prove it, I should like to clear some obstacles from our
way. We have so far been rather careless about certain definitions and we must
make up for it now. We shall simply envisage two types of society and mention
others only incidentally. These types we will call Commercial and Socialist.
Commercial society is defined by an institutional pattern of which we
need only mention two elements: private property in means of production
and regulation of the productive process by private contract (or management
or initiative). Such a type of society is not as a rule purely bourgeois,
however. For as we have seen in Part II an industrial and commercial
bourgeoisie will in general not be able to exist except in symbiosis with a
non-bourgeois stratum. Nor is commercial society identical with capitalist
society. The latter, a special case of the former, is defined by the additional
phenomenon of credit creation—by the practice, responsible for so many
outstanding features of modern economic life, of financing enterprise by
bank credit, i.e., by money (notes or deposits) manufactured for that purpose.
But since commercial society, as an alternative to socialism, in practice
always appears in the particular form of capitalism, it will make no great
difference if the reader prefers to keep to the traditional contrast between
capitalism and socialism.

By socialist society we shall designate an institutional pattern in which
the control over means of production and over production itself is vested
with a central authority—or, as we may say, in which, as a matter of
principle, the economic affairs of society belong to the public and not to the
private sphere. Socialism has been called an intellectual Proteus. 

There are
many ways of defining it—many acceptable ways, that is, besides the silly ones such as that socialism means bread for all—and ours is not necessarily
the best. But there are some points about it which it may be well for us to
notice, braving the danger of an indictment on the score of pedantry.

Our definition excludes guild socialism, syndicalism and other types. This
is because what may be termed Centralist Socialism seems to me to hold the
field so clearly that it would be waste of space to consider other forms. But
if we adopt this term in order to indicate the only kind of socialism we shall
consider, we must be careful to avoid a misunderstanding. The term centralist
socialism is only intended to exclude the existence of a plurality of units of
control such that each of them would on principle stand for a distinct interest
of its own, in particular the existence of a plurality of autonomous territorial
sectors that would go far toward reproducing the antagonisms of capitalist
society. This exclusion of sectional interests may well be thought unrealistic.
Nonetheless it is essential.

But our term is not intended to suggest centralism either in the sense that
the central authority, which we shall alternatively call Central Board or
Ministry of Production, is necessarily absolute or in the sense that all the
initiative that pertains to the executive proceeds from it alone. As regards the
first point, the board or ministry may have to submit its plan to a congress or
parliament. There may also be a supervising and checking authority—a kind
of cour des comptes that could conceivably even have the right to veto
particular decisions. As regards the second point, some freedom of action must
be left, and almost any amount of freedom might be left, to the “men on the
spot,” say, the managers of the individual industries or plants. For the moment,
I will make the bold assumption that the rational amount of freedom is
experimentally found and actually granted so that efficiency suffers neither
from the unbridled ambitions of subordinates nor from the piling up on the
desk of the minister of reports and unanswered questions—nor from orders
of the latter suggestive of Mark Twain’s rules about the harvesting of potatoes.
I have not separately defined collectivism or communism. The former
term I shall not use at all and the latter only incidentally with reference to
groups that call themselves so. But if I had to use them I should make them
synonymous with socialism. Analyzing historical usage, most writers have
tried to give them distinct meanings. It is true that the term communist has
fairly consistently been chosen to denote ideas more thoroughgoing or
radical than others. But then, one of the classic documents of socialism is
entitled the “Communist” Manifesto. And the difference of principle has
never been fundamental—what there is of it is no less pronounced within
the socialist camp than it is as between it and the communist one. Bolsheviks
call themselves communists and at the same time the true and only socialist.’
Whether or not the true and only ones, they are certainly socialists


I have avoided the terms state ownership of, or property in, natural
resources, plant and equipment. This point is of some importance in the
methodology of the social sciences. There are no doubt concepts that bear no
relation to any particular epoch or social world, such as want or choice or
economic good. There are others which, while in their everyday meaning they
do bear such a relation, have been refined by the analyst to the point of losing
it. Price or cost may serve as examples.1 But there are still others which by
virtue of their nature cannot stand transplantation and always carry the flavor
of a particular institutional framework. It is extremely dangerous, in fact it
amounts to a distortion of historical description, to use them beyond the social
world or culture whose denizens they are. Now ownership or property—also,
so I believe, taxation—are such denizens of the world of commercial society,
exactly as knights and fiefs are denizens of the feudal world.

But so is the state. We might of course define it by the criterion of
sovereignty and then speak of a socialist state. But if there is to be meat in
the concept and not merely legal or philosophic gas, the state should not be
allowed to intrude into discussions of either feudal or socialist society, neither
of which did or would display that dividing line between the private and the
public sphere from which the better part of its meaning flows. To conserve that
meaning with all its wealth of functions, methods and attitudes, it seems best
to say that the state, the product of the clashes and compromises between
feudal lords and bourgeoisie, will form part of the ashes from which the
socialist phoenix is to rise. Therefore, I did not use it in my definition of
socialism. Of course socialism may come about by an act of the state. But there
is no inconvenience that I can see in saying that the state dies in this act—as
has been pointed out by Marx and repeated by Lenin.
