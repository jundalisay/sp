IT WAS not by a slip that an analogy from the world of religion was
permitted to intrude into the title of this chapter. There is more than analogy.
In one important sense, Marxism is a religion. To the believer it presents, first,
a system of ultimate ends that embody the meaning of life and are absolute
standards by which to judge events and actions; and, secondly, a guide to those
ends which implies a plan of salvation and the indication of the evil from
which mankind, or a chosen section of mankind, is to be saved. We may
specify still further: Marxist socialism also belongs to that subgroup which
promises paradise on this side of the grave. I believe that a formulation of these
characteristics by an hierologist would give opportunities for classification and
comment which might possibly lead much deeper into the sociological essence
of Marxism than anything a mere economist can say.

The least important point about this is that it explains the success of
Marxism. 1 Purely scientific achievement, had it even been much more perfect
than it was in the case of Marx, would never have won the immortality in the
historical sense which is his. Nor would his arsenal of party slogans have done
it. Part of his success, although a very minor part, is indeed attributable to the
barrelful of white-hot phrases, of impassioned accusations and wrathful
gesticulations, ready for use on any platform, that he put at the disposal of his
flock. All that needs to be said about this aspect of the matter is that this
ammunition has served and is serving its purpose very well, but that the
production of it carried a disadvantage: in order to forge such weapons for the
arena of social strife Marx had occasionally to bend, or to deviate from, the
opinions that would logically follow from his system. However, if Marx had
not been more than a purveyor of phraseology, he would be dead by now.
Mankind is not grateful for that sort of service and forgets quickly the names
of the people who write the librettos for its political operas.

<!-- 1 The religious quality of Marxism also explains a characteristic attitude of the orthodox
Marxist toward opponents. To him, as to any believer in a Faith, the opponent is not merely in
error but in sin. Dissent is disapproved of not only intellectually but also morally. There cannot
be any excuse for it once the Message has been revealed. -->

But he was a prophet, and in order to understand the nature of this
achievement we must visualize it in the setting of his own time. It was the
zenith of bourgeois realization and the nadir of bourgeois civilization, the
time of mechanistic materialism, of a cultural milieu which had as yet betrayed no sign that a new art and a new mode of life were in its womb,
and which rioted in most repulsive banality. Faith in any real sense was
rapidly falling away from all classes of society, and with it the only ray of
light (apart from what may have been derived from Rochdale attitudes and
saving banks) died from the workman’s world, while intellectuals professed
themselves highly satisfied with Mill’s Logic and the Poor Law.
Now, to millions of human hearts the Marxian message of the terrestrial
paradise of socialism meant a new ray of light and a new meaning of life.
Call Marxist religion a counterfeit if you like, or a caricature of faith—there
is plenty to be said for this view—but do not overlook or fail to admire the
greatness of the achievement. Never mind that nearly all of those millions
were unable to understand and appreciate the message in its true significance.
That is the fate of all messages. The important thing is that the message was
framed and conveyed in such a way as to be acceptable to the positivistic
mind of its time—which was essentially bourgeois no doubt, but there is no
paradox in saying that Marxism is essentially a product of the bourgeois
mind. This was done, on the one hand, by formulating with unsurpassed
force that feeling of being thwarted and ill treated which is the auto-
therapeutic attitude of the unsuccessful many, and, on the other hand, by
proclaiming that socialistic deliverance from those ills was a certainty
amenable to rational proof.
Observe how supreme art here succeeds in weaving together those extra-
rational cravings which receding religion had left running about like
masterless dogs, and the rationalistic and materialistic tendencies of the time,
ineluctable for the moment, which would not tolerate any creed that had no
scientific or pseudo-scientific connotation. Preaching the goal would have
been ineffectual; analyzing a social process would have interested only a few
hundred specialists. But preaching in the garb of analysis and analyzing with
a view to heartfelt needs, this is what conquered passionate allegiance and
gave to the Marxist that supreme boon which consists in the conviction that
what one is and stands for can never be defeated but must conquer
victoriously in the end. This, of course, does not exhaust the achievement.
Personal force and the flash of prophecy work independently of the contents
of the creed. No new life and no new meaning of life can be effectively
revealed without. But this does not concern us here.
Something will have to be said about the cogency and correctness of
Marx’s attempt to prove the inevitability of the socialist goal. One remark,
however, suffices as to what has been called above his formulation of the
feelings of the unsuccessful many. It was, of course, not a true formulation
of actual feelings, conscious or subconscious. Rather we could call it an
attempt at replacing actual feelings by a true or false revelation of the logic
Marx the Prophet 7
of social evolution. By doing this and by at tributing—quite unrealistically—
to the masses his own shibboleth of “class consciousness,” he undoubtedly
falsified the true psychology of the workman (which centers in the wish to
become a small bourgeois and to be helped to that status by political force),
but in so far as his teaching took effect he also expanded and ennobled it.
He did not weep any sentimental tears about the beauty of the socialist idea.
This is one of his claims to superiority over what he called the Utopian
Socialists. Nor did he glorify the workmen into heroes of daily toil as
bourgeois love to do when trembling for their dividends. He was perfectly
free from any tendency, so conspicuous in some of his weaker followers,
toward licking the workman’s boots. He had probably a clear perception of
what the masses are and he looked far above their heads toward social goals
altogether beyond what they thought or wanted. Also, he never taught any
ideals as set by himself. Such vanity was quite foreign to him. As every true
prophet styles himself the humble mouthpiece of his deity, so Marx
pretended no more than to speak the logic of the dialectic process of history.
There is dignity in all this which compensates for many pettinesses and
vulgarities with which, in his work and in his life, this dignity formed so
strange an alliance.
Another point, finally, should not go unmentioned. Marx was personally
much too civilized to fall in with those vulgar professors of socialism who do
not recognize a temple when they see it. He was perfectly able to understand
a civilization and the “relatively absolute” value of its values, however far
removed from it he may have felt himself to be. In this respect no better
testimony to his broad-mindedness can be offered than the Communist
Manifesto which is an account nothing short of glowing 2 of the achievements
of capitalism; and even in pronouncing pro futuro death sentence on it, he
never failed to recognize its historical necessity. This attitude, of course,
implies quite a lot of things Marx himself would have been unwilling to accept.
But he was undoubtedly strengthened in it, and it was made more easy for him
to take, because of that perception of the organic logic of things to which his
2 This may seem to be an exaggeration. But let us quote from the authorized English
translation: “The bourgeoisie…has been the first to show what man’s activity can bring about.
It has accomplished wonders far surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts and Gothic
cathedrals…. The bourgeoisie… draws all nations…into civilization…. It has created enormous
cities… and thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy [sic!] of rural
life…. The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created more massive
and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together.” Observe that
all the achievements referred to are attributed to the bourgeoisie alone which is more than many
thoroughly bourgeois economists would claim. This is all I meant by the above passage—and
strikingly different from the views of the vulgarized Marxism of today or from the Veblenite
stuff of the modern non-Marxist radical. Let me say at once: not more than that is implied in
anything I shall say in the second part about the performance of capitalism.
The Marxian Doctrine8
theory of history gives one particular expression. Things social fell into order
for him, and however much of a coffeehouse conspirator he may have been
at some junctures of his life, his true self despised that sort of thing. Socialism
for him was no obsession which blots out all other colors of life and creates
an unhealthy and stupid hatred or contempt for other civilizations. And there
is, in more senses than one, justification for the title claimed for his type of
socialist thought and of socialist volition which are welded together by virtue
of his fundamental position: Scientific Socialism.
